hadria said that be question must not fail to be of peculiar interest to who have life before to make mar be extremely difficult question for admitted of experiment one must never go back in life try plan one must never make sure by such test how much circumstance how much innate idea have to do with one disposition emerson insisted that man make circumstance history seemed to support theory how untoward have be in appearance surroundings of who have made great movement done great deed of world let one consider poverty persecution incessant discouragement often tragic end of greatest

who be strong must carry with a perpetual burden mass of such pensioner who be scared shocked at rude individuality if must trip stumble if must lose way in untrodden path in seeking new truth broader foundation for life of men then chorus of censure go up from million of little throat hear hear cried algitha fred table rocked enthusiastically when good thing be gained for upholder have striven perhaps given life then there be more greedy absorber of bounty than same innumerable little throat table led chorus of assent now said lecturer slowly consider in relation to point at issue emerson asserts that circumstance can always be conquered be not circumstance to large extent created by destroyer a have called have not strongest soul to count with who weave web of adverse condition whose dead weight have to be carried whose work of destruction have to be incessantly repaired who can dare to say ' be master of fate ' when doe not know how large may be share of general burden will fall to to drag through life how great may be number of parasite who be living on moral capital of generation surely circumstance consists largely in inertia impenetrability of destroyer ernest shewed sign

of chief charm of institution in eye of member of society be secrecy family though united by tie of warm affection to parent did not look for encouragement from in direction mr fullerton be too exclusively scientific in bent of thought to sympathize with kind of speculation in child delighted while mother looked with mingled pride alarm at outbreak of individuality on part of daughter for

existence than in other material condition being equal do mean that girl must have more difficulty in bringing power to maturity getting recognized than man must have asked fred yes odds be too heavy second rate talent perhaps ernest admitted not really big one must exactly reverse statement said greater power finer quality greater inharmony between nature condition therefore more powerful leverage against small comfortable talent might hold own where larger one must succumb be where think make big mistake in forgetting that greatness of power may serve to make greatness of obstacle so much better for then said algitha with touch of satire for have idea of being beaten folded arm in serene attitude of determination surely only want little force of will to enable to occupy life in manner think best said ernest be often impossible for girl because prejudice custom be against ought to despise prejudice custom cried brother nobly so often must then have to tear through so many living tie restrain freedom algitha drew up if one be unjustly restrained said be perfectly right to brave infliction of sort of pain that people feel only because unfairly object to one liberty of action what frightful piece of circumstance be to encounter cried hadria to have to buy mere right to one liberty by cutting through prejudice be twined in with very heart string of one love ah that

hadria cast about in mind for method of utilizing to best advantage possible mean at disposal to force circumstance to yield harvest to will to be family consolation meant light task for mr fullerton be exacting by nature have given much expected much in return logic be somewhat faulty must not be gracefully pointed out to by daughter having allowed own ability to decay mr fullerton have developed extraordinary power of interfering with employment of ability of others hadria have rather underrated than exaggerated difficulty mother must keep for hour discussing trivial point of domestic business giving elaborate direction about only to do in end spent whole life in trifle of kind over social matter everything be done cumbrously with incredible amount of toil consideration without noticeable result hadria fighting against multitude of harassing little difficulty struggled to turn long winter month to use mr fullerton broke good serviceable time into jagged fragment really ca see said mother when daughter proposed to set apart certain hour for household duty to have other portion of day to herself really ca see why girl little occupation must be treated with so much consideration however have wish for grudging assistance hadria temper be far indeed from perfect painful scene often occurred a rule must afterwards be seized with fit of remorse knowing that mother be suffering bitterly from keen disappointment about failure of life long hope must try endurance of bravest mr fullerton seeing that hadria be more patient quickly took advantage of favourable moment with rapid instinct have often done good service in management of niggard destiny valuable mood must not be allowed to die fruitless elder girl defection thus became to mother sort of investment

disappointed to find that author of parthenia wore ordinary human serge cape cut after fashion of other person cape still have idea what supersensuous material must reasonably have demanded of heroine unless be mythic bombazine that ernest used to talk about in ignorant effort to describe female apparel what transcendental form of cape must have satisfied imagination have lovely home said valeria

strange retrospective sense of solitude feeling new pity for eager little child of year ago who have wandered up to garret late at night to watch moonlight spread white shroud over hill with moment spent in society of valeria du prel new clearer light seemed to hadria to be thrown upon problem of existence not by mean only through what miss du prel directly said by what implied by what took for

woman must lead if be actually reduced for interest amusement to utterance of mr wilkins must have pull of one though if utterance of mr wilkins be only utterance to be heard perish thought of such beggary talk with valeria du prel grew more intimate more deeply interesting to hadria day miss du prel used often to look at companion in amazement where did come from exclaimed on one occasion one must suppose have lived several life seem to know thing in such subtle intimate fashion used to ponder over problem wondering what professor fortescue must say to there appeared to be more here than mere heredity must account for science have never solved problem originality seemed always to enter upon career uncaused unaccountable be ever miraculous phenomenon professor have always said so still heritage be rich enough in case heredity might have discoverable part in apparent marvel member of fullerton family have unusual ability of kind knowledge of science familiarity with problem of philosophy have often astonished miss du prel hadria account of preposterous society made laugh exclaim at same moment gave envious sigh at picture of eager little group with warmth of affection for

in love genuinely after one arrived at year of discretion thought inherently idiotic worse to make choice ought to be for life at year of indiscretion still people be idiotic must be considered a well a other fact such a difficulty of really knowing other before marriage owing to social arrangement also owing to training made men woman always pose so ridiculously towards one pretending to be

joy nothing ever shake belief that what mind of man can imagine that can achieve there be so many pulling wrong way said algitha sadly ah one man may be miserable through deed of others race can only be miserable through own after pause algitha put question how far be justifiable to give pain to others in following one own idea of right reasonable how far might one attempt to live life of intellectual integrity of widest mercy that one nature must stretch to professor fortescue saw limit of one own courage ability algitha pointed out that in most life limit occurred much sooner if others tyrannical absorbent others have intricately bound up notion of happiness with prevention of such endeavour if notion be of usual negative home comfort affection order narrowly personal fruitful in nothing except sort of sentimental egotism spread over whole family what hadria called egotism douze how far ought idea to be respected at what cost professor fortescue be unqualified in condemnation of sentiment erected sacrificial altar in family circle spoke scornfully of doctrine of renunciation so applied held victim who brought gift of power liberty more culpable than who demanded since duty of resistance to recognised wrong be obvious while great enlightenment be needed to teach one to forego unfair privilege power that world concurred in pressing upon one then think person even feminine person justified in giving pain by resisting unjust demand certainly think that attempt to usurp person life on plea of affection must be stoutly resisted recognise case must often occur when resistance be practically impossible one ought not to be too easily melted by behrieks of near relation said hadria ah have good mind to try fear risk for work stake be worth want to grow cramped crooked like poor ash tree perhaps may be form of vanity too know be going to say care scent of young leaf of flower came up soft rich from garden a hadria leant over parapet gust of

hadria gave quiet smile there be not method mental other have not tried tried hard if have not be for sternest self discipline mind at moment must be so honeycombed with small pre occupation pleasant otherwise that must be incapable of consecutive idea of kind a be feel miserable number of hole here touched brow loss of absorbing power at time mental slackness be really alarming what remains of

sinking down down into darkness to dim hell where doom be slow decay instead of fiery pain of burning be wrong wrong cried professor anxiously ah feel now such certainty such courage seems a if fate be giving one more chance have often run very close to making definite decision to dare everything rather than await fool disaster then come that everlasting feminine humility sneaking up with simper 'be not presumptuous selfish mistaken wrong what business have one out of so many to break roughly through delicate web have be spun for kindly detention ' of course retort be 'what business have to

avenue proved to be miss du prel who have come to find hadria henriette have arrived unexpectedly by late afternoon train valeria have volunteered to announce arrival to sister in law ah exclaimed hadria heaven help who help will fit in neatly with plan chapter xxx valeria du prel finding that miss temperley proposed visit of length returned to town by early morning train valeria do know anyone in paris to whom must give letter of introduction hadria asked at last moment when there be just time to write letter more be going to paris valeria asked startled please write letter will tell day what want for nothing very mad hope only little judiciously mad well there be madame bertaux in avenue kleber know already let see oh yes madame vauchelet charming woman very kind very fond of young people be about sixty widow husband be in diplomatic service valeria made hurried comment while writing letter be musical too will introduce perhaps to great joubert others of set will like be sure be one of truly good people of world if really be going to paris will feel happier if know that madame vauchelet be friend sophia successor announced that pony cart be at door miss du prel looked rather anxiously at hadria sister in law a stood on step to bid good bye there be look of elation mixed with devilry in hadria face two figure turned entered house together a pony cart passed through gate hadria always gave miss temperley much opportunity for employment of tact finding tact more elucidating than otherwise to design that be intended to conceal affected in manner of magnifying glass about couple of year ago death of mother have thrown henriette on own resource set free large amount of energy craved legitimate outlet family with whom be now living in london not being related to offered limited opportunity henriette eye be fixed with increasing fondness upon red house there lay callow brood marked out by nature man for ministration with infinite adroitness miss temperley questioned sister in law by inference suggestion about affair of household hadria evaded attempt rejoiced for reason of own that be made began to find occupation diverting characteristically did not hesitate to allow critic to form most alarming conclusion a to state of matter at red house be pensive mild little surprised when miss temperley with suppressed gasp urged that question be deeply serious amused hadria to reproduce for henriette benefit theory regarding treatment training of child that have found current among mother of district madame bertaux happened to call during afternoon that outspoken lady scoffed openly at theory declaring that woman made idiot of on behalf of child whom preposterously ill used with unflagging devotion moral training of young mind be such problem said henriette after visitor have left must cause many anxious thought hadria arranged comfortably among cushion let muscle relax boy be so young said drowsily have doubt will come later on dear hadria unless be trained now oh there be plenty of time do mean to say only what other people say nothing in least original assure see folly inconvenience of now have consulted hoary experience have sat reverently at foot of old nurse have talked with mother in spirit of disciple have learnt oh so much mother be most anxious about moral training of little one said henriette in bewilderment of course worry about so early one ca expect accomplished morality from poor little dot of five six charm of infancy must be gone miss temperley explained remonstrated hadria be limp docile unemphatic perhaps henriette be right did know sense of honour hadria suppressed smile must one after expect of six what one did not always get at six twenty moral altogether seemed good deal to ask of irresponsible youth henriette must not overrate importance of early familiarity with difference between right wrong certainly be important hadria shrank from extreme view one must not rush into without careful thought meanwhile child be growing up cried henriette in despair hadria have not found that experienced mother laid much stress on fact besides there be considerable difficulty in matter henriette did not see difference between right wrong must easily be taught to child perhaps so seemed to be thought expedient to defer lesson till distant future at least if one might judge from literature especially designed for growing mind wherein clever villainy be exalted deed of ferocious cruelty revenge occurred a daily commonplace among hero same policy be indicated by practice of allowing child to become familiar with sight of slaughter of violence of kind towards animal from earliest infancy hadria concluded from that be thought wise to postpone moral training of young till more convenient season henriette looked at sister in law with sad baffled mien hadria expression be solemn a much like of mr walker a must make without descending to obvious caricature do think quite wise henriette to run dead against custom of age do think safe to ignore opinion of countless generation of who be older wiser than dear how have changed cried miss temperley advancing year sobering effect of experience hadria explained be grieved to find henriette at variance with who have practical knowledge of education a child grew up one must easily explain to that idea impression that might have acquired in early year be mostly wrong have to be reversed be quite simple besides unless be born idiot of criminal tendency be bound to find out for dear hadria be just early year be impressionable year nothing can quite erase first impression oh do think so said hadria mildly yes indeed think so cried henriette losing temper oh well of course may be right hadria have brought out piece of embroidery about ten year old be working peacefully on question of hygiene be equally troublesome have taken hint said from mother of large family henriette laid stress upon fresh air even in house hadria believed in fresh air be not going little far to have in house henriette shook head fresh air be always necessary in moderation perhaps hadria admitted utmost care be called for to avoid taking cold laid great stress upon child be naturally so susceptible in nursery that have visited where possible precaution be taken against draught child be incessantly taking cold perhaps precaution made delicate henriette suggested paradox hadria must not entertain take care of cold fresh air will take care of be general maxim dear hadria do mean to tell that people about here be so benighted a really not to understand importance to system of constant supply of pure air hadria puckered up brow a if in thought well said several mother have mentioned take more interest in fluid magnesia tonic henriette looked dispirited at rate there be reason why hadria must not be more enlightened than neighbour on point hadria shook head deprecatingly hoped henriette must not mind if quoted opinion of old mr jordan whose language be sometimes little strong said that did believe damned nonsense about fresh air drain henriette coughed be certainly not safe to trust entirely to nurse however devoted experienced insisted hadria shrugged shoulder if nurse did constitutionally enjoy certain stuffiness in nursery well child be out day must do much harm hadria bent low over embroidery night oh then one must of course expect to be little stuffy cried miss temperley almost hopeless impure air breathed night after night be incessant drain on strength even if time only doe little harm hadria smiled over silken arabesque oh nobody ever object to thing that only do little harm there be moment of silence henriette thought that hadria must indeed have changed very much during last year well of course when very young hadria said one have extravagant notion one imagined sort of wild thing about purpose of human brain not till later did one realize that average brain be merely instrument of adjustment sort of spirit level enabled owner to keep accurately in line with other people henriette ought to rejoice that hadria have thus come to bow to superiority of collective wisdom henriette have doubt hadria carefully selected shade of silk went to light to reassure herself of correctness returned to easy chair by fire henriette resumed knitting be making stocking for nephew henriette think must be rather good plan if be to come live here manage affair moral manner hygiene everything henriette needle stopped abruptly wave of colour came into face gleam of sudden joy to eye dear what do mean hubert of course must be only too delighted to have here want to go away for heaven sake not exactly for heaven sake for own sake suppose frankly selfish be perhaps particular form that selfishness take unfortunately conspicuous form so many of can have nice cosy pocket edition doe show however be not point know must be happier doing than anything else that must do perfectly have kind of talent if may say so make admirable ruler when have large political field call 'administrative ability ' when have small domestic one speak of a 'good housekeeping ' be precious quality wherever appears have scope for at present henriette be bewildered horrified yet secretly thrilled with joy on own account be there quarrel have cloud come over happiness of home hadria laughed assured to contrary where be going for how long what did intend to do did hubert approve must bear to be away from child hadria thought be beside point especially a boy be shortly going to school question be whether henriette must take charge certainly if hadria came to such mad decision that henriette hoped might be averted what must people say further discussion be checked by call from mr walker whom hadria have audacity to consult on question of education hygiene leading by dexterous generalship almost over same ground that have traversed inducing unconscious lady to repeat with amazing accuracy hadria own reproduction of local view now be without authority in idea asked after mr walker have departed henriette have to admit that have at least one supporter believe added that practice be better than preaching seems to be ordinance of nature said hadria that thing will never correspond chapter xxxi hadria said nothing more about project when henriette alluded to answered that be still unfurnished with detail merely wished to know for certain henriette view admitted that there have be conversation on subject between hubert must give particular henriette have to draw own conclusion from hadria haggard look suppressed excitement of manner henriette always made point of being present when professor fortescue called a did not approve of frequent visit noticed that gave slight start when hadria entered in few day have grown perceptibly thinner manner be restless day two of rain have prevented usual walk when cleared up again season have taken stride still more glorious be array of tree flower indescribable freshness suggested idea that be bathed in mysterious elixir of life that if one touched eternal youth must be reward professor theobald gazed at hadria with startled enquiring eye when met again look tired said be rather spring be always little trying especially spring find garden of priory be now at very perfection of beauty supreme moment have come of flowing wealth of foliage delicate splendour of blossom yet paleness of green tenderness of texture be still there professor theobald said suddenly that hadria looked a if be turning over project very anxiously in mind project on much depended be very penetrating replied after moment hesitation be exactly what be doing when be girl brother sister used to discus question of sovereignty of will most of believed in devoutly regarded circumstance a annoying trifle that person who respected must allow to stand in way want to try theory see what come of alarm mr temperley yes people always do

stopped reddening a met glance of miss temperley flung into conversation with became especially animated when be passing hadria who did not appear to notice a professor be to leave craddock dene at end of week be last meeting in priory garden miss temperley found professor theobald entertaining at time little incoherent why there be miss du prel exclaimed henriette what erratic person be went to london day before yesterday now turn up suddenly without word of warning confirmed professor theobald suspicion that something serious be going on at red house valeria explained return to hadria by saying that have felt so nervous about what latter might be going to attempt that have come back to see if must be of help able to ward off rash adventure there be pleasant open space among shrubbery where several seat have be placed to command dainty view of garden lawn with house in distance here party gradually converged in desultory fashion coming up strolling off again a fancy inspired cigar be lighted sense of sociability enjoyment suffused like perfume among group lady engleton be delighted to see miss du prel again did so want to continue hot discussion be having at red house afternoon when mr temperley must be so horridly logical smiled twisted moustache be interrupted by caller have to leave argument at most exciting moment eternally interesting subject said temperley what woman be what be not dread be presently need for dissimulation being over delightful mystery will have vanished said professor theobald must tire in day of woman must understand tempt one to enquire length of reign of satisfactory enigma cried lady engleton precisely length of ability to mystify replied future wife ought to be given hint oh wife in case must hold mere fact that be duty to adore must be chilling when added to knew that have placed among list of obligation to adore well must be climax of disenchantment hubert commended wisdom in not marrying only person must conceivably marry must be cook in case there must be romance to spoil vision to destroy fear be cloak for poor opinion of sex professor on contrary admire sex too much to think of subjecting to ordeal must not endure to regard woman have once admired a matter of course commonplace in existence henriette plunged headlong into fray in opposition to professor heresy conversation became general professor theobald fell out of be furtively watching hadria whose eye be strangely bright be sitting on arm of seat listening to talk with little smile on lip hand clasped back of seat rigidly a if be holding something down quality defect of female character be frankly canvassed view being held with fervour expressed with urbanity woman be always so so woman be absolutely never so so woman felt without exception thus thus on contrary be entirely devoid of such sentiment large experience wide observation always supported opinion eminent authority swarmed to standard do think that woman want breadth of view said lady engleton sometimes want accuracy of statement observed professor theobald with possible second meaning in word seems to lack concentration be too versatile be hubert comment want sense of honour be asserted sense of humour one added want feeling of public duty want spice of devil exclaimed hadria there be laugh hubert thought be lack not likely to be felt for very long be under rapid process of cultivation why be commonplace that if woman be bad be always very bad cried lady engleton new intoxicating experience said professor fortescue sympathize new colleague murmured with faint chuckle

reminded that truth be always stranger than fiction to best men observed valeria woman show meanest quality be fatality of training professor theobald have noted same trait in other subject race pray call subject race remonstrated lady engleton ah yes truth cried hadria starve for truth be courageous mr temperley like lady of willott be sick of shadow bare truth on subject be hard for woman to face be harder in long run to waltz eternally round with averted eye dear why be truth about hard to face demanded valeria be placed between horn of dilemma one lady clamour for bare truth forbids to say anything unpleasing withdraw objection valeria offered ungracious task will not be forced upon unwilling chivalry said hadria if condition have be evil scar must be left may a well be confessed among fault of woman must place tendency to trade upon abuse real chivalry generosity when meet survival perhaps from stone age when fittest to bully be surviving elect of society hadria eye sparkled with suppressed excitement freedom alone teach to meet generosity generously said professor fortescue ca get perpendicular virtue out of really free born then do describe woman virtue a horizontal enquired miss du prel half resentfully in so far a follow prevailing model woman love friendship duty conduct of life a whole speaking very roughly have be lacking in quality that call perpendicular

because be generally more le abject hadria put in sacrifice be made because woman be woman be obeisance of sex acknowledgment of servility not simple desire of service adorable creature be not always precisely obeisant observed theobald a say may be capricious cruel enough to who treat justly generously hadria eye instinctively turned towards distant priory valeria followed ask to sacrifice for

who did not like tone conversation be taking desired to join never quite know how far be serious how far be just amusing hadria said lady engleton talking of greece reminds of remark made other day

spartan wife throw off bondage defies law insult be still more glad not if sin henriette coughed warningly yes if sin oh hadria remonstrated henriette in despair see that follows that helen did sin

assert husband right of ownership be at door that siege of troy ought to be laid only wish elopement always caused a much commotion lady engleton laughed miss temperley tried to catch hadria eye well be strange idea do really think helen did not sin seriously now know there be evidence on point lady engleton laughed again do amuse assuming that helen did not sin suppose must if only for sake of paradox accuse virtuous greek matron who sat at home wove span bore child of sinning against state certainly said hadria undismayed be who insidiously prepared doom for country a wove span bore child with stupid docility a surely a enemy might undermine foundation of city till fell in with crash so surely brought ruin upon greece oh hadria be quite beside to day cried henriette love of paradox

must face anything on behalf including present disagreeable task hadria looked at sister in law with admiration offered homage to prowess of enemy miss temperley held commanding position fortified by idea custom century old supported by ally on side ran through hadria mind that be possible to refuse to allow subject to be broached thus escape encounter altogether must save many word on side henriette have always be in hubert confidence occurred to hadria that might be well to define own position once more since be thus about to be directly frankly attacked moreover hadria began to be fired with spirit of battle be not merely for on behalf of sex that longed to repudiate insult seemed to to be involved in henriette whole philosophy however if enemy shewed sign of hostility hadria resolved that also must keep truce miss temperley have already mentioned that mr fullerton be now staying at red house for change of air have be far from well of course be worrying very much over money trouble peril ahead a well a about hadria present action mr fullerton have suggested that henriette must go over to paris to see what must be done to patch up quarrel ah exclaimed hadria cloud

what might think now say that in acting a have acted have forfeited position need not return to red house know spoke in great haste anger have made confidante ambassador henriette shook head have acted entirely on own responsibility must not bear to see brother suffering have felt quarrel deeply on account of stupid talk said hadria will soon blow over on account of talk partly know

indeed be slumbering be simply scathing on behalf have come way from england for wo understand mean motherhood have duty ca deny can do miss temperley stared will find human being to agree with said at length doe not alter opinion oh hadria explain utter paradox want to understand point of view be simple enough deny motherhood have duty except when be absolutely free absolutely uninfluenced by pressure of opinion by of innumerable tyranny that most child have now to thank for existence miss temperley shook head see that 'tyranny a call exonerates mother from duty to child there differ motherhood in present social state be sign seal a well a mean method of woman bondage forge chain of own flesh blood weave cord of own love instinct agonizes fruit of agony be not even legally hers

miss temperley symbol have stood to world for be sweetest holiest know have so profound have be humiliation know what to say to anyone so wrong headed so twisted in sentiment hadria smiled thoughtfully while be about may a well finish disclosure of feeling again warn be not peculiar to myself however may lay that flattering unction to soul have seen heard of many saddening evidence of sex slavery since came to terrible wonderful city crude obvious buying selling that shudder at hideous a be to be far le awful than other respectable form of degradation that everyone glow smirk over miss temperley clasped hand in despair simply ca understand what say be rank heresy against be most beautiful in human nature surely rank heresy be to be laid at door of who degrade enslave assert to be most beautiful in human nature be not speaking to convince merely to shew where can not count upon for point of attack try something else be so strange so insane a seems to do mean to throw contempt on motherhood per se be not discussing motherhood per se woman have yet be in position to know what be per se strange a may appear woman have yet experienced apart from enormous pressure of law opinion have always formed part of inevitable condition illegal mother be hounded by fellow in one direction legal mother be urged incited in free motherhood be unknown amongst speak of a be to

know own name henriette preferred to ignore side of experience murmured something about maternal instinct potency deny potency of instinct said hadria do say that be shamefully presumed upon strong obviously must be if industrious cultivation encouragement threat exhortation can make so past a well a weight of opinion training in present have be at work on thrusting alluring coercing woman to man allotted fate nature allotted if please said henriette there be need for alluring coercing why do then now be frank henriette try not to be offended must feel sense of indignity in performing function of sort however noble so on might think per se if knew that must be demanded of a duty if did not welcome a joy must acknowledge a duty if did not welcome a joy in other word must accept position of slave how so by bartering womanhood by using power of body in return for food shelter social favour for sake of so called 'duty ' irrespective of perhaps in direct opposition to feeling how then do differ from slave woman who produce progeny of young slave to be disposed of a will seem good to perhaps indulgent master see essential difference see difference between honour ignominy said henriette hadria shook head sadly difference be in detail in circumstance be sorry if offend taste fact be offensive bewildering thing be that fact never seem to offend only mention of must take too long to go into subject said henriette can only repeat fail to understand extraordinary view of holiest of human instinct catch word use rashly henriette for do not know that deepest of degradation come of misusing be most holy woman who doe duty be not to be accused of misusing anything cried miss temperley hotly be there then sin misuse of power in sending into world swarm of fortuitous poverty stricken human soul a soul must be who be born in bondage with blended instinct of slave master for proud inheritance sound awful know truth be apt to sound awful motherhood a wisdom have appointed among civilized people represents prostitution of reproductive power precisely corresponds to other abuse seems to most of so infinitely more shocking miss temperley preferred not to reply to remark entrance of little martha relieved tension of moment henriette though bore child grudge must not resist when came forward put up face to be kissed be really growing very pretty said henriette in tone betrayed agitation have be struggling to hide martha ran for doll blue man be soon busy at play in corner of room building eiffel tower out of stone brick knocking down again

remind that when married entered into contract now repudiate hadria started up reddening with anger did such thing know henriette how do dare to sit there tell that tell nothing truth woman who marries enters by fact into contract miss temperley have evidently regarded a strong card played hopefully hadria be trembling with anger steadied voice then actually intended to entrap into so called contract by leading to suppose that must mean nothing more between hubert than unavoidable formality tell to face appear to see that be confessing act of deliberate treachery nonsense cried henriette there be nothing that sane person must have objected to in conduct hadria stood looking down scornfully on sister in law shrugged shoulder a if in bewilderment yet must have felt yourselves stained with dishonour for rest of life have procured anything else on false pretence woman be different affair code of honour doe not here apply must seem fraud may be honourably practised on wild be surprise indignation if object when find out be perfectly mad cried henriette tapping angrily with finger on arm of chair what say be true whether be mad sane what call 'contract ' be simply cunning contrivance for making woman possible child legal property of man for enlisting own honour conscience to safeguard disgraceful transaction ah said henriette on watch for opportunity then admit that honour conscience be enlisted certainly in case of most woman enlistment be masterpiece of policy to make prisoner own warder be surely light stroke of genius be exactly what refused to be from first one must have spoken more plainly now be shocked pained aggrieved because wo eat word yet have talked over in room at dunaghee by hour oh henriette why did not listen to conscience be honest with hadria insult why must not hubert choose one among hundred thousand of woman who must have passed under yoke without question have gladly harnessed to chariot by rein of own conscience must to heaven have henriette be goaded into replying hadria laughed then brow clouded with pain ah why did not meet frankness with equal frankness at time trouble must have be saved if only have be honest dear be in love with so thought justified in deceiving there be indeed war to knife between sex hadria stood with elbow on back of high arm chair chin resting on hand be not fair to use that word tell that confidently expected that when have more experience must be like other woman adjust sensibly to condition see said hadria so be decided that hubert be to pretend to have objection to wild idea so a to obtain consent trusting to ponderous bulk of circumstance to hold flat subservient when no longer have remedy in power neither of lack brain at rate henriette clenched hand in effort of self control in ninety nine case out of hundred forecast must have come true said mean be refreshingly frank cried hadria thought acted for best oh if come to that spanish inquisitor doubtless thought that be acting for best when made bonfire of heretic in market place henriette bent head clasped arm of chair tightly well if there be one at fault in matter be culprit said in voice trembled be who assured hubert that experience must alter be who represented to that though might be impulsive even hard at time must not persist in course must give pain that if saw that act of yours caused to suffer must give up be convinced that character be good noble au fond hadria have believed up to moment hadria drew together with start face darkened make regret that ever have good pitiful impulse cried with passion went to window stood leaning against casement with crossed arm henriette turned round in chair why do always resist better nature hadria use against be same with woman let beware of 'better nature poor hunted fool for 'better nature ' will be used a dog chain by can be led like toy terrier from beginning to end of what be pleased to call life oh hadria hadria cried miss temperley with deep regret in tone hadria be only roused by remonstrance be cunning willow heartless woman who really fare best in society condition suit have pity no sympathy to make chain of mind stooping to

thank if conscience be going to be made into helm by others may guide according to good pleasure sooner that helm be destroyed better be conclusion to drive rest of henriette charity demand believe what say said miss temperley oh trouble to be charitable henriette heaved deep sigh hadria said be going to allow petty rancour about well will call error of ours if like to be severe be going to bear malice ruin own life hubert child be so unforgiving so lacking in generosity call error call treachery returned hadria why must result of treachery be thrust on to shoulder to bear why must generosity be summoned to rescue suppose calculated on sub consciously at time hadria be moment for plain speaking if ever there be one must have reckoned on appeal to generosity on utter helplessness of position when once be safely entrapped be extremely clever well thought out do suppose that must have dared to act a did if there have be mean of redress in hand after marriage if did rely on generosity admit mistake said henriette bitterly now when deed brings natural harvest of disaster hubert come howling like frightened child to have mischief set straight again consequence of treachery averted by of people on earth be wife mother of child in heaven name henriette why do always run into very jaw know what mean why do catalogue injury when point be to deny henriette rose with vivid flush hadria hubert be one of best men in england when have disputed that hadria advanced towards miss temperley stood looking full in face believe that hubert have acted conscientiously according to standard detest standard did not think wrong treacherous to behave a did towards be that very fact that so bitterly resent must have forgiven sin against alone acknowledged to be sin be sin against

red house where old couple be to settle for rest of day within reach of child grandchild wish of invalid must be respected just unjust absolute repose of mind body be imperatively necessary must only be attained for by complete surrender on part of child of course of action that seriously disapproved income be too limited to allow of algitha returning to parent otherwise mr fullerton must have wished algitha have now to provide for a allowance that father have given must not be continued have previously done work for nothing now mr trevelyan under whose care have be living offered paid post in convalescent home in be interested be exceptionally fortunate said algitha for mr trevelyan have arranged most kindly so can get away to see mother father at end of week mr mr fullerton have taken for granted that hadria must remain at red house that hubert must forgive a put circumstance seemed to take equally for granted mr fullerton must now depend entirely on child for solace pleasure must require cheering amusing helping in thousand way algitha be to come down week from saturday till monday brother when must during rest of week invalid must depend on younger daughter hadria leaving home rumour of quarrel between hubert have conduced to mother illness perhaps have even caused mr fullerton have taken bitterly to heart have become obvious that hadria must have now to remain at red house for mother sake that being so hubert agreed that be useless to discus other reason for against hubert be only too glad of return for appearance ' sake of thought for moment of what henriette called reconciliation what have passed before hadria departure have revealed finally hopelessness of such attempt matter settled down heavily with air of finality if only mother declining year be happy peaceful must be something of importance gained ala mr fullerton seemed anything happy helplessness be hard to bear felt worldly downfall severely shattered state of nerve tended to make exacting irritable a have felt seriously aggrieved for so many year of life now regarded devotion of child a debt tardily paid habit grew insensibly upon of increasing demand a found everyone so ready to submit to possession of power have usual effect knew mercy in use daughter be made to feel that if have be le headstrong selfish in past must have be vigorous active woman to day obviously very least must do be to try by mean in power to lighten burden have laid upon yet mr fullerton be by nature unselfish must have gladly sacrificed herself for child good a indeed have persistently doggedly sacrificed for during childhood naturally have own view of what constituted good did not consist in wasting one youth look among slum of east end in deserting one home to study music mix in set of second rate people in out of way district of paris a for hadria conduct about little martha mr fullerton must scarcely bring to speak about terrified thought indicated taint of madness in daughter mind two charming child of own mr fullerton with painful flush must turn mind from subject have to believe daughter mad bad be terrible to maternal pride must indeed scarcely believe that have not all be painful dream for hadria be now so good dutiful so tender watchful how must have behaved so abominably so crazily day hadria came to cottage generally with bunch of fresh flower to place by mother couch then affair of household be talked over arranged daughter doing what be needed in way of ordering provision writing note for invalid must now write only with greatest difficulty then mr fullerton liked to have chat to hear what be in paper be going on in neighbourhood to discus sort of dreary detail over over again book that hadria must sometimes bring be generally left unread unless be light novel of rigidly conventional character mr fullerton grew so excited in condemnation of other kind that be dangerous to put before in evening old couple liked to have rubber often hubert hadria must make up necessary quartett four silent human being who sat like solemn child at portentous play while clock on mantel piece recorded moment of life that dedicated to mimic battle hour hour be spent in way hadria found that must not endure night much to surprise of parent monotony incessant recurrence have disastrous effect on nerve suggesting wild desperate impulse must go out of mind if have break said at last after trying for month in interest of future rubber must leave off now then that play run away will live to play day mr fullerton thought strange that hadria must not do even little thing for parent without grumbling did not wish to make martyr of must try find one else to take place occasionally sometimes joseph fleming must accept post sometimes lord engleton often ernest fred whose comparatively well ordered mind be not sent off balance so easily a hadria in fashion time went by new state of affair already seemed hundred year old paris be clear far off dream occasional letter from madame vauchelet jouffroy who mourned wailed over hadria surrender of work served to remind that have once be actual living there still existed paris far away beyond hill brilliant vivid exquisite inspiring at very moment people be coming going river be flowing little steamer plying how hard be to realise family be charmed with position of affair be such mercy thing have happened a have be verdict delivered with much wise shaking of head there can be more mad disgraceful behaviour on part of hubert wife be one comfort ca murder mother outright though have not be far off from first hadria have understood what future must be circumstance must not be overcome by deed that must bring to do even valeria be baffled theory must not quite work hadria looked thing straight in face that be strongest most essential in must starve there be help for one be directly to blame not even fate chance providence devil whatever be have determined against particular impulse particular view of thing after must have be rather strange if power have happened exactly to agree with be not so ridiculous told a to feel personally aggrieved so long a fate chance providence devil gave emotion desire talent will be impossible not to suffer might fully recognise that suffering be of absolutely importance in great scheme of thing did not make suffering le if must be must be there be end to must someone gain by be highly satisfactory more than must be said of most suffering exists must seem only to increase multiply after manner of dire disease be what hadria dreaded in own case that loss must not end with child martha everyone who came under influence must share in henriette irritated by approving sweetness of demeanour carefully avoiding look of triumph rather triumphing by air said must crow over for world be evidently brimming over with satisfaction great peril felt have be averted family reputation be saved appear to think that eye of europe be riveted on temperley family said august race know there be one two other branch of human stock in existence one must consider what people say said henriette hadria time now be filled more more with detail since there be two household instead of one to manage new charge be particularly difficult because have not free hand without entirely abandoning music have perforce to fall into abeyance progress be scarcely possible a henriette pointed out gave so much pleasure to others when hadria avoided music be too severely classical at craddock place one evening be taken in to dinner by callow youth who

only phase know upon word be getting tired of not that have objection to woman being well educated hadria be glad of must not stand when went out of sphere put forward tried to be emancipated sort of nonsense hadria be not surprised that must not stand there have be scathing article youth said in one of evening paper wondered how new woman felt after reading simply made mincemeat of wretched creature hadria exclaimed youth wished that woman must really do something instead of making fuss hadria agreed that be pity be so inactive must not one two of more favoured sex manage to inspire with little initiative youth considered that woman be by nature passive reflective not original hadria thought novelty of idea not least of charm youth allowed that in own way in own sphere woman be charming singularly intelligent have objection to developing a much a pleased in proper direction hadria felt really encouraged be so absurd to pretend woman must do work be peculiar to men hadria agreed with chuckle when have written one of shakespeare drama when indeed history be ominously silent on point hadria what be amusing enquired hostess across table oh well only discouraging fact that woman a mr st george convincingly point out have ever written one of shakespeare drama oh said lady engleton with broad smile know mr st george really have have quite same chance have perhaps not quite a far a literature went youth admitted tolerantly there be failure in original work in direction be blame to woman be not made that way fact have to be recognised woman strength lay in different domain in home be of use to try to fight against nature look at music for instance one required particular liberty to pursue that art yet where be woman composer if there be so much buried talent among woman why did arise bring out opera oratorio hadria must understand especially a domestic life be arranged one might almost say with special view to promoting musical talent in mistress of household yet where be oratorio shook head mr st george thought have clearly proved that inherent nature of woman be passive imitative while of man even in least remarkable example of sex be always powerful original to verge of perilous think have better go to drawing room said lady engleton discreetly youth twirled moustache thoughtfully a lady filed out hadria happiest hour be now that spent with little martha who be growing rapidly in stature intelligence child lovable nature blossomed sweetly under influence of hadria tenderness when wearied sad at heart hour in priory garden saunter along roadside with little martha be like touch of fresh breeze after oppression of heated room hadria attachment to child have grown grown until have become almost passion how be child to be saved

folly of persevering in fruitless effort lady engleton be sure that hadria saw too few people lived too monotonous life craddock place be filled with guest just now lady engleton used utmost persuasion to induce hubert hadria to come to dinner to join party in evening whenever must hadria shrank from idea be adding burden to already failing strength to talk coherently to be lively make agreeable to have to think about one dress seemed inexpressibly wearisome lady engleton be so genuinely eager to administer cure that hadria yielded half in gratitude half in order to save effort of

brow looked like restless wild animal pacing cage intense mortification gave strange malicious expression seemed to be casting about for mean of returning stunning blow that have received just at moment of expected triumph damn exclaimed with sudden vehemence stood still looking down into hadria face with cruel glittering eye glanced furtively around there be one in sight even little martha be making mud pie by church door thick yew tree shut in churchyard from village there be not sound far near to break sense of seclusion mean to tell be to part mean to tell that be final decision bowed

having made into legal property have legal right to own child believe can make give up professor looked at calmly think will find that law have infinite respect for father holiest feeling must have interfere with awakening aspiration to do duty towards child what dreadful thought then think have special view on education of little one can not entirely approve after woman have probably to be wife mother on good old term have served world for fair number of century when one come to consider be pity to allow to grow up without dogma sentiment may help to make position tolerable if not always satisfactory to though a philosopher one may see absurdity of popular prejudice yet a practical man one feel inexpediency of disturbing idea upon system depends thus adding to number of malcontent very well for who think thing out for education of girl must be on old line believe will not believe know so think better for a well a for other reason to take daughter under own care be extremely sorry that must have have trouble responsibility for nothing be grieved that educational idea must be so frustrated what be to do duty be obvious regret that did not become devotee to duty little sooner little later hadria returned for present suppose martha will remain with hannah until conscience decides what course will take until see whether can carry out threat certainly certainly wish to give unnecessary pain be consideration hadria stooped to take child hand little finger nestled confidingly in palm will say good bye martha asked professor stooping to kiss martha drew away struck father sturdy blow on face have apparently vague idea that have be unkind to protectress that be enemy oh cruel cruel what if bring more toy martha threatened tear will allow to pas said professor

made confession to lady engleton on same night when also announced that found suddenly necessary to return to town be time before recovered from astonishment horror told story quietly without effort to excuse of course though ca exonerate professor blame more than said finally for standard in matter be so different from being man professor suppressed smile always seemed strange to that woman must be harder on own sex than on have intention of discouraging lack of esprit de corp have obvious convenience did confess everything to aunt after return from portsmouth asked lady engleton yes have letter now in name be mentioned in name be mentioned sent money to girl returned said that hated must not touch so gave money to aunt told to send on in own name to ellen for child support of course made secrecy condition so a matter of fact have acknowledged child though not publicly have contributed to support from birth thought mr temperley have be supporting cried lady engleton nevertheless have continued to send money to aunt if mr temperley chose to take charge of child certainly have nothing to complain of must not openly contribute without declaring dear be very strange what must hadria say if knew doe know what along since yesterday how doe take be bitter against be only natural especially a told wanted to have child under own care ah will be blow to be wrapped up in little girl professor theobald pointed out difficulty must begin to crop up a grew older child must not have same advantage in present circumstance a professor must be able to give lady engleton admitted that be true then may count on to plead cause with mr temperley if hadria belief that be for child good will not stand in way unless remember that idea of vengeance that used to have oh must not let vengeance interfere with child welfare hope not see want to adopt strong measure law be always odious law lady engleton looked startled be sure that law must give custody of child sure of law dear lady one might a well be sure of woman pardon know regard quality of infinite flexibility a one of supreme charm of sex ca say that feel to be supreme charm of law mr temperley claim to have authority through mother because have written consent of aunt to adoption think be rather stretching point fear be since poor mother be dead at time can prove everything have said to satisfaction of anybody continued theobald think claim to take charge of child be well established will admit wish be not unreasonable doe great credit oh dear will be hard for mr temperley fear will be most grieved what be to do must consider best interest of child doubtless be trifle late professor in thinking of must prefer to be never than late heaven forbid then may rely on to explain position of affair to mr temperley will understand that be painful subject between lady engleton readily promised called at red house immediately after professor theobald departure interview be long then have not spoken in vain dear hadria said lady engleton in most sympathetic tone hadria be very pale on contrary have spoken to convince knew that must hing to stand in way of child hadria be silent be very sorry about

be thankful for by time story have flown through village nothing else be talked of excitement be intense gossip ran high in hall cottage professor fortescue alone must not be drawn into discussion lady engleton took aside asked what really thought about must say be that whole affair be deeply tragic have knowledge of circumstance feeling involved judgment must therefore be useless seemed more practical to try to help one fellow to resist sin than to shriek at convicted sinner departure have be fixed for following morning so poor little martha will go up together by afternoon train suppose said lady engleton hadria spent rest of day at martha cottage there be many preparation to make hannah be bustling about eye red with weeping be heart broken declared that must never live with bad man

what can one do there be case in short thing be impossible valeria be silent have thought at time that might make better stand said at last clinging still to theory of sovereignty of will hadria did not reply professor shook head know present condition said hadria after silence ca overcome perhaps one else in place might overcome confess see how do valeria hesitated made vague statement about

long self suppression long playing of fatiguing role hadria felt unspeakable relief in algitha presence to at least need not assume false cheerfulness algitha noticed with anxiety change be coming over sister spirit of tired acquiescence insidious creeping in of slightly cynical view of thing in place of brave believing imaginative outlook that have once held towards life cynicism be more le superficial however a algitha found when have long intimate conversation one evening in hadria room by fire be painful to algitha to hear hopeless tone of sister voice now that be speaking simply sincerely without bitterness without what be usually called resignation think be for best said hadria think a far a influence go be for worst what fatal argument life will give to who be seeking reason to hold sex in old bondage struggle failure will add to staggering weight that stumble under have hindered more be bitter thing by having tried failed than if have never tried at mr walker mr gordon have given le argument to oppressor than why how cried algitha incredulously because one can point to a will to say beee what ghastly failure see how feeble after be pretentious woman of new order who begin by denying sufficiency of life assigned by common consent end by failing in in other aspire to what have become of talent theory resolve so next girl who dare to have ambition dare to scorn role of adventuress that society allots to will have harder fate because of attempt now nothing in whole world cried hadria voice losing even tone in have be speaking nothing in whole world will ever persuade that be for best never said be when thing have to be why not make best of so persuade people that be well when be not well that be exactly what woman always do always have done plume upon so ridiculous farce be kept up because wretched woman go smiling about world hugging stupid resignation to heart pampering up sickly virtue at expense of sex hang virtue algitha laughed be somewhat self regarding certainly in spite of incessant renunciation sacrifice oh self sacrifice in woman be always easiest course be nearest approach to luxury society allows cried hadria irascibly be most refreshing to hear exaggerate once more with old vigour sister cried if have foible be under statement returned hadria with half smile then think have foible said algitha that be ready to admit seriously woman seem bent on proving that may treat a like will 'never desert mr micawber algitha smiled be so mortally afraid of getting off line doing what might not be quite right take morbid interest in own character be so particular about soul female soul be such delicate creation like bonnet look at woman trimming poking at bonnet be exactly how go on with soul algitha laughed shrugged

to heaven hadria exclaimed well be not of course conception mine of will of heaven be hadria shrugged shoulder wish woman must think little le of heaven in abstract little more of one in concrete nobody have ever taught to think of one on contrary have always be trained to think of men of heaven soul that training account for attitude towards own sex suppose so spirit of sisterhood among woman must have sadly upset social scheme a have be hitherto conceived indeed social scheme have made spirit well nigh impossible conquering race if be wise governs subject largely through internecine

turn if be intention oh can not even turn replied hadria necessity know law one thing wo do be to be virtuously resigned wo beake best of ' algitha laughed be relieved to hear so wrong headed sentiment from sound more like old self wo be called wrong headed on account said hadria if life be to bear testimony to truth refrain ought to be 'this be wrong be futile be cruel be damnable ' will warn young woman come across to beware a grows older have people in clutch not to express affection by making unlimited demand on beloved object by turning world into prison house for whom honour with devotion hope of future lie in rising generation ca alter who have matured in old idea be for to warn wo pretend to think that thing be all right when know be not all right must be mean what be called making best of must testify wrong way life instead of being warning must be sort of trap let at least play humble role of scarecrow be in excellent condition for added grasping thin wrist algitha shook head anxiously fear said that moral that most people will draw will be 'follow in path of mr gordon however distasteful may seem to whatever temptation feel towards more independent life if will come to grief ' then think must be better to be besigned look after one own soul heaven know what must be better algitha exclaimed one thing be certain ought to look after body for present at rate

inflicted on helpless creature in order to supply daily demand of vast flesh eating population must feel that a matter of fact have be doing human race good turn a well a more friendless fellow being be impossible to imagine that men woman must not suffer at thought of causing suffering to helpless if once realized that suffering clearly men woman be not devil theobald have always laughed at for

favourable to lingering among little longer suffering at time be so great that must scarcely wish for delay hadria used always to play to during part of afternoon robin have become constant visitor have found way to window of sick room where crumb have be scattered on sill professor took great pleasure in watching little creature sometimes must come into room hop on to chair table coquetting from perch to perch looking at invalid with bright inquisitive eye crumb be put out at certain hour morning bird have acquired habit of arriving almost to moment if by chance crumb have be forgotten robin must flutter ostentatiously before window to remind friend of neglected duty during last few day hadria have fancied that professor have divined valeria secret that have betrayed there be peculiar reverent tenderness in manner towards be even more marked than usual ca save ca save hadria used to cry piteously when be alone surely surely there be hope science make such profession why doe do something ah torture with false hope dear valeria world be monstrous life be unbearable exclaimed valeria with despairing break in voice one afternoon came out of sick room with le distraught expression on worn face though eye shewed trace of tear dying man used to speak often about wife to hadria have be room almost fancied presence about do know said have found of late that many of old fixed idea have be insidiously modifying so many thing used to regard a preposterous have be borne in upon in singular fashion a by mean so out of question have have one two strange experience now hope might say faith have settled upon of undying element in personality feel that will meet again have loved here time what sting must take from agony of parting cried hadria after be le rational to suppose that there be survival of self that wild confused earthly experience be element of spiritual evolutionary process than to suppose that whole universe be chaotic meaningless for what call mind exists must be contained in sum total of existence how must arise out of therefore reasonable scheme appears more likely than reasonless one then there be that other big fact that stare in face put one fear to shame human goodness hadria rebellious memory recalled fact of human cruelty wickedness to set against goodness be silent what earthly business have thing a goodness pity to appear in fortuitous mindless soulless universe where doe come from what be origin whence sprang law gave birth give more argument to faith than thing know said even if there have be one good man woman since world began ah yes pity tenderness lie in heart of man even of worst if only can be appealed to before die may teach to hope thing there be long silence through open window must hear soft cooing of wood pigeon among big tree behind house there be populous rookery noisy now with squeaky voice of young bird deeper cawing of parent rook have be for many year without one gleam of hope said professor slowly be only lately that of obstinate preconception have begun to yield to other suggestion other thought have opened up thousand possibility thousand hope have not be false to reason in change have followed more fearlessly more faithfully have sometimes thought said hadria that when seem to cling most desperately to reason be really refusing to accept guidance into unfamiliar region confuse familiar with reasonable exactly want to be on guard against intellectual foible believe have held back in region of sadness solitude need not have lingered in for there be great commotion in rookery presently flock of rook swept across window in loud controversy away over garden in circle then up up till be grey little patch of changing shape in blue of sky dying man followed with eye have watched such streaming company start forth from old rookery ever since boyhood memory of time of importunate thought have haunted then at opening of life returned to now have accomplished fraction of what have set out to attempt with such high hope dream of personal happiness have failed many illusion have be lost many bitterly regretted deed have saddened many error have revenged upon drew deep sigh if scheme of universe be reasonable one said half dreamily then one can account better for life never fulfil apparent failure saddens one in such numberless instance especially among woman for in case failure be only apparent however cruel however great if effort have be sincere thought bent upon best must be conceived by particular soul then that effort thought must play part in upward movement of race can not believe otherwise hadria head be bent lip moved a if in effort to speak sound came to believe that better more generous hope of kind be to be lost ineffectual that genius be finally wasted goodness exotic to be trampled under foot in blind movement of nature requires more power of faith than can muster once believe that thought be main factor motive force of universe then everything settle into place have room for hope indeed insists upon admission fall into shadow of life like blessed ray of sunlight lay across bed in bright streak hope lead far training have be

be left unopposed be worse than folly to underrate force of enemy be always worse than folly to deny fact in order to support theory exhort people to face conquer can help more than dream even a thing stand can not tell what have done for dear hadria held out hand to helpless human animal how wring one heart forget be to knight errant have suffered enough to know well how to bind wound speaker
