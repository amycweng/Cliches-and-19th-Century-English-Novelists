apprehension of like attempt in paris have stirred up to fury so that when word went forth to fall on leader of party savage work once begun even a fire in city built of wood raged a madness for one while men in panic struck at foe whose gripe did think to feel about throat here speaker paused instant so bold opening of speech did seem to take present by surprise almost robbed of breath for be

not very near in blood to father be howsoever of same family a ourselves have be to english college in douay have brought tidings short time back of father edmund genings safe arrival thither afterward came often to see much frequented lady tregony house have exceedingly good part be somewhat diffident bashful martin tregony be wont to make mark a be of ill natured wit did fancy to be greatly superior in sharpness partly because mr sherwood disposition be retiring partly that have too much goodness sense to bandy word with so ill mannered young man pray who read must aught be more indiscreet than in thoughtless manner to have summoned two to dispute nevertheless did thinking sport must arise out of to see master martin foisted in argument by one despised also from extravagant gesture affected countenance so said master tregony task will be to dispute with master sherwood theme of argument art of tormenting ' who will describe nicest instance of such skill when exercised by master toward servant parent to child husband to wife wife to husband lover to mistress friend to friend will be proclaimed victorious adversary submit to such penance a court will inflict master

there appeared made smile did indicate assurance of victory so began more wit man hath better able will be at time to torment so do premise at outset of argument declare that to blame man for exercise of talent doth posse be downright impiety to wound by pungency of home thrust in conversation be a just liberty in ingenious man a use of sword in battle be to soldier mr sherwood upon replied that did allow public disputation appointed by meet judge to come under name of fair battle even in battle said generous combatant aim not so much at wounding adversary a to disarming of that who in

in theatre to take to see good play at moment when plot will wax most moving to say must be tired procure to send home in more weighty matter daughter marriage for instance to detect if wench hath set heart on one lover if so to keep from knowledge of gentleman address when hath accepted to let know first have sued for hand be dismissed here young gentlewoman did exclaim that master sherwood must by mean think of more skilful torment than must prove thought for instant then said must be finer more delicate torment to stir up in young gentlewoman mind suspicion of one loved so work on natural

in picture have drawn a to make seem likeness albeit most unjust toward one who though apt to boast of obedience to utter sundry trifling complaint be fond wife toward lady to dear husband that malice in mr tregony over above wonted spite be due to rejection of hand short time before marriage master sherwood seeing ungracious gentleman ill nature lady confusion stood up more speedily to reply so cut short will relate said yet more ingenious practice of tormenting must seem highest proof of skill in wife albeit also practised by husband only not so aptly peradventure so often be when one hath offered to notable insult affront so to turn table even a conjuror card doth handle straightway offended party will seem to be offender be obliged to sue forgiveness for wherein be hurt pray gentleman lady can anything more ingenious than practice be thought on did admit to be rare example of ability in tormenting objected be not solely exercised by wife husband friend lover sort of person might use then one gentleman called for special instance of art in lover said be natural instinct not art in such to torment one likewise own self proposed behavior of friend in respect a more new admirable theme ah quoth master martin with affected wave of hand first show instance of true friendship betwixt lady sincere affection betwixt gentleman then will be time for to describe art whereby do plague torment other mr sherwood answered french gentleman said short time since that must be piece of commendable prudence to live with friend a looking that must one day be enemy now be warranted by master

perhaps that one sight of have at bedford year before visage be very like figure mostly countenance different can not say wherein great differency did lie methinks one must have seen rather felt basil be tallest handsomest of twain will not be so great prodigal of time a to bestow on commendation of outward appearance whose inward excellence be chiefest merit howsoever be minded to set down in place somewhat touching appearance a may so happen that who read history who have known loved basil in old year must take a much pleasure in reading a do in writing description of person limning a be resemblance of at period in history wherein hitherto separate current of life mine do meet like noble river poor stream for to flow onward in same channel basil rookwood be of tall stature well

of stranger not for space of one page nay not with so much a one stroke of pen can dissemble love have dawn on day have noted be sudden in beginning yet steady in progress deepened widened with course of year even a rivulet doth start with lively force from source gathering strength a flow grows into broad noble river be ardent not idolatrous sudden a have said in rise not unconsidered be founded on high esteem on one side on other inexpressible tenderness kindness religion honor duty be cement of love blind dotage deathless bond of true sympathy making equal in be unequal for if vain world must have deemed that on one side there did appear greater brilliancy of part than showed in other who must judge of true merit sound wisdom must need have allowed that in true merit basil be a greatly superior whom honored with love a be pure diamond to showy setting encases hubert presented to brother who when heard name mentioned must not be contented till have got speech of straightway after first civility have passed between began to relate to that have be staying for few day before coming to town at mr roper house at richmond where have often visited in summer so befel that have left in chamber where slept of book on margin of be written such note a be wont to make whilst reading for so hubert have advised counsel in found very profitable for method teach one to reflect on what read to hold converse a be with author whose friendship company thus enjoys be source of contentment more sufficient lasting than most other pleasure in world basil chanced to inhabit room discovered on odd by shelf volume so disfigured a said so adorned took such delight in reading of mostly in poor reflection unknown pen have affixed to page that rested not until have learnt from mr roper name of writer when found be young girl have once seen at bedford marvelled at strong impulse have toward pressed venerable gentleman with so many question relating to that feared must have wearied inquiry met with such gracious answer that perceived mr roper to be a well pleased with theme of discourse a a glad to set forth excellence be ashamed to write word must indeed imply speaker to have be in dotage for excuse of too great kindness to unworthy creature a have to listen to here must need interrupt narrative to admire that one who be scholar yea great reader at time albeit endowed with excellent good sense needful information must by mean of book have be drawn to first thought of who be to enjoy love never be given to other creature pray doth not happen most often though be scarce to be credited dissemblance in certain matter doth attract in way of love more than resemblance that short men do choose tall wife lover of music woman who have ear to discern one tune from scholar witless housewife retired men ambitious helpmate gay lady grave husband must seem to be rule otherways exception notable instance of same find in first motion did incline basil to good opinion of poor self to return mistress sherwood basil mr roper did not wholly praise recited fault a well a virtue answered did very much content must have done so for then more credit must be given to word in wherein did commend since be so true friend a to note defect what quoth archly smiling if fault named be such a pleased a well a virtue then replied methinks sir fault must be rather in than in who doth commit for may be ignorant else subject to infirmity of temper to commend fault must be very dangerous error will hear fault a mr roper recited yea willingly answered mend also if can oh pray mend not cried at laughed said must be ashamed to give such wanton advice then mr roper declares have so much inability to conceal thought that albeit lip must be forcibly closed eye must speak so clearly that one who listed must read methinks said willing to excuse like lawyer in gospel must not be fault who made not mine own eye then also say that have so sharp apprehension of wrong done to others that if hear of injustice committed cruel treatment of one be so moved troubled that have known on such occasion to shed tear flow with like ease for own grief do cry mercy to

if have sinned therein concerning mine own grief have be few a yet so 't be little praise deserve for not overmuch resentment in instance wherein if others be afflicted have much ado to restrain wrath ah said methinks if answer in so true grave manner rude catechizing mistress sherwood be not bold enough to continue inventory of fault pray do answered for felt in soul unusual liking for conversation more so when leaving off jesting said last fault mr roper did charge with be lack of prudence in matter wherein prudence be most needed in day ala exclaimed for also do cry mercy indeed master rookwood there be in day so much cowardice time serving style prudence that methinks might sometimes happen that right boldness must be called rashness raising eye to thought saw clouded by misty dew replied yea mistress constance if be so have sooner that such a have friendship for must have to cry mercy on death bed for too much rashness in stemming tide than for too much ease in yielding to now added will repeat what mr roper related of virtue answered smiling for if fault doth charge with be so much smaller than reality what hope have that must speak truth in regard to poor

since have met of most weighty knew somewhat nothing of last haunting fear have lest dear basil must be in london very night engaged in perilous attempt to carry off mr watson when told of started exclaimed god defend quickly corrected cried god mercy that first feeling must have led to think rather of basil safety than of fine spirit showed in instance where good action have to be done service rendered to in affliction indeed mr roper said a led back to house into solitary parlor where uncle now seldom came remained sitting alone in library chiefly engaged in praying reading do condemn mine own weakness in pray god to give strength for what may come upon do promise be easy matter to carry always so high heart that will not sink with human fear grief in such passage a dear good man answered god knoweth 't be easy matter to attain to courage speak of have seen sweetest lovingest most brave creature ever did breathe give mark of extraordinary sorrow when father that generous martyr of christ be to die pray tell answered what behavior be like in trial for to converse on such theme doth allay somewhat torment of suspense may learn lesson from example who say joined to natural weakness so courageous spirit in like strait upon willing to divert yet not violently change current of thought spake a followeth on day when sir thomas more came from westminster to tower ward wife desirous to see father whom thought must never see in world after also to have final blessing gave attendance about wharf where knew must pas before must enter into tower a soon a saw after blessing upon knee reverently received hastening toward without care consideration of herself passing in amongst throng company of guard ran to took about neck kissed who well liking most natural dear daughterly affection toward gave fatherly blessing godly word of comfort beside from whom after be departed not satisfied with former sight of like one have forgotten being ravished with entire love of father suddenly turned back again ran to a before took about neck diver time kissed lovingly till at last with full heavy heart be fain to depart from beholding thereof be to many be present so lamentable mostly so to that for very sorrow must not forbear to weep with wife of john harris sir thomas secretary be moved to such transport of grief that suddenly flew to neck kissed a have reclined head on daughter shoulder who in midst of greatest strait have ever merry manner of speaking cried 'this be kind albeit rather unpolitely done ' day suffered asked what be good daughter behavior went quoth to different church distributed abundant alms to poor when have given money away withdrew to pray in certain church where on sudden did remember have linen in to wrap up father

time a father half kind of melancholy half smiling look came into good old man face a answered father be sir thomas more so worthy of daughter passionate love affection betwixt so entire absolute compounded of filial love on part unmitigated reverence unrestrained confidence that there be left in heart great space for wifely doating to be moderately affectioned by such woman to stand next in esteem to incomparable father be of greater honor worth to unworthy husband than must have be undivided yea idolatrous love of one not so perfect a herself after pause during thought ween reverted to past mine investigated mine own soul said to mr roper think sir that love to be idolatrous be indeed so absolute that must be difficulty to die for who doth inspire must prefer prison in company howsoever dark loathsome yea consider very paradise to beautifullest palace in world without must seem nothing vile dungeon must with good will suffer torment in world for to see object of affection enjoy good men esteem on earth noble place in heaven must be nevertheless founded so wholly built up on high estimate of virtue on quality holdeth of god servant on likeness of christ stamped on soul day exemplified in manner of living albeit to lose love company in world must be like uprooting of happiness turning brightness of noonday to darkness of night must thousand time rather endure mishap than that least shade approach of stain must alter unsullied opinion till then held of perfection mr roper smiled said be too weighty question to answer at once for must be loth to condemn yet altogether to absolve from degree of overweeningness such affection a described did seem indeed to savor somewhat of excess yet if noble in us held in subjection to higher claim of creator whose perfection creature doth at best only imperfectly mirror might be commendable mean of attaining to like virtue doated on in a did utter word servant came into parlor whispered in mine ear master basil rookwood be outside door craves suffered not to finish speech bounded into hall where basil be indeed standing with traveller cloak on slouched hat over face after greeting a may be conceived ala greeting then did seem to combine strange admixture of joy pain led into parlor where mr roper in turn received with fatherly word of kindness mixed with amazement at return whence exclaimed so sudden coming good basil verily do appear to have descended from sky basil looked at replied heard in paris mr roper that gentleman in whom do take very lively interest one mr tunstall be in prison at london bethought must be of service to by coming over at time o basil cried do then know be father yea joyfully answered be right glad do know also for then there be occasion for feigning albeit deny not to be sometimes useful necessary doth so ill agree with bluntness that keepeth in constant fear of stumbling in speech be in manner forced to come over secretly because if sir henry stafford who willeth to remain abroad till have got out of wardship must hear of being in london gain scent of object of coming must have dealt in sort of way to send out of prithee dearest love be mr ward in house ala said be gone hence mind be set on very dangerous enterprise know saith at word heart began to sink verily see not much danger to be in methinks if do succeed in carrying off good father that other priest to night in ingenious manner hath devised will be best night work done by good head good arm good oar can be thought of oh then exclaimed be even a feared basil have engaged in rash enterprise

involve others in peril of theirs oh how confirmed must be in purpose if knew who be who doth throw into so great risk faith can not will not suffer exclaimed impetuously for sudden joy of presence sight of beloved countenance lighted up with inexpressible look of love kindness more beautiful than poor word can describe worked in rebellion against thought of more suffering further parting greater fear than have hitherto sustained said must wish father have be otherwise disposed for to have aided in escape must have be to greatest joy must think of that having promised likewise to assist in mr watson flight must never fail to do so if be to die for 't be very easy cried to speak of dying basil do doubt that to one of courage faith doing of must have nothing very terrible in pray remember that life make so little account of be not now yours alone to dispose of a list mine dear basil be wrapped up with for if lose care not to live what becomes of more mr roper said must think on well before made venture for a have truly urged have right over now must not dispose of a one wholly free might do dear sir in answer sweet constance also might perhaps have prevailed with

where shade made too dark for grass to grow only moss yielded soil carpet for foot sat down on shelving slope of broken stone exclaimed oh basil methinks will be too happy in fair place do tax

air most of to forego native liberty feeding return to servitude diet what lesson do read to when wanton will thought take heed of reason conscience voice luring back to duty perch when have stood brief time watching for mallard basil perceived one whistled off falcon flew from a if must never have turned head again yet upon shout came in then by degree little by little flying about about mounted so high a if have made moon place of flight presently came down like stone at sound of lure waxed very eager in noticing of hap be well content to be eye witness of sport methought must be very pleasant thing to be basil companion in wear dainty glove gentle tasel on fist must never cast off at bidding when let fly must return at call thought minded of faithful love never diverted from resting place save by heavenward aspiration alternating betwixt earthly duty ghostly soaring oh what tragedy be enacted in air when basil having detected by little white feather in tail cock in brake cast off tasel gentle who never ceased circular motion till have recovered place then suddenly upon flushing of cock came down missing of in down come lo what working there be on side cock mounting a if must have pierced sky hawk flying contrary way until have made wind friend what speed cock made to save what hasty pursuit hawk made of fugitive after long flying killing of alack in killing of killing ah fatal ending to fatal strife exclaimed known voice close unto mine ear melodious one albeit now harsh to hearing mine eye be dazzled with gazing upward confusedly discerned two gentleman standing near one of knew to be hubert gave hand then basil turning round beholding companion came up to with joyful greeting oh sir henry exclaimed be truly glad to see hubert what welcome surprise be then introduced to sir henry jemingham for be who bowing in courteous fashion addressed to such compliment a gentleman be wont to pay to lady at outset of acquaintanceship visitor have left horse few pace off then sir henry explained that hubert have be abiding with at seat for few day certain law business in basil be concerned a well a brother also a having be for one year guardian did necessitate meeting wherein matter must be brought to close so quoth then master basil proposed must invade solitude in place of withdrawing from methought of two evil must be least seeing what attraction do detain at euston at time foolishly dared not look at hubert when sir henry made speech basil with hearty cheer thanked for obliging conduct great honor did for to visit in amicable manner then craved permission for to accompany to lady tregony house trusting said to hubert to conduct to euston to perform there hospitable duty during short time must be absent nay nay quoth sir henry with license master basil will ride with lady to banham hall methinks seeing be such near neighbor mistress sherwood lacketh not opportunity to enjoy company that must not deprive of pleasure of short conversation with whilst hubert entertain yourselves for nonce in best way can basil smiled said contented very much that sir henry must enjoy conversation hoped in future must make amends to friend for own deficiency so mounted horse sir henry rode alongside of basil hubert behind for only two must hold abreast in narrow lane led to fakenham chill have fallen on heart since hubert arrival can only liken to sudden overcasting of bright sun shiny day by dark cold cloud at first sir henry entered into discourse with touching hawking talked of in merry fashion drawing many similitude betwixt falconer lover said be likest people in world for pray said be not hawk to one what mistress be to other object of care admiration labor be indeed idol to consecrates amorous ditty court one in peculiar dialect oh believe mistress sherwood that lady may style fortunate in love who will meet with so much thought affection solicitude from lover husband a bird do from good ostringen then

arundel also at house in norwich doth much grieve to hear answered then wherefore mistress sherwood because said lord arundel hath already greatly impaired fortune spent larger sum than can be thought of in like prodigal courtly expense also lost good part of land grandfather lady lumley must have bequeathed to if have not turned spendthrift so greatly displeased if be so quoth again wherefore doth young nobleman imprudence displeasure mistress sherwood answered by reason of pain folly do cause to sweet lady for many year hath be more of friend to poor self than unequal rank if possible still more unequal merit must warrant then marvel not replied sir henry at resentment of husband folly for by have ever seen heard of lady doth show to be pattern of wife model of high born lady be said that albeit so young there doth exist in so much merit dignity that nobleman confess that when come into presence dare not swear a at other time be wont to do before best of kingdom have heard be verily inclined to believe that be much changed in disposition toward lady though pride may be shame at ill usage of fear that must seem that now favor with queen doth visibly decline must turn to whom when fortune smiled upon did keep aloof from seeking only when cloud gather round do hinder from showing new inclination how much must err exclaimed wrong noble wife if misdoubted heart in such case methinks most woman must be ready to forgive one loved when misfortune threatened beyond others who never at time allowed jealousy natural resentment to draw away love from to whom hath vowed be
