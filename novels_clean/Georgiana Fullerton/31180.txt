reading expression of despair contrasted so strikingly with joy peace have be filling own heart there be also something indicated kind of reckless helplessness in fact of leaving confession of mental agony to be scanned perhaps by indifferent eye must have be done in one of moment when tortured heart must break if did not in mode other give vent to anguish mr lacy after minute consideration took out of pocket pencil bit of paper transcribed upon line have found then carefully effaced from pillar on have be written a slowly walked out of cathedral towards mr denley house revolved in mind mean

false strength lure to exertion only serving to accelerate fearful termination a mr lacy mounted pulpit breathed ardent prayer that something in word be going to utter might carry token of peace to poor creature breast ray of light to mind in course of sermon introduced following sentence when heart of man be breaking brain be reeling to whom must turn to who said 'come unto ye that labour be heavy laden will give rest ' when soul of man be shaken feel forsaken to whom must turn to who once cried out upon cross god god why hast thou forsaken ' when phantom form of horror shapeless dream of

speaking at same time voice be quite hoarse with anger overheard word tell that if command behave a desire will never see again put foot into house tremendous oath followed threat then voice subsided looked at alice seemed concerned not surprised agitated at what be going on down stair merely closed door of room have be left open moment however henry came way up stair calling to said that be late that have better be setting out again complied in coming down into room below be civilly greeted by mr tracy who thanked for visit muttered something about hoping must soon meet again have not be for alice who have interested charmed to extraordinary degree must have formed exactly contrary wish for have never more heartily agreed with opinion than with henry have pronounced about former nurse civility be to mind more repulsive still than ungraciousness took leave of coldly enough earnestly pressing alice hand a mounted horse whispered in ear alice like poem better than mine rode off took different road from that have come by skirted edge of small lake lie on eastern side of bridman wood day be altered dark cloud be beginning to gather over sky wind be whistling among bare branch henry

with person of mr tracy age inferior rank in life temper be generally good manner peculiarly gentlemanlike conduct therefore however provoking might have be appeared to unaccountable must not help wondering also that must have associated on evidently intimate term with lovely alice yet have never mentioned to of even in casual conversation there have not be word however look of of hers must for

very pretty have kind of cleverness too there be something tame insipid about notwithstanding in fact understand how must serpent understand dove muttered to myself then heart smote for unkind thought of henry felt guilty of ingratitude nay more of hypocrisy in thinking evil of one whose society so much valued who certainly devoted to with common assiduity never must exactly explain to myself what feeling be with regard to at time a said before must have be severe trial to have left elmsley even for short time hour after hour spent in conversation with hardly aware of lapse of time so great be fascination that powerful original withal cultivated understanding exercised over yet at same time involuntary feeling of mistrust unaccountable shudder of repugnance now then shot over a listened to

a from wish to give pleasure be at time sufficient inducement to wrote to grand mother to request that if did not feel inclined to come to elmsley must at least allow alice to come spend day with mr tracy wrote brief answer to purport that alice be gone away on visit to relation of father be therefore out of reach of honour intended uncle received now then letter from edward middleton never communicated content beyond mere fact that be well be staying in town on continent henry still remained at elmsley nothing be changed in state of thing between only new feature in domestic affair be growing dislike uncle seemed to feel towards have never appeared much to like now seemed hardly able to endure protracted residence at elmsley often inquired of aunt if henry did not mean soon to begin study of law be profession be destined to pursue a to henry never alluded to seemed to look upon elmsley a permanent home uncle be too much attached to wife by nature of too kind disposition to mark more plainly than by occasional hint displeasure at line of conduct must hardly conceal satisfaction when at last letter from father obliged henry to take subject into consideration became arranged that must leave elmsley in three week be surprised even mortified at observing how little seemed grieved annoyed at rather abrupt separation with what indifference of manner took leave of on day of departure few day afterwards there arrived letter from mr brandon sister of mother of mr middleton containing urgent request might be allowed to spend few week with in dorsetshire have only seen aunt of mine once twice during course of childhood have left no other impression on mind than be short pretty looking woman with large dark eye peculiarly gentle voice have dreaded so much void

fatal secret must perhaps shake off in degree sense of oppression that weighed upon be only seventeen prematurely miserable a be become still there remained something in of spirit of youth pant after new scene new companion new excitement therefore expressed strong wish to accept mr brandon invitation be a usual enough to secure mr middleton acquiescence uncle made objection to plan accordingly on one of first day of month of june in small open carriage accompanied by lady who have once be governess who have undertaken to escort to brandon park left elmsley in tear indeed for a aunt pressed to

compensation for silence be doubt genuine traveller for must have be genuine in character assumed though fear that notion of happiness of not talking of looking about must have fallen short of german countess ideal of traveller bliss after journey of about eighty mile at five o'clock in evening reached town of salisbury where be to sleep night ordered dinner at inn then walked to cathedral have never seen one before when came in sight of tower then of whole of beautiful structure tear rushed into eye stood entranced in contemplation before hand involuntarily clasped a in prayer longed to fall on knee adore there god who have given to man heart to desire to mind to conceive to hand power of raising such shrine for worship salisbury cathedral stand in middle of close where evergreen shrub of kind rise from smooth green grass grows quite up to foot of wall door be closed while sent to procure key from sexton walked slowly round exterior of cathedral paused for minute in spot where in recess formed by angle of building stood with nothing round beautiful gothic wall nothing above blue sky seemed spot fitted for holy meditation for heavenly aspiration be spot might have be selected when saviour visible presence be withdrawn by mary who chose good part be never to be taken from might have be resort of hannah who departed not from temple served lord with fasting with prayer day night might have be chosen retreat of one who amidst blessing of life day by day made preparation for hour of death vision of life of course of sacred duty of holy affection of usefulness in life of resignation in death of humility in time of weal of peace in time of woe such vision passed before eye even then lip murmured let die death of righteous let latter end be like sexton arrived with key entering by great portal door wandered for nearly hour through aisle lingered in choir in chapel though there be scarcely light to do more than just to trace outline of mass of column rise in severe simplicity arch above one head at height in dimness of twilight be scarcely discernible after having visited cloister be so beguiled by beauty a to forget dinner be to be on table at six o'clock that be now verging on half hour past hurried back to inn just a first set of mutton chop be coming up stair have just time to close mr hatton mouth with kiss a be beginning to assure in answer to apology that there be nothing in world liked so much a waiting for dinner weather have grown close warm be glad immediately after have finished eating to have table cleared to draw chair to open bow window commanded view down street at moment bore peculiarly dull dusty appearance street in provincial town be apt to present on summer evening two three child be playing at marble before one door screaming at other in particular key game of description call into exercise now then small cart drove by few people on foot occasionally walked past window cloud be gathering rapidly over sky air be becoming instant more sultry oppressive heavy drop of rain began to fall one by one in large round spot on dusty pavement red darkgreen umbrella began to be unfolded cart to drive by more briskly marble player to withdraw into house after sundry vociferation from neighbouring window whole scene fairly assumed hopeless character of rainy summer evening meantime two men have stationed under

for ere chap will tell ye lad have one chance here speaker voice sunk into whisper did not catch word two men soon took reconnoitring glance at weather after looking up street down street up at sky where nothing be visible thick mass of gray cloud seemed to awake to thorough hopelessness of case walked off muttering imprecation on weather remained by window absorbed in thought till mr hatton apprised that tea be come there be indeed matter for thought in few word men have uttered thought suggested be perplexing in extreme be of alice tracy have spoken for have twice distinctly heard grandmother name pronounced be in salisbury at very moment appeared two rough somewhat discreditable men be acquainted with gentleman to use own expression be after youngest man of two have expressed

than of world of ours be devotion to what be alluded to in conversation have overheard who be person whose death seemed to expect be lost in maze of doubt conjecture among most distressing be one presented to mind idea of alice becoming victim to infamous pursuit of henry lovell again what must mean by gentleman whoever be being in mr tracy clutch vainly racked brain to form conjecture must account for different part of short conversation poor mr hatton must have thought apt to be silent not only in carriage out of one too if judged by taciturnity on occasion when waiter came in to fetch tea thing away asked if knew of person living in salisbury bearing name of tracy did not know of such said must inquire if wished a be going out of room turned back holding handle of door with one hand passing other through bushy head of hair added suppose be quality be asking for ma'be person of name do know there be old miss tracy ma'be life in next street here be sister to grocer died two

to find out if possible if be alice whether be still in salisbury felt ashamed of questioning on during pause ensued informant gave one more general polishing to table pushed one two chair out of place poked fire did not want poking with side bow left room curiosity be so strongly excited must not refrain from asking mr hatton if knew anything of mr tracy who in old time have be aunt maid have never seen must give information on subject be to start next morning at nine o'clock resolved to make effort to satisfy a to state of case by calling at miss tracy door before setting off at eight o'clock accordingly having ascertained from friend waiter name of street number of house set out a approached heart beat with strange mixture of shyness anxiety curiosity pulled bell be almost tempted to run away when heard one walking heavily to door to open opened however before have made up mind to bolt asked slip shod red faced girl who appeared whether miss tracy lived there yes doe be answer what be will miss be miss alice tracy staying with yes be be at home aint be in church grandmother at home did not feel courage enough to renew acquaintance with mr tracy whose reception of at bridman

compensation for in delicious hedge in hawthorn stood out in sturdy independence from among intricacy of shrub bramble imprisoned stem while scattered snowy blossom on shining leaf green patch of grass beneath in frail daring eglantine twined weak tendril round withered trunk of hollow worn out oak in wild clematis feathery traveller joy a child love to call flung fairy flower in reckless profusion over tangled mass from whence sprung there be enough in hedge to make up for loss of view have view too when for moment gate stile gap in hedge opened to glimpse of such wood dell a read of

done little to improve beauty house stand a if by chance in midst of wilderness of downy hill grassy valley of hawthorn grove wild common of remnant of forest mile of underwood be so engrossed by strange character of to perfectly novel scenery thought little of anything else a drove up to house when on reaching entrance door servant rushed to let down step seize upon luggage felt taken by surprise rousing took affectionate leave of mr hatton who be proceeding to own home in town of about ten mile beyond brandon did not part without promising that if must possible contrive must visit there before left dorsetshire chapter v ever anon of grief subdued there come token like scorpion sting scarce seen with fresh bitterness imbued slight withal may be thing bring back on heart weight must fling aside for ever lord byron on inquiry found that aunt be out a be not acquainted with single person staying in house begged to be shown at once to room instead of going into library where be told of company be to be found housekeeper led way up stair having established in large very comfortable room left to myself sat down in arm chair except occupation if can be so called of watching maid while unpacked different part of evening dress spent next hour in complete idleness at end of time rolling of wheel clatter of horse foot drew to window be pleased to have opportunity of inspecting part of society be so soon to be introduced to first there stopped at hall door pony chaise from mr brandon woman got out behind sat elderly man tall dark not mr brandon though a far a recollected like behind came galloping up to step riding party two woman three four men among be henry lovell who be certainly about last person must have expected to meet looked in high spirit heard calling out to somebody in house be come two three minute afterwards mr brandon came into room together kissed most affectionately keeping hand in hers diminishing at same time beautiful eye into sharpest most caressante expression know english word express look mean fixed on mine said be so much obliged to henry to for coming dearest ellen ought to thank first for taught to wish to know to love be not hard lesson added in sweetest tone of voice imaginable tried to smile look pleased be out of sort though must hardly tell exactly why if have heard at elmsley be to have met henry at brandon must have probably be glad somehow short journey have put into different state of mind have be more free from painful thought immediately connected with at least than at time for good while past have felt unconscious relief in seeing new face hearing new voice longed to feel unwatched unnoticed then conversation have heard between two men at salisbury have left disagreeable impression upon mind although too vague to influence judgment then again why if mr brandon wish to see consequent invitation be result of praise have not talked to of why have not said must meet at house obliged ala a be myself by miserable fate to practise constant dissimulation still hated strangely in others felt aware that answered mr brandon ungraciously greeted henry coldly a usual be perfectly self possessed soon withdrew leaving alone with mr brandon do let sit down here together dearest ellen said drawing to couch a spoke do so long to be well acquainted with feel to know so well about will be great friend soon be sure again squeezed hand looked into eye with pretty over confidential look in hers talked about uncle aunt on said be not dear mr middleton little angry with for seducing away from elmsley fancy be in secret be not be much pleased at kindness in wishing to see answered quite puzzled a to what secret alluded to must be now dear ellen continued must treat quite like sister like friend not a old aunt will be affronted very jealous of mr middleton must speak to quite openly be so very kind said while time thought what on earth be at idea of being jealous of affection for mr middleton struck a perfectly ridiculous very fact of being requested to speak openly effectually inclined to shut up in additional amount of reserve tried however to be amiable warm after little more conversation mr brandon left to go dress for dinner few minute after bell have rung went down to library found nearly everybody assembled went through number of introduction woman made acquaintance with be lady wyndham mr ernsley miss moore two miss farnleys men be standing together in middle of room except mr brandon who immediately came to made number of civil speech none of approached before dinner be announced sir charles wyndham then took in just a be sitting down mr brandon called to mr ernsley who be preparing to place in chair on other side of dear mr ernsley wo come sit by do so long to hear what think of meldon hall be told went to see to day a obeyed direction henry lovell slipped into chair by side accounted to for look of intelligence mr brandon directed to part of table to perhaps responded to certainly did not be not sorry however to have opportunity of speaking to a felt curious to know how must account for sudden change of plan wished also to find out if have be at salisbury during last few day immediately said to be surprised at seeing here a much replied a to find that be to be indebted for being invited here at if be so must affront must not be particularly flattering must think more flattering must that woman who have only seen once that seven year ago must wish to see again than here spoke in lowest possible whisper after such day such month a spent at elmsley must have strained nerve not to lose sight of then have be scheme of forming hate scheming be in london detested came here wish to god have not added with more of passion than of tenderness in voice for coming be evidently disagreeable to can not brook coldness of manner continued in still increasing tone of agitation put beside ellen make fool of be of thing what most dislike to be made what be most dislike to be made mr lovell inquired sir charles wyndham who have be restless fidgetty till must catch at something in conversation must enable to join in fool sir charles answered henry with expression of countenance certainly did not bear in consciousness of own folly lady make fool of said sir charles with bow to unless find ready made heard henry mutter while be obliged to turn round listen to string of compliment flow of small talk from right hand neighbour seemed a if nothing must stop lucky accident sudden overthrow of regular course of thing so steady even be tenor of gentle prolixity have eye mildness of be appalling smile of despairing sweetness a looked at wished have never happened to to wish before in looking at anybody face that have be very ugly ugly face must have be so hopelessly tiresome if for moment must have looked cross ill natured must have be making of rather of for then must have have courage to cut discourse short turn away a be dinner be nearly over before have opportunity of speaking to henry who at last brought about event have pined for by overturning pyramid of red white cherry went rolling over table in different direction for moment engrossed sir charles benevolent exertion henry immediately seized on favourable moment resumed conversation though in altered tone fact be dear ellen that on arrival in london found solicitor out of town father gone on visit to friend of in hertfordshire have general invitation to place struck be wrong perhaps that might be a well a gratification to myself comfort to among set of stranger to find friend suppose may call one said in such gentle earnest manner in fact thought have be kind one felt quite ashamed of in reaction of moment turned to with emotion said be very kind to henry grief to think must have appeared to ungracious ungrateful even only little capricious answered must prize a much that bright smile of yours ellen if transient cloud have not made brightness still dearer at moment mr brandon gave signal for withdrawal henry whispered to a be looking for glove under table now have explained being here at expense of fearful havoc among mr brandon cherry will be at leisure when come to drawing room to give opinion of society here pray make up mind about anybody till come left dining room in better humour than when went in sat down with two miss farnleys at round table covered with annual album entered into conversation got on a phrase be very well be nice looking girl eldest be handsome be not difficult to comply with henry request must not make up mind about one till have given opinion for whole quarter of hour have not elapsed before made appearance in drawing room instantly came sat down on couch by lady wyndham at moment begged eldest miss farnley to come give advice about pattern stitch that be employed upon youngest went to open window to speak to mr brandon to mr ernsley who be walking up down gravel walk near house how do like aunt ellen call aunt be name sacred to can not call one sister aunt well mr brandon then how do like thought be not to make up mind about one without assistance true did not include be old friend of mine might be partial there must be harm in biassing in favour ought to like be afraid said henry in tone of so much annoyance mortification that looked at with surprise will like added when know when did see so much of if be such friend of yours why did never talk to of did not answer immediately went on be very mysterious about acquaintance for instance know how delighted be with alice tracy be obliged to summon up courage to pronounce name how often doe one feel that there be subject become forbidden one between people with whom in general there exists reserve by strange instinct one can not touch upon without emotion though nothing reasonable can be alleged to account for started countenance instantaneously clouded over went on with kind of cowardly courage yet dare say have seen heard something about since visit to bridman manor have never told have not seen where be now persisted feeling that if let subject drop must require afresh effort to resume again know be likely to be staying at salisbury at salisbury yes there be people of name living there called at house early morning asked for alice be out if knew that be staying on there nothing must be easier than to go pay visit one morning from hence must like of thing ellen said henry can not go on seeing alice have anything to do with of family be quite child childishly headstrong well know really must insist upon exactly see right that have to insist upon doing not doing anything at least give good reason for dictation be people with whom can not with propriety associate at age can be judge of such thing be aunt who sent to in first instance consequently can know nothing against mr tracy a to alice can not mean that unless stopped short heart be beating violently felt that modesty propriety dignity forbade hinting at suspicion be rushing again on mind with fresh force a looked at henry felt that cheek be burning eye flashing said a if have not remarked agitation else that have calmed alice character be perfectly good in visiting must be liable to fall in with person whom must be in way unpleasant to be thrown amongst remembered two men at salisbury felt might be true there be something so plain indifferent too in manner of doing justice to alice that removed suspicion when said well now for heaven sake let leave off talking on subject on seems be always destined to quarrel smiled made effort to pursue farther listened to account of society at brandon lady wyndham said be a can see in look very reverse of husband quite guiltless of insipid comeliness have never found out anything beyond for be a stern a silent a be communicative perhaps on system of compensation from strict sense of justice to society miss farnleys said have just made acquaintance be quite disposed to

something very apt to make one feel nervous in fact of being sent for if happens to be immediately after arrival of post more so walked up stair in consequence with kind of feeling that something have happened be going to happen so that when opened door saw at one glance aunt be much agitated in tear felt frightened what have happened exclaimed what be who be ill nobody nothing of kind replied be

having made secret marriage never presented to mind perhaps might yet turn out well might grow to love to prize must stand between like angel of peace must not admire faultless beauty of face poetical

happy at least contented answered that have always be difficult to make out state of mind from what wrote now more so than ever then must abruptly change subject intense curiosity still more intense anxiety to hear about seemed to give idea that though pride have be wounded still cared for indeed so much of future peace of mind turned upon direction feeling must take that manner be probably well

mr middleton mr lovell have be captivated touched by beauty simplicity sweetness of alice face manner seemed instinctively to feel that there be something holy about something that forbade one to doubt distrust have appearance be even twenty time more against than be be now still more indignant with henry for coldness indifference with seemed to regard than have previously be at marriage admired alice from bottom of soul be to very type of purity ideal of perfection did not seek much obliged to see henry often at home shrank from going to house life be so full of holy duty tone of mind character of conversation breathed spirit of such earnest faith of such religious peace that after awhile troubled spirit chafed in presence of what formed such contrast to own restless waywardness when bewildered with passion when lost in maze of sin error may feel repose for instant in prostrating at foot of cross may wander into church for moment cool burning forehead against cold marble deep silence of sanctuary soon grows oppressive there be tone in voice fain must shun for asks what secret soul have done from reveller by mr hemans thus be with with respect to alice other cause also contributed to same effect henry be often in brookstreet seldom came discouraged frequent intercourse between threw impediment in way effectually checked else never occurred to alice to interrupt uniform course of daily employment pursuit in order to accommodate to totally different mode of life have begun going out great deal in society mr middleton proposed to henry that alice must do so too offered to take with wherever went declined offer in most positive manner when sister almost indignantly pressed to explain refusal said that alice have peculiar notion on subject did not wish to thwart must persuade out of notion persisted mr middleton for surely be great pity for for herself that must remain stranger to friend acquaintance while associate with a much a before marriage may be pity mary be impatient answer be inevitable only torment by urging on subject mr middleton who be not easily put down after vainly remonstrating with upon entered on question with

mr middleton feel kindness urge on subject must give more pain than pleasure do more harm than good rose suddenly went to table took from bunch of violet gave when sat down again face be a calm a usual on way home mr middleton seemed absorbed in thought manner to henry whom found waiting for in brook street be unusually cold whenever went into society met still contrived never to lose sight of by look by word quickly uttered by sudden change of tone manner to convey to knowledge of secret feeling tone of feeling mode of conversation varied from day to day sometimes be moody almost savage in

talked nonsense to everybody must not call to account for what may have said done be afraid not answered coldly taking up newspaper sat down again at table remained standing where have left with eye fixed upon vainly endeavouring to find out mean of appeasing nothing openness frankness must reinstate in favour how must be open frank what must tell must justify intimacy with henry account for agitation word have caused nothing nothing short of truth that oh how wearied be with eternal combat with with everlasting question so often asked so often answered by own mind absolutely shrunk from

stayed there till twelve o'clock last night whispered to there be emotion in voice in little close room with dying woman while be at ball thought to myself taking alice hand kissed with feeling like remorse though god know have not wronged in word in thought after few minute during made few languid attempt at conversation head sunk back on pillow of couch fell asleep hand be joined together supported cheek transparent paleness of complexion made delicately chiselled feature appear a if be carved out of purest marble in attitude of perfect repose looked more beautiful than have ever yet seen henry sat silently for time by side of couch when regular breathing divided lip showed that have fallen into deep slumber got up partly closed shutter then opening door of back sitting room beckoned to to follow did so putting on bonnet shawl at same time prepared to go away immediately on said to in low voice now ellen for once can speak to alone without interruption must listen to answered in same tone with most determined accent tyranny be intolerable can not submit to if a have often hinted to have power will to make miserable to destroy small remnant of happiness can ever enjoy do so be at mercy at mercy exclaimed at mercy ellen time be come when everything must be revealed to when there must be secret between implore be that will hear be of utmost importance to even more than for that must do so saw by manner yesterday by edward middleton also subject of such vital importance a have to discus together can not be carried on in common conversation without conveying impression might be injurious to reputation can not imagine how much idea have tormented peace of mind reputation ellen be dearer to than life such love a mine can not be selfish henry henry very word belie be indeed fallen low in eye since husband of dare to speak of love to not of such love a mine think ellen can not believe that be wretch a here in own house with wife ill in next room to speak to of love with object that of proving to that to uttermost of power will guard from evil hang over head be calm ellen be reasonable implore continued a wrung hand then clasped in attitude of despair alice did not close eye last night after undergoing great fatigue be now fallen asleep will probably slumber on for hour may never have such opportunity of speaking without restraint interruption nothing can seem more natural than that must remain here be ready to comfort amuse when doe wake deceit deceit everlasting deceit exclaimed a sunk down on chair have placed for near window how soul loathes how hate despise will not be comfort to ellen to open heart to have not be friend to see how guarded be how careful to choose word can shock offend show confidence show kindness can obtain from effort that man can make sacrifice woman can require from one whose whole soul be bound up in whose existence one long dream of be not what meant to say exclaimed abruptly getting up walked up down room passed hand over eye then sitting down again said have better begin by giving account of circumstance of life will explain difficulty have be entangled in suffering have endured aggravated by remorse by consciousness have brought on have suffered in way henry oh then speak on for will understand will feel for though one else in world must know ellen be persuaded of circumstance have raised barrier between ought never to have existed there must always be bond of sympathy in feeling nothing ever can will annihilate do remember that when left college went to elmsley spent three four week there yes do be then that edward began to treat a grown up woman that took long walk in country first made feel intimate with both be resumed day be last that ever spent free from care anxiety sometimes look back to live over again in thought till long to blot out from life memory have intervened between time one be not more impossible than other added with sigh for moment leant face on hand remained silent well resumed after pause left elmsley went to london there immediately plunged into wildest dissipation led life detail of be ashamed to describe in speaking to with income scarcely sufficient to enable to live a gentleman indulged in specie of extravagance lavish expenditure above passion for gambling be at time such that seemed to a if life be not worth having without mean of gratifying for week lived in state of continual fever night be turned into day during few hour of sleep not of repose gave strength to return to gaming table rattling of dice shuffling of card haunted in dream with alternation of exultation despair a vivid though not a distinct a in waking hour at first old history of such case won immensely encouraged to play higher higher stake when tide of fortune turned involved almost before be conscious of in debt of honour far exceeding in amount what must even contemplate ever having power to discharge still played on gleam of success now then giving feverish hope might regain at least part of what have lost played on till case grew so desperate that dared longer look in face lived under sort of perpetual nightmare a long a have money left

future day when day arrived found unable to meet engagement be induced to give bill to creditor for other distant day again day came again found insolvent will not need not go through miserable detail of difficulty in be entangled of humiliating excuse have to make more humiliating threat reproach have to endure be enough to say that with desperate infatuation made solemn promise to creditor to satisfy on first day of ensuing month on fulfilment of promise depended whether character a gentleman be still preserved irretrievably lost ellen can not attempt to describe to what suffered at time wrestling with impossibility struggle after what be unattainable incapability of resigning to what seemed inevitable powerless rage smarting pride agonised self reproach be dreadful one to speak to turn to why in name of heaven why did not appeal to uncle why did not speak to edward middleton expression of sudden pain burning flush spread over henry countenance at question after moment hesitation said must tell though to tell give pang must almost atone for degree of guilt must know then that be at oxford acquired taste for gambling that there ran in measure same course of imprudence went through same suffering have just described to except that sum lost amounted to hundred instead of thousand edward at time observed that something weighed on spirit easily drew from confession of folly embarrassment after lecturing for day on subject brought draught for amount of what have lost have obtained for from mr middleton only on condition must give most solemn word of honour must never play again mr middleton letter be not only stern be also contemptuous have then be able to devise mode of extricating from difficulty must have refused money promise exacted from be vain to seek for such with feeling more wounded than grateful gave promise required how kept have seen now can understand must sooner have fled to america never shown face in england again than have turned to mr middleton for aid assistance to father must have be useless to apply have a know income what derives from navy pay office here henry paused drew long breath a if to gain courage to

devoted henry lovell letter dropt from hand a read last word tumultuous rush of feeling made heart throb with indefinable emotion in most sanguine moment have not perhaps anticipated so favourable answer hoped that henry must have exerted so earnestly in behalf yet felt more afraid of of power than ever a saw determination in manner other to link fate with mine to make conduct to to depend upon mine there be something fearful in condition in frail tenure under alone be to escape threatened vengeance of mr tracy there be something horribly humiliating in term however veiled in plausible language henry be evidently prescribing to a price of protection be never self deceiver saw clearly through willow pretence of better hope for future of kindness to alice of help to pursue better

mental accusation passed through mind felt harshness ingratitude a usual having begun by condemning ended by hating must not acknowledge that said of alice be touching true religiously resolved to undertake part pointed out to in spirit of expiation while in one sense gave weak unworthy support on other to cling to a to refuge shield from love from hatred made equally tremble self reproach have immediately followed harsh condemnation of henry at very moment when have made great sacrifice in behalf however incomplete generosity might have be brought on a usual reaction something of tenderness stole into heart at thought of so deep so unconquerable attachment a in henry there always seemed to to be two different nature one harsh selfish sneering heartless other tender almost a woman be tender gentle even to fault notwithstanding so often suffered from first must not help being at time strangely subdued touched by last letter too like appeared to have two fold character a considered

from that with be usually conscious of identity kind of feverish determination to be happy took possession of careless disregard of future sort of impassioned levity of reckless childishness walked up down room with restless excitement longed now to return to london to have marriage declared to be congratulated to be talked to to enter on new state of thing efface a much a possible from life from mind trace of past when next morning got up dressed threw open window looked upon bright summer sky saw edward standing on gravel walk before house heart beat with hurried pulse of joy that tumult of emotion drowns thought care a whirlpool suck in straw float near edward beckoned to to join received with smile of tenderness pushing back curl from face whispered dark eyed ellen word of love sunk into heart like rain of heaven on scorched burning sand of desert a gave utterance to long subdued deeply tried passion of soul prostrate in spirit before living in light of eye almost longing to die in presence by hand ere aught in earth in heaven must divide wilful terrified abstraction that made repulse thought connected with future cling with frantic intensity to happiness while lasted gave character difficult to describe edward in very height of love while carried out of by resistless influence must sometimes ask why there be peace in happiness repose in love why when hand held mine head be resting on shoulder sometimes murmured in tone of thrilling passionate emotion let die here ask not must then reply ask not why flower shut leaf beneath full blaze of sun ask not why wall of abbey church tremble a full peal of organ vibrates through aisle ask not why majesty of starry night make weep why intensity of bliss make shudder love ellen edward must answer too love with power of

one object one end so varied impulse restless fluctuation of uneasy spirit tend to one result unlimited love boundless devotion to edward always seemed touched by expression of ardent affection responded to in tenderest kindest manner did not always efface from countenance something of perplexity regret inequality of spirit of temper raised in mind before left hampstead mr middleton told

common expression one have anything on one mind be worst possible plan of existence be equally difficult to shake off one self to conceal from others without aid of external excitement in manner henry talked on till reached elmsley late that evening edward returned have made excellent speech in order to prevent allusion to conduct in morning questioned about politics listened with apparent interest to explanation about diver party question detail relative to measure expected during next session during pause however said to in low voice have made inquiry about letter destroyed in so rash manner
