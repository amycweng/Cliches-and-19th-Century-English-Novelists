commandment must be made centre of life a have be done by others for though zaddik who gave life to helping neighbor enemy as lying under burden a enjoined in exodus xxiii be not unworthy of admiration indeed be own disciple desired thus to commemorate circumstance of first meeting with baal shem yet who made speciality never to tell smallest falsehood be led into greater sin for when fame be so bruited that reached even government officer suspecting jew of town of smuggling said must withdraw charge if saint must declare brother innocent whereupon prayed to god to save from dilemma by sending death lo when men came to fetch to law court found dead true follower of master must have be willing to testify for truth sake even against brother in humble judgment death be not deliverance punishment from on high have moreover saint practised humility master put a first of three cardinal virtue must not have deemed so fatal to tell lie once for who can doubt there be in more spiritual pride in own record than pure love of truth have practised second of three cardinal virtue cheerfulness must have known that god can redeem man even from sin of lying have practised third enkindlement must never have narrowed to one commandment that negative one not to lie for where there be living flame in heart spread to member service be own reward own joy said baal shem man must bend mind on not doing sin day must be too full of joyous service messianic age must be master taught when man did what be right just of mere natural impulse not even remembering that be doing right still le being uplifted on account for man be proud because walk sleep then must righteousness be incarnate in world devil finally defeated man must be able to make celestial union soul ascension many suffering did baal shem endure in year be with penury persecution be often portion how wife death wounded have already intimated be revival of sabbatian heresy by jacob frank caused severest perturbation frank who be by turn turk jew catholic played role of successor of zevi a messiah ordered follower to address a holy lord later paraded beautiful daughter eve a female godhead much of what grandfather have told of first pretender be repeated save a first have made alliance with mohammedan so second coquetted with christian hence public disputation fostered by christian in frankists did battle with talmudists being accredited victor exulted in seeing sacred book of rabbi confiscated when thousand copy of talmud be thrown into great pit at kammieniec burned by hangman baal shem shed tear joined in fast day for burning of torah for despite detestation of devil knot held that talmud represented oral law expressed continuous inspiration of leader of israel to rely on bible

sphere in heaven where soul remains shorter time than in sphere of merit there be none where abides longer than in sphere of love much also in troublous time did baal shem suffer from sympathy with suffering of poland in fratricidal war when cossack hung up together nobleman jew monk dog with inscription be equal although cossack later on turk who in guise of friend of poland turned southern province into desert rather helped than hindered cause of follower by diverting persecutor baal shem palpitated with pity for dog monk nobleman jew howsoever suffered serene cheerful faith on be dark shadow never ceased altogether to shine in face even on death bed three cardinal virtue be not absent for man must face angel of death more cheerfully anticipate more glowingly absorption into divine a for humility o vanity vanity be dying word even in hour of death thou darest approach with thy temptation 'bethink thee israel what grand funeral procession will be thine because thou hast be so wise good ' o vanity vanity beshrew thee now although be son in law be with in last hour be known of men that not rabbi baer be appointed by to be successor for although acquaintance with baal shem did not tend to increase admiration for chief disciple never expressed full mind on subject to master for have early enjoined on that obverse side of virtue of humility be to think highly of one fellow man who love father god will also love child inasmuch a abhorred profitless learning study for study sake doe not lead to infinite light did venture to ask why have allowed baer scholar to go about a lieutenant found community in name because said with beautiful simplicity saw that have sinned in making ignorance synonymous with virtue there be good men even among learned men whose heart be uncorrupted by brain baer be such one since have great repute among learned saw that learned who must not listen to simple man must listen to now before say aught else on point let saying of master serve to rebuke graceless follower who despise learned while have not even holiness who boast of ignorance a though guaranteed illumination a to rabbi baer will boldly say that must have be better for world baal shem teaching have be appointed to hand down for baer made of master living impulse code creed grew rigid dead organized follower by external sign noisy praying ablution white sabbath robe so forth so that spirit died symbol remained now of ten of thousand who call chassid pray prayer perform ceremony wear robe there be not ten have faintest notion of master teaching for spirit be volatile fly away symbol be solid be handed down religiously from generation to generation greatest abuse have come from doctrine of zaddik perhaps logic of baer be sound that if god a master taught be in thing then be there so much of in certain chosen men that be divine doubt that master be akin to divinity for though did not profess to perform miracle pretending that such healing a wrought be by virtue of knowledge of herb simple saying jestingly that angel of healing go with good physician ever admitting to that have done battle with demon magician save figuratively yet be there in strange power be not given to men of soothing redeeming by mere touch so laid upon brow a can personally testify hand must cure headache drive out ill humor will even believe that there be of divinity in rabbi baer whereas baal shem veiled divinity in manhood baer strove to veil manhood in divinity to eke out power by art policy better to influence men govern gain of gold for further operation yet lesson of history to be that if truth be not great enough to prevail alone will not prevail by aid of cunning for finally there will come men who will manifest cunning without truth so at least have be here first baal shem pure zaddik then rabbi baer worldly zaddik then host of zaddikim many of having only outward show of sainthood for since otherwise great sect be split up into thousand little sect boasting own zaddik superior to others only true intermediary between god man sole source of blessing fount of grace lodging in palace to make pilgrimage at festival a of yore to temple paying tribute of gold treasure be palpable that sorry saint have brought about division for greater glory profit weep more over spoliation of chassid because there be so much perverted goodness among so much self sacrifice for one in distress such faithful obedience to zaddik who everywhere monopolizes service worship must be given to god ala that movement began with such pure aspiration be to soul of so many other young student a shadow of great rock in weary land that doctrine opened out to young israel such spiritual vista transcendent splendor of godhead must end in such delusion distortion woe be be always to be thus with israel be to struggle out of one slough only to sink into doubt dishonor master let be humbler in judging others cheerfuller in looking out upon future more enkindling towards young men who be growing up around who may yet pas on torch of master for let recall many soul touched to purer flame let tell of who gave up post dignity to spread gospel endured hunger scorn
