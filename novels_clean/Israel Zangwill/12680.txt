acknowledgment of sanctity made more more difficult to disavow obligation dread of shocking mary came to dominate life fashionable house near kensington garden be still veritable centre of true jewish orthodoxy with little nothing to make old aaron goldsmith turn in grave be probable though mr henry goldsmith must have kept kosher table even if mary have never be born many of acquaintance relative be of orthodox turn kosher dinner must be eaten even by heterodox whereas tripha dinner choked off orthodox thus came about even rabbinate might safely stoke spiritual fire at mr henry goldsmith hence

first time temptation to wealthy honored to desert struggling brother be manifold sad experience have made race accustomed to loss of brightest son thanks for compliment fair coz said sidney not without complacent cynical pleasure in knowledge that raphael spoke truly that owed own immunity from obligation of faith to artistic success that outside world be disposed to accord larger charter of morality on same ground if can only deny nasty fact by accounting for dare say mr armitage book will afford ample opportunity for explanation have jew brazenness to assert be invention one must do

to exchange picturesque primitiveness of orient for sobriety of fashionable civilization when jeshurun waxed fat did not always kick yearned to approximate a much a possible to john bull without merging in to sink yet not be absorbed not to be yet to be attempt to realize asymptote in human mathematics be not quite successful too near approach to john bull generally assimilating jeshurun away for such be nature of jeshurun enfranchise give own way make new man of persecute be again if nobody have read man book raphael leon ventured to interrupt at last be quite fair to assume book be fit to read shy dark little girl have taken down to dinner darted appreciative glance at neighbor be in accordance with raphael usual anxiety to give devil due that must be unwilling to condemn even writer of anti semitic novel unheard then be open secret in family that raphael be mad did best to hush up among pitied behind back even sidney considered cousin raphael pushed dubious virtue too far in treating people very prejudice with deference due to earnest reasoned opinion know enough of book to know be badly treated protested hostess have always be badly treated in literature said raphael be made angel devil on one hand lessing george eliot on other stock dramatist novelist with low comedy villain oh said mr goldsmith doubtfully for must not quite think raphael have become infected by cousin propensity for paradox do think george eliot lessing did understand jewish character be only writer who have ever understood affirmed miss cissy levine emphatically little scornful smile played for second about mouth of dark little girl stop moment said sidney have be so busy doing justice to delicious asparagus have allowed raphael to imagine nobody here have read mordecai joseph have say there be more actuality in than in daniel deronda nathan der weise put together be crude production same writer artistic gift seems handicapped by dead weight of moral platitude highfalutin even mysticism not only present character moralizes over actually care whether be good bad have yearning after indefinable be very young instead of being satisfied that judaea give character be interesting actually lament lack of culture still what have done be good enough to make one hope artistic instinct will shake off moral oh sidney what be saying murmured addie be right little girl understand greek be not greek put in raphael in greek art beauty of soul beauty of form be one be french be talking though ignorant atelier where picked up flatter be greek be greek to addie anyhow laughed sidney be what make anti semitic chapter so unsatisfactory felt unsatisfactoriness if must not analyze so cleverly said hostess felt said mr montagu samuel yes be said sidney blandly must have

liberal tory supplementing duty a englishman with solicitude for best interest of judaism that left stone unturned to emancipate from secular thraldom of prejudice felt very hard that little vulgar section must always be chosen by own novelist effort to raise tone of jewish society passed by sidney whose conversation always have air of aloofness from race so that own foible often came under lash of sarcasm proceeded to justify assertion of rose color picture in mordecai joseph denied that modern english jew have religion claiming that faith consisted of form have to be kept up in public be too shrewd cute to believe in to practise in private though one might believe one else did that looked upon due payment of synagogue bill a discharging obligation to heaven that preacher secretly despised old formula that rabbinate declared intention of dying for judaism only a way of living by that body politic be dead rotten with hypocrisy though augur said be alive well admitted that same be true of christianity raphael reminded that number of jew have drifted quite openly from traditional teaching that thousand of well ordered household found inspiration spiritual satisfaction in form of that hypocrisy be too crude word for complex motif of who obeyed without inner conviction for instance said gentleman said to other day be much touched by expression believe with father heart ' be good epigram said sidney impressed what be to be said of rich community recruit clergy from lower class method of election by competitive performance common a be among poor dissenter emphasizes
