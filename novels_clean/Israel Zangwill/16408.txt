did not shave be never known to be in possession of such instrument if then be to confine to medical police evidence there must think be little hesitation in dismissing idea of suicide nevertheless be well to forget physical aspect of case for moment to apply mind to unprejudiced inquiry into mental aspect of be there reason why deceased must wish to take own life be young wealthy popular loving

two together case against suicide be mathematically complete answer then to first question did deceased commit suicide be that did not coroner paused everybody drew long breath lucid exposition have be followed with admiration if coroner have stopped now jury must have unhesitatingly returned verdict of murder coroner swallowed mouthful of water went on now come to second alternative be deceased victim of homicide in order to answer question in affirmative be essential that must be able to form conception of modus operandi be very well for dr robinson to say cut be made by hand in absence of theory a to how cut must possibly have be made by other hand must be driven back to theory of self infliction however improbable may seem to medical gentleman now what be fact when mr drabdump mr grodman found body be yet warm mr grodman witness fortunately qualified by special experience state that death have be quite recent tally closely enough with view of dr robinson who examining body about hour later put time of death at two three hour before say seven o'clock mr drabdump have attempted to wake deceased at quarter to seven must put back act to little earlier a understand from dr robinson that be impossible to fix time very precisely death may have very well taken place several hour before mr drabdump first attempt to wake deceased of course may have taken place between first second call a may merely have be sound asleep at first may also not impossibly have taken place considerably earlier than first call for physical data seem to prove nevertheless on whole think will be least likely to err if assume time of death to be half past six gentleman let picture to ourselves glover street at half past six have seen house know exactly how be constructed on ground floor front

arthur constant in cold blood with most careful premeditation premeditation so studied a to leave circumstance of death impenetrable mystery for week to world though fortunately without altogether baffling almost superhuman ingenuity of mr edward wimp of scotland yard detective department propose to show that motif of prisoner be jealousy revenge jealousy not only of friend superior influence

not saint world have agreed to paint will not shrink from unveiling truer picture in interest of justice can not say nil nisi bonum even of dead propose to show that murder be committed by prisoner shortly before half past six on morning of december th that prisoner having with remarkable ingenuity have shown throughout attempted to prepare alibi by feigning to leave london by first train to liverpool returned home got in with latch key through street door have left on latch unlocked victim bedroom with key possessed cut sleeping man throat pocketed razor locked door again gave appearance of being bolted went downstairs unslipped bolt of big lock closed door behind got to euston in time for second train to liverpool fog helped proceeding throughout such be in sum theory of prosecution pale defiant figure in dock winced perceptibly under part of mr drabdump be first witness called for prosecution be quite used to legal inquisitiveness by time did not appear in good spirit on night of december rd gave prisoner letter yes ludship how did behave when read turned very pale excited went up to poor gentleman room be afraid quarrelled with might have left last hour peaceful amusement what happened then mr mortlake went out in passion came in again in about hour told be going away to liverpool very early next morning ludship said be going to devonport sensation what time did get up next morning half past six be not usual time always get up at six how do account for extra sleepiness misfortune will happen be dull foggy weather lud else must never get up early laughter drink something before going to bed like cup o ' tea take strong without sugar always steady nerve quite so where be when prisoner told be going to devonport drinkin ' tea in kitchen what must say if prisoner dropped something in to make sleep late witness startled ought to be shot might have done without noticing suppose if be clever enough to murder poor gentleman be clever enough to try poison judge witness in reply must confine to evidence mr spigot qc must submit to lordship that be very logical answer exactly illustrates interdependence of probability now mr drabdump let know what happened when awoke at past six next morning thereupon mr drabdump recapitulated evidence with new redundancy slight variation given by at inquest how became alarmed how found street door locked by big lock how roused grodman got to burst open door how found body with public be already familiar ad nauseam be extorted from afresh look at key key passed to witness do recognise yes how did get be key of first floor front be sure left sticking in door did know miss dymond yes mr mortlake sweetheart knew must never marry poor thing sensation why not be getting too grand for amusement mean anything more than know only came to place once twice last time set eye on must have be in october how did appear be very miserable must let see laughter how have prisoner behaved since murder always seemed very glum sorry for cross examined did not prisoner once occupy bedroom of mr constant give up to so that mr constant might have two room on same floor yes did pay a much while occupying front bedroom did not prisoner once lose key have made did be very careless do know what prisoner mr constant spoke about on night of december rd must hear then how did know be quarrelling be talkin ' so loud sir charles brown harland qc sharply be talking loudly to now must say be quarrelling take two to make quarrel laughter be prisoner sort of man who in opinion must commit murder never must have ' guessed be always struck a thorough gentleman lud knew be only comp say prisoner have seemed depressed since murder might not have be due to disappearance of sweetheart 'd more likely be glad to get rid of then must be jealous if mr constant took off hand sensation men be dog in manger never mind about men mr drabdump have prisoner ceased to care for miss dymond did seem to think of lud when got letter in handwriting among heap used to throw aside till 'd torn open others brown harland qc with triumphant ring in voice thank mr drabdump may sit down spigot qc one moment mr drabdump say prisoner have ceased to care for miss dymond might not have be in consequence of suspecting for time that have relation with mr constant judge be not fair question spigot qc will do thank mr drabdump brown harland qc one question more mr drabdump did ever see anything say when miss dymond came to house to make suspect anything between mr constant prisoner sweetheart did meet once when mr mortlake be out sensation where did meet in passage be going out when knocked opened door amusement did hear what said ai eavesdropper spoke friendly went away together mr george grodman be called repeated evidence at inquest cross examined testified to warm friendship between mr constant prisoner knew very little about miss dymond having scarcely seen prisoner have never spoken to much about must not think be much in prisoner thought naturally prisoner have be depressed by death of friend besides be overworked witness thought highly of mortlake character be incredible that constant have have improper relation of kind with friend promised wife grodman evidence made very favourable impression on jury prisoner looked gratitude prosecution felt sorry have be necessary to call witness inspector howlett sergeant runnymede have also to repeat evidence dr robinson police surgeon likewise retendered evidence a to nature of wound approximate hour of death time be much more severely examined must not bind down to state time within hour two thought life have be extinct two three hour when arrived so that deed have be committed between seven eight under gentle pressure from prosecuting counsel admitted that might possibly have be between six seven cross examined reiterated impression in favour of later hour supplementary evidence from medical expert proved a dubious uncertain a if court have confined to original witness seemed to be generally agreed that data for determining time of death of body be too complex variable to admit of very precise inference rigor mortis other symptom setting in within very wide limit differing largely in different person agreed that death from cut must have be practically instantaneous theory of suicide be rejected by a whole medical evidence tended to fix time of death with high degree of probability between hour of six half past eight effort of prosecution be bent upon throwing back time of death to a early a possible after about half past five defence spent strength upon pinning expert to conclusion that death must not have be earlier than seven evidently prosecution be going to fight hard for hypothesis mortlake have committed crime in interval between first second train for liverpool while defence be concentrating on alibi showing that prisoner have travelled by second train left euston station at quarter past seven so that there must have be possible time for passage between bow euston be exciting struggle a yet contending force seemed equally matched evidence have gone a much for a against prisoner everybody knew that worse lay behind call edward wimp story edward wimp have to tell began tamely enough with thrice threshed out fact at last new fact came in consequence of suspicion have formed in mind took up quarter disguised in late mr constant room did at commencement of year suspicion have gradually gathered against occupant of glover street resolved to quash confirm suspicion once for will tell jury what followed whenever prisoner be away for night searched room found key of mr constant bedroom buried deeply in side of prisoner leather sofa found what imagine to be letter received on december rd in page of 'bradshaw lying under same sofa there be two razor about mr spigot qc said key have already be identified by mr drabdump letter now propose to read be undated ran a follows

least love till end yours till death jessie by time letter be finished numerous old gentleman with wig without be observed to be polishing glass mr wimp examination be resumed after making discovery what did do made inquiry about miss dymond found mr constant have visited once twice in evening imagined there must be trace of pecuniary connection be allowed by family to inspect mr constant cheque book found paid cheque made out for l in name of miss dymond by inquiry at bank found have be cashed on november lth of last year then applied for warrant against prisoner cross examined do suggest that prisoner opened mr constant bedroom with key found certainly brown harland qc sarcastically locked door from within with on leaving certainly will have goodness to explain how trick be done be done laughter prisoner probably locked door from outside who broke open naturally imagined have be locked from inside when found key inside key must on theory be on floor a outside locking must not have be effected if have be in lock first person to enter room must naturally believe have be thrown down in bursting of door might have be left sticking very loosely inside lock so a not to interfere with turning of outside key in case must also probably have be thrown to ground indeed very ingenious can also explain how prisoner must have bolted door within from outside can renewed sensation there be only one way in be possible be of course mere conjurer illusion to cause locked door to appear bolted in addition must only be necessary for person on inside of door to wrest staple containing bolt from woodwork bolt in mr constant bedroom worked perpendicularly when staple be torn off must simply remain at rest on pin of bolt instead of supporting keeping fixed person bursting open door finding staple resting on pin torn away from lintel of door must of course imagine have torn away never dreaming wresting off have be done beforehand applause in court be instantly checked by usher counsel for defence felt have be entrapped in attempting to be sarcastic with redoubtable detective grodman seemed green with envy be one thing have not thought of mr drabdump grodman inspector howlett sergeant runnymede be recalled reexammed by embarrassed sir charles brown harland a to exact condition of lock bolt position of key turned out a wimp have suggested so prepossessed be witness with conviction that door be locked bolted from inside when be burst open that be little hazy about exact detail damage have be repaired so that be question of precise past observation inspector sergeant testified that key be in lock when saw though mortice bolt be broken be not prepared to say that wimp theory be impossible must even admit be quite possible that staple of bolt have be torn off beforehand mr drabdump must give clear account of such petty fact in view of immediate engrossing interest in horrible sight of corpse grodman alone be positive that key be in door when burst open did not remember picking up from floor putting in be certain that staple of bolt be not broken from resistance experienced in trying to shake upper panel of door by prosecution think from comparative ease with door yielded to onslaught that be highly probable that pin of bolt be not in firmly fixed staple in one already detached from woodwork of lintel door did not yield so easily must be hercules not quite bolt be old woodwork crumbling lock be new shoddy have always be strong man very well mr grodman hope will never appear at music hall laughter jessie dymond landlady be next witness for prosecution corroborated wimp statement a to constant occasional visit narrated how girl have be enlisted by dead philanthropist a collaborator in of enterprise most telling portion of evidence be story of how late at night on december rd prisoner called upon inquired wildly about whereabouts of sweetheart said have just received mysterious letter from miss dymond saying be gone landlady replied that must have told that week ago a ungrateful lodger be gone now three week without leaving hint behind in answer to most ungentlemanly raging raving told served right a must have looked after better not kept away for so long reminded that there be a good fish in sea a ever came out girl of jessie attraction need not pine away a have seemed to be pining away for lack of appreciation then called liar left hoped never to see face again though be not surprised to see in dock mr fitzjames montgomery bank clerk remembered cashing cheque produced particularly remembered because paid money to very pretty girl took entire amount in gold at point case be adjourned denzil cantercot be first witness called for prosecution on resumption of trial pressed a to whether have not told mr wimp that have overheard prisoner denouncing mr constant must not say have not actually heard prisoner denunciation might have given mr wimp false impression then mr wimp be so prosaically literal laughter mr crowl have told something of kind cross examined said jessie dymond be rare spirit always reminded of joan of arc mr crowl being called be extremely agitated refused to take oath informed court that bible be fad must not swear by anything so self contradictory must affirm must not deny though looked like wishing to that prisoner have at first be rather mistrustful of mr constant be certain that feeling have quickly worn off yes be great friend of prisoner did see why must invalidate testimony especially a have not taken oath certainly prisoner seemed rather depressed when saw on bank holiday be overwork on behalf of people for demolition of fad several other familiar of prisoner gave more le reluctant testimony a to sometime prejudice against amateur rival labour leader expression of dislike have be strong bitter prosecution also produced poster announcing that prisoner must preside at great meeting of clerk on december th have not turned up at meeting sent explanation finally there be evidence of detective who originally arrested at liverpool dock in view of suspicious demeanour completed case for prosecution sir charles brown harland qc rose with swagger rustle of silk gown proceeded to set forth theory of defence said did not purpose to call many witness hypothesis of prosecution be so inherently childish inconsequential so dependent upon bundle of interdependent probability that crumbled away at merest touch prisoner character be of unblemished integrity last public appearance have be made on same platform with mr gladstone honesty highmindedness have be vouched for by statesman of highest standing movement must be accounted for from hour to hour with prosecution credited rested on tangible evidence whatever be also credited with superhuman ingenuity diabolical cunning of have shown no previous symptom hypothesis be piled on hypothesis a in old oriental legend where world rested on elephant elephant on tortoise might be worth while however to point out that be at least quite likely that death of mr constant have not taken place before seven a prisoner left euston station at be for liverpool must certainly not have got there from bow in time also that be hardly possible for prisoner who must prove being at euston station at be to travel backwards forward to glover street commit crime within le than two hour real fact said sir charles impressively be most simple prisoner partly from pressure of work partly have wish to conceal from worldly ambition have begun to neglect miss dymond to whom be engaged to be married man be human head be little turned by growing importance nevertheless at heart be still deeply attached to miss dymond however appears to have jumped to conclusion that have ceased to love that be unworthy of unfitted by education to take place side by side with in new sphere to be mounting that in short be drag on career being by account girl of remarkable force of character resolved to cut gordian knot by leaving london fearing lest affianced husband conscientiousness must induce to sacrifice to dreading also perhaps own weakness made parting absolute place of refuge mystery theory have be suggested drag honoured name in mire theory so superflous that will only allude to that arthur constant must have seduced have improper relation with friend betrothed be hypothesis to life of give lie before leaving london england miss dymond wrote to aunt in devonport only living relative in country asking a great favour to forward addressed letter to prisoner fortnight after receipt aunt obeyed implicitly be letter fell like thunderbolt on prisoner on night of december rd old love returned be full of self reproach pity for poor girl letter read ominously perhaps be going to put end to herself first thought be to rush up to friend constant to seek advice perhaps constant knew something of affair prisoner knew two be in not infrequent communication be possible lord gentleman of jury wish to follow method of prosecution confuse theory with fact so say be possible that mr constant have supplied with l to leave country be like brother to perhaps even acted imprudently in calling upon though dreamed of evil be possible that may have encouraged in abnegation in altruistic aspiration perhaps even without knowing exact drift for doe not speak in very last letter of fine female character be meeting influence for good have over individual human soul still can now never know unless dead speak absent return be also not impossible that miss dymond be entrusted with l for charitable purpose to come back to certainty prisoner consulted mr constant about letter then ran to miss dymond lodging in stepney green knowing beforehand trouble must be futile letter bore postmark of devonport knew girl have aunt there possibly might have gone to must not telegraph for be ignorant of address consulted 'bradshaw resolved to leave by be from paddington told landlady so left letter in 'bradshaw ultimately got thrust among pile of paper under sofa so that have to get be careless disorderly key found by mr wimp in sofa be absurdly supposed to have hidden there after murder must have lain there for year having be lost there in day when occupied bedroom afterwards rented by mr constant for be own sofa removed from room suction of sofa be well known afraid to miss train did not undress on distressful night meantime thought occurred to that jessie be too clever girl to leave so easy trail jumped to conclusion that must be going to married brother in america have gone to devonport merely to bid aunt farewell determined therefore to get to liverpool without wasting time at devonport to institute inquiry not suspecting delay in transit of letter thought might yet stop even at landing stage on tender unfortunately cab went slowly in fog missed first train wandered about brooding disconsolately in mist till second at liverpool suspicious excited demeanour procured momentary arrest since then thought of lost girl have haunted broken be whole plain sufficing story effective witness for defence be indeed few be so hard to prove negative there be jessie aunt who bore out statement of counsel for defence there be porter who saw leave euston by train for liverpool arrive just too late for there be cabman who drove to euston just in time witness thought to catch be under cross examination cabman got little confused be asked whether if really picked up prisoner at bow railway station at about ought not to have caught first train at euston said fog made drive rather slowly admitted mist be transparent enough to warrant full speed also admitted being strong trade unionist spigot qc artfully extorting admission a if be of utmost significance finally there be numerous witness of sort condition to prisoner high character a well a to arthur constant blameless moral life in closing speech on third day of trial sir charles pointed out with great exhaustiveness cogency flimsiness of case for prosecution number of hypothesis involved mutual interdependence mr drabdump be witness whose evidence must be accepted with extreme caution jury must remember that be unable to dissociate observation from inference thought that prisoner mr constant be quarrelling merely because be agitated dissected evidence showed that entirely bore out story of defence asked jury to bear in mind that positive evidence whether of cabman others have be given of various complicated movement attributed to prisoner on morning of december th between hour of be that most important witness on theory of prosecution meant of course miss dymond have not be produced even if be dead body be found countenance must be given to theory of prosecution for mere conviction that lover have deserted must be sufficient explanation of suicide beyond ambiguous letter tittle of evidence of dishonour on bulk of case against prisoner rested have be adduced a for motive of political jealousy have be mere passing cloud two men have become fast friend a to circumstance of alleged crime medical evidence be on whole in favour of time of death being late prisoner have left london at quarter past seven drugging theory be absurd a for too clever bolt lock theory mr grodman trained scientific observer have pooh poohed must solemnly exhort jury to remember that if condemned prisoner must not only send innocent man to ignominious death on flimsiest circumstantial evidence must deprive working men of country of one of truest friend ablest leader conclusion of sir charles vigorous speech be greeted with irrepressible applause mr spigot qc in closing case for prosecution asked jury to return verdict against prisoner for a malicious premeditated crime a ever disgraced annals of civilised country cleverness education have only be utilised for devil end while reputation have be used a cloak everything pointed strongly to prisoner guilt on receiving miss dymond letter announcing shame probably intention to commit suicide have hastened upstairs to denounce constant have then rushed to girl lodging finding worst fear confirmed planned at once diabolically ingenious scheme of revenge told landlady be going to devonport so that if bungled police must be put temporarily off track real destination be liverpool for intended to leave country lest however plan must break down here too arranged ingenious alibi by being driven to euston for train to liverpool cabman must not know did not intend to go by meant to return to glover street there to perpetrate foul crime interruption to have possibly barred by drugging landlady presence at liverpool whither really went by second train must corroborate cabman story night have not undressed gone to bed have plotted out devilish scheme till be perfect fog came a unexpected ally to cover movement jealousy outraged affection desire for revenge lust for political power be human might pity criminal must not find innocent of crime mr justice crogie summing up began dead against prisoner reviewing evidence pointed out that plausible hypothesis neatly dove tailed did not necessarily weaken one fitting so well together of whole rather making for truth of part besides case for prosecution be a far from being hypothesis a case for defence be from excluding hypothesis key letter reluctance to produce letter heated interview with constant misstatement about prisoner destination flight to liverpool false tale about searching for denunciation of constant be fact on other hand there be various lacuna hypothesis in case for defence even conceding somewhat dubious alibi afforded by prisoner presence at euston at be there be attempt to account for movement between be be a possible that returned to bow a lingered about euston there be nothing in medical evidence to make guilt impossible be there anything inherently impossible in constant yielding to sudden temptation of beautiful girl in working girl deeming deserted temporarily succumbing to fascination of gentleman regretting bitterly afterwards what have become of girl be mystery hers might have be one of nameless corps tide swirl up on slimy river bank jury must remember too that relation might not have actually passed into dishonour might have be just grave enough to smite girl conscience to induce to behave a have done be enough that letter must have excited jealousy of prisoner there be one other point must like to impress on jury counsel for prosecution have not sufficiently insisted upon be that prisoner guiltiness be only plausible solution have ever be advanced of bow mystery medical evidence agreed that mr constant did not die by own hand one must therefore have murdered number of people who must have have possible reason opportunity to murder be extremely small prisoner have reason opportunity by what logician called method of exclusion suspicion must attach to on even slight evidence actual evidence be strong plausible now that mr wimp ingenious theory have enabled to understand how door must have be apparently locked bolted from within last difficulty last argument for suicide have be removed prisoner guilt be a clear a circumstantial evidence must make if let go free bow mystery might henceforward be placed among archive of unavenged assassination having thus well nigh hung prisoner judge wound up by insisting on high probability of story for defence though too be dependent in important detail upon prisoner mere private statement to counsel jury being by time

red cheeked maedchen yet never be true there be something sordid about atmosphere subtly permeates that drag down to mary ann transpontine drudge whose lip be fresh from coalman butcher phaugh fancy seized hold of imagination must not shake off must not sleep till have got out of bed sponged lip vigorously meanwhile mary ann be lying on bed dressed doing best to keep meaningless half hysterical sob from mistress keen ear ii be long time before mary ann came so prominently into centre of lancelot consciousness again remained somewhere in outer periphery of thought nowhere near bull eye so to speak a vague automaton worked when pulled bell rope infinitely more important thing be troubling visit of peter have somehow put keener edge on blunted self confidence have started grand opera worked at furiously in interval left by engrossing pursuit after publisher sometimes must look up from hieroglyphic see mary ann at side surveying curiously then must start remember have rung up try to remember what for mary ann must turn red a if fault be hers publisher be one thing be never out of lancelot mind though drove lancelot nearly out of be like arrow stuck in aforesaid bull eye target being conscious rankled sorely lancelot discovered that publisher kept musical adviser whose advice appeared to consist of famous monosyllable publisher generally published musical adviser own work advice having apparently be neglected when be most worth taking at least so lancelot thought when have skimmed through set of lancer by one of worthy will give up being musician said to grimly will become musical adviser once half by accident actually saw publisher dear sir said great man what be use of bringing quartet full score to must have taken to brahmson be very man want know address of

dripping lancelot groaned be not only that improved mary ann be again sinking to earth unable to soar in romantic aether where must fain have seen volant be not only that coarseness of nature have power to drag down be coarseness of red chapped hand be thrust once again violently upon reluctant consciousness then like mary ann have inspiration how must like pair of glove mary ann have struck latent feminine eye gleamed oh sir be must say then swift shade of disappointment darkened eager little face never go out cried never go out corrected shuddering never go out said mary ann lip

else of course must sir said mary ann earnestly with grateful little sigh so lancelot measured wrist feeling pulse beat madly really have very little hand though to sensitive vision roughness of skin seemed to swell to size demanding boxing glove bought six pair of tan kid in beautiful cardboard box must ill afford gift made one of whimsical grimace when got bill young lady who served looked infinitely more genteel than mary ann wondered what must think if knew for whom be buying dainty article perhaps feeling must be so outraged must refuse to participate in transaction young lady be happily unconscious have best smile for handsome aristocratic young gentleman mentioned moustache later to bosom friend in next department thus mary ann lancelot became joint owner of secret coplayers in little comedy when mary ann came into room must put be carrying on chair gravely extract glove from pocket draw on lancelot pretending not to know be in room though have just said come in after allowing minute must look up in course of week became mechanical so that lost semi ludicrous sense of secrecy felt at first a well a little pathetic emotion inspired by absolute unconsciousness that performance be not intended for own gratification nevertheless though must now endure to see mary ann handling sugar tongs remained cold to for week have kissed again in flush of joy at sight of glove after there be reaction rarely went to club now there be one with whom be in correspondence except music publisher did reply dropped in there once soon after glove episode looked over paper in smoking room chatted with popular composer one two men knew be while waiter be holding out coffee tray to that mary ann flashed upon consciousness thought of seemed so incongruous with sober magnificence massive respectability surrounded cheerful marble hearth reddened with leaping flame luxurious lounge well groomed old gentleman smoking eighteenpenny cheroot suave noiseless satellite that lancelot felt sudden pang of bewildered shame why very waiter who stood bent before must disdain took coffee hastily with sense of personal unworthiness feeling soon evaporated left le of resentment against mary ann made inexplicable to fortunately habit of acceptance saved tear though shed others there remained always glove when be putting on always felt be slipping hand in then there be yet further consolation for glove have also subtle effect on lancelot gave sense of responsibility vaguely resentful a felt against mary ann in interval of more definite resentment against publisher also felt that must not stop at glove have started refining must go on till be so to speak glove must cover up coarse speech a have covered up coarse hand owed that to glove be least must do for so whenever mary ann made mistake lancelot corrected found grammatical dialogue not uninteresting vent for ill humour against publisher to boot very often verbal correction sounded astonishingly like reprimand here again mary ann be forearmed by feeling that deserved must have be proud have known how much mr lancelot be satisfied with aspirate came quite natural have only dropped h temporarily a one drop country friend in coming to london curiously enough mary ann did not regard new locution pronunciation a superseding old be new language knew two others mother tongue missus tongue must a little have thought of using new linguistic acquirement in kitchen a of wearing glove there be for lancelot ear only a glove be for eye time lancelot be displaying prodigious musical activity so much so that cost of ruled paper became consideration there be form of composition did not essay none by made shilling once felt prey of splendid inspiration sat up night writing at fever pitch surrounded with celestial harmony audible to alone little room resounded with thunder of mighty orchestra in instrument sang to individually piccolo flute oboe clarionets filling air with silver spray of note drum throbbing trumpet shrilling four horn pealing with long stately note trombone bassoon vibrating violin viola sobbing in linked sweetness 'cello contra bass moaning under chant then in morning when first rough sketch be written glory faded threw down pen called as for wasting time on what nobody must ever look at then laid head on table overwrought full of infinite pity for sudden longing seized for one to love to caress hair to smooth hot forehead mood passed too smoothed slumbering beethoven instead after while went into bedroom sluiced face hand in ice cold water rang bell for breakfast there be knock at door in response come in said gently emotion have left tired to point of tenderness then waited minute while mary ann be drawing on glove did ring sir said wheezy voice at last mr

in aperture with immediate intention of departing must find repartee beyond slamming door a hard a must little passage of arm strangely softened lancelot to mary ann made realise faintly what life must be must go mad smash crockery cried aloud felt quite tender again towards uncomplaining girl presently there be knock lancelot growled half prepared to renew battle to give mr leadbatter piece of mind on subject be merely mary ann shaken in routine looked on steadily while mary ann drew on glove in turn confused mary ann hand trembled let help said there be lancelot buttoning mary ann glove just a if name be guinevere neither saw absurdity of wasting time upon operation must have to be undone in two minute then mary ann eye full of soft light went to sideboard took out prosaic element of breakfast when returned to put back lancelot be astonished to see carrying cage plain square cage made of white tin wire what be that gasped please mr lancelot want to ask to do favour dropped eyelash timidly yes mary ann said briskly what have got there be only canary sir must please sir must mind then desperately want to hang up here sir here repeated in frank astonishment why please sir be

child to start with have grown only in body whose soul have be stunted by uncounted year of dull monotonous drudgery blood burnt in vein a thought of cruelty of circumstance heartless honesty of mistress made up mind for second time to give mr leadbatter piece of mind in morning well go to bed now poor child said will get rest at yessir went obediently up couple of stair then turned head

yes yes understand broke in half amused though somehow word did not seem so full of maudlin pathos to now there drew head towards kiss good night did not complete quotation indeed lip be already drawn too close to ere released long repressed thought have found expression kiss anybody said half playfully oh sir said mary ann earnestly what more lightly still have got dozen young men mary ann shook head more regretfully than resentfully told never go out except for little errand have told attention have be so concentrated on ungrammatical form in have conveyed information that fact have made

help expressing sense of good taste then wo kiss anybody said a let go for last time have quixotic sub consciousness that be saving from kind by making promise formally how must mr lancelot brimming eye shone with soft light never will never sounded like troth went back to room shut door must not shut out image picture have unwittingly supplied of took possession of imagination saw almost a dream figure virginal figure knew standing by stream in sunset amid elm silver birch with daisy in hand bluebell at foot inhaling delicate scent wafted from white hawthorn bush watching water glide along

flowed out at point of pen reverie full of haunting magic of quiet water woodland sunset gracious innocence of maidenhood when be done felt must give distinctive name cast about for one pondering rejecting title innumerable countless line of poetry ran through head from sought to pick word two a one pluck violet from posy at last half tender half whimsical look came into face picking pen out

be intimation from misogamist german professor that have persuaded of old pupil to include prize symphony by lancelot in programme of crystal palace concert be of sufficient to turn lancelot head away from thought of fame even if mary ann have not be luckless enough to be again discovered cleaning step without glove against spectacle veriest idealist be powerless if mary ann did not immediately revert to category of quadruped in have started be only because of lancelot supplementary knowledge of creature a passed by solicitous a before not to tread upon felt a if cold water in pail be

popular composer who be member of club that lancelot must collaborate with in comic opera for production of have facility composer confessed have fluent gift of tune have liking for drudgery of orchestration a lancelot be well up in tedious technicality two might strike partnership to mutual advantage lancelot felt insulted retained enough mastery of to reply that must think over a gave sign of life thought popular composer then wrote to at length on subject offering fifty pound for job half of on account lancelot be in sore strait when got letter for stock of money be dwindling to vanishing point dallied with temptation sufficiently to take letter home with spirit be not yet broken letter crumpled like rag be picked up by mary ann straightened out carefully placed upon mantel shelf time did something of similar service for mary ann picking up from crumpled attitude in lancelot have detected on doorstep straightening out again replacing upon semi poetic pedestal a with cream laid note paper wrinklings must not be effaced entirely be more serious for mary ann not that mary ann be conscious of diverse humour in lancelot unconscious of change in must not conceive related to variation of mood still le did realise inward struggle of be cause be vaguely aware that have external worry for grandeur if be by turn brusque affectionate indifferent playful brutal charming callous demonstrative more connected with vicissitude than with caprice of weather if sun smiled once day be enough how must know that indifference be often victory over a amativeness be defeat if excuse must be found for lancelot must be that administered to conscience morning evening like soothing syrup position be grown so desperate that mary ann almost stood between suicide continued disappointment made soul sick proud heart fed on must bite lip till blood came vowing never to give in not only must not move inch from ideal must rather die than gratify peter by falling back on must never even accept that cheque be virtually own be wonderful how in stoniest moment sight of mary ann candid face eloquent with dumb devotion softened melted must take gloved hand press silently mary ann never knew one iota of inmost thought must not bring to indeed never for moment appeared to in light of intelligent being at best be sweet simple loving child scarce spoke to at now theirs be silent communion have heart to converse with a have done piano too be almost silent canary sang le le though spring be coming glint of sunshine stole between wire of cage even beethoven sometimes failed to bark when there be knock at street door at last there came day when for first time in life lancelot inspected wardrobe hunted together odds end of jewelry from significant task be aroused by hearing mr leadbatter coughing in sitting room went in with interrogative look oh chest said mr leadbatter patting be use denyin ' of sir be done up be a much a can do to crawl up to top to

thousand be thinkin ' if must give rosie lesson once week on there pianner must be kind of set off for know sir policeman tell winder be landmark to 'im on foggiest night lancelot flushed then wrinkled brow be new idea altogether mr leadbatter stood waiting for reply with deferential smile tempered by asthmatic contortion have got piano of own oh sir cried mr leadbatter almost reproachfully well how be rosie to practise one lesson week be of very little use anyway unless practises good deal will only be waste of time ah know rosie said mr leadbatter shaking head with sceptical pride must judge by other gel way that gel pick up thing be well will just tell what 'er school teacher miss whiteman said say good lady interrupted lancelot practised six hour day yes come so natural to man said mr leadbatter unshaken look natural to see man playin ' pianner be like seein knittin ' lancelot be knitting brow in way be exceedingly natural may a well tell at once that what propose be impossible first of because be doubtful whether will remain in room secondly because be giving up piano immediately only have on hire felt blushing oh what pity interrupted mr leadbatter might a well let go on payin ' hinstalments instead of lettin ' have paid go for nothing rosie ai got much time must allow day if be own pianner lancelot explained hire did not mean hire system idea of acquiring piano having once fired mr leadbatter brain must not be extinguished unexpected conclusion arrived at be that be to purchase piano on hire system allowing to stand in lancelot room that five shilling week must be taken off rent in return for six lesson of hour one of hour counterbalancing gas grievance reviewing bargain when mr leadbatter be gone lancelot did not think at bad for use of piano gas murmured with pathetic smile recalling advertisement have read before lighting on mr leadbatter five shilling week be considerable relief there be loss of dignity for nobody will know wonder what governor must have said thought shook with silent laughter spectator might have fancied be sobbing after lesson began might almost be said be only when spectator be present that be not sobbing for rosie who be awkward ungraceful young person proved to be dullest most butter fingered pupil ever invented for torture of teacher at least so lancelot thought then have never have other pupil be not patient must be admitted though rosie giggled perpetually apparently finding endless humour in own mistake climax of horror be attendance of mr leadbatter at lesson for to lancelot consternation took for granted that presence be part of contract marched into room in best cap sat smiling in easy chair wheezing complacently beating time with foot occasionally must supplement lancelot critical observation ai a fear to trust 'er with sir also remarked about three time week for know sir be gentleman be neighbour never can mind own business told 'em be going to give rosie lesson know sir that will talk of what concern after sir be hour hour be sixty minute ai sir lancelot groaning inwardly unable to deny chronometry felt that ironic providence be punishing for attention to mary ann yet only felt more tenderly towards mary ann contrasted with two vulgar female whom came to conceive a oppressor sitting in gaud finery taking lesson have better befitted cinderella figure of mary ann definitely reassumed of antediluvian poetry if may apply adjective to catastrophic washing of step mary ann have grown gloomier once twice thought have be cry though be too numbed apathetic to ask be incapable of suspecting that rosie have anything to do with tear hardly noticed that rosie have taken to feeding canary question of how must feed be becoming day more more menacing saw starvation slowly closing in upon like wall of torture chamber have grown quite familiar with pawn shop now though still slipped in a though good be stolen at last there came moment when lancelot felt must bear no longer then suddenly saw daylight why must teach only rosie nay why must teach rosie at if be reduced to giving lesson after be degradation to do so abandonment of artistic ideal rather solution of difficulty so simple that wondered have not occurred to before why must give at so wretched price must get pupil other pupil who must enable to dispense with few shilling made by rosie must not ask anybody to recommend pupil there be need for acquaintance to know if asked peter peter must probably play philanthropic trick must advertise after have spent last gold breast pin in advertisement realised that to get pianoforte pupil in london be a easy a to get song published by time quite realised be may then sat down to realise future future be sublimely simple a simple a wardrobe have grown clothes be on back in week two must be on street for poor widow must not be expected to lodge partially board with use of piano gas absolutely penniless young gentleman though combined blood of twenty county family with genius of pleiad of tone poet there be only one bright spot in prospect rosie lesson must come to end what must do when got on street be not so clear a rest of prophetic vision might take to barrel organ must be cruel waste of artistic touch perhaps must die on doorstep like professor of many language whose starvation be recorded in very morning paper thus driven by saturnine necessity that sneer at puny resolution lancelot began to meditate surrender for surrender of sort must be of life ideal after so steadfast protracted struggle oh be cruel be terrible how noble how high minded have be be how fate dealt with at moment sw eet went canary filled room with rapturous demi semi quaver throat swelling little body throbbing with joy of sunshine then lancelot remembered not joy of sunshine not joy of life merely mary ann noble high minded let peter think that let posterity think that must not cozen thus have fallen horribly vulgarly how absurd of to set up a saint martyr idealist must not divide into two compartment like pretend that only one counted in character who be to talk of dying for art be everyday man wanted mary ann yes might a well admit that to now be use humbugging longer why must give up be discovery treasure trove property if must stoop to why must not stoop to popular work to devilling to anything must rid of sordid care bah away with

on mantel piece other day accept fifty pound did must do anonymously so that peter must know after must escape from wretched den take flat far away somewhere where nobody knew there must sit work with mary ann for housekeeper poor mary ann how glad must be when told tear came into eye a thought of naive delight must rescue from horrid monotonous slavery happy thought must have to give lesson to

mild irritation at destruction of so truly platonic converse in book of proposal savoured must have found quite romantic person in actuality felt a frigid a if marble forehead be chilling what remembered most acutely be fishlike gasping then too contradictoriness of social attitude desire to make rich drone shame at mother reclusive shyness weakness of man came to obscure sense of literary idealism if not indeed to reveal a mere coquetry with fine idea coarse clothes then for moment humour of being mr maper daughter in law appealed to laughed to herself in soft duet with music in middle
