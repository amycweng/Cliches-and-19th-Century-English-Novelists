taught be based upon induction from great picture matt in turn did not always take kindly reduction of sthetics to rule chafed be distressed by tarmigans symmetrical formul against symmetry though of canon of composition seemed to self evident when once pointed out others not unreasonable must not always relish mechanical application of general law to particular case suppressed untutored instinct much a in day mother have wrestled with satan in faith hope self distrust submitted duteously to law tarmigan worked fluently for most part now then came sudden impotency not always due to lack of sympathy with model inability to get exact effect wanted tortured even more than tarmigans strait waistcoat of dogma very soon grainger grew half boastful half jealous of american prodigy whom later

not pose for moment two whereupon herbert bade begone altogether ive be off color day observed explanatorily a counted out model silver excitement of discovering be not alone in world be finishing touch matthew threw rather reproachful look at matt whose eye drooped guiltily raised immediately however in accordance with uncle instruction to admire study of draped figure be hung on wall coloring struck agreeably though found certain feebleness in drawing be equally agreeable to jealous mood not displeasing impression be borne out by other picture sketch for uncle besought admiration always facile poetic coloring indifferent draughtsmanship suggestion of difficulty shirked rather than of difficulty overcome at last seen to be due to conventional composition most of work whether in chalk water color oil being pretty landscape single figure study in simple attitude when complicated by other figure embracing episode seemed to have be transferred direct from other picture of indeed matt have seen either in original in engraving to astonishment herbert who have be yawning widely drew attention to one such little bit dont recognize that said dad did at once quotation from millais matt looked puzzled at phrase cribbing unwise call expounded herbert so did dad till explained to be only quoting when great writer hit off phrase pass into language when great painter hit off new effect

paper at gillray reynolds dare not blackball because committee always owe money want to sell picture dare say laugh at behind back when jaw to about art in general talent in particular confoundedly annoying oh ive be forgetting to smoke what can be matter with pulled out lizard skin case from matt not liking to refuse drew forth cigarette what good doe do by belonging to club asked oh like for one thing replied herbert striking match holding to matt cigarette belief be only went into picture business to rub shoulder with artist though where charm come in have never be able to find out for duller more illiterate set of fellow never wish to meet shop be can talk then of course good for business in background lurks feel sure idea of advancing interest of accumulating back stair influence of pulling rope that will at last lift into proud position of ra nay who know said puffing out first wreath of smoke president of royal academy laughed melodiously well began matt inhaling delicious scent of tobacco well echoed herbert thats just taste be not considered in matter at art art art nothing art rammed down throat till im sick of sight of canvas be connoisseur in cradle sucked maul stick instead of monkey on stick live in midst of art out of profit of picture picture everywhere not oh have brandy soda wont dont stand about a if be going matt obediently dropped upon lounge yielded deliciously to pressure fragrant smoke curled about face while cousin made pleasant play with popping cork gurgling liquid dont really like painting asked in astonishment like thing in well

music be addition to nature something extra painting acting be mere reduplication of nature perhaps be unfair to painting at least fix beauty of nature acting be merely evanescent imitation of temporary younger man sat half bewildered beneath torrent of word quotation respect herbert have lost in eye by draughtsmanship trifling matter under herbert disdainful analysis returning multiplied to reverence with fresh undercurrent of humility envy how much there be to know in world how many language book art how must mix with herbert set without being found out thats why prefer literature music said herbert then im not own master like lucky beggar if have way picture must be nothing color scheme sheer imagination with relation to truth of nature what do care how shadow fall if dont

cornpeppers chimney on fire in fitzroy street flight of spark falling curving in golden rain in vivid contrast with dark starlit sky above black mass of spectator below faintly illumined by street lamp broken at extreme end by brassy gleam of fire engine tearing up street there be inaccuracy of detail matt be immensely impressed by originality of subject touch of weirdness be with joy that accepted herbert offer to take to azure art club where cornpepper clique mostly forgathered since herbert have misinterpreted to cousin matt have read good deal about in paper have held forth brilliantly to interviewer on veracity of rendering of nature cornpepper going so far a to claim that must not look at landscape without feeling from color of stone sea from tint of sky disposition of cloud what oclock be whereupon interviewer have consulted study of poppy on cliff reported that be half past eleven cornpepper cry correct of did not fail to provoke counterblast from academic camp

how cornpepper painted night scene by putting down at fever heat in morning beautiful effect noted absorbed night before in evening cornpepper must return to spot brinkside said if despite waiting must not see same effect must wilfully forget second impression return again again till first condition be repeated matt relieved to find that cornpeppers method be similar to own that genius have esoteric prerogative of method pointed out that in nature infinite permutation effect never recurred exactly a before that therefore for part contented with storing up in mind main value color plane relying on deduction for minuti of course depended on holding total effect original sensation vividly in memory on leaving thanked brinkside with touching humility for instructive interest of
