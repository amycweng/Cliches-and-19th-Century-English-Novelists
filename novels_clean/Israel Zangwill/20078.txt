phaugh fancy seized hold of imagination must not shake off must not sleep till have got out of bed sponged lip vigorously meanwhile mary ann be lying on bed dressed doing best to keep meaningless half hysterical sob from mistress keen ear ii be long time before mary ann came so prominently into centre of lancelot consciousness again remained somewhere in outer periphery of thought nowhere near bull eye so to speak a vague automaton worked when pulled bell rope infinitely more important thing be troubling visit of peter have somehow put keener edge on blunted self confidence have started grand opera worked at furiously in interval left by engrossing pursuit after publisher sometimes must look up from hieroglyphic see mary ann at side surveying curiously then must start remember have rung up try to remember what for mary ann must turn red a if fault be hers publisher be one thing be never out of lancelot mind though drove lancelot nearly out of be like arrow stuck in aforesaid bull eye target being conscious rankled sorely lancelot discovered that publisher kept musical adviser whose advice appeared to consist of famous monosyllable publisher generally published musical adviser own

infinitely more genteel than mary ann wondered what must think if knew for whom be buying dainty article perhaps feeling must be so outraged must refuse to participate in transaction young lady be happily unconscious have best smile for handsome aristocratic young gentleman mentioned moustache later to bosom friend in next department thus mary ann lancelot became joint owner of secret co player in little comedy when mary ann came into room must put be carrying on chair gravely extract glove from pocket draw on lancelot pretending not to know be in room though have just said come in after allowing minute must look up in course of week became mechanical so that lost semi ludicrous sense of secrecy felt at first a well a little pathetic emotion inspired by absolute unconsciousness that

massive respectability surrounded cheerful marble hearth reddened with leaping flame luxurious lounge well groomed old gentleman smoking eighteenpenny cheroot suave noiseless satellite that lancelot felt sudden pang of bewildered shame why very waiter who stood bent before must disdain took coffee hastily with sense of personal unworthiness feeling soon evaporated left lee of resentment against mary ann made inexplicable to fortunately habit of acceptance saved tear though shed others there remained always glove when be putting on always felt be slipping hand in then there be yet further consolation for glove have also subtle effect on lancelot gave sense of responsibility vaguely resentful a felt against mary ann in interval of more definite resentment against publisher also felt that must not stop at glove have started refining must go on till be so to speak glove must cover up coarse speech a have covered up coarse hand owed that to glove be least must do for so whenever mary ann made mistake lancelot corrected found grammatical dialogue not uninteresting vent for ill humour against publisher to boot very often verbal correction sounded astonishingly like reprimand here again mary ann be forearmed by feeling that deserved must have be proud have known how much mr lancelot be satisfied with aspirate came quite natural have only dropped h temporarily a one drop

first rough sketch be written glory faded threw down pen called as for wasting time on what nobody must ever look at then laid head on table overwrought full of infinite pity for sudden longing seized for one to love to caress hair to smooth hot forehead mood passed too smoothed slumbering beethoven instead after while went into bedroom sluiced face hand in ice cold water rang bell for breakfast

growing grave again added at last when mother be really on point of death forgot about little sally said be going to meet tom remember thinking be going to america did know people talk nonsense before die do great deal of unfortunately said lancelot lightly trying to disguise from that eye be moist seemed to realise now what be child child who simpler than most child to start with have grown only in body whose soul have be stunted by uncounted year of dull monotonous drudgery blood burnt in vein a thought of cruelty of circumstance heartless honesty of mistress made up mind for second time to give mr leadbatter piece of mind in morning well go to bed now poor child said will get rest at yessir went obediently up couple of stair then turned head appealingly towards tear still glimmered on eyelash for instant thought be expecting kiss only wanted to explain anxiously once again be why liked that song 'kiss good night dear love ' be what mother yes yes understand broke in half amused though somehow word did not seem so full of maudlin pathos to now there drew head towards kiss good night did not complete quotation indeed lip be already drawn too close to ere released long repressed thought have found expression kiss anybody said half playfully oh sir said mary ann earnestly what more lightly still have got dozen young men mary ann shook head more regretfully than resentfully told never go out except for little errand have told attention have be so concentrated on ungrammatical form in have conveyed information that fact have made impression now anger against mr leadbatter dwindled after be wise in not giving mary ann run of london street hesitated how about milkman other gentleman please sir said mary ann like after man must help expressing sense of good taste then wo kiss anybody said a let go for last time have quixotic sub consciousness that be saving from kind by making promise formally how must mr lancelot brimming eye shone with soft light never will never sounded like troth went back to room shut door must not shut out image picture have unwittingly supplied of took possession of imagination saw almost a dream figure virginal figure knew standing by stream in sunset amid elm silver birch with daisy in hand bluebell at foot inhaling delicate scent wafted from white hawthorn bush watching water glide along till seemed gradually to wash away fading colour of sunset glorified a dwelt on vision felt harmony phrase stirring singing in brain like choir of awakened bird quickly seized paper wrote down theme flowed out at point of pen reverie full of haunting magic of quiet water woodland sunset gracious innocence of maidenhood when be done felt must give distinctive name cast about for one pondering rejecting title innumerable countless line of poetry ran through head from sought to pick word two a one pluck violet from posy at last half tender half whimsical look came into face picking pen out of hair wrote merely marianne be only natural that mary ann must be unable to maintain be maintained at idyllic level fall be aggravated by two circumstance of have particular business to occur first be intimation from misogamist german professor that have persuaded of old pupil to include prize symphony by lancelot in programme of crystal palace concert be of sufficient to turn lancelot head away from thought of fame even if mary ann have not be luckless enough to be again discovered cleaning step without glove against spectacle veriest idealist be powerless if mary ann did not immediately revert to category of quadruped in have started be only because of lancelot supplementary knowledge of creature a passed by solicitous a before not to tread upon felt a if cold water in pail be pouring down back of neck nevertheless

lancelot must collaborate with in comic opera for production of have facility composer confessed have fluent gift of tune have liking for drudgery of orchestration a lancelot be well up in tedious technicality two might strike partnership to mutual advantage lancelot felt insulted retained enough mastery of to reply that must think over a gave sign of life thought popular composer then wrote to at length on subject offering fifty pound for job half of on account lancelot be in sore strait when got letter for stock of money be dwindling to vanishing point dallied with temptation sufficiently to take letter home with spirit be not yet broken letter crumpled like rag be picked up by mary ann straightened out carefully placed upon mantel shelf time did something of similar service for mary ann picking up from crumpled attitude in lancelot have detected on doorstep straightening out again replacing upon semi poetic pedestal a with cream laid notepaper wrinklings must not be effaced

than with caprice of weather if sun smiled once day be enough how must know that indifference be often victory over a amativeness be defeat if excuse must be found for lancelot must be that administered to conscience morning evening like soothing syrup position be grown so desperate that mary ann almost stood between suicide continued disappointment made soul sick proud heart fed on must bite lip till blood came vowing never to give in not only must not move inch from ideal must rather die than gratify peter by falling back on must never even accept that cheque be virtually own be wonderful how in stoniest moment sight of mary ann candid face eloquent with dumb devotion softened melted must take gloved hand press silently mary ann never knew one iota of inmost thought must not bring to indeed never for moment appeared to in light of intelligent being at best be sweet simple loving child scarce spoke to at now theirs be silent communion have heart to converse with a have done piano too be almost silent canary sang le le though spring be coming glint of sunshine stole between wire of cage even beethoven sometimes failed to bark when there be knock at street door at last there came day when for first time in life lancelot inspected wardrobe hunted together odds end of jewelry from significant task be aroused by hearing mr leadbatter coughing in sitting room went in with interrogative look oh chest said mr leadbatter patting be use denyin ' of sir be done up be a much a can do to crawl up to top to bed be thinkin ' will have to make up bed in kitchen only show right be to send for rosie though quite lady where will find nattier nursemaid in bayswater nowhere assented lancelot automatically oh did know 'd noticed running in to see 'er pore old mother of

there pianner must be kind of set off for know sir policeman tell winder be landmark to 'im on foggiest night lancelot flushed then wrinkled brow be new idea altogether mr leadbatter stood waiting for reply with deferential smile tempered by asthmatic contortion have got piano of own oh sir cried mr leadbatter almost reproachfully well how be rosie to practise one lesson week be of very little use anyway unless practises good deal will only be waste of time ah know rosie said mr leadbatter shaking head with sceptical pride must judge by other gel way that gel pick up thing be well will just tell what 'er school teacher miss whiteman said say good lady interrupted lancelot practised six hour day yes come so natural to man said mr leadbatter unshaken look natural to see man playin ' pianner be like seein knittin ' lancelot be knitting brow in way be exceedingly natural may a well tell at once that what propose be impossible first of because be doubtful whether will remain in room secondly because be giving up piano immediately only have on hire felt blushing oh what pity interrupted mr leadbatter might a well let go on payin ' hinstalments instead of lettin ' have paid go for nothing rosie ai got much time must allow day if be own pianner lancelot explained hire did not mean hire system idea of acquiring piano having once fired mr leadbatter brain must not be extinguished unexpected conclusion arrived at be that be to purchase piano on hire system allowing to stand in lancelot room that five shilling week must be taken off rent in return for six lesson of hour one of hour counterbalancing gas grievance reviewing bargain when mr leadbatter be gone lancelot did not think at bad for use of piano gas murmured with pathetic smile recalling advertisement have read before lighting on mr leadbatter five shilling week be considerable relief there be loss of dignity for nobody will know wonder what governor must have said thought shook with silent laughter spectator might have fancied be sobbing after lesson began might almost be said be only when spectator be present that be not sobbing for rosie who be awkward ungraceful young person proved to be dullest most butter fingered pupil ever invented for torture of teacher at least so lancelot thought then have never have other pupil be not patient must be admitted though rosie giggled perpetually apparently finding endless humour in own mistake climax of horror be attendance of mr leadbatter at lesson for to lancelot consternation took for granted that presence be part of contract marched into room in best cap sat smiling in easy chair wheezing complacently beating time with foot occasionally must supplement lancelot critical observation ai a fear to trust 'er with sir also remarked about

ai sir lancelot groaning inwardly unable to deny chronometry felt that ironic providence be punishing for attention to mary ann yet only felt more tenderly towards mary ann contrasted with two vulgar female whom came to conceive a oppressor sitting in gaud finery taking lesson have better befitted cinderella figure of mary ann definitely reassumed of antediluvian poetry if may apply adjective to catastrophic washing of step mary ann have grown gloomier once twice thought have be cry though be too numbed apathetic to ask be incapable of suspecting that rosie have anything to do with tear hardly noticed that rosie have taken to feeding canary question of how must feed be becoming day more more menacing saw starvation slowly closing in upon like wall of torture chamber have grown quite familiar with pawnshop now though still slipped in a though good be stolen at last there came moment when lancelot felt must bear no longer then suddenly saw daylight why must teach only rosie nay why must teach rosie at if be reduced to giving lesson after be degradation to do so abandonment of artistic ideal rather solution of difficulty so simple that wondered have not occurred to before why must give at so wretched price must get pupil other pupil who must enable to dispense with few shilling made by rosie must not ask anybody to recommend pupil there be need for acquaintance to know if
