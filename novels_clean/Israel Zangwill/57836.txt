upstairs for time lay awake pondering over fate of money seemed like cleopatra to be in bond wondering whether poor uncle lilliwhyte be still alive then everything faded into vision of mr flippance jogging marionette for rugged miner who poured out teapot at box office reducing to such swamp that box floated in tea at breakfast finding grandfather abnormally restless asked little maliciously if have slept all right oill sleep better to night said chuckled little seemed indeed very happy at having treasure so well warded though exuberance be alarming felt that excitement of happiness be
