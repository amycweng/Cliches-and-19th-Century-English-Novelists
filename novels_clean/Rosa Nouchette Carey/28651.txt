of shielded happy life love of sister tom god bless make worthy of thought girl with sudden rush of tenderness for dear one at home bessie be early riser dr lambert have always inculcated useful healthy habit in child must inveigh bitterly against self indulgence of young people of present day against modern misuse of time look at pallid sickly complexion of of girl see must say do look fit

be placed be not anxious for girl to marry mean to play minor providence in life a father do must fit for position for dignity of marriage for unselfish duty of single woman dr lambert loved to moralize to womankind have way of standing before fire haranguing family anything must serve a text for discourse of daughter certainly thrived on homely prescription hatty be thorn in father side

harassed youth a dr lambert watched languid step dissatisfied voice must sigh a though thought oppressed with gentleness be very gentle with hatty never yielded suffered one else to yield to wayward caprice dear must say when bessie pleaded for little extra indulgence for hatty must not think hard if say distinctly 'no ' to request may trust know hatty better than do very little must make confirmed invalid be not in power not in power of man living continued doctor with emotion to give poor child health may help great deal by teaching self control half misery proceeds from own nervous

kept place at side mr sefton received rather coldly edna said addressing daughter want to speak to about mackenzie be sitting quite alone one be talking to that tall brother of have not played single game be own fault offered marian atherton for partner age ago play badly a for girl keep aloof from everybody introduced mr sayers major sparkes to have evidently frightened away mamma be engaged for

be very unjust continued edna will not bear from richard confess see gist of remark returned brother who be now growing angry in turn think can be very amusing to miss lambert if mother have objection to keeping up acquaintance with captain grant be duty to give thing up in opinion be right be not sort of friend for edna mother be disliked by officer wife must think sinclair must have right to object to frequent visit to staplehurst be in mood to listen to reason neville know better than to state objection to returned haughtily be quite unnecessary to drag name into present conversation will only trouble to answer one question do absolutely refuse to do favor to drive miss lambert over to staplehurst on thursday must refuse returned richard firmly be quite true that engagement can be put off be so evident that mother object to whole thing will not be party to disobeying wish edna rose from table made profound courtesy thank for moral lecture richard be quite thrown away be not

scapegoat a usual edna will not speak to for week so saying pushed chair away walked to window mr sefton did not answer stepson most likely conscience told that reproach be just one only glanced at bessie grieved face downcast eye proposed to retire drawing room be empty when entered a bessie noticed mr sefton wistful look round room said timidly may go talk to edna dear far better not be reply edna have hot temper take after poor father in must give time to cool will go to presently be very wrong to answer richard in way have so little tact bessie did not trust to reply took book to window

in opinion be wrong acquaintance with edna have be brief have suspicion of intense pride blended with edna wilfulness of tenacity strange in such bright young creature must quietly maintain purpose under careless light hearted exterior edna have evidently be ashamed of outburst of temper on previous evening for came down on sunday morning looking little pale subdued very gentle in manner to mother bessie seemed to ignore richard beyond cold good morning did not vouchsafe word look a overture toward reconciliation be passed over in chilling silence soon left to herself went to church together a walked through lane edna seemed to recover buoyancy laughed chatted with mother made sprightly speech in usual way one must have judged from manner that there be spot of bitterness under smooth surface angry consciousness richard have dared to cross will ah well there be many beside edna who enter god house with darling sin hugged close to bosom fondled cherished truly may say be miserable sinner that there be health in for black plague spot be often hidden under white vesture undetected by human insight clearly legible to eye seeth not a man seeth once bessie looked up from hymn book a edna clear high note reached ear edna seemed singing with heart oh paradise oh paradise who doe not crave for rest brown eye be soft with feeling there be sweet almost angelic look upon

magnanimity from one of droll speech when maud atherton asked where miss lambert be preferred taking walk returned edna be truth not whole truth for a said to herself girl will not have chance of laughing at dear little bessie cleverly changed conversation to safer topic for be quite diplomatist in small way edna be really very good natured thought bessie gratefully a sauntered happily through leafy lane how delicious air felt be june yet there be still crispness of spring felt a though bird have beautiful world to twitterings rustling in thicket be only sound that broke sabbath stillness bessie have just turned into sunny bit of road when abject looking white dog with black patch over eye suddenly wriggled through half closed gate why do believe be bill sykes thought bessie a creature

ceased at last not before edna have grown secretly conscious of lateness of hour be nearly seven before weather allowed to start for last half hour have stood at window quite oblivious of captain grant entreaty that must make herself comfortable evidently deaf to unmeaning compliment for answered absently with manner showed that be ill at ease moment rain ceased asked peremptorily to order pony chaise round mamma will be getting anxious at long delay said so gravely that captain grant dare not disobey will come over next saturday see match with hussar pleaded a gathered up rein perhaps will not promise returned with nod smile oh dear how tiresome last two hour have be have not enjoyed bit bessie be so sorry oh never mind returned bessie wearily then have be silent be in mood to enjoy delicious freshness of evening that clear shining after rain be so indescribable wet gleaming hedge little sparkling pool vivid green of meadow for edna be feeling reaction after excitement bessie tired out with conflicting feeling be thinking regretfully of unsatisfactory conversation with captain broughton serf right after thought penitently father always say that ought to take trouble to please even most commonplace uninteresting person not to let be bored by anyone however uncongenial may be of course be right be just fidgeting about weather how be to get home so did not try to be entertaining here bessie made mental resolution to be more charitable in estimate of people have idea captain broughton have said to a left nice little girl nonsense about not bad sort after woman one see can talk to man without looking for compliment like better than miss sefton just a drive be drawing to close bessie roused up from unwonted depression have turned out of narrow lane wide sweep of country lay before bathed in soft tint of setting sun mass of golden crimson cloud made western heaven glorious meadow be transfigured in yellow radiance hedgerow bush seemed touched by unearthly finger sense of distance of mystery of tranquil rest seemed to pervade world oh edna how beautiful if only one be artist to try paint yes be fine evening remarked edna carelessly thank goodness there be grange at last yes there be richard evidently on lookout for so suppose have finished dinner did think be lost asked with little air of defiance a brother came forward patted pony said gravely told mother rain must have detained be pity went edna sinclair have be here two hour came down in same train with mother neville here edna look changed became rather pale what have brought richard richard shrugged shoulder replied that have not least idea supposed be whim be evident that edna be not too well pleased at news little hardness came into face walked into house without taking notice of bessie a bessie stood hesitating for moment in hall richard followed have not even looked at poor bessie felt sure that manner expressed disapproval will not go into drawing room miss lambert oh mr sinclair be there be not must rather go upstairs take off thing be very tired here bessie faltered little to surprise richard looked at very kindly of course be tired have that long ride edna must not think of take off thing quickly come down to dining room dixon will have something ready for there be coffee going into drawing room will like oh yes please returned bessie touched by thoughtfulness for comfort after must not be angry with perhaps must have time to explain to ask opinion to talk out perplexity how comfortable must be bessie must not stay to change dress only smoothed hair ran down richard be waiting for dixon have just brought in coffee when have gone out of room said eagerly oh mr sefton be so glad to be able to ask question be not vexed with for going to staplehurst with sister vexed returned richard in tone set mind at rest in moment acted exactly a expected to act when mother showed note only said ' never doubted for moment what miss lambert must do must go of course ' yes only hesitated for moment oh what miserable afternoon have be a touched on various incident including tete tete with captain broughton richard listened with much sympathy never dreamed for moment edna must go after be just piece of childish bravado foolish girl doe not think of consequence be most unfortunate thing that sinclair must turn up at moment be little stiff on subject be afraid that be terribly annoyed did mr sefton tell about mother must have given world to hide from edna told that be going in last letter oh know edna a bessie looked extremely surprised at chief virtue be truthfulness will defy to face trample on prejudice will never hide anything actually told mr sinclair yes did to tease believe because last letter did not please sinclair have to put up with good deal can tell wrote back in great hurry begging not to carry out plan sinclair told evening that must not have written stronger letter told that have good reason for wishing to see a little a possible of captain grant when came down just to give pleasant surprise a have leisure evening be quite shock to to find entreaty have be disregarded that have actually gone after be excessively hurt wonder to find edna have so little respect for wish be grievous mistake returned bessie sorrowfully believe edna enjoyed one bit be just freak of temper chose to be self willed about hope will show penitent to sinclair can turn around little finger if like sometimes prefers to quarrel with really think edna enjoys regular flare up finished richard laughing say good quarrel clear air like thunder storm confess that agree with chapter xv will not come bessie did not enter drawing room that evening felt that presence must be decidedly de trop under circumstance made pretext of fatigue reason for retiring to room early richard accepted excuse a though believed in well dare say will be more comfortable agreed mother will be sure to come up wish good night confess now miss lambert be not wishing at home evening of course not replied bessie briskly have not promised ride to morrow same a went upstairs thought talk with mother hatty must have be very soothing be sitting by window thinking over thing in general when there be tap at door mr sefton entered richard told be tired have gone up to bed said more kindly than usual be so sorry dear that have have uncomfortable afternoon edna have be very naughty very naughty indeed richard feel very grateful to for accompanying thought be right thing to do mr sefton yes of course there be nothing else to be done be foolish freak on edna part mr sefton spoke in worried voice face looked tired harassed bessie said a much replied oh yes be worried enough have have fatiguing day in town then when neville entered house expecting welcome there be richard moody face note to greet now to make thing worse edna chooses to be offended at neville coming down in way declares meant to be spy on wo say civil word to yet be for to be displeased think must waive that if must only own have acted ungenerously to must say neville be behaving beautifully speaks a gently a possible edna be in one of temper will not listen to reason be sorry replied bessie looking so full of sympathy that mr sefton relaxed from usual cold dignity oh dear said now there be tear in eye be afraid be fault have indulged edna too much given own way in everything now tyrannizes over if have only acted differently here poor woman sighed bessie echoed sigh must think of nothing to say must comfort mr sefton be evidently reaping effect of own injudicious weakness have not taught child to practice self discipline self control waywardness have be fostered by indulgence temper have become more faulty what man be there of whom if son ask bread will give stone asked divine teacher yet there be many parent who offer stony gift to child loading with false kindness indulgence leaving evil weed unchecked teaching everything one thing needful oh how different from mother thought bessie when be left alone recalled time when young will have be over strong there have be difficult point in character yet how sensibly how tenderly mother have dealt with have never be blind to one of child fault up to certain age have be habit on eve of birthday to talk quietly to pointing out failing defective habit giving opinion on year improvement on birthday one ought to begin afresh must say make new start how well bessie must remember talk gentle word of praise generally closed be almost sorry when be too grown up for quiet self examination took place of fond maternal admonition when bessie joined family at breakfast found mr sinclair helping edna with urn accosted bessie with much friendliness seemed pleased to see again have be prepossessed with at first meeting thought manner still pleasanter on second occasion be struck afresh with air of quiet refinement took part in conversation with much animation talked more to richard than to one else edna did not appear to have recovered took very little notice of anybody received fiance attention rather ungraciously bessie thought looked a though have not slept well eye have heavy look in a though head ached bessie have ride directly afterward a richard assisted to mount mr sinclair stood on step watched what be edna going to do with yourselves asked richard presently mr sinclair smiled will do edna like perhaps will drive somewhere look a though fresh air must do good will have to go back to town evening so must make most of day in country house be so still when returned that bessie thought have started for drive when ran upstairs to take off habit seated presently by one of drawing room window with work wondering what everyone be doing work interested be quietly enjoying when heard quick footstep in hall outside moment afterward door slammed have come back suppose thought bessie worked on until drawing room door opened mr sinclair came in alone seemed surprised to see bessie next minute have crossed room hastily miss lambert will do favor can not find mr sefton have one else to ask certainly returned bessie rose at once mr sinclair looked pale troubled manner be extremely nervous then will be so good a to beg edna to come down to for moment have misunderstood be wish to speak to there be slight misconception edna have gone to own room will go at once exclaimed bessie feeling convinced by manner that something be very wrong edna must have quarrelled with again ran upstairs knocked on edna door received answer be not locked however after moment hesitation entered edna have evidently not heard be standing by window in walking dress a bessie spoke to attract attention turned round frowned angrily something in face made bessie breathless with apprehension what do want asked harshly mr sinclair sent pleaded bessie be very anxious to speak to begs that will come downstairs think that there be mistake there be mistake replied edna slowly may tell so for why not tell edna because have have enough of mr sinclair company morning because nothing must induce to speak to again thought have locked door to prevent intrusion suppose forgot please give message that there be mistake oh none at bessie hesitated look at edna face showed that entreaty at moment must be in vain so went out of room without word mr sinclair be standing just where have left looked at anxiously bessie shook head will not come said sorrowfully will not did give reason send message only that there be mistake repeated that more than once perhaps will change mind in little while mr sinclair did not seem to hear mistake then meant meant muttered face became quite changed have walked to window came back again thank miss lambert be very much obliged to said a though feeling have be deficient in politeness before must reply have left room gong sounded for luncheon directly afterward bessie found dining room empty so sat down to work again bye bye dixon brought message that mistress be waiting mr sefton be in room alone motioned bessie to seat began to carve chicken before one else made appearance mr sefton did not apologize for absence scarcely eat anything made attempt to sustain conversation looked preoccupied troubled a soon a meal be over begged bessie to amuse a have important business to settle left room bessie passed solitary afternoon though book be interesting attention often wandered be sure something be seriously wrong felt vaguely unhappy on edna account must not forget mr sinclair face when have brought that message be a though have received blow that scarcely knew how to bear dixon brought tea told that mistress miss edna be having theirs in dressing room later on a went indoors to prepare for dinner encountered richard have just driven up to door in dog cart brand gelert be with where be mr sinclair ventured to ask a smiled at seeing have gone replied have just driven to station do know where mother be to be found have not seen since luncheon answered bessie think be with edna very likely will go see richard sprung up staircase three step at time bessie thought looked tired worried too to add to general oppression storm seemed gathering for air felt unusually still sultry edna did not join at dinner meal be hardly more festive than luncheon have be mr sefton hardly opened lip richard only made few general remark bessie expected that evening must be a solitary a afternoon rather to surprise mr sefton beckoned to sit down beside dear said be feeling very uncomfortable can see like to ask question think something be matter be right edna be making very unhappy have quarrelled with neville have broken off engagement with nothing richard can say to will induce to listen to reason oh mr sefton how dreadful yes be not heart breaking poor neville be so devoted to be to have be married next spring now edna declares that nothing must induce to marry will have that be jealous monopolizing that

certainly fond of then will be too late have really sent away yes told to go that never wanted to see again have gone poor fellow richard drove to station say never saw man so terribly cut up told richard just at last that perhaps might prove best for in end that be not suited to other never have be that edna have never shown temper quite so plainly before oh mr sefton how terrible seems can nothing be done nothing in voice of despair richard have talked to for hour be use declares that be good thing neville at last understand other that will never repent decision yet time look utterly wretched will not own be just pride temper finished unhappy mother must stand by see sacrifice own happiness say nothing may go up to mr sefton do think must care to see think will see now be not good for to be alone will find very hard impracticable will not mind that if will only let be with little can not bear to think of shut up with only miserable thought to keep company here bessie eye filled with tear for be very sympathetic soft hearted then go to dear hope may do good bessie went at once just outside door met richard be on way to drawing room be going up to edna said a looked at inquiringly oh mr sefton be so sorry for be making one else miserable be more sorry for sinclair returned face looked very stern a spoke have treated abominably wait moment miss lambert a seemed about to leave there be hurry be there have not spoken to to day do think be wise to mix up in mother be thinking more of edna than of will do good only make miserable leave edna alone to night come play to instead mr sefton never thought must be so selfish laughed outright a bessie said very seriously never trust man be of selfish to tell truth be not thinking of own enjoyment at minute wanted to save hour unpleasantness see prefer to make miserable think do in present instance returned bessie quietly very well have own way if take advice will not waste pity upon edna be flinging away happiness with eye open just to gratify temper see can speak plainly miss lambert call thing by right name just out of pride self will be bidding good bye to one of best fellow living time know that be good fellow wo find neville sinclair tell be just because be doing that be sorry for replied bessie please keep mr sefton understand how can if have died if anything else have separated must be so much

edna in mother dressing room large comfortable room much used by mother daughter when be tired indisposed mr sefton generally used a morning room be fitted up somewhat luxuriously bessie found edna lying on couch in white tea gown with novel in hand pink shade of lamp threw rosy glow over everything at first sight bessie thought looked much a usual first word too be said in ordinary tone so have found way up at last exclaimed throwing down book with air of disgust weariness head ached afternoon so mamma thought have better stay here quietly be head better now yes thanks only book be so stupid think novel be stupid nowadays hero be so gaudy heroine have not spark of spirit may talk to instead if like what have be doing with day bessie be dumb with amazement be pride be edna acting part pretending not to care must break lover heart one minute talk of novel next bessie simplicity be at fault must make nothing of why be looking at in way asked edna fretfully on receiving answer a raised on cushion bessie must see face more plainly looked very pale eye be painfully bright then gave hard little laugh have mirth in so mamma richard have be talking to what transparent little creature be bessie be dreadfully shocked be not have sent neville about business oh edna please talk about in way if talk about at must be in own way if neville thought must not live without find mistaken now be not sort of girl who must put up with tyranny other people may submit to be ordered about treated like child be not one of edna surely consider that owe duty to man have promised to marry none will never owe duty here edna manner became excited be mamma ought to obey will not always yield to have never given neville right to lecture control man will man angrily edna how can bear to part with mr sinclair when be so good love so much can bear very well can do without replied obstinately at least have regained liberty become own mistress will console for making miserable oh edna if have only seen face when gave message be sure must have relented have gone away unhappy let go yes let go how dare come down here to spy on movement captain grant indeed be of piece jealously be unbearable will no longer put up with why do talk about bessie know mr neville mr sinclair mean be stranger to have given plenty to bear during engagement have difficult nature doe not suit mine must

made too miserable one will speak to be affair one have right to meddle mamma take part richard too one be against can not influence finished edna proudly mr sefton be right can do good thought bessie sorrowfully seems a though demon of pride have taken possession of girl mr sinclair be nothing to to night be only conscious of own proud injured feeling bessie showed wisdom by ceasing to argue point let edna talk on without checking until have exhausted then rose bade good night edna seemed taken aback be going to leave bessie yes be very late mother will be coming up directly can do good one must to night will go pray for instead will pray for may ask why will not even tell to night must be use evil spirit will not let listen edna have stopped ear too to night be in power have placed at

be angry at plain speaking for really want to do good edna made answer yielded cheek coldly to bessie kiss if something wet touched face took apparent notice bessie must not restrain tear a left room oh why why be people so mad wicked how must one calling by sacred name of christian suffer to be overmastered by bitter angry passion be just temper mr sefton be right thought bessie mind be so oppressed by thought of edna wretchedness that be long before must compose to sleep rose at usual early hour wrote out of fullness of heart to mother not mentioning fact relieving overwrought feeling by loving word be very sweet to mother think be good to go away sometimes from one belonging wrote bessie absence make one realize one blessing more think ever felt more thankful have mother than last night when edna be talking in way troubled when bessie went downstairs after finishing letter be much surprised to see edna in usual place pouring out coffee looked little pale heavy eyed one must

of morbid humor difficult tendency have refined cultured mind chief source of fretfulness be that loved best failed to reach very loftiness of standard produced despondency akin to despair faith be pure feeble hated everything false mean despised conventionality of life while bessie laughed at bessie have ideal simple secret crude girlish notion be nevertheless very true sweet bessie must make allowance for hatty sharp speech a watched daily struggle with faulty temper must rejoice in hatty victory more that have borne so patiently with failure there be abiding sting in grief now remorseful
