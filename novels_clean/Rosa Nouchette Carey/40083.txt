when be out not that ever do go out heaven know declare quite envy thorold going out morning to work woman life be far more dull monotonous than men here joanna voice waxed more plaintive than ever be naturally rather sweet voice fretfulness discontent have deadened harmony if a say closing of eyelid will shut out lustre of planet so to joanna small everyday worry seemed to obliterate larger grander interest of life jemima good look lover small impertinence misdemeanour loomed like gigantic shadow on horizon if must only learn right proportion of thing thorold have said once to althea almost in despair when joanna made dolorous little speech thorold raised eye from plate looked at why do not go to red house oftener asked gravely know how glad must be to have stay at home too much joa be own fault know doreen althea be always sending invitation yes know be very fond of althea somehow never care to go to red house reminds too much of dear old manor house that room of althea make quite shiver when enter must not give way to feeling joa returned hastily in life one have to harden one self to sort of thing be use moping brooding over trouble can not be altered if jemima want to go out perhaps have better not wait longer then lighted reading lamp unfolded paper in spite of well cooked chop supper have certainly not be more festive than usual then strange fancy came to thorold how must be with if younger brighter face be to be opposite to evening after evening must not home humble a be be very different place knew why be happier in chamber at lincoln inn to reserved

pondered thorold advice a unravelled skein of yarn be somewhat tangled a pulled with nervous jerk yarn snapped ball rolled from hand thorold suppressed forcible interjection a groped under chair for ball if ever married determined that one of first rule must make for wife guidance must be that wool winding must be done by daylight joanna have tiresome habit of leaving tangled skein for comparative leisure of evening hour thorold used to wonder sometimes if skein be tangled got on nerve sometimes spoilt enjoyment of reading joanna limp nerveless movement jerky beginning abrupt ending brief spasm of energy inevitable hunt for unlucky ball irritated at time beyond endurance be quite ridiculous almost derogatory to one dignity to think how much daily life be marred by small fret torment buzzing of bluebottle against window pane be certainly preferable to brass band when instrument be cracked whizzing fizzing of insect may in time jar on ear to thin skinned people midge bite be fruitful of irritation joanna be making up mind slowly that brother have given good counsel that perhaps must be well for to follow be master of house if wished to keep joanna of course girl must stay when joanna have arrived at point broke thread of yarn again thought there be something wanted to tell thorold said rather reproachfully when have found new beginning have brought work be ready

paring candle end know what mean thorold returned joanna in puzzled tone never use candle except in coal cellar then thorold gave grim unmirthful laugh if ever married lady of choice must have sense of humour nothing be more harassing trying to temper than to have to talk down to level of one daily companion althea once said rather wittily that joa brain be like nutmeg grater one have to rub one nutmeg very hard before spicy fragment must filter through perhaps may have better house soon said after pause must like to be out of town higher up hill air be fresher must be quieter oh yes much

waveney instinctively dreaded surprised look curious questioning feared awaited idea of joanna pity betty welcoming caress seemed alike repugnant when thorold opened parlour door drew back a though afraid to enter gently led in be out said quietly can rest get warm then drew up easy chair to fire placed in brought footstool next moment with careful hand removed hat put cushion under head then drew off glove gently rubbed benumbed finger waveney submitted to passively warmth stillness soothed in spite of herself when thorold left room to speak to jemima rested weary head against soft cushion closed eye how kind be how kind one be then of sudden great tear welled up in eye little parlour with drawn crimson curtain bright fire seemed to fade from sight be sitting on bench in old ranelagh garden mollie be beside sunlight be filtering through lime child be flitting to fro like butterfly here be noticeable man with large grey eye be saying must hear sweet scornful laughter in reply dear miss ward please drink will warm do good thorold spoke in clear persuasive voice a waveney opened eye tear be rolling down small white face why did rouse said with little sob be dreaming be so lovely be sitting with mollie be laughing talking together oh mollie mollie here fit of bitter weeping seemed to shake from head to foot power on earth must have hindered flow of tear for one

entering lodge gate at moment leant forward in darkness lifted cold little hand to lip yes be wrong said tenderly a though be speaking to child will never be so foolish again will take care of for sake of who love then dropped hand a gleam of light from open door streamed across shrubbery a cab stopped saw althea standing in porch with light fleecy wrap thrown over head oh waveney exclaimed in anxious tone a thorold lifted girl out where have be then a caught sight of waveney face dear child look dreadful what have happened nothing have happened returned thorold impatiently miss ward be not
