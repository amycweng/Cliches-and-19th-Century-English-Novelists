rare in secluded life with exception of doctor clergyman perhaps sympathising neighbour few ever invaded privacy of laurel cottage light well assured footstep sounded strange in mildred ear listened with inward perturbation to susan brief colloquy with stranger mistress be disengaged must send in name business must walk in door be flung open little testily by susan who objected to innovation on usual afternoon quiet 'forgive if be intruding miss lambert brother told might call 'dr heriot 'yes have kept promise then have written to inform of intended visit have heard so much of other that be

superior mildred have taken measurement of dr heriot in own quiet way long before have exhausted feminine budget of conversation fineness of weather long dusty journey need of refreshment inquiry after brother health spirit 'he be not man to be embarrassed business baffle ' thought to herself 'he be ill at ease unhappy must try meet way accordingly mildred began in straightforward manner 'it be long way to come up on business dr heriot arnold told have difficulty though did not explain nature strange to say spoke a though must be of assistance to ' ' have right to burden ' returned somewhat incoherently 'you look little fit now to cope with such responsibility a must fall to share must not rest change be beneficial before entering on new work ' be not talking of ' returned
