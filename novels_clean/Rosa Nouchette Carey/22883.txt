day passed quietly dr luttrell professed perfectly satisfied with patient progress in spite of delicate aspect terrible hardship have experienced robert barton proved that have fair amount of recuperative power perhaps youth be in favour be soon evident that have naturally sanguine temperament nature be singularly ill balanced be always in extreme either in depth of depression else unaccountably excited olivia must sometimes find crouching over fire with head between hand in state of morose misery at other time must hear whistling few bar from opera in quite light hearted way if mind olive think that barton have better come down to morrow afternoon marcus observed one evening will get on faster a olivia made objection to matter be settled marcus secretly wondered how robert

be starving on doorstep supping off dry bread thin cocoa in casual ward dear old fellow know world better than robert barton be black sheep not charity can wash white mr gaythorne be evidently in one of obstinate mood thought prudent to say no more on subject robert barton must be able to vindicate without difficulty when mr gaythorne saw sketch of dot kitten must be more lenient in judgment of

have paid evening visit be able to assure that little visit have done patient harm mr gaythorne have stipulated that must see son alone dr luttrell who be keenly alive to danger of strong excitement have decided to remain in house during interview alwyn seemed so unnerved miserable that be impossible to do more than give word of warning say a little a possible gaythorne have observed a walked across together if take advice will just let bygone be bygone be more emotional than can help remember how ill have be very little excites though alwyn only nodded in answer to marcus be sure that understood a stood by hall fire caressing eros must not help feeling very anxious be of to be trusted thought determined that if talk be too prolonged must make excuse to go in interrupt then raised head uneasily listened a sound of man stifled sob reached ear be what have feared that alwyn weak unstrung must break down utterly next moment dr luttrell have opened door of library neither of perceived a stood for moment watching with keen professional eye alwyn be kneeling with face hidden on father knee mr gaythorne clasped hand be resting on head boy must say whispered forgive trespass a forgive marcus heard more closed door again softly scene be too sacred not even to dearer self wife did ever speak of what have seen prodigal have eaten fill of husk have returned to father roof father love in case father have also sinned for surely undue severity exacting hardness failure of sympathy be sin to be bitterly repented one can gather grape of thorn glean corn from harvest of tare parent who have first unwisely indulged son then ruled with rod of iron can well claim glad obedience of free son if alwyn gaythorne trammelled embittered by father tyranny have dashed recklessly down path lead to destruction father have first driven to verge of frenzy young limb will not always adjust to procrustean bed alwyn who have inherited father strong will refused to bear yoke of despotism must rather starve have room to breathe have once said to greta there be room here half hour passed before dr luttrell ventured into room again found mr gaythorne leaning back in chair looking very white exhausted with peaceful expression on face alwyn have just left side be standing by window with miniature in hand dr luttrell observed old man feebly a gave restorative son will stay with to

if will go into next room will see presently alwyn nodded be all right happiness never kill observed mr gaythorne for matter of grief must just bide time then with flash of strong feeling in deeply set eye held out hand to young doctor god bless luttrell say have be like brother to a for wife have word for goodness may heaven repay for what have done for boy when marcus returned home found greta sitting with wife looked at anxiously mr gaythorne will not part with son informed mr crampton be getting room ready for so labour will be lightened livy look tired doe not miss williams though will not confess well have passed off well mr gaythorne be very much exhausted nurse be getting to bed have told alwyn to rest left mr crampton fussing round so will be right then olivia smiled a though be

venture to link life with man whom must not wholly respect greta nature be noble one have lofty aim high sense of duty in spite of gentleness have plenty of firmness backbone be one thing to be sorry for old friend playmate to show sister tenderness quite to give to more than once olivia have felt uneasy delicacy have led to keep thought to herself do hope must not carry sacrifice to such length a said young wife to herself alwyn may be lovable must never satisfy girl like greta woman ought to be able to look up to husband a look up to dear marcus not be always trying to drag up to level do want greta to be married when father dy will be so utterly alone can not reconcile to marrying alwyn gaythorne for one thing health be so unsatisfactory that wife must never be easy about eyen marcus

hospital be fine work doubt for anyone who have vocation may a well tell miss williams not to ask advice have not physical strength besides in position idea be absurd why take bread out of other woman mouth just counsel to patience in few month will see way wind blow for though word have yet passed between marcus be quite aware of alwyn gaythorne penchant for old playfellow though idea be hardly more pleasing to than be to olivia there be not enough of said to doe not come up to mark be not money for mr gaythorne be rich man son will have plenty stand on higher plane than in humble opinion
