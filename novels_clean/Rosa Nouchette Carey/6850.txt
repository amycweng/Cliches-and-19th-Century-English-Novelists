clambering after holding tightly to dress dot watched wistfully a went higher higher leaving flossy behind seaweed impeded after little while came to bare piece of rock jutting out over cave with scooped out corner where of must huddle seemed to a though shelf went on for yard two beyond be above water mark there must be quite safe delicious glimmer of hope came over have great difficulty in inducing flurry to stay behind while crawled down for dot be afraid to be alone in dark place with hollow booming of wind wave echoing round told sternly that dot flossy must be drowned then let go dot be overjoyed to welcome back then lifted up bade crawl slowly on hand knee while followed with crutch flossy crept after shivering whining for to take up a toiled up broken ledge seemed to grow darker must hardly see other face if tried only splash of first entering wave warned that sea must soon have be upon be giddy breathless by time reached nook where flurry be then crept into corner child clasping other across flossy on lap licking face alternately saved from horrible death for little while must hing weep helplessly over child thank god for merciful deliverance a soon a first hysterical outburst of emotion be over did best to make child a comfortable a must under such forlorn circumstance knew flurry terror of darkness must well imagine how horribly water must foam splash beneath must try prevent from seeing made dot climb into lap for thought hard rock must make poor back ache must keep from being chilled then induced flurry to creep under heavy waterproof cloak how

anguish for child poor child who be whispering baby prayer together that kept still perhaps might be even now at mouth of cave seeking calling to dozen time imagined must hear splash of oar hoarse cry of sailor how must feeble voice reach in face of shrieking wind one must think of smugler cave for be one of many hollowed out of cliff must search for very soon must abandon in despair knew have gone to seek child most likely have be too late rising tide have engulfed swept far out to sea miss ruth must think of dream tremble wretched father must sit by stunned helpless waiting for morning to break bring proof of despair tear ran down cheek a sad thought passed through mind strong inward cry for deliverance for endurance for present comfort in awful misery shook frame with convulsive shudder dot felt clasped tighter flurry trembled in sympathy paroxysm disturbed prayer be heard brief agony passed thought of jeremiah in dungeon of daniel in lion den of three child in fiery furnace form be like son of god walking with in midst of flame knew felt that be a safe on rocky shelf with dark raging water below a though be by own bright hearth fire at home then trembling ceased recovered voice to talk to child wanted to go to sleep flurry said in lamentable voice that be too hungry sea made noise so told about shadrach meshech abednego after have finished that bible story

tranquillized child so repeated hymn slowly monotonously until nodded against fell into weary slumber thank god murmured when perceived leaned back against rock tried to close eye must keep opening staring into darkness be not black darkness think must have borne that sort of murky half light seemed reflected from water from somewhere glimmered strangely from background of inky blackness be bitterly cold now foot felt numbed spray wetted chilled face dared not move arm from dot leaned so heavily against flurry head be against have curled up like flossy have one hand free only must not disentangle from cloak dared not change cramped position for fear of waking be too thankful for brief oblivion if must only doze for few moment if must only shut out black water for minute tumult of thought be indescribable whole life seemed to pas before childish folly girlish error sin seemed to rise up before conversation have forgotten little incident of family life dull otherwise speech have made repented till head seemed whirling must be midnight now thought if must only dare new terror kept wide awake in spite of protecting arm must not dot suffer from damp chilliness shivered in sleep flurry moaned half woke then slept again be growing so numbed cramped that doubted endurance for much longer dot seemed growing heavier there be weight of flurry flossy if must only stretch then nearly cried out for sudden flash seemed to light cavern one instant be gone that second showed grewsome scene damp black wall with frothing turbulous water beneath hanging arch exuding moisture darkness again from whence have that light flashed a asked question came again startling with sudden brilliancy time be certainly from aperture overhead little beyond where sat gone again time utterly not before caught glimpse of broad rocky shelf beyond light have flashed down not dozen yard from where stood must have be lantern if so be still seeking time on cliff be only midnight there be still four weary hour to wait moment be growing more chilled numbed began to dread consequence to myself a well a to child if must only crawl along shelf explore perhaps there might be opening to cliff have not thought of before until light brought idea to mind perceived too that glimmering half light came from above not from mouth of cave for moment fear of losing balance falling back into water daunted kept from moving next minute felt must attempt unfastened cloak woke dot softly then whispered to be cramped in pain must move up down platform understood crawled sleepily off lap then lifted flurry with difficulty for moaned whimpered at touch numbness be so great must hardly move limb crawled across flurry somehow saw dot creep into place covered with cloak then commenced to move slowly carefully on hand knee up rocky path chapter xviii brave girl told afterward that be daring feat fraught with awful peril for in painful groping in darkness might have lost balance fallen back into water be conscious of at time can not die until hour be come in youth one faith be more simple trusting to pray be to be heard to grasp more tightly by mantle of providence so committed to heaven crept slowly along face of rock in two three minute felt cold air blowing down upon face raising cautiously found be standing under aperture large enough for to crawl through led to down for one moment breathed fresh night air caught glimmer of starlight then crept back to child flurry be awake weeping piteously dot be trying to comfort in sleepy voice be quiet moment told about hole must leave behind dot said sorrowfully take flurry first brave little fellow said right essie held back dog who be whining to follow put arm round flurry made promise not to lose hold of rock poor child be dreadfully frightened stopped now then cry out in horror that be falling into water held fast coaxed to go on again time clammy dew of terror stood on forehead never to dying day will forget terrible

horizon of present monotony suffering here consolation of gospel came to help severe test of faith proved reality submission total abnegation of will brought truest comfort in hour of need looking back on part of life believe carrie needed just discipline like many other earnest worker made idol of work cost month of suffering before realized that god doe not always need work that chastened will be more acceptable to than labor think so all sufficient sad lesson to poor human pride belief so much in own effort yet many one laid by in vigor of life work have to learn so painfully oh
