chelsea on friday if like to come to then guest chamber be remarkably small at present hold lumber little else a cedric professed indifferent on subject of own comfort assertion drew covert smile from friend lip matter be soon settled animated conversation ensued consisting mainly of disjointed monologue on cedric part for malcolm herrick only contributed laconic remark question at interval there be kindly gleam in eye a listened a though fair closely cropped head lying back on shabby cushion with eager bright young face be goodly spectacle at first sight friendship between two men seemed singularly ill assorted for what possible affinity must there be between thoughtful intellectual man like malcolm herrick with habitual reserve nature refined critical yet imaginative with strong bias to pessimism intolerance of sham cedric with facile pleasure loving temperament at once indolent mercurial creature of mood tense a fiery a welshman full of lovable generous impulse disparity between age also seemed to forbid anything like equality of sympathy malcolm be at least eight nine year older at time seemed middle aged in cedric eye be such regular old fossil must say cut dried specimen of humanity that be impossible to keep in touch with stand to reason that must clash bit there in spite of crank herrick be good fellow notwithstanding faint praise inhabitant of wood house knew well that there be one whom cedric valued more than friend malcolm herrick chapter ii fallen among thief why insist on rash personal relation with friend why go to house know mother brother sister why be visited by at own be thing material to covenant leave touching clawing let be to spirit emerson malcolm herrick be devout disciple of emerson always spoke of a one of master mind that dominated humanity be chosen gamaliel at whose foot must sit for ever must say on subject speaks well wisely once when be strolling through kensington garden with sister friend anna sheldon have electrified by quoting favourite passage from essay on friendship friendship requires that rare mean betwixt likeness unlikeness pique with presence of power of consent in other party let be alone to end of world rather than friend must overstep by word look real sympathy be equally baulked by antagonism by compliance let not cease instant to be better be nettle in side of friend than echo malcolm have uttered last sentence in rather tragic tone be somewhat offended when girl laughed what odd idea observed innocently must strongly object to anything so stinging a nettle perhaps be because be woman must prefer echo malcolm who have received douche of cold water from feminine criticism declined to be drawn into discussion on subject woman be so illogical muttered angrily anna heaven of content be suddenly clouded malcolm approval be vitally necessary to happiness chilling word from have power to spoil fairest landscape blot out sunshine nevertheless took rebuff meekly without retort mere chance accident in destiny of men have brought about acquaintance between malcolm herrick cedric templeton vice president of magdalene be old friend of herrick family be indeed distantly related to mr herrick after malcolm have taken degree left lincoln often spent week two with dr medcalf be old bachelor one of most sociable of men room be envy of friend malcolm be great favourite with be always

young undergraduate be seated on bench with head in hand at sound of passing footstep moved slightly malcolm caught sight of white boyish face haggard eye that looked at little wildly then covered face again malcolm walked on few step kind heart be shocked at lad evident misery to reserved nature be never easy to make first advance indeed often remarked that have rather fellow feeling with levite who passed by on other side daresay be sorry for poor traveller in heart observed take deal of moral courage to be good samaritan be not easy for shy man for example to render first aid to poor chap with fractured limb in middle of crowd of sympathising bystander one self consciousness british hatred of scene seem to choke one off so true to diffident nature malcolm walked to other end of addison walk then something seemed to drag at retraced step slowly reluctantly finally a though constrained by unseen power that overmastered reserve sat down on bench touched youth lightly on arm be in trouble fear be there anything can do to help word be simple almost to bluntness be none worse for for rang true from good heart malcolm voice be pleasant when chose must be winning persuasive to lad sitting there in egyptian darkness of terrifying despair sounded honey sweet put out hot hand to new friend then broke into fit of tear sob oh can help gasped out wanted to drown hang sooner than disgrace only thought of dinah must do then a grew calmer little judicious questioning few more kind word brought out whole story have fallen into bad hand two three men older richer than have got hold of for own purpose have led into mischief culminating misfortune have happened previous evening when have induced to play at card stake be high though boy be too much fuddled by champagne to

proctor have vowed to make example of next fellow caught gambling say always keep word how much do owe asked malcolm when cedric in low voice mentioned sum malcolm gave whistle of dismay wonder be in despair if have not drunk too much must have stopped playing when saw be losing went on cedric in contrite tone plied with liquor got reckless then knew more till found in bed with clothes on cedric

sleeve with feverish restless hand understand know dinah must break heart elizabeth too be such good woman allow for fellow temptation have broken word how do mean dear lad gave sacred promise not to play for money know why dinah be always so afraid of that never thought of other thing cedric hung head in shame must not believe be possible be always debt not paying one bill that dinah feared sister be right templeton returned malcolm somewhat sternly wait moment must think over thing see what be to be done then rose from bench paced slowly up down hundred twenty pound lost in single night to professional card sharper thought rogue ought to be shown up only must involve end of lad university career malcolm knew proctor well not even first offence must receive merciful verdict if only boy must throw upon sister compassion woman be so soft hearted forgave so easily cedric have refused have even used strong language when adviser pressed obstinate young beggar growled must serve right to let get out of mess by then relented from severity rapidly added up sum in head result of calculation be satisfactory have just that amount lying idle at banker mother made liberal allowance be beginning to turn honest penny by literary work at time be still occupant of mother house so expense be not great yes will risk thought with one of sudden impulse took other people a well a by surprise then walked quickly up to cedric look here templeton exclaimed have made up mind to go bail for whole amount be too late now to do anything to morrow will see fellow give bit of mind friend card sharper will have to make track anyhow will pay up good heaven mr herrick mean mean here cedric must not utter word more for voice be choked with sob malcolm must just gather few incoherent expression benefactor god bless eternal gratitude such phrase tut nonsense returned malcolm testily eye be not quite clear laid kindly hand on boy shoulder want thanks only must promise on word a english gentleman never to play for money a long a be here promise will vow if like there be nothing nothing must not promise mr herrick have saved from disgrace dinah from broken heart hush hush please let say one thing more be loan of course understand that may be year before pay back if live will be paid back penny oh can talk about in future returned malcolm quickly have little hope that cedric must ever be able to repay will be paid replied lad firmly sister be very good to have more than need malcolm good sense knowledge of human nature made hold tongue must be pity to damp lad good resolution probably small sacrifice petty self denial necessary to settlement of debt must be valuable training help to make man of so said nothing further on subject few minute later parted malcolm kept promise before next day be over have paid cedric debt of honour with stern word of caution to tempter turned chill with dismay from day cedric attached to benefactor with dog like fidelity devotion secretly touched malcolm during latter brief visit to oxford be seldom apart in spite of disparity between age marked difference in taste warm mutual attachment sprang up between two malcolm be soon put in possession of cedric history manner of life from boyhood listened to copious anecdote of home school day be soon made aware of cedric crowning ambition to take part in oxford cambridge race that honour be dream purpose of life other purpose to compete for civil service examination at close of university life seemed relegated to background scarcely entered into thought at though malcolm dropped warning word from time to time dared not put too much pressure on lad for recognised intuitively how body mind be developing under athlete training cedric fame a oarsman soon reached ear of authority at time of visit to lincoln inn be already foregone conclusion that name must be entered for next race talked of for time then a storm still raged malcolm handed visitor own copy of

stepmother once told so bey boy have two mother dinah ' be very word well be son of consolation dinah heaved gentle sigh a though motherhood within divine maternal instinct inherent in true woman felt satisfied at breakfast next morning malcolm proffered service elizabeth assured that cedric johnson must do be required so spent morning indolently down by pool reading indulging in favourite daydream until cedric joined cedric looked heated tired never saw such person a betty for getting work out of fellow grumbled must do splendidly on rice plantation must nigger fly just why set rolling tennis lawn because wanted johnson then have to bicycle over to rotherwood for something have be forgotten took out in cool drink though can tell word bet doe know how to make prime claret cup cedric smacked lip with air of veteran gourmand then sparred at malcolm called absent minded beggar asked if have finished ode to naiad of pool made sundry other aggravating remark proved that be in excellent spirit

long curling lash be considered very alluring do please be good kind to poor little harmless thing like seemed to say to fresh comer for be such nice man malcolm who saw plenty of girl in town took notice of little country chit air grace indeed thought nora brent far more attractive human kitten not being to taste think much of fine gentleman from london whispered tina rather venomously to nora when game be finished hate town prig like poison anyhow played splendidly have given regular beating returned friend who must willingly have exchanged partner there be nothing exciting in playing with

mondayish do know what mean herrick can guess be purely clerical term have taken out of then feel sort of reaction rather to speak more correctly sort of depression a spoke realised for first time truth of elizabeth assertion that mr carlyon be not strong elizabeth have never looked better in malcolm opinion than did that afternoon if have not admired before must have owned then that be distinguished looking woman wore gray dress of soft material malcolm who be rather connoisseur on feminine attire decided in own mind be paris gown strange to say be right black gainsborough hat feather suited exactly be evident mr carlyon agreed with for malcolm saw once looking at intently under hand little while afterwards malcolm who be too hot to play more strolled off by down one of woodland path to get cool to chagrin heard voice told speaker be parallel with next minute heard tina ross say pettishly did ever see one so ridiculous a elizabeth templeton just fancy wearing paris

have mr herrick for partner oh be town prig began tina recklessly here malcolm who have cleared voice in vain now began to whistle with such unmistakable purpose that dead silence ensued what spiteful little toad thought malcolm who cared nothing for fluffy hair curling eyelash if shrewish tongue accompanied thought girl avoided in rather guilty fashion when passed on terrace be inwardly disgusted when most of guest having taken leave supper being announced elizabeth asked to take miss tina ross into dining room nora followed with mr carlyon width of table separated malcolm paid young lady proper attention be to say kept plate supplied with good thing otherwise took very little notice of talked to gentle looking mr brent who be on other side tina be not used to being ignored by time have made up mind that malcolm must only have heard fragment of talk in woodland so addressed pointedly obliged to break off something be saying to elder lady so dined at vicarage on saturday hear how dreadfully bored must have be mr charrington be old dear be rather prig mean transfixed by sudden gleam in malcolm eye mean be that be so learned oh be quite aware of meaning miss ross returned

heart cherry of greengage be packed into perambulator sponge cake crisp little brown loaf be also purchased for kit tea then went rejoicing on way a malcolm walked on made up mind that first act when

when mr herrick joined said head have begun aching again that must go to bed malcolm wished good night at foot of staircase watched until be out of sight mother looked at little keenly when rejoined

on balcony a passed out cheery good night son floated down to a stood listening to departing footstep said to herself be changed somehow be not quite have noticed wonder here sighed rather heavily

sacred star browning to living soul same saith be faithful whatsoever else be let be faithful challenging faith christina rossetti manor house where godfreys lived be fine old red brick elizabethan house standing about quarter of mile from river delightful garden surrounded chief point of attraction to visitor be terrace walk shaded by old chestnut tree formed extreme boundary on hottest summer day offered cool shady retreat terrace be broad at one end be sort of loggia alcove built of grayish white stone with wide stone bench running round from point there be charming view of river between tree be here that malcolm found hostess on arrival at manor house mr godfrey be reading in loggia with husband magnificent deer hound lying at foot laid aside book welcomed visitor with warmth

so handsome even most critical agreed that woman must be more charming have spent great deal of life abroad easy well bred manner savoir faire broad sagacious view on subject have be gained in world academy in spite of goodness of heart real unselfishness be essentially woman of world little a malcolm guessed at time be elizabeth templeton greatest friend indeed sister be devoted to of elizabeth

rustic tea table so have be staying at wood house began mr godfrey a handed tea elizabeth templeton letter morning almost took breath away what small world be after mr herrick life tread on life murmured malcolm heart on heart press too close in church mart to keep dream grave apart how true be quiet rejoinder mr browning said that well do know be quite childishly surprised when heard have be guest at wood house herrick have only just left ' be elizabeth word be driving to station have greatly enjoyed visit ' etcetera etcetera then slight flush came to malcolm dark face have very pleasant time returned be most kind hospitable miss templeton be one of most charming woman have ever met dear dinah yes be very sweet think have ever seen ruffled be just lovely be elizabeth who be friend indeed friendship be very real one continued mr godfrey thoughtfully next to husband there be one whom must trust a must elizabeth templeton be very strong oh yes be very strong in ruminative manner have found that out already in surprised tone remember be student of human nature mr herrick rather keen observer most people must not be able to diagnose elizabeth templeton character correctly at end of one short week when be first introduced to thirteen fourteen year ago told alick must never get on with one who be so reserved so stand offish soon changed opinion found out that great deal of reserve be in reality shyness that frankness openness of disposition be chief charm then became friend yes not for long time be of at gushing be old married woman know there came time when needed help when be in anxiety woman counsel woman sympathy be comfort to here mr godfrey paused a became aware of concentrated keenness in malcolm eye added hastily trouble be not own be be nature to take burden of others on own shoulder never knew one capable of such intense sympathy be rare gift mr herrick brings possessor great suffering be right in low tone knew then that be woman in thousand have be close dear friend ever since not that often meet be busy woman so be generally stay at wood house once year elizabeth come to for few day rest refreshment whenever can spare time alick tease sometimes about lady love assure that be very fond of be always delighted to hear be coming to manor house malcolm listened to with deep interest seemed to that one who spoke to of elizabeth templeton praised without stint limit be evidently much beloved very fact that person like mr godfrey must choose for most trusted friend be mean title of honour never be there woman more fastidious discriminating in idea of female friendship malcolm must willingly have heard more curious sort of embarrassment fear of betraying too deep interest made speak of sister miss templeton seems to have happy nature said little abruptly never saw one so perfectly peaceful serene make one better only to look at hair be gray yet when smile one be reminded of innocent child be such perfectly radiant expression yes know dear dinah have secret of perpetual youth be one of little one know what mean when talk to a tell elizabeth sometimes feel such worldly frivolous creature sister perfectly realises for have prettiest name for 'that angel woman have heard say that very often call 'das engelkind without exaggeration have rare beautiful nature malcolm assented to then said slowly have ever struck that there be line on miss templeton face must think life story must be happy one mean that have not known very great trouble then rather peculiar expression crossed mr godfrey face ah see have made mistake observed malcolm quickly yes have made mistake replied little sadly did really think that even dinah templeton must have forty year in wilderness without share of pain difficulty well be ancient history there be harm in telling what one know that in bloom of fresh young womanhood have sore trial great sorrow say one know about returned malcolm eagerly yes one in staplegrove earlsfield oh can read face must

time approved of engagement dr eraser be devoted to profession be rising man people predicted that before many year be over must make mark douglas fraser great authority on neurotic disease in harley

intellectual head face a for dinah must have be one of sweetest looking creature on god earth well be engaged if ever young pair of human lover walked in garden of eden dinah douglas fraser be that couple until cloud came be to eclipse happiness in world there be need for to enter into matter very fully though know everything one unhappy day dinah discovered that dr fraser be agnostic for time have have grave doubt on subject of revealed religion have kept to for fear of distressing now sense of honour compelled to tell truth have lost faith no longer believed in anything science good heaven what shock ejaculated malcolm may well say so returned mr godfrey sadly be light cross that dinah have to bear even in youth be intensely religious religion be not portion of life be life to such nature idea of marrying agnostic be practically impossible marry douglas will be committing great sin said to sister ' will be denying lord master ' in semi delirium in illness ensued elizabeth must hear say over over again 'whoso loveth father mother more than be not worthy of actually gave up yes gave up though broke heart to do so believe that suffered terribly that used argument in power to shake resolution in vain have long illness after elizabeth took abroad be at rome met after time became intimate poor dinah have relapse assisted elizabeth in nursing well mr herrick can read question in eye yes there be one thing want to know have not dr fraser married to be sure have did not marry for year left earlsfield took london practice career have be brilliant one believe mr fraser be lovely woman have three beautiful child strangest part of story be still to be told douglas fraser be no longer agnostic malcolm looked at silently mr godfrey said more not for world must have asked question must see that be deeply moved for lip quivered little rose from bench paced up down terrace listening to faint soughing of dark chestnut leaf looking at cool silvery gleam of river between tree bole malcolm be man of intensely imaginative sympathetic nature mother have once told that have something of woman in certainly one be more capable of filling up outline of story have just heard giving life colouring admired before said to will look upon a saint now have have martyrdom if ever woman have have fought fight nobly then with clear insight seemed natural to added know that have come right be secret of serenity be indeed truth though not whole truth for dinah templeton have indeed realised master word that through much tribulation must enter into kingdom of heaven when mr godfrey rejoined malcolm husband be with malcolm always declared that colonel godfrey be typical ideal englishman be well built soldierly looking man of unusually fine presence a be over fifty golden brown moustache be slightly grizzled hair have worn off forehead be still strikingly handsome wife be alone son be in indian army only daughter be married lived in yorkshire be just old darby

through field towards river bank talking on various topic of social political interest while mr godfrey returned to house to write letter dress for dinner be not until following afternoon malcolm found opportunity of sounding mr godfrey on subject of jacobi be sitting in loggia again row of dark chestnut tree looked almost black against intense blue of sky faint breeze be just stirring leaf now then sort of ripple of sunlight seemed to streak sombre foliage with gold on terrace there be wealth of sunshine stone felt hot to foot only under chestnut tiny flickering shadow seemed to dance in out among tree bole colonel godfrey have just be summoned to business interview for first time day malcolm found alone with hostess oh by bye observed rather abruptly there be something want to ask there be people of name of jacobi who have taken house at henley wonder if have come across to be sure have in rather surprised tone miss jacobi called here on tuesday mr sinclair drove over well want to tell what think of asked amused look came into mr godfrey eye held up finger in chiding fashion oh fie for shame mr herrick be deep deep so handsome siren have attracted too handsome siren repeated malcolm with unnecessary energy why what nonsense be talking dear lady never saw miss jacobi in life be miss templeton who desire information promised must sound on subject then mischievous spark died

malcolm reply cedric have come across seems rather thick with be going to stay at beechcroft be that not name of place have taken for season yes believe so returned mr godfrey in rather perturbed tone cedric boy going to stay with jacobi then broke off said abruptly be sorry to hear must not care for one of boy to be thrown much into society of saul jacobi sister chapter xix touch of tartar here come lady o so light foot will ne'er wear out everlasting flint romeo juliet when doubt abstain zoroaster malcolm gave slight start of dismay mr godfrey manner conveyed more than word in spite of secret prejudice be not prepared for so strong expression of disapproval be woman of sound judgment very charitable in estimate of people knew that must rely on opinion intuition be seldom at fault whether blamed praised be always with rare discrimination perfect justice be never impulsive rash in verdict there be moment silence blackbird evidently attracted by mr godfrey clear resonant voice have perched on stone parapet beside watched in bright eyed curiosity then a malcolm moved arm flew off with clucking note of warning to rejoin mate be rather troubled to hear say began malcolm will tell know about people be just difficulty returned mr godfrey slowly one seems to know much about even mr sinclair who have taken up so lately know scarcely anything of antecedent a far a remember mr sinclair asked one day if be not going to call on jacobi be perfectly charming ' be word 'they be brother sister who have taken beechcroft for season seem wealthy people live in good style miss jacobi

wondered with sudden fierce prick of jealousy if fellow carlyon knew be birthday have brought to at idea there be dangerous throbbing of pulse previous evening have strolled across to wood house in hope that elizabeth must be in one of gracious mood then must coax to sing to to disappointment visit have seemed le welcome than usual though dinah received with wonted gentle courtesy have vague suspicion that something be amiss dinah looked a though have be shedding tear elizabeth face be flushed be very silent if have not known so well intense love for other must almost have suspected that there have be warm altercation between be manifestly impossible have never quarrelled even in childish day remembered have once told that assuredly never quarrelled now nevertheless there be something troubled in atmosphere even dinah seemed to find difficult to talk malcolm raged inwardly over disappointment have too much tact to prolong visit be rewarded for forbearance when dinah said in gentle way be afraid be rather stupid to night mr herrick elizabeth be tired have be talking for hour if look in to morrow afternoon will promise to behave better though elizabeth did not endorse malcolm accepted invitation with undisguised pleasure satisfaction must have be sadly damped if have overheard elizabeth speech why did ask die know hesitating moment like to be quiet on birthday looked so dull returned dinah apologetically think depressed be very sorry dear ought to have found out wish first will not stay long unless ask elizabeth made answer to looked thoughtful little troubled dinah felt have done wrong thing afternoon elizabeth be in old sunshiny mood made little speech about being old maid in way charmed malcolm how still be down by pool only dry leaf dropping into water sleepy snapping of one of dog at midge faint twitter of far off bird broke silence air be sweet with warm resinous smell of fir strong perfume seemed to pervade sens be alone with not human creature be near be so close that if have stretched out hand must have touched dress malcolm heart began beating dangerously there be curious throbbing at temple when tried to speak voice be thick indistinct then with great effort steadied for time have come knew there be something want to say to that for week have be trying to say will let speak now did really say word did whisper inwardly must see sudden startled look in elizabeth eye when saw face may speak in frightened tone mr herrick for sake for sake implore to be silent can not will not listen agitation increasing with word might a well have tried to control wind can not mean that returned gently firmly forgive if obey if be not possible for to keep silence longer elizabeth surely week must have known that be one woman in world for returned covering face with hand never knew how must how must mistook cause of emotion think woman be ever loved so well week have be dumb have be living for only for then put up trembling hand to stop caught in own elizabeth will try to love little hush hush endeavouring to free indeed indeed must not say such thing mr herrick be deceiving be friend like be very very grateful to for goodness to cedric never meant to come to how do mean asked face be white with emotion surely must have seen how thing be with be voice be little hard think tried not to see answered truthfully once twice be afraid then told be mistaken mr herrick want to hurt must not add to trouble for world at least will do justice of owning never gave encouragement no returned in tone of forced composure never encouraged in presumption loved because must not help because be elizabeth templeton be malcolm herrick then eye grew very sad dear friend be presumption woman must have felt honoured by such devotion here burning flush came to face be too late be not free malcolm stared at surely be in hideous nightmare must wake directly what awful stillness seemed round a though storm be impending water lily on pool looked like dead thing even dragon fly hung motionless in mid air only dog panted snored round elizabeth pressed hand together a though something pained be not free repeated in low voice did not look at malcolm a spoke last evening mr carlyon spoke to be engaged good god malcolm did not say word aloud for tongue felt suddenly dry palsied be only cry of soul to maker in hour of agony elizabeth dared not look at heart must have be wrung with pity at sight of drawn haggard face have cared for other for long time whispered be poor did not like to speak only dinah know have just told when came in last evening did not want one else to know just yet forced hand malcolm have pulled together now thank for telling truth be always brave woman tried to smile oh have not be brave then eye suddenly filled with tear mr herrick be so unhappy have spoiled everything must not say that if have be blind fool be fault of yours have one to thank for misery have come upon elizabeth oh how sad voice be thrilled to hear before leave let wish happiness mr carlyon too then rose to foot must go pleaded yes must go returned hurriedly will excuse to sister then elizabeth stretched out hand to in silence saw that must not trust to speak must not be too sorry for said rather brokenly be not only man who have be denied heart desire turned away plunged into little fir wood elizabeth sat listening to retreating footstep tear be running down cheek be still weeping when dinah rejoined have be long observed cheerfully that tiresome mr carrick called about mother meeting where be mr herrick then a caught sight of elizabeth face oh dear betty what be have gone wrong on birthday too elizabeth wept afresh hush ask not now david will be here directly must not see like be right die saw how be must not believe did not want to believe now let go away recover dinah held fast will go in moment dear just tell one thing did mr herrick ask to be wife not exactly must not let go a far a die love so be so unhappy then dinah sighed hand dropped from sister arm have better go returned see mullins crossing bridge if david come will make excuse for absence elizabeth nodded turned away dinah heart be very heavy a stood looking down upon pool be looker on who see most of game week ago have vainly tried to open elizabeth eye to sense of danger have never said word to that whole world might not hear believe ever will elizabeth have replied obstinately dinah knew that be wilfully deceiving that intuition be truer than word in malcolm herrick presence be always on guard a if feared invasion of woman kingdom dinah must have wept too in grievous disappointment passionate pity for elizabeth choice seemed to great mistake david carlyon be dear fellow a good a gold be not equal to malcolm if only have met year ago thought before david influence grew so strong must surely have discovered then that be made for other mr herrick be just sort of man must have admired there be something striking original about then in spite of cleverness be so simple good oh betty darling went on why must not have given such brother must have be so proud of then dinah checked in very shame for remembered how have promised elizabeth previous evening that must take david carlyon to sisterly heart be not very cheerful birthday tea though one of trio tried to do best to promote innocent hilarity elizabeth talked great deal face be still flushed rather avoided lover eye a for david talked principally to dinah told funny little parish story made laugh to elizabeth listened with manifest effort took notice when chimed in with irrelevant remark dinah wondered to herself more than once if really have not noticed that elizabeth eyelid be still reddened in spite of cold water eau de cologne david be certainly little dense in happiness thought then sighed involuntarily a thought of lonely man who have left will take hardly said to herself nature be intense will suffer more than most men a thought passed through mind looked up found david keen bright eye fixed on coloured little a though have read thought when tea be over dinah made transparent little excuse to go back to house for in sweet early day of happiness knew well that lover must have much to say to other be not wrong before be out of sight david have flung down at elizabeth foot have taken hand what be dearest said tenderly have be shedding tear do think did not know that then elizabeth blushed a though be child discovered in fault tell about darling whispered shook head can not david indeed can not must not ask to tell elizabeth voice quivered little be very much in earnest must not returned with smile look so frightened sweetheart perhaps there be need to ask perhaps know be trying to keep from then in low voice full of meaning so herrick have spoken at last at last be evident two word have startled elizabeth david with difficulty suppressed irresistible smile do mean asked incredulously that never noticed what one else saw so plainly that poor fellow fairly worshipped ground trod on then again painful flush came to elizabeth face be not sure stammered for conscience did not wholly acquit must not let see notice thing besides be thinking of then david kissed hand held there be troubled look in eye poor beggar muttered to then aloud do know darling what people will say when hear have thrown over man like herrick for for mere curate with empty pocket not too many brain do suppose care what say throwing head back in rather regal fashion will say be mad upon word here david knit brow in puzzled manner be not sure that will be wrong look at difference between herrick be superior in way used to shake in shoe to hear talk to vicar elizabeth heart ache for poor fellow even know what have suffered on account week there be time when be tempted to throw up sponge oh david when knew when must have known feeling yes knew there be day when courage failed felt have right to stand in light dearest here be kneeling beside with man worship in honest eye be too good for do think know that be goodness generosity make stoop to elizabeth laid hand upon lip hush will not talk so be who be not worthy of love david love oh so dearly be enough for too elizabeth looked at with adorable smile then for little while malcolm herrick be forgotten chapter xxv have gone very deep when depart from sorrow abides happiness take leave shakespeare fulfil perfection of long suffering be thou patient teaching of buddha life long malcolm never spoke of hour followed that fateful interview down by pool when be a one who have just received baptism of fire when be scorched through through with new terrible agony will take hardly dinah have said to herself nature be intense will suffer more than most men be right malcolm did suffer cruelly have spoken parting word to elizabeth with outward calmness though lip be blanched feature drawn with pain for be gentleman noblesse oblige why must make suffer when have done wrong be not only man who have be denied heart desire have said to in dull lifeless voice in be certainly right be not winner in race many fail to attain goal retire baffled disheartened from contest few suffer a malcolm herrick did though did not curse day be born a job did whole plan purpose of life seemed frustrated future hopeless blank fault be own even in most despairing moment never ceased to tell that have never encouraged never held out woman sceptre for to touch even when have be most sweet winsome have not abridged distance between in noble sincerity friendship attempted to draw closer be who have be blind fool must pay penalty of madness gate of earthly paradise have closed behind for ever must hear clanging in distance golden bell of city of dream be chiming nevermore oh nevermore city of dream what good name thought through long summer day have dwelt there like king now gate have closed golden pinnacle be no longer visible breath of rose fragrance of spice of araby blessed must no longer steep sens in sweetness nevermore oh nevermore must blissful dream be malcolm never quite recollected what did with that evening idea of going back to crow nest in present state of mind be simply intolerable how must have joined in simple meal listened to goliath talk no must be better to have good long walk look thing in face if tired so much better malcolm never retained clear recollection of walk have vague idea that passed earlsfield station presently found on open moor where have driven with day when have so naively confessed ignorance to be rather desultory sort of person have said to have offered to make out list of book for to read have done so have thanked very sweetly have sent for of book have never seen read perhaps carlyon at thought ground teeth hard perhaps carlyon have discouraged horticulture seemed chief hobby be always talking to about new fern house be making at wood house malcolm poor book be neglected flung down on heather must battle out with thought when be in quieter frame of mind must go home home pooh must never have home now be glorious evening fresh soft breeze have risen blew refreshingly in face never heeded for in mood take gift grace of nature a matter of course yield thanks acknowledgment for gentle benison even glowing crimson tint of sunset cloud must not move to admiration line of browning came involuntarily to mind will not soil thy purple with dust be thinking of elizabeth not of sunset must battle out with repeated hour passed moon have risen still lay there plucking up heather flinging aside in stupefaction of misery be only when september darkness stole over moor that recollected stumbled to foot be almost worn out when unlatched little gate at crow nest amia be smoking a usual in porch verity be with lamplight from within fell full on malcolm face a approached verity gave start oh how tired look said in quite shocked voice malcolm gave weary smile have have long walk returned be such lovely evening so resolved to miss supper for once tried to speak in jaunty fashion be ghastly failure knew be so sick faint with inanition that felt a though must not utter word be tired think will go to bed good night two groped way to garden house amia took pipe from mouth looked at wife inquiringly what be come to herrick said in concerned tone look dead beat thought be dining at wood house at least said so yea verily child believed yes know dear be wrong have eaten nothing be evident then got up quickly kitchen fire be still alight kettle will soon boil told martha to leave will make coffee will take to amia dear old thing talk to be not fit for to night so be that quarter of hour later amia knocked at malcolm door be reluctantly bidden to enter malcolm be sitting still fully dressed by open window moonlight made look still more ghastly amia without word lighted lamp placed tray beside verity sends love say must eat supper be ventured to say large hand rested kindly on malcolm shoulder for moment malcolm tried to thank word must not come when friend have left room suddenly covered face with hand cried like child elizabeth elizabeth there be response only sleepy bird stirred in shrubbery in spite of great intimacy with kestons very real friendship malcolm did not confide in of be undemonstrative self reliant by nature a said afterwards there be thing that man ought to keep to amia verity expected such confidence if amia seemed puzzled by change in malcolm verity needed explanation have seen how thing be from first have once caught sight of malcolm face when elizabeth templeton have passed so closely that dress brushed against have seen that look in amia eye in dear auld lang syne verity be loyal little soul never even hinted suspicion to husband neither did attempt to find out what be amiss when next evening malcolm told hurriedly that must be obliged to return to town earlier than thought interrupted amia clumsy exclamation of regret mr herrick have be very good to give so much of company said cheerfully of course will miss so will babs then in pretty housewifely way set about making arrangement for comfort malcolm felt inwardly grateful for unspoken sympathy went over to vicarage to bid mr charrington good bye on way back met david carlyon young curate looked rather nervous discomposed malcolm be quite calm a be leaving staplegrove to morrow said quietly be glad to have opportunity of offering congratulation bidding good bye lie came glibly to lip glad when must have gone dozen mile to avoid rival successful rival nevertheless such hypocrite be best of men word flowed smoothly from lip thanks awfully replied david prodding dust with stick be going up to wood house now think be be sure lady be out be certainly fact a have just seen driving in direction of earlsfield not afternoon think replied malcolm well good bye be bit pressed for time then young men shook hand david grip be almost painful poor beggar muttered to a turned away malcolm must not give expression if tried to bitter thought of david carlyon husband husband of elizabeth templeton why very bird knew how to mate more fitly thought be good true be not worthy of david in sad humility be saying same thing of that evening dinah received note amia keston left dear miss templeton wrote malcolm to morrow be leaving staplegrove know will understand reason why call to bid good bye that will not think ungrateful after kindness hospitality have received from sister have often told that have secret from other so will know why be better for to return to town have be to vicarage afternoon have seen carlyon with kindest regard to sister very sincerely gratefully malcolm herrick elizabeth grew little pale bit lip when dinah showed note have gone very deep said to herself david said so be right have gone very deep so malcolm shook off dust of staplegrove gate of city of dream clanged behind must dree weird said to a sat down to work in gloomy room in lincoln inn in spite of heart sickness worked on stolidly well evening be worst time when went back to empty house at cheyne walk sat on balcony brooding over trouble until light faded eerie darkness crept over river suppose many men have to go through sort of thing must say to trying to philosophise in old way if one have seen face what doe glorious will say been have died from time to time worm have eaten not for love ' ah also say 'how bitter thing be to look into happiness through man eye sometimes when silence solitude oppressed terribly must picture to dreary future will never marry must say there be only one woman in whole world want will have nothing to do with love other woman will ever be wife then must wonder sadly what life must be like when be old bachelor must be living on here with amia verity must go back to mother do duty to in old age with bitter rumination never let go again battled manfully with pain though a day went on grew paler thinner looked wretchedly ill malcolm knew that mother anna be back at queen gate be quite ten day before saw dreaded ordeal of mother searching glance at last one evening plucked up courage went anna who saw coming flew down staircase to meet looked younger than ever quite pretty with soft pink colour in cheek fair hair smile faded when saw malcolm face oh malcolm have be ill

never tolerated excuse ten day have never be near then tone changed have be ill malcolm regarded with undisguised anxiety anna asked same question replied impatiently have only be out of sort a tell rather off feed that kind of thing then mr herrick said more on subject a sat at dinner keen gray eye be often fixed on face malcolm did part manfully talked questioned anna about doings must not brook instant silence anna must tell that about water party picnic wonderful people who tried to force acquaintance on must not let off though more than once girl looked wistfully at why did not tell about staplegrove have not once mentioned wood house templetons be anything wrong with did not look have never before noticed line on forehead looked different somehow in two month when went on to balcony to smoke cigarette followed stood silently beside until turned saw anxious face well annachen one of pet name for what be little woman then soft hand smoothed coat sleeve malcolm dear like to

cedric be absolutely dependent on sister oh jacobi quite understands that so much better well then three four year ago mine be discovered that beggarly little farm have brought quite fortune elizabeth

when spoke of intended marriage sudden sickening pain at heart told that must not trust a walked towards station when have done business pondered over mr godfrey have told be possible that sister have known week cedric have be thrown into daily hourly contact with leah jacobi brother be likely that cedric have told that there be even such place a shepherd hut perhaps did not mean to wilfully deceive very probably have excuse ready malcolm must almost hear word said nothing about jacobi because knew prejudice did not want to fluster thought mr godfrey must spin yarn left to be not fault if wallace took to that be often up at fettercairn such word cedric must say when saw sister what blessing term have begun be back at oxford be safe from jacobi there must be in town probably then fancy

unscrupulous adventurer must simply mould to will poor lad passionate love for sister must be turned to account made to further own wily purpose malcolm groaned inwardly a realised that sole chance lay with leah message have given shade of hope must not allow to be sanguine knew too well that woman of leah calibre be not always to be depended on in such case one must reckon with mood impulse brother dominated be evil genius of life how must one hope to influence when poor soul lived under reign of terror one might a well ask wretched prisoner to break off fetter bound a to expect leah jacobi to walk out of house of bondage free woman malcolm found impossible to rid of gloomy foreboding nevertheless made such good speed that be barely half past nine when stood in stone porch of

must be good for in many way must be useful to dinah elizabeth also told david that father have promised to travel down with that intended to find locum tenens for stokeley that must probably remain with for month six week last item of information seemed to afford david much satisfaction next moment observed in rather worried tone that must be great expense that be afraid theo must object theo will have to mind own business returned elizabeth severely father mean to tell that be first duty of course be right elizabeth carefully forbore to tell david that have already undertaken to pay expense of locum tenens for three month by dint of sheer obstinacy feminine persuasion have at last induced mr carlyon to accept bounty poverty not will consent observed sadly elizabeth must not listen to dear mr carlyon have said earnestly if only knew pleasure will give can not understand that only cared for money because must be now what good will be to let use for a long a can let do in power for too a though a though be already daughter then a wiped away few quiet tear mr carlyon have yielded david strove with wonted unselfishness to interest in elizabeth plan for comfort heard how inner drawing room at red brae be to be converted into bedroom that might be able without fatigue to take possession of drawing room couch by pleasant window with view of sea how smaller room on same floor be to be prepared for father by bye in spite of effort attention flagged looked so exhausted that elizabeth refused to say word will give luncheon then read to sleep said in what david called mother gamp tone be too worn out to resist though forgetfulness be not to be obtained be certainly comfort to lie with closed eye listen to elizabeth dear voice till twilight compelled to close book then sat by in silence until asked to light lamp tea be ready before mr carlyon returned a opened door gave quick anxious glance at elizabeth come in dad be all right observed david in weak voice spoke with old cheeriness wilful man wilful woman too must have way have given in like good boy be dear lad returned father rubbing cold hand gleefully together knew must make hear reason elizabeth be worth rest of put together be not davie mr carlyon interrupted elizabeth david be tired must not talk more one else be tired too then drew up easy chair by fire gave mr carlyon tea talked to softly

sat beside son bed side with worn little book of devotion out of have be reading to still open in hand be struck with strained troubled look in david eye what be dear said wistfully for curate in charge of stokeley have homely little way trick of speech endeared still more to who loved elizabeth must often praise simplicity unobtrusive goodness reminded of david there be something on mind continued tenderly make clean breast of boy understand other davie mr carlyon gently patted son hand a though be still little child out with lad be not quite happy about ventnor father how must guess returned david in deprecating voice if knew how hate for being so cowardly ungrateful promise promise dad that will never let elizabeth know how badly feel about must make so unhappy so must poor girl so must rejoined mr carlyon for in eye elizabeth be still girl very dearest of daughter to dinah have planned for continued david know what sacrifice be to dinah for doe so dislike leaving home be doing for elizabeth sake be doing for elizabeth sake too be not david asked father quietly then harassed face brightened at once let tell about dad returned eagerly will be such comfort have often be father confessor before if knew how heart sank when elizabeth begged to go to ventnor yet how be to refuse when said with tear in eye that consenting to plan must probably give few more week of happiness know how meant oh yes know david in same quiet tone of course must not refuse dared not be guilty of such selfishness for after what doe little more pain matter here david drew heavy sigh of intense weariness be so tired then knew that battle must have to be fought over again be not sure that understand dear lad because be not making thing clear will try to do so then must help have be coward father be truth have rebelled against hard fate god will be not will wanted to live marry elizabeth ay david boy know yes know with sad yearning look at gray head bent now upon trembling hand know be how mother felt when went so far away from to die only consented to go because wanted to live broke heart to leave returned father huskily dear heart how prayed that might be spared that parting divine will ordered otherwise have prayed too murmured david then thank god strength help needed so sorely came have felt so peaceful lately now struggle will begin again oh surely not david yes father must will get better for time will have sunshine elizabeth dear love life will grow too precious to again will dishonour master put to shame by wanting to lay down cross david be not afraid of returned father gravely own boy be only one of dark hour when evil one tempts in weakness need remind of what have so often preached to others that a thy day thy strength will be help never come beforehand true seem to forget everything then warm comforting hand be laid tenderly upon david forehead will remind will not be parted yet son god will help to say right word to ah david in reverent tone many life have gethsemanes only one ever drank bitter cup of sorrow to dreg without murmur only one have angel to comfort will not be hard on because human will shrink from hard cross of pain for 'he knoweth frame ' in weakness extremity will be staff stay in trembling tone blessed boy sat beside in voiceless prayer deep inward supplication of exceeding love did leave until david have sunk into exhausted sleep david be very feverish unwell next day mr carlyon must not leave after few hour grew better again a day went on seemed to recover old cheerfulness one afternoon a elizabeth be sitting with a usual for always spent afternoon at white cottage surprised by asking if malcolm herrick never came to wood house now how strange that must ask question returned elizabeth colouring slightly at mention of malcolm name for be coming down very evening cedric be driving to earlsfield to meet dinah asked to come went on wanted to talk to about cedric herrick be dinah right hand man of business quite swears by replied david smoothing tenderly ruffled lock of brown hair that wind have disordered suppose will remain night oh yes of course dinah have got room ready for told that must not allow to go to 'king arm be right for to put foot down returned david approvingly why on earth need scruple to accept hospitality somehow always liked herrick though be not so sure that returned compliment perhaps under circumstance one must hardly expect be face grew hot subject be painful one to never mind about mr herrick dear said hurriedly dinah be great friend need not tell that in rather meaning tone dinah have excellent taste dearest voice changing to seriousness want to give herrick message from tell must like to shake hand with when go to vicarage do really want to say to there be little doubt from elizabeth face that be reluctant to give message david meant to have way yes tell repeated cedric be sure to walk over in morning vicar herrick be such crony why must pas door seemed so plausible that elizabeth said more a walked home wondered more than once over strange fancy on david part there have be so little intercourse between two young men secret sense of antagonism on malcolm herrick part have be obstacle to david proffered friendliness be true that mr herrick must pas white cottage on way to vicarage even without message good feeling must probably have induced to stop inquire after invalid felt david request must surprise nevertheless must do will give message elizabeth be later than usual that evening found that malcolm have just arrived be talking to dinah in drawing room be standing before fire warming after cold drive a elizabeth entered broke off in middle of sentence silently shook hand with elizabeth felt at once conscious that manner be even more constrained guarded than usual made nervous for moment must find nothing to say be relief to when dinah observed in quiet matter of fact way mr herrick be so kind obliging betty have promised not to leave until quite late to morrow afternoon will give plenty of time for nice talk see cedric will be with evening may find difficult to get rid of there be so much that want to say think can take off hand replied elizabeth then turned to malcolm though noticed that avoided looking at there be curious abruptness in manner that almost amounted to awkwardness mr carlyon have sent message mr herrick think will be sure to call at vicarage must like to look in at white cottage a pas say that must be pleased to shake hand with there be doubt that malcolm be surprised unconsciously stiffened be very kind said rather formally of course meant to call at least leave card have just told sister so perhaps have better call at vicarage first returned elizabeth hurriedly mr carlyon be rarely out of room before mid day hour be alike to mr charrington when malcolm have gravely agreed to do elizabeth went upstairs to prepare for dinner did not appear again until gong sounded did not forget promise however of taking cedric off dinah hand a soon a have finished coffee challenged to game of chess in inner drawing room where on cold night second fire generally burned room be so large that unless dinah malcolm raised voice be impossible to hear conversation a cedric have back to have idea that be talking more confidentially than usual from malcolm position elizabeth face stood out in full relief in spite of effort attention often wandered even in few short week since have last met must see change in have grown thinner paler there be deepened sadness in eye yet in opinion have never looked more lovely though be more inward than outward loveliness that meant noticed how mechanically played how game failed to interest when cedric checkmated twice only rose with air of relief a though have finished wearisome task came towards be cold said simply a dinah made room for nearly let fire out between a sat in snug corner warming hand did not attempt to join in conversation indeed manner be so absent that malcolm felt convinced that heard little of what said be not surprised that dinah noticed at last be tired betty dear said kindly be quite sure that mr herrick will excuse elizabeth availed at once of permission to withdraw be not at ease malcolm thought bitterly seems afraid of somehow will not meet eye have scarcely spoken dozen word to sighed for seemed saddest thing to that must suffer that must be powerless to help in fanciful way said to be like two traveller walking along stony path with high wall between so that helping hand can be stretched out voice of comfort can be heard then added dare not even tell be sorry for for too malcolm be alone when paid visit to white cottage there be doubt that change in david carlyon shocked greatly though strove to hide from invalid david welcomed with old cordiality malcolm who be exceedingly nervous must only stammer out few commonplace bright eager young face elizabeth so loved be shrunken wasted lip seemed drawn from teeth yet at time old cheery smile played round voice be weak toneless now then hard dry cough seemed to rack cruelly if knew how sorry be to see like observed malcolm kindly well be rather poor specimen just now returned david with feeble laugh what ca be cured must be endured eh herrick told elizabeth here shade came over malcolm face must like to shake hand with when fellow be going long journey here david hollow eye grew little sad wistful seems natural to bid one friend good bye did not know other much herrick always wanted to see more of be very good to say so if life have depended on malcolm must not have brought to say more at moment wished hundred mile away quaint sweet smile flitted across david face must read malcolm thought have be good fellow herrick have done so much for be bad business with cedric at age will get over know that do indeed returned malcolm gravely dinah come talk to sometimes went on david say that if have be own brother must not have done more be so grateful to herrick perhaps must have said more malcolm checked never mind that carlyon be great pleasure to to do now let talk of something more interesting then for short time talked of oxford boat race then of ventnor malcolm knew well have even spent evening at red brae when godfreys be staying there house be charming said quite enthusiastically know room will have carlyon be delightful david did not respond be evidently getting tired so malcolm rose to take leave wish wish must do something for too said with such sincerity that david be quite touched have have good thing returned in low voice now must dree weird worry herrick thing generally come right in long run must not try to act providence too much good bye god bless thin hand wrung malcolm with surprising force malcolm eye be little misty a went out of room for knew knew too well that in life must never see david carlyon face again chapter xxxvii parting of way will forget on side of grave promise nothing must wait see patient brave o soul watch with with will forget in peace of paradise promise nothing follow friend see faithful wise o soul lead way walk with christina

to other seem to think alike on subject elizabeth read aloud by turn like to take work there listen to happy family party thought little bitterly a put down letter even now must have found in heart to envy rival next moment dismissed unworthy thought be only temporary rally dr hewlitt told dinah privately one day that there be real improvement in patient condition at time there might be sudden change for worse when least expected haemorrhage collapse might set in doctor fear be verified one day late in march david seemed unusually well gale have blown all night towards morning wind have lulled heavy rain have set in david have expressed disappointment at having to remain indoors mr carlyon who considered weather wise assured that weather must improve later gale have disturbed elizabeth have found impossible to sleep for hour when rose next morning felt unusually weary depressed strange foreboding sense of separation loss seemed to oppress effort on part must enable to maintain wonted cheerfulness dejection be so evident that david noticed at last when mr carlyon have put on old mackintosh gone out for blow on parade gently rallied on depression what be dearest asked rather anxiously be not bright self morning be so good unselfish darling that never let see when be unhappy to day can not hide from then took hand held so that must see face know have come over

afterwards dear elizabeth be true to a have be true to may god bless reward for goodness to mine david spoke with strange solemnity for though of guessed then be last farewell before parting of way evening passed tranquilly elizabeth seemed le dejected head ached sat silently beside david while mr carlyon went on with book be reading once when there be pause looked up saw david rapt gaze fixed on sunset while look of almost unearthly beauty seemed to transform emaciated feature must have spoken to made gesture a though for silence again that awful sense of separation seemed to pas between

feel strength most weak life most burdensome lift mine eye up to hill from whence help will come christina rossetti malcolm sat for time talking to two lady then made excuse set off in search of leah be well acquainted with ground of sandy hollow must have found way blindfolded to lower garden be quaint old plaisance shut in with high wall be covered with fruit tree where downy peach nectarine golden apricot big yellow plum nestled sun kissed cheek against warm red brick in oddly shaped bed manner of sweet growing thing seemed to jostle other not forming stately row ordered phalanx even gay patterned border after fashion of modern flower bed growing together in loveliest confusion peony nasturtium sweet pea salvia everywhere crowd of rose over arch climbing up wall hanging in festoon over gateway long row of standard guarding path like army of beauteous amazon while day long heavy brown bee hummed round filled honey bag with rifled sweet there be small green bench placed invitingly in shady corner where leah have seated to rest after labour malcolm thought that figure gave finishing touch to picture wore white dress large shady hat basket of marshal niel rose be in lap when caught sight of visitor rose so hastily that basket be upset rose strewed ground at foot malcolm felt concerned when saw how pale have grown how be trembling from head to foot thought better to take notice to give time to recover have startled said lightly let pick up rose for may have bud for showing spoil then when basket be full again sat down beside be leah who broke silence have not regained colour voice still trembled little did not know be in neighbourhood faltered startled so to see at gate have not be strong since influenza even little thing like brings on palpitation must

never guessed fact then afterwards have be having tea in alcove a usual colonel have just gone to stable to give order for next day malcolm have made humorous speech other about wonderful agility for man of age when mr godfrey remarked innocently how strange that must say that mr herrick be just word for word what elizabeth said when be last here never saw two people think so alike here mr godfrey laughed quite merrily for once before have accused malcolm of making elizabethan speech laugh died away when saw malcolm face be too sudden be not prepared next moment be hanging over parapet trying

fear that must find changed that must be cold distant with worked up into fever at last that way up staplegrove hill stopped fly told driver that wished to walk directed to take bag to wood house walk certainly refreshed by time reached crow nest felt more ready for ordeal when came to gate led to wood house hesitated then crossed road stood for few moment looking down little woodland path remembered so well other place be so associated with elizabeth how often have met at little gate waited for when knew be coming back from rotherwood day for example when wore white sun bonnet came along swinging arm like imperial milkmaid very queen of curd cream at moment little sharp clang of distant gate made heart beat suddenly there be footstep yes without doubt there be footstep be fancy then at bend of road must see distinctly tall black figure walking rather slowly wearily along though must not see face knew be elizabeth next minute unlatched gate little noisily must not steal march on believed alone then looked up quickened pace when came up to there be actually smile on face be fond of surprise said looking at a gave hand be late have come to meet what have done with luggage

thought looked year older mourning did not suit black hat with heavy trimming seemed to extinguish somehow be paler thinner be sure of have lost of splendid vitality yet in spite of be to dearest face in world a made that poor little attempt at smile whole heart went out to in profound love pity forgot own pain in remembering trouble sister told about mr carlyon said a crossed road be very glad to

eagerness oh always understand said gratefully be why be so easy to talk to yes indeed have made so much happier life be worth living when one know there be one in world who be dependent on one for earthly comfort of course mr carlyon have theo doe not know a do be at cottage nearly day malcolm listened smiled must not have spoken at moment how little guessed how word stabbed must tell to face that life be worth living because there be one dependent on for earthly comfort yet must leave hungering thirsting in sad pilgrimage of thought sweet ministry be for david father be for thought bitterly be rival still dead a well a living be very faithful will not forget heart be still closed to elizabeth did not seem to notice silence talked on about mr charrington new school then cedric came flying down path to meet next moment malcolm saw dinah smiling in porch after dinner that evening gathered round fire for night be still chilly elizabeth joined circle to hear cedric scheme discussed from dark corner malcolm watched in spite of unrelieved black absence of ornament be looking more like old elizabeth grew interested then quite absorbed in cedric project soon began discussing with wonted vivacity when malcolm made damping remark argued point with in most peremptory fashion be quite elizabethan in rebuke be worst of talking to lawyer said severely legal mind take such cut dried view granted that be speculation seems promising one nothing venture nothing have know how feel die be quite willing to do share then dinah who be in quite flutter of excitement pleasure looked at adviser in timid deprecating fashion if mr herrick think be not imprudent must like to do a cedric wish replied though there be need to touch money betty elizabeth took notice of remark have proposal to make went on in such animated voice malcolm quite started why must not go down see place mr strickland must come too donnarton be only three hour from town must be sort of picnic excursion know dinah must like bravo betty what brick be exclaimed cedric boisterously malcolm observed in low voice that be excellent idea when talked over quietly found amendment be necessary must be impossible to go return same day there be farm to inspect most likely must have to consult lawyer matter ended by cedric volunteering to go back with malcolm when returned to town talk matter over with harry strickland if decent lodging must be found in little town of donnarton must stop at least one night a early day a possible be to be fixed arrangement be to be made by gentleman dinah be evidently charmed with prospect of seeing priory elizabeth ardour quickly cooled when found must be necessary to remain night suppose must not go without die observed when alone with sister then dinah face fell oh betty dear must spoil everything said in distressed tone surely want to see dear cedric future home of course want to see returned elizabeth rather shortly only must have preferred going down quietly little later on be somewhat contradictory a have proposed plan perhaps delighted look on malcolm face when heard proposition have somewhat alarmed for next day be little cool distant in manner to left entertainment to dinah cedric chapter xli can be dinah friend sometimes said thing will be no more expectation wearies will cease will resign now be at peace yet never gave o'er christina rossetti various complication prevented templeton strickland picnic a cedric termed from being speedily carried out be not until middle of may that day be definitely fixed cedric brought sister up to waterloo where malcolm mr strickland met whole party be to be housed at priory where be to sleep two night there be plenty of good bedroom harry strickland told in rough homely fashion must undertake that must be comfortable have already be down to priory to look after thing to tell mr renshaw that must find temporary help must have brought down hamper of delicacy from fortnum mason cedric remonstrated with said sister must much prefer simple country fare then harry gave order to bailiff that plumpest chicken fattest duck be to be sacrificed new laid egg cream served ad libitum malcolm always looked back on two day a saddest yet most beautiful have ever known for what sadness can be equal to of being with person one love best in world yet being conscious of great dividing gulf never narrow yet in spite of happiness to know one roof must cover for two day malcolm be in condition when be thankful for even fragment crumb kind smile approving word from elizabeth made heart beat more quickly a for dinah be in seventh country be lovely priory beautiful picturesque old place with leaded casement deep porch wonderful neglected garden veritable wilderness of sweet liked everything admired everything thought harry strickland thoroughly nice fellow elizabeth wandered over house suggesting improvement in practicable sensible way full of admiration for fine oak staircase really beautiful cabinet bench on landing place in best parlour roger strickland have always called parlour oak parlour cedar parlour latter charming room with fine ceiling cedar lined panel cosy nook by fireplace covered with quaint tapestry elizabeth fell in love with room directly insisted that certain cabinet have seen upstairs must be brought down to cedar parlour that empty recess must be fitted up for book young men listened to quite meekly reform alteration became so sweeping extensive at last that malcolm who at first have be only amused grew seriously alarmed must see what mr atkins think kept observing must decide on nothing without mr atkins be lawyer who have managed strickland business be to drive into donnarton very afternoon to consult nevertheless when malcolm made little protest elizabeth only shrugged shoulder muttered something about cautious legal mind under breath good for betty that have lawyer handy observed cedric in high good humour must be ruining dinah too herrick be right will mend hole lay down fresh flooring where be absolutely necessary do cleaning painting be required rest can keep for while parlour two decent bedroom be will require then went off to see dairy drove into donnarton after early dinner on arriving at lawyer elizabeth suddenly remarked that be far too large party that meant to do little sight seeing on own account so a knew of old that be useless to argue with went inside from over wire blind in dingy front room malcolm watched crossing butter market in direction of ancient churchyard skirted one side of troubled to hear bell toll a passed through little gate moment later funeral procession following small coffin evidently of child climbed slowly up step after that resigned to long tedious hour room be hot airless lawyer very prosy unnecessarily fluent seemed straightforward honest man gave good counsel malcolm be soon put into possession of strickland bequest after be plain sailing land be good though farm have deteriorated little judicious management moderate outlay must soon put thing on different footing be mr atkins opinion have suggested that partner with capital must be found final arrangement be made after then cedric suggested that must have tea at inn malcolm volunteered to go in search of elizabeth felt sure that must find still in churchyard be right be standing near one of dreary monument affectionate relative loved to raise to departed friend in early victorian era there be old time with beard scythe broken column veiled mourner dejected looking cherub stiff funereal urn elizabeth be looking at cluster of grassy mound under yew tree with simple headstone here there cross looked up at malcolm with quiet smile have sent to find asked be so nice peaceful here like to think of tired worker resting after labour work done think make mistake there returned malcolm falling at once into vein of thought resting true work be certainly not finished be only broken off because probably have reached part can only be carried on under certain condition elizabeth turned round in quick way say that again exclaimed eagerly malcolm repeated speech like murmured if one must only grasp thought there be difficulty surely replied people often talk of continuity of life continuity of love why not continuity of work think of thousand of worker who have gone hence many of in prime of youth manhood votary of science of art pioneer missionary soldier of cross soldier of queen vast army that man can number here malcolm paused yes yes oh please go on elizabeth be drinking in word a though be new wine know what wisdom of solomon say 'in sight of unwise seemed to die departure be taken for misery ' looking at with smile know better than think a mr carlyon doe that there will be active life work there elizabeth large sad eye be full of yearning a asked question how must face future if did not believe returned malcolm earnestly why be talent gift of genius thirst for knowledge given to if be not to be developed turned to account hereafter think of condition under such work will be done here malcolm voice be full of enthusiasm wisdom of age around great one of earth in whose footprint have striven to walk beside in fulness of majesty hindrance physical weakness painful conflict between human will clouded intellect heir of age will have entered goodly heritage oh forgive checking abruptly for tear be streaming down cheek no have be comfort will not forget have done so much good then wiped away tear tried to smile by time reached inn have regained composure during drive home malcolm occupied seat next in waggonette dinah who be opposite to noticed that elizabeth talked more to than have done since unlucky afternoon at pool that malcolm looked unusually happy content be of short duration next morning a be waiting for waggonette to take to station elizabeth wandered into deserted garden malcolm who followed found standing under guelder rose tree picking of snowy blossom greeted with smile reminds of cedric nursery day observed used to love to pelt with soft white ball when be mite of thing in white frock blue ribbon powder puffin used to call what pretty little fellow be to be sure well mr herrick a malcolm made reply so little jaunt be at end have really be very pleasant think so have enjoyed returned malcolm spoke with marked emphasis oh so have replied lightly be so delightful to see two boy so ridiculously happy for cedric harry strickland have behaved during breakfast time like couple of crazy schoolboy have helped to make so observed malcolm meaningly oh in careless tone dinah be taking lion share if have have way must have restored beautiful old place two lawyer be enough to crush woman be only thankful that be able to check such sinful extravagance returned calmly believe generosity can degenerate into positive vice elizabeth refused to listen to if have be cedric house must have done up from garret to basement said wilfully anyhow mean to take garden in hand when come down to wood house next will hear plan of course will have one of old fight over now what be there in speech to cause curious revulsion in malcolm mind elizabeth be speaking with utmost good humour at other moment must have thought imperiousness charming so what possessed to draw up say rather stiffly that feared that must be time before saw at staplegrove know be going abroad summer with mother anna sheldon continued gravely be going to engadine italian lake be not until august returned elizabeth rather taken aback by malcolm sudden gravity have be so pleased with previous afternoon liking for have deepened have felt genuine desire for friendship in secret heart knew how well have behaved be grateful to for delicacy tact at moment felt a though have received douche of cold water be not until august be only may now repeated rather seriously yes know here malcolm lost self command perhaps may sunshine dazzled soft friendliness in elizabeth eye that unvarying kindliness tried endurance for once underlying bitterness found vent can not come before go abroad of people ought not to expect must know how feel that be not good for when be with can scarcely endure pain spoke harshly almost flinging word at answered quite humbly forgive did not want to hurt in trembling voice did not understand no have never understood there be conciliation in tone make thing harder for elizabeth ought not to have said happiness of two day have be too much for will keep away until have regained mastery over then will come if want if there be anything can do for sister must send for must not do that returned averting face shower of white petal powdered ground at foot a nervous finger unconsciously stript stalk have made that impossible then continued impulsively mr herrick must believe how sorry be have be friend such true kind friend have be so grateful to can never be

be very near sob in minute recovered dinah wisely said more moment elizabeth saw malcolm face at luncheon knew sister be right be unusually silent rather constrained in manner hardly addressed then evil spirit of contradiction entered into elizabeth became suddenly extremely talkative to listen to rotherwood might have be rustic paradise full of village hampdens mute inglorious milton in idyllic street peace simplicity reigned even heavy loutish tommies jack who have exasperated by dense stupidity that morning be only subject for humorous anecdote two with little effective sprightly touch made cedric throw back head with boyish laugh malcolm never raised eye from plate to elizabeth graphic description be far from amusing be thankful when meal be over be ready to set out for rotherwood dinah have call to pay so elizabeth have house to herself for hour two must not be idle for moment sun be hot on terrace flower bed vas be to be replenished dinah have returned brought cup of tea

succeed in saving think not have fancy that told that preferred strangling to help oh be only dream a elizabeth looked rather horrified at dream of pool be never happy one elizabeth made reply to perhaps word be little difficult at moment a malcolm said more observed presently suppose thought must exorcise nightmare by seeing place again then turned round looked full in face line round mouth be fixed stern said with unnatural calmness such exorcism must be useless in case have only come to take last look at elizabeth strength seemed to forsake sank down on boulder what what do mean asked faintly what do mean with bitter laugh eye flashed ominously mean that be coward coward run away do not elizabeth be beaten confess be going to give up will come here more more not come to wood house
