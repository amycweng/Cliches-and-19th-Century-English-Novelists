match be over just a be sauntering homewards encountered mr blake in course of brief conversation learnt that mr blake be in town michael thought must call see if audrey be ready to come home must do harm to inquire at door biddy who be scouring doorstep told abruptly to step in must find lady half amused at own coolness nothing loath accepted invitation found kester alone in dining room busy over

spoken with sort of involuntary outburst for moment captain burnett turned head aside felt rebuked by crude boyish enthusiasm have gone so straight to heart of thing why be grown man so selfish so impatient when poor lad acquiesced so meekly in fate have kester deserved lot 'you be right ' observed michael in low tone 'one ought only to be thankful not complain just at moment audrey came in stood on threshold transfixed with amazement until michael rose offered chair here ' gasped ' thought heard voice mollie be cousin captain burnett suppose must let stay to tea ' mollie gave invitation

nicest man that have ever seen be so kind so helpful told such interesting story mollie forgot cinderella rag a listened eye sparkled pretty colour came to face rough brown hair have gleam of gold in mollie did not look plain awkward then eye be nice have sweet voice ringing laugh ' thought michael a glanced at how merry be what nonsense talked a sat there watching pigeon circling among arch little garden be still pleasant zack be stretched out beside with booty curled up near be first to call attention to lateness of hour must go home now michael said in tone of regret be loudly echoed by mollie kester mollie closed green gate after then rushed back to kester 'do like captain burnett mean asked eagerly ' be so afraid of at first eye seem to look one through through even when say

throwing down on grass while zack jumped on 'have got tea for mollie have forgotten teapot in hero worship how late mother be hesitated looked at kester must like to meet be such long lonely walk ' a cloud stole over kester face 'perhaps will take omnibus open book let see day work ' cyril quietly repressed yawn a took cup of cold tea from mollie hand be tired walk through dewy lane must refresh

if be true have continued 'where be harm of wealthy widower with one daughter falling in love with good looking widow yet edith bryce seems to hint darkly at misconduct on mr blake part ' 'you be putting too strongly dear ' replied sister only said considered mr blake rather flippant in manner little too gracious to gentleman audrey have refused to hear more ' be utterly wretched at headingly

apprenticeship know how hard be for pleasure loving nature to be deprived of so many source of enjoyment to have to stint one taste for pretty thing to be perpetually saying to one self ' 'and yet own that be happy ' yes after fashion think poor child be until kester got so ill mollie used to walk about richmond park build castle in air planned what must do if be rich sometimes must amuse ourselves by looking into shop window thinking what must like to buy like couple of gutter child sometimes on winter evening must blow out candle sit round fire tell story 'and then say kester fell ill ' be not exactly illness seemed to dwindle pine somehow cyril got dreadfully anxious about think richmond suited must not give comfort needed fretted so about want of education seemed to get better directly went to headingly cyril began to give lesson 'yes see then audrey took advantage of pause to look at watch be later than thought rose reluctantly to go mr blake rose too think odd unconventional sort of person to tell ' asked little abruptly 'do know cyril often say that make very anxious because be so dreadfully impulsive speak out everything think made up mind afternoon when cyril told that mr bryce be connection of sister must talk to about headingly worry on first opportunity be very glad have spoken to think be very brave of ' dear miss ross not brave cowardly be so afraid must be

than can say know will very soon get fond of be not blameless then curious doubt crept into audrey mind with impulsiveness be not mr blake rather clever woman to tell that forester story in own way audrey have already heard very different version knew agatha forester have lived in deadly terror of charming widow be true that have declined to believe story that sympathy be enlisted on mr blake side still be not rather clever stratagem on mr blake part to secure a ally audrey dismissed thought a quickly a passed through mind what nonsense ' argued ' be accusing mr blake of being little deep when owned frankly that be anxious to prejudice in favour of course knew edith bryce must talk to gage be only wise of to tell truth people must have treated very badly at headingly son must not have

ross gave message ' believe have have message have audrey audrey laughed little guiltily did not always remember people message mr blake shook head at 'oh traitress ' exclaimed playfully 'and thought of people be to be trusted captain burnett must give own message want to thank for kindness to poor boy 'he be not poor at replied lightly keen blue eye seemed to take measure mental physical of graceful looking woman before 'he be very clever fellow will make mark can assure quite envy brain 'it make so proud to hear say that often wonder why child be so clever father ' checked then went on

be wrong be fault if foolish child choose to swear by mother cleverness doe not consist in chattering little french italian doe captain burnett know better than will always be lasting wonder to why

for knowledge showed one of translation to dr ross be quite struck by know dr ross be fine greek scholar mr blake seemed much impressed be evidently taken aback be generally so absorbed in eldest son that failed to give kester due boy be shy retiring with very likely felt unappreciated anyhow be certain that sought sympathy from everyone mother yet in own way be kind to audrey be little disappointed to find michael so grave in manner to charming friend for such already considered mr blake michael be generally so nice genial with people did not seem in least aware that be talking to pretty woman in audrey opinion seemed disposed to pick hole in mr blake word to find matter for argument not that must be apparent to anyone then knew michael so well must always tell in moment if approved disapproved of anyone one thing be clear enough to that mr blake be not at ease lost gay fluency hesitated for word now then when left lake walked towards tennis ground cyril intercepted gave appealing look to draw to side for once cyril be blind to mother wish shook hand with captain burnett then fell behind to speak to audrey 'do mean to say that have finished game already asked in surprise indeed only mr fortescue discovered that be late took daughter away of course must not beat single handed wheeler be crack player so made up mind to consider drawn game ought not to have thrown over miss ross ' dropping voice 'it be hardly kind be ' 'must have play with neglect other guest returned smiling ' think owe gratitude for providing with partner like gertrude fortescue be one

behe be most kind about have promised to call on to morrow mother be so pleased doe not look happy miss ross be so fond of sort of thing dull life never suit nearly moped to death at headingly be uncomfortable there ' think will get on with rutherford people 'indeed hope so miss ross do know be so vexed about something mother said other afternoon when mr ross mr harcourt be calling on a audrey looked mystified went on slowly behe actually told that must accept evening engagement that hoped one must invite to dinner ' 'oh yes remember ' ' be afraid must have thought very strange tell mother that be far too frank outspoken for civilised age that there be not slightest need to flaunt poverty in neighbour face cyril spoke with air of unmistakable annoyance audrey good naturedly hastened to soothe fine instinct told that stronger more reticent nature must often be wounded by mother indiscreet tongue ' be afraid be little worldly minded mr blake consider mother be far more honest 'thank ' in low tone same returning to usual manner be premature absurd to make such statement mother have to do a like ' throwing back handsome head with sort of wilfulness that audrey thought very becoming 'and intend to go out miss ross be going to ask very odd question there be other lady to whom can put inquiry doe cost so very much mean how much doe cost for lady to be properly dressed for evening ' audrey did not dare to laugh cyril be so evidently in earnest nice tact guarded from making such grievous mistake question be little vague mr blake hardly know what be to understand by do mean evening dress for one dinner party succession of dinner party know be perpetual in rutherford house invite other house to dinner in rutherford be terribly given to dining out ' see relay of gown must be required returned cyril in dejected voice be afraid must give up then mother must certainly not be able to afford for present 'but when one wear black change of dress be not so necessary ' interrupted audrey eagerly be poor must not allow poverty to debar from society of fellow creature just because must not make a great display a other people indeed must not be slave of clothes can believe that ' with admiring glance ' must have one good black dress must be a nice a mean must allow must wear everywhere must not care bit if people looked a though recognised be noticing gown must say to yes be old friend old friend be better than new mean to cling to mine by by when be little richer will buy ' ross if mother must hear ' 'tell what say bid do same black suit so perfectly too ' 'oh never mean to wear anything else black ' returned gravely 'let get soft silk surah for example if be made prettily in newest fashion will look well for long time yes reflectively bers blake must look well in surah ' 'must do mind telling how to spell ' cyril produced pocket book u r h 'thank thousand time miss ross about cost must five pound do ' looking at anxiously 'oh yes must say must do replied audrey who in reality knew very little about mr blake must have done better to have consulted geraldine thought geraldine must have told price to fraction of shilling must have directed to best shop for making excellent bargain geraldine have genius for practical thing whereas audrey be liable to make mistake be sure five pound will do repeated by way of encouragement again cyril thanked fervently there be more opportunity for carrying on interesting discussion for others be now standing quite still in shrubbery walk waiting for to join dearest boy everyone have gone ' exclaimed mr blake in tone of dismay tennis lawn be empty ' doe that matter ' replied audrey hastening up to with heightened colour a noticed quick observant look on michael part 'we have rule for monday people come when like stay a long a like ' 'but still to be last to go first visit to woodcote ' rejoined mr blake uneasily 'cyril ought to have taken away long ago 'we will make adieu now returned carelessly not at affected by mother discomposure 'come see mr ross standing in drawing room window be evidently waiting for ' cyril drew mother hand through arm audrey michael followed to gate mr blake kissed audrey with effusion audrey who in spite of large heart wide sympathy be not demonstrative person must willingly have dispensed with little attention before gentleman mr blake have never offered to embrace before have idea too that cyril be not quite pleased 'come come mother ' said impatiently 'we be detaining miss ross hurried away audrey must have returned to house at once michael asked to take turn in shrubbery have not seen for whole week grumbled 'and be hardly possible to get word with now ' 'well have now ' returned with assumed gaiety time wanted to be alone think what mr blake parting look meant 'it be so so ' audrey must not quite find word now michael be ready ' audrey be going to say ' be ready to hear opinion of mr blake just at moment saw father coming to meet two be company three be none a michael audrey felt at moment dr ross on contrary joined with air of man who know to be acquisition tucked daughter hand under arm began questioning michael about week in town a happened michael have seen done good deal audrey be soon interested in what have to tell knew michael friend by name in way must claim acquaintance with large circle be soon busily questioning in turn have seen that pretty little mr maddox be baby christened who be second godfather so on until gong warned to disperse conversation at dinner ran on same topic just before rose from

always criticised friend felt part of duty utter disapprobation be so unexpected be crushing absolutely crushing too whose opinion trusted so entirely 'oh hope mean that be only joking ' said so earnestly that felt little sorry for abruptness be too late to retract besides michael never retracted ' be sorry asked question be bound to tell truth know ' 'and be really truth asked little piteously 'it be very soon for to have made up mind that like why have only spoken to twice ' 'yes have have plenty of time to form opinion of look here audrey must not be vexed with must not have found fault with fair friend if have not asked opinion of course admire one have seldom seen prettier woman style be so uncommon too ' michael will be praising hair complexion next a gertrude fortescue did other afternoon be woman mr blake want to like ' 'ah just so ' 'and now be so disappointed somehow never enjoy friend quite so much if care for thought always liked same people now ' here audrey stopped felt vexed mortified did want michael to share interest in blake now will look on a broken reed after be not so bad like kester be fine fellow like little friend mollie be true a steel ' after moment pause ' like mr blake ' 'be quite sure of michael ' 'yes be quite sure of if know anything of human nature mr blake be worthy of esteem a far a man be good be good then have such splendid capability audrey felt vaguely that be generous on michael part yet must not have told why be generous if have have idea of truth a yet be only dimly conscious of nobility of michael nature

extreme surprise 'you be very incomprehensible to night michael at one moment praise mr blake say nice thing about next minute be warning people against becoming intimate with be surely very inconsistent ' there be method in madness ' returned quietly have nothing to say against young man a far a can tell there be harm in be so young be such devoted son that be likely to be influenced by mother ' be on account that must dislike such intimacy oh michael ' very sorrowfully have idea must dislike so 'it seems rather unreasonable such pretty woman too on whole think do like talking to be so amusing audrey must say one thing be always talking about frankness now agree with ' ' understand michael have never known anyone so outspoken ' 'outspoken yes well will explain be frank audrey hide nothing because there be nothing to hide if there be must not hide now mr blake have reserve with impulsiveness have thorough self command must never say word more than suited own purpose be pleasure to indulge in wild picturesque sort of talk be effective plea people mr blake in common with other pretty woman like to please there be positive harm in perhaps not detracts from reality

member of blake family must still be able to work happily together michael be certainly much interested in kester have adopted in same manner a have adopted mollie be comfort also that approved of mr blake michael have spoken of with decided approval without stint limit of praise nevertheless be well aware that michael must willingly have restricted intimacy that saw with reluctance father growing partiality for young master audrey have only spoken simple truth when owned that michael approval be necessary to perfect enjoyment of friend might still maintain own opinion of mr blake nevertheless first fine flavour of pleasure have be destroyed by michael severe criticism delicate bloom have be impaired must hold fast to new friend must even be kinder to a though to make up for other people hard speech much of enthusiasm must be locked in own breast 'what be use of talking on subject on must only disagree ' said to week two afterwards when have rebuked playfully for not telling something

paid to o'brien so following afternoon started off for brail a matter of course 'perhaps will come have tea with mother gage have said on bidding sister good bye brail afternoon always keep out until dinner time geraldine have generously assented to admired audrey benevolence in walking mile to see old friend whole family took lively interest in honest tom o'brien though must be allowed that mr baxter be by mean favourite audrey must have enjoyed walk more if must have kept thought free from mr blake unfortunately long grassy lane be just entering only recalled time when have carried booty have walked with to gate of woodcote found wondering in vexed manner a to cause of gravity have excited mother uneasiness grew impatient with presently 'after what doe matter to ' thought a stopped to gather red leaf daresay be only miss france after then recoiled with sort of shock for actually within few foot of be tall figure in brown tweed coat have be so busy with thought red yellow leaf that have not seen mr blake leaning against gate led into ploughed field might even have passed if have not started up confronted beiss ross ' grasping hand let gather for be too difficult for to reach ditch be so wide how many do want do care for bit of barberry ' think have enough now ' returned audrey very gravely be quite unprepared for meeting have seen flash of joy in eye a sprang forward to meet be annoyed to feel that own cheek be burning be clear sighted enough to notice something else that mr blake be talking eagerly gathering coloured leaf at random a though hardly knew what be doing after first look be avoiding eye a though be afraid that have betrayed audrey maidenly consciousness be up in arm in moment gleam in cyril eye have opened hers instinct of self defence made suddenly entrench in stiffness soft graciousness be chief charm seemed to desert for once in life be little abrupt 'there be need to gather more thank have want be in great hurry held out hand for leaf cyril withheld 'let carry for ' returned evidently trying to speak a usual voice be not quite in order ' know where be going to pretty old fashioned cottage with jasmine covered porch be not far have not seen for so long ' then stopped suddenly a though something in audrey manner arrested 'that be if object ' finished with pleading look for once audrey be obdurate 'thank must rather carry there be need to take out of way ' audrey felt that tone be cold that be utterly unlike one thought be to get rid of need not have feared cyril importunity drew back at once put leaf in hand without speaking turned very pale there be hurt look in eye audrey put out hand to did not seem to see only muttered something that sounded like 'good morning ' a lifted cap went back to gate audrey walked on very fast cheek must not cool miserable feeling of discomfort harassed be vexed with still more with why need have taken alarm so quickly be not like to be so missish disagreeable why have be so cold so unfriendly just because seemed little too pleased to see now have hurt terribly be quite sure of who never willingly offended anyone have be too proud too gentlemanly to obtrude where be evidently not wanted pained reproachful look a drew back must haunt for rest of day then how splendidly handsome have looked have once likened to greek god may be doubted whether even youthful apollo have seemed more absolutely perfect when revealed in human form to athenian votary than cyril blake in glory of young manhood audrey have not recognised so keenly before ' must make up to somehow can not bear to quarrel with anyone must rather do anything than hurt feeling thought needed excellent common sense to prevent from running back to say kind word to ' be in hurry be too abrupt did not mean to be unkind ' be what longed to say to 'please come with a far a cottage tell have be doing ' well what withheld from natural course from making amends in graceful generous fashion simply same maidenly instinct of self preservation did not go back dare not trust with cyril blake because be afraid of perhaps though be not quite so clear to be afraid of same be very miserable for doing one duty doe not always make one happy felt joy of home coming be already marred for with person of audrey temperament there be complete enjoyment if be not in thorough harmony with everyone one false note one rift within lute whole melody be spoiled so audrey gaiety seemed quenched that afternoon though old friend testified liveliest satisfaction at sight of priscilla must not make enough of be conscious that a far a own pleasure be concerned visit be failure be aware that one be conscious of fact certainly not honest tom o'brien a sat smoking pipe in porch listening to description of highland scenery with beaming face be mr baxter keen observer a testified by parting speech have done father world of good miss ross ' said a walked down to little gate with audrey ' think there be one so love to see who cheer up in same way a do be young see young people take more cheerful view of life be easy to see have not care on not that begrudge happiness for one deserves more long may continue miss ross finished mr baxter with usual mournfulness chapter xxi 'he be very brave ' 'ah life grows lovely where be only to think of give light to dark heart within whose night image though hide afar glow like lake reflected star ' mathilde blind for first time audrey closed little gate of vineyard cottage with sense of relief that visit be over two hour have just passed have be quite ordeal to true have exerted to purpose have talked amused old friend have partaken of mr baxter cake have even summoned up semblance of gaiety have wholly deceived time heart have be heavy within remembrance of cyril grieved look came between enjoyment have be lovely afternoon when have started for walk now heavy cloud be obscuring blue sky air felt heavy oppressive audrey quickened step fearing lest storm must overtake in long unsheltered lane still lay between home drew breath little a approached place where have parted with cyril more than two hour ago then gave great start again blood rushed to face for through gap in hedge must see brown tweed coat quite plainly be still there still in same position must see line of shoulder a stooped little over gate with peak of cap drawn over eye audrey slackened pace felt little breathless giddy must have to pas quite close of course if meant to speak to though heard footstep half turned head seemed to listen did not move arm from gate evidently meant to take advantage to let pas if wished to do so audrey must read determination in averted face most likely wished to think that abstraction be too great to allow to notice light footfall must make easy for to pas man eye can only see what be looking at time audrey prudence counselled in vain soft heart must not allow to go past a stranger stopped looked at cyril did not turn head ber blake ' said gently then did move slightly ' be not in way hope ' said rather coldly ' did not know be so late must have gone back please let keep miss ross be afraid there will be storm directly 'in that case have better come with ' returned trying to speak with usual friendly ease proud sad look rather daunted how must leave go on way when seemed so utterly cast down miserable be fault shake head mr blake know be hurt with because be rather abrupt just now meant nothing at only be in hurry 'that did not wish for company added bitterly 'oh mr blake ' 'you be right quite right ' went on in tone pierced heart be so hopeless so full of pain now did place at side ' blame in least be truest kindness can see now be not fault have be fool miss ross wished to pas never meant to speak to obtrude on stopped of own accord ' wished to apologise to for abruptness did not like to think unkind ' 'you be never unkind must not be if tried ' returned in same passionate tone be only so absolutely true saw what ought never to have shown thought only right to check be hurt for moment will allow perhaps in sort of sense be hurt now suppose man may own to being hurt when heart be half broken ' please talk so ' will promise never to talk so again ' returned with sad humility have gone too far to stop now 'no oh ' trying to check might a well have tried to check river have broken bond for once cyril determined that must be heard 'it be own fault returned looking at 'you must have passed on left to misery yes be miserable have made so yet for that be not to be blamed how must see how must be with not love have loved from very first hour saw ' 'oh hush hush ' audrey be half sobbing there be great tear rolling down face must hardly bear to hear to look at face be so white strained ' must always love ' went on in same low concentrated voice ' have never seen anyone like there be not girl in world who must do a be doing how can help losing heart to man must in position ' be very sorry ' murmured ' be sorry then saw tear voice softened from vehemence became very gentle 'you be so kind that know must spare pain if must be not in power be in mine be afraid of ' went on quickly a must have spoken bemember be asking for nothing expect nothing what right have to aspire to such a even if have dared to dream dream be at end now when have shown so plainly stopped turned aside face word must have be so eloquent a silence ber blake will let say something be grieved grieved to heart that must have happened if must have prevented not word of must have be spoken be too late to say so now ' 'far far too late ' must make best of must try to forget have passed mr blake must promise to do same have promised ' returned proudly promised of own accord must never talk to in way again must not ask anything more of ' beay not ' in rather faltering voice must be useless replied quickly can never leave off loving must part with life first think be not one of men who must ever love twice be young still something tell same have nothing to fear from know position mine ' 'you must not speak a though be not equal ' said in desire to comfort raise up from despondency 'it be not that what doe one poverty wealth matter ' be not that ' answered with significance made lower eye one sense be equal for one can not be more le than gentleman when one have youth strength moderate amount of talent one can always raise one self to level of woman one love if have thought that must ever have cared for ' voice trembled must not proceed ber blake must beg do entreat to say no more ' audrey lip be quivering looked quite pale at moment must bear more 'forgive said remorsefully ' be thinking more of than be trying too much ' must not deny with usual unselfishness strove again for comforting word 'it will be a though have not spoken ' said in so low voice that have to stoop to hear 'it will be sacred quite sacred let spoil everything have be so happy let try to remain good friend will try best will be very hard perhaps if have seen face that moment must have known that what asked be impossible how must be friend with girl even while assented to innocent request knew must never be beiss ross said suddenly for position be becoming too difficult for be duty to shield a much a possible 'we be just in town perhaps must be better for to drop behind little will not do for people to notice now rain be beginning if hurry on will be wet well ' returned then rather timidly put out hand to cyril did not ignore time held fast for moment have be good very patient with ' said rather huskily 'thank for a well a for everything else then stepped aside waited for to leave be limb be trembling have never felt so agitated in life hurried on panting little with haste drop fell faster faster just at entrance to town be obliged to take refuge in shed by roadside street be dark knew one must see must have time to recover little before have to answer mother anxious question there be carpenter bench pile of plank sat down on looked out at heavy torrent of rain by by cyril passed did not notice be walking very fast head be erect a though be not conscious of rain beating down on audrey shrank back little a saw 'he be young be strong ' said to herself 'he be almost a strong a michael ' then tear flowed again wiped away little impatiently must be strong too for sake a well a own will never do for people to find out secret must be spared a much a possible must help can ' a argued into calmness told again again how thankful be that michael be away michael be so observant so clear sighted that be impossible to hoodwink have terrible habit of going straight to point of putting question that one must hardly evade must have seen in moment that have be cry refusal on part to satisfy inquiry must only have deepened suspicion must not have faced michael ' thought a rain suddenly stopped stepped out into wet gleaming road audrey played part in conversation so badly that night mr ross observed uneasily that be sure audrey have taken chill be quite flushed john continued anxiously 'and noticed shiver more than once have overheated in long walk then being caught in heavy rain have done mischief dr ross looked at daughter perhaps in spite of short sight be more observant than wife for took girl face between hand to bed child ' said kindly 'and will finish game of chess with mother audrey with grateful kiss obeyed a dr ross placed opposite wife seemed little absent a though be listening in vain for something for be be habit to sing snatch of gay tune a mounted stair to night there be 'widow miller ' be doctor who hummed refrain to a captured unwary pawn ye bind up sheaf leave out few grain to heart broken widow who never complains audrey felt night a though must never sing again a though have committed crime must for ever separate from old happy self to most people remorse for unconscious fault must have seemed morbid exaggerated thousand of girl have to inflict sort of pain at least once in life wrong man love disastrous must be spoken audrey have not even said 'no for nothing have be asked have only have to listen to declaration of love honest manly confession have be wrung from speaker lip wherein then did blame consist why be audrey shedding such bitter tear a sat by window that night looking over dark garden for hundred complex reason too involved intricate to disentangle in one brief hour audrey be accusing herself of blindness of wilful foolish blindness ought to have seen must have seen to what be tending again again mr blake have shown quite plainly extent of influence over must not have warned in time to prevent most unhappy declaration must not have be kinder to have drawn back in first month of intimacy have interposed barrier of dignified reserve must have kept silent for ever have drawn on not by coquetry audrey be far too high minded to coquet with man simply by warm friendliness of manner have liked company have accepted attention not once have repulsed consequence be attachment have grown increased in intensity day by day until have overmastered have said that heart be almost broken be fault what right have to be so kind to until very softness graciousness have fed wild hope be not true when have implied that misery lay at door audrey felt a though own heart be broken that night passion of pity remorse swept over what must not give to undo 'if must only bear of suffering ' thought must only comfort must not care what became of must sooner bear anything than incur awful responsibility of spoiling life audrey wept again even at miserable crisis shrank from questioning too closely sort of terror strange beating at heart assailed if tried to look into own thought be there subtle sweetness in knowledge that be so beloved wish lying deep down in heart that might have be possible to comfort must not do must not do be sure of not of ' thought 'and must make so unhappy if must only think right then stopped there be sad sad look in eye will not think of more to night ' then knelt in simple girlish way prayed that god must forgive for have be wrong miserably wrong must comfort make possible for to remain friend 'for wish to lose ' thought audrey a laid head on pillow that for once in bright young life seemed sown with thorn seemed to audrey a though have never passed more uncomfortable three week than followed that unfortunate talk in brail lane in spite of effort to appear a though nothing have happened look gravity be noticed by mr ross geraldine ' told father that be chill ' observed mr ross on more than one occasion behe be growing thin eye be so heavy in morning there be nothing worse than suppressed cold went on anxiously for even small ailment in one of child always called forth motherly solicitude geraldine held opinion audrey never took cold have often got wet through in scotland have never hurt thought more probable that audrey be troubled about something perhaps missed michael then paused looked at mother with significance perhaps who know might even be little hurt at mr blake desertion for certain little bird that fabulous winged purveyor of gossip dear to feminine mind have whispered into young mr harcourt ear most curious story be said that mr blake have fallen deeply in love with cornish beauty certain miss france hackett that moody look be owing to 'edith have seen went on geraldine a repeated story with immense relish behe be pretty little thing dark eyed brunette hacketts be very wealthy people say miss france will have few thousand pound of own so will be lucky if get perhaps pere hackett be obdurate may account for mr blake gloom for be certainly very bad company just now ' 'your father think look very ill be speaking to about last night be wonderful what fancy have taken to ' ' think like ' returned geraldine who must afford to praise now fear about audrey be removed beiss france might do worse for herself be very clever rising young man a percy say then be so handsome girl might well lose heart to ' mr ross be quite willing to regard mr blake a miss france suitor unhappy lover be sure to excite warmest sympathy be little shocked scandalised at geraldine hint bey dear ' said in more dignified tone than usually employed to eldest daughter ' think have right to say such thing of sister audrey be last girl in world to fancy man be in love with to trouble because chose to fall in love with one else have often seen mr blake together have dined here dozen time manner have always be perfectly friendly with a frank a possible just a be to michael ' thought seemed little constrained uncomfortable last night when mr blake came into room returned geraldine who certainly seemed to notice everything knew mother too well to say more just then with softness mr ross have great deal of womanly dignity nothing must have ruffled more than to be made to believe that one of girl cared for man who have just given heart to woman that audrey bright unselfish audrey must be that girl must never have be brought to believe audrey be quite aware that sister eye be upon exerted to utmost on occasion when geraldine be present gaiety be very far from felt day with certain sickness of heart that burden be growing too heavy for position with regard to mr blake be becoming more difficult in spite of effort to see a little a possible of circumstance be perpetually throwing together day met at luncheon must still keep seat between father how differently that hour passed now instead of eager low toned talk that merry interchange of daily news plan cyril must be absorbed in carving in supervision of boy seemed to have leisure to talk to audrey grave remark upon weather brief question two then turned to fellow master mr greville audrey never tried to divert attention listened to two young men little wearily politics must still interest thought yes politics be always safe once when have excuse to offer for be very ready with excuse joined at family dinner audrey never passed miserable evening sat opposite there be other guest to break awkwardness only mr blake mother father be first time have be compelled to look at be painfully struck with alteration in father be right certainly looked ill be thinner older there be dark line under eye just at moment cyril seemed to become aware of scrutiny eye met be audrey who blushed looked embarrassed cyril did not flinch only right hand contracted under table cloth played chess with afterwards there be help for dr ross have proposed audrey be so nervous that played shamefully lost queen at third move stupid of ' said trying to laugh off cyril looked at very gravely ' be afraid find bore said with such evident understanding of nervousness that tear came to eye when have played little longer suddenly jumbled piece together 'it be unfair to take advantage of longer said jumping up 'no one can play without queen have lost castle one of knight be just going to take other be only trying patience for nothing game be mine ' 'yes be yours returned audrey in rather melancholy voice why have ended so abruptly must have noticed how hand shook how very nervous have be did not dare look at a bade good night must go heard say to dr ross ' have work to finish then went out heard door close behind 'be always to be like thought audrey a stood by window 'will never speak to look at again in old way to night went away to spare because saw how uncomfortable be be very brave suppose man pride help somehow think be easier for than perhaps be different from other woman always feel a though must rather bear pain than inflict on person chapter xxii 'no have not spared ' 'thy word unspoken thou canst day speak thy spoken ne'er again unsay ' eastern proverb trench michael be still away business detained be not to be settled a easily a have expected there be complication host of minor difficulty be unwilling to return until thing be

to interest thoroughly in case like kester have great hope of result have written to brother perhaps must be wise to say a little a possible to mr blake be far too sanguine by nature must never do to excite hope might never be gratified mr blake be of different calibre will look at thing more sensibly audrey sighed a laid aside michael letter seemed to miss more day yet be quite willing that absence must be prolonged michael must have noticed want of spirit in moment must never have be free from affectionate surveillance at distance everything be so much easier must write cheerfully must fill sheet with small incident matter of local interest with pleasant inquiry about kester nevertheless michael face grew graver over letter must not have told what be lacking to entire satisfaction only strange subtle chord of sympathy a delicate a be unerring warned that be not right with girl behe be not a bright a usual thought be letter be generally overflowing with fun there be grave almost forced tone about last one so seldom mention blake audrey have certainly avoided gray cottage during last three week even mollie lesson be irksome to mollie tongue be not easily silenced in spite of effort cheek often burnt at girl innocent loquacity mollie be for ever making awkward speech asking question audrey found difficult to answer must chatter incessantly about mother cyril beamma be so dreadfully worried about cyril ' said once behe want to speak to dr powell be quite sure that be ill hardly eats anything at least have appetite mamma say be so strange in young man walk about room

piano morning will hand that feather brush please want to try duet with be such pretty one ' after mollie finger be kept so hard at work that found more opportunity for talking about cyril time a audrey looked over french exercise heard deep sigh glancing up from book found mollie gazing at with round sorrowful eye what now asked little sharply be so sorry miss ross returned mollie faltering turning red ' be so dreadfully sorry miss ross that cyril have offended thought be such good friend now ' stopped somewhat abashed at audrey displeased expression dear mollie have never be really vexed with before will annoy excessively if talk such nonsense be not in least offended with brother made say thing be perfectly good friend audrey spoke with much dignity a took up pen again poor mollie looked very much frightened 'oh dear miss ross said penitently 'you be not really cross with be be not own idea only mamma said last night that be sure be offended about something for never come to see now manner be so different when spoke to after chapel on sunday then said perhaps cyril have offended ' ' tell be nonsense mollie 'yes be sure there be something ' returned mollie half cry for audrey have never be impatient with before 'cyril will never let talk to about get up leaf room when mamma begin wondering why never come cyril be quite cross when asked to give message other day be more in mollie line said never can remember message walked away mamma cried said must not think what have happened to that have never be cross with in life before that now hardly dared open lip to took up so audrey sighed wearily then gave comforting little pat dear ' said kindly ' did not mean to be cross with do say such thing know really be old enough to know better a mollie only looked at wonderingly go away be dear little soul talk a though be baby one be offended if brother be not well why can not leave in peace think understand that men never like to be questioned about ailment be not like woman cornwall certainly did not agree with ' 'do think be only that oh wo say word if will only not be cross with mollie relieved feeling by one of strangling hug mollie be quite used to people finding fault with telling be goose when audrey kissed sat down copied exercise in humble contrite spirit be audrey who felt sad spiritless rest of day have gone deeper than thought have gone very deep ' said with sort of shiver a walked up to hillside afternoon far worse ordeal be before audrey one threw mollie girlish chatter into shade few day afterwards received little note from mr blake bey dear miss ross began ' be nearly desperate what have mollie done that must be sent to coventry after fashion at least not mollie be wrong there mollie still basks in light of smile be still allowed to converse with be only who seem to be debarred from such privilege now dear creature what can mean by keeping away from like be at woodcote yesterday have flown have to sit chat with mr ross instead be delightful be not daughter one can ever fill place one can be miss ross now will make amends for unfriendliness if will only come to tea with to morrow will promise full forgiveness warmest of welcome affectionately resentfully m blake audrey wrote pretty playful little answer to be sorry to be accused of unfriendliness nothing be farther from thought be very busy very much engaged relay of parent have be interviewing at woodcote sister have not be well afternoon have be spent at hillside mr blake must be lenient must come soon very soon so on mr blake be more formidable than mollie audrey be determined to delay visit a long a possible just now have good excuse geraldine be little delicate ailing mother went daily to hillside audrey breathed more freely when have sent off note have given into cyril hand at luncheon sudden impulse made choose that mode of delivery ' wish must give to mother ' said addressing suddenly a sat beside behe want to have tea with to morrow be impossible have so much to do just now ' ' must have told there be need for to write to trouble in way be afraid mother be rather exacting be blake foible smiled a spoke there be special meaning in tone seemed to take a matter of course that audrey visit to cottage have ceased 'it will be all right ' said a put letter in breast pocket then stopped called boy to order 'you will stay in after luncheon robert said severely after that did not speak again to audrey that letter strange to say brought thing to climax very next morning mollie gave audrey note 'it be from mamma said rather timidly 'must like to begin piece miss ross while read ' 'yes certainly doe not seem long letter indeed only contained few word miss ross ' must see if will not come to will tell mollie when may call must will speak to alone ' audrey twisted up paper in hand then stood behind mollie beat time for moment said hurriedly a turned over page tell mother will come to afternoon little before three will not be able to stay just for hour then sat down quietly patiently pointed out how erring passage ought to be played there be tired look on face long before lesson ended life long audrey never forgot strange chill sensation came over a read that note be a though dim overmastering force be impelling against own will a crushed letter in hand told that circumstance be becoming too strong for face be very grave afternoon a pushed open green gate walked up to open door seemed to a though be someone else a crossed threshold stood for moment in little hall biddy came out of kitchen mistress be in drawing room said miss mollie be out audrey still with strange weight at heart went upstairs slowly mr blake be sitting in usual seat by window rose without speaking took audrey hand there be smile upon face looked very pale audrey must see at once that have be weeping 'you have come ' said quietly thought letter must bring perhaps be wrong of to write ought to have come to instead how be to speak to alone last night be almost desperate then be obliged to send for ' 'if wanted so much of course be right to send for ' audrey be conscious that manner be cold that voice be hardly a sympathetic a usual be sure mr blake noticed for eye filled with tear how coldly speak poor boy have indeed offended deeply oh know everything be too unhappy last night to hide longer from mother do know what said to that with strength must not bear that must go away away leave rutherford ' 'yes now tear be streaming down face voice be almost choked with sob 'he said must give up that must go away that effort be killing that man must bear such ordeal oh miss ross a audrey averted face ' know be sorry for think what be for mother to stand by hear say such thing boy brave noble hearted boy who have never given hour pain in life 'and have sent for to tell ' there be something proud almost resentful in audrey tone 'yes must not be angry with think that if cyril knew be betraying must never give confidence again last night heard walking about room went up to wanted to send away must not go knelt down beside put arm round neck told that have found out secret have come to with sudden flash a sat beside in chapel last sunday passed up aisle saw face then knew what ailed in darkness whispered in ear poor boy love audrey ross ' audrey put up one hand to shield face made remark must hear have brought misery upon must not refuse to share 'he owned then will not tell what said must be sacred between boy oh know nature be intense like mine take nothing easily when say that be killing by inch that must go away know be speaking truth how be to live here seeing day knowing that there be love for in heart how must man drag out such hopeless existence ' beuch thing be done day audrey hardly knew what be saying dull pain seemed to contract heart be going away somehow thought have never occurred to 'yes not by men of cyril nature be strong very strength seems to make suffer more keenly if stayed here people must begin to talk must not always be able to hide what felt think ought to go away for sake be giving pain now by by will be worse be very word ' think must be braver to stay on here will tell so mr blake ' miss ross will not tell so will not consent to see slowly tortured if tell must go will not say dissenting word what be own comfort compared to have have hard life god know now will be harder still 'but have other child to consider ' remonstrated audrey faintly 'if leave here mollie kester will be sacrificed surely have put before ' 'no indeed have not have always be first consideration of course know how bad will be for poor child if come to to choose between cyril ' strange passionate look came into eye hush like to hear talk so replied audrey 'it be wrong mother ought to make such difference be not must not say such thing be trouble ' 'perhaps be right returned drearily ' think have half crazed to know must go away oh if knew what life have be what haven of rest have seemed ' looked round room sort of spasm crossed face 'it be so sweet homelike have loved so now to begin afresh to go amongst stranger then loss stopped a though something seemed to choke audrey felt a though must hear more 'it be fault ' burst out 'how must hate ' mr blake shook head with sad smile ' seem to have power of hating ' said so gently that audrey lip quivered can hate what boy love then paused looked at audrey a though sight of suppressed emotion stirred dim hope within 'if thought must help must kneel at foot like beggar pray to have compassion upon know what such pity must be worth do think cyril must accept woman pity ' 'no ' then audrey rose put out hand in beseeching way 'will let go indeed indeed can bear more 'yes will go returned mr blake in stifled tone ' have not be generous have spared nothing yet be not fault have not played with boy heart never tried to win heart cyril said so ' 'no have not spared ' be answer then two woman parted without kissing other audrey be too sore too bewildered for such caress stood holding other hand for moment then mr blake walked to other end of room threw down upon couch audrey looked at for instant then turned went slowly down stair a closed green gate after told that must be alone for little with sudden impulse turned into courtyard led to school house chapel there be one spot where must be in perfect seclusion be school library even if stray boy be to make appearance in search of book very unlikely thing at time in afternoon presence there must attract notice have several time chosen a cool quiet retreat on hot summer afternoon sight of big shabby room with pillar book recess sloping desk gave momentary sense of relief stillness soothed tumultuous singing in head ear seemed to lull sat down in one of inner recess looked out on row of ivy covered study little gate led down to town tame jackdaw be hopping among stone couple of fan tail pigeon be strutting near mellow brightness of october sunshine seemed to flood whole court oh how peaceful looked how calm still then audrey suddenly put down face on hand cried like baby if be only not fault ' sobbed 'but can not can not bear ' for time must hing weep chapter xxiii 'daddy want to speak to ' 'to eye there be one beloved face on earth be shining on ' chapman audrey never knew how long sat there shedding healing tear one of seemed to relieve overcharged heart be luxury to sit there in cool shadowed stillness presently must rouse go back to world again presently not just now by by must think out must question own heart more closely hitherto have feared such scrutiny now must be selfish cowardly to avoid longer at present minute be only conscious that everyone else be miserable at moment heard footstep crossing courtyard then to dismay entered lobby have only just time to drag down book from shelf open haphazard be volume on natural history anyone must have thought absorbed pored so attentively over plate of gaudy butterfly never raising head to look at new comer who stood few yard off regarding with unqualified astonishment cyril blake for be other who have entered library must willingly have withdrawn without attracting notice one of boy in sanatorium wanted certain fascinating book of adventure have promised to fetch knew volume be in very recess saw with annoyance that must be necessary to disturb beiss ross said in quiet guarded tone in always addressed now beay trouble to move just for one moment be so sorry to disturb willie taylor ' then stopped a though be suddenly petrified audrey have risen quickly a moved aside have full view of face flushed cheek swollen eyelid told own tale heaven exclaimed forgetting errand speaking in excessive agitation be unhappy something be matter cyril turned quite pale poor audrey feeling be not very enviable at moment that must be discovered by very person whom be most anxious to avoid if must only go away leave not stand there asking question nothing be farther from cyril intention for minute have forgotten everything except be unhappy 'you be not well else something have be troubling ' continued voice softened with involuntary tenderness ross promised that must be friend will not treat a one now there be nothing must not do to help if must only tell what be troubling ' 'it be impossible ' returned with little sob oh if must only go away not speak to so kindly must be troubled sometimes one can help if will only leave to myself ' 'leave like 'yes indeed indeed can not talk audrey wiped away tear seemed to blind so seldom gave way so seldom permitted feminine luxury of tear when once set flowing be simply uncontrollable must not help what cyril thought of 'if must only go away repeated turning from a stood there a though rooted to spot can not go ' here cyril lip became quite white under moustache sudden intuition of truth have come to why have not thought of before have never even occurred to hour ago have met mollie wandering about town disconsolately miss ross be at cottage have said be only call have taken message then mother have given errand to do have charged strictly not to return for at least hour never like to be at home when miss ross come mollie have observed in aggrieved tone cyril have taken notice of speech knew mother little way suspicion of truth have come to be only sight of audrey emotion quickened into life now 'you have seen mother ' exclaimed here face grew dark stern behe have be talking to making unhappy miss ross a remained silent 'you must answer concern very closely have right to know if mother have betrayed ' tone frightened audrey 'you must not be vexed with said rousing to defend absent behe be very unhappy of course troubled ' audrey spoke with usual simplicity what be use of trying to hide longer cyril impetuous pertinacity gave chance of escape 'and told that be going away ' audrey bowed head 'it be very wrong ' returned still sternly 'whom be man to trust if can not trust own mother have betrayed confidence be cruel to be far more cruel to be that can not forgive ' must not say that did not mean to be cruel mr blake of course ought not to have known of course have made very unhappy now must ask something will not wait little thing may be better easier ' here looked at timidly expression be very sweet cyril be not looking at be having hard fight with be angry justly angry a thought nay more be humiliated that mother must have appealed to girl that knowing kind heart must have inflicted pain on sight of grief gentleness almost maddened averted eye a answered 'they can not be easier mistake meaning perhaps mother have misled let put right pain difficulty be driving away think that for moment however hard might be to go on living here think must have endured if be only right to do so have made up mind that be not right to morrow morning will speak to dr ross ' 'oh here audrey clasped hand involuntarily cyril eye be fixed on carrier pigeon fluttering across courtyard 'it be duty to do must be done if dr ross question will tell truth must go away because have dared to love daughter if stayed here must never cease from effort to win be what must tell miss ross think will not press to remain under circumstance cyril gave bitter little laugh 'perhaps not ' here audrey sank down upon chair for felt weak giddy ' be glad at least that think be doing right ' ' did not say so 'pardon ' here cyril did try to get glimpse of face for something in tone baffled 'you who know must of course approve conduct if stayed here must not answer for be better safer must go though wherever be ' here voice trembled with exquisite tenderness ' must always love ' 'then in case have better remain ' audrey tried to shield face a spoke have seen little tremulous smile flit over feature must not hide dimple what must mean be fooling dreaming next moment have dropped on one knee beside be begging with tear in eye to look at 'this be matter of life death to ' implored compelling by very strength of will to turn blushing face to beiss ross audrey ' tone almost amounting to awe 'you can not mean that really care for ' ' be afraid do care too much to let go ' half whispered a grasped hand looked at almost incredulously be so impossible think in way have long cared ' even then did not seem satisfied 'it be not pity be sure of that be nothing that mother have said audrey if thought must rather die than take advantage of tell dear ' pleading of eye be almost more than must bear 'you must not so humiliate ' 'no cyril must not ' name came so naturally to hardly knew said gleam of joy passed over young man face a heard next moment drew towards audrey took quite simply listened to young lover passionate protestation of gratitude half shyly half happily reverence with treated touched profoundly did not overpower with force of affection after first few moment of agitated feeling have quieted ' must not try too much ' said be to talk for hour must never make understand how happy be be new existence be wonderful yesterday be so tired of life to day to day audrey be happy too said in soft contented voice week have be so miserable seemed to miss so must have nothing to say to do remember that evening when took queen oh how unhappy be that night saw went away ' did not go far returned taking possession of one hand soft white hand lay so quietly in 'it be only thing must do for to keep out of sight a much a possible walked up down road like sentinel for hour did not seem possible to go home sleep felt a though never wanted to sleep again must only think of in white gown a sat opposite to how hand trembled how cold felt when said good night thought be goodness because be sorry for be beginning to care for little even then darling ' ' know answered gently 'you must not question too closely hardly understand how have come about ' 'no returned looking at with sort of worship in eye worship with good true woman will sometimes inspire man make love higher education 'it be miracle be not worthy of will see will see how dearly will prize precious gift then for moment be silent 'you will not now forbid to speak to father ' said presently shade of anxiety crept into voice in spite of intense happiness thought of interview somewhat daunted be surely daring thing for junior classical master to tell chief that have won daughter affection be ordeal that most men must have dreaded audrey seemed to read thought hope will never hinder from doing duty ' said quietly 'and of course will have to speak to ' looking at with one of radiant smile will find quite prepared ' mean that will speak to first oh be surely prerogative to spare ' 'but wish to be spared returned happily 'cyril think have idea of what father be to to do suppose must sleep until have told there have never be secret between even when be little child must take broken toy to mend if fell down cut finger be always in mischief be always father who must bind up kiss comfort with hard work be never too busy to attend to ' ' think in place must have gone to mother must not be jealous darling if tell fell in love with first be so glad dear mother everyone love when gage be child be always one most with father think there be one in world like michael say same must write tell michael about 'oh yes be like brother remember told so dearest must confess be little anxious about dr ross be only poor man know may refuse consent ' audrey shook head 'father be not like ' said tranquilly 'we think same on matter be of very impulsive have money of own know not much a cyril brow contracted little 'but enough to be real help let talk about have never cared for such thing if have not penny in world must be still cyril blake ' audrey looked so charming a said that cloud on cyril brow cleared like magic 'and think father will be angry 'angry why must be angry opening eye widely 'he may be disappointed very probably will be so may think might have done better for may even argue point little great blessing be that one be not obliged to consult one sister in such case for ' looking at with old fun be afraid gage must refuse consent ' 'yes be afraid mr mr harcourt will send to coventry ' 'to be sure will suppose even coventry will be bearable under circumstance oh dear interrupting 'do see how dark be growing have actually forgotten time must really be going ' ' ought not to have kept so long ' returned remorsefully 'there will go will not detain moment think will be better for to go alone will stay here half hour must not speak to anyone just now must be alone think over wonderful thing have happened ' havery well ' replied minute elapsed before last good bye be said there be thing have forgotten to say more than once a turned away detained with parting request when have really gone last sound of footstep died away went back into dusky room threw down on chair where have sat abandoned to delicious retrospect be true be not dream said to when hour later roused to go back to gray cottage thank god that have given priceless gift if must only be worthy of finished young man with tender reverence a crossed courtyard let in at green door mr ross looked at daughter rather anxiously that evening thought audrey be rather quiet trifle subdued geraldine husband be dining at woodcote audrey who have forgotten be expected be rather taken aback when saw sister made excuse little hurriedly have be detained sort of thing have detained have be to gray cottage library have not walked far enough to tire being literal fact a not quarter of mile lay between woodcote cottage oh be not least tired hoped geraldine felt better beuch better thank ' returned geraldine with one of keen glance then somewhat elaborately changed subject audrey be not subjected to cross examination indeed there be something significant in mr harcourt entire dearth of curiosity time be saying to herself have be cry eye be quite swollen yet look cheerful what can mean what have be doing have hardly have time to smooth hair look so rough wonder if percival notice anything be sure father doe for keep looking at so on be mr harcourt who be audrey bete noir that evening be in one of argumentative mood must not be made to understand that sister in law must have preferred silence be perpetually urging to single combat touching up on supposed tender point in hope of getting rally suppose audrey who go in for woman right so warmly will differ from if say so so ' 'we must ask audrey what think of dear be great stickler for feminine prerogative then must point chin sort of sarcastic light must come into eye be positive enjoyment to when audrey rose to bait floundered hopelessly into argument on whole acquitted ill be too clever for to night percival ' said little wearily a stood talking to with coffee cup in hand ' can not think what make men so fond of debating argument if can only persuade person that black be white go home sleep quite happily be such triumph to make people see with one own eye returned a though accepting compliment ever read republic of plato must recommend for perusal be acknowledged masterpiece reasoning be superb be rich in illustration want of woman be that with intelligence be so illogical now if woman only have education of men 'harcourt think geraldine be tired must like to take home ' observed dr ross interrupting stream of eloquence mr harcourt without finishing sentence went at once in search of wife woman might be illogical be to be considered for with satire love of argument mr harcourt valued wife comfort before own be quite ready dear said a looked up at with deprecating smile 'and know mother will excuse ' dr ross have walked with daughter to gate young mr harcourt be woman who always exacted little attention from menkind around without demanding took naturally a right prerogative must have seemed strange to if father have not offered arm 'good bye father dear ' said giving firm cool cheek to kiss 'percy have have nice evening ' dr ross walked back to house then went to study lighted reading lamp there be certain interesting debate in time wished much to read ministerial crisis be at hand dr ross who be conservative to backbone be aware that party be menaced have just taken paper in hand when audrey came into room 'good night dear ' said without looking up audrey did not take hint want to speak to ' said very quietly 'will please put paper down for moment then added ' want to speak to very particularly ' dr ross heaved sigh lowered paper somewhat reluctantly 'must not time have done a well ' grumbled good humouredly have taken up evening be worst of having elderly son in law one be bound to be civil to one must not tell to hold tongue for example ' think percival must resent such hint returned audrey rather absently have drawn low chair close to father knee so that must touch now looked up in face little pleadingly what be child ' went on still fingering paper ' suppose want help for protegee other moderation in thing warn have not got fortunatus purse ' 'it be not money want returned so gravely that began to feel uncomfortable be something very very different afternoon cyril blake spoke to be be engaged ' dr ross gave great start dropped time a though burnt for moment did not speak with mildness benevolence be man of strong passion though one must have guessed from habitual self control be engaged ' repeated softly then stroked father hand drew rather quickly away 'audrey ' said in voice that did not recognise be so stern so full of displeasure ' must rather have heard anything than that child of mine must so far forget a to engage to man without parent consent ' daddy ' began caressingly stopped 'it be wrong be what must not have believed of audrey with regard to mr blake be altogether dishonourable how dared ' here doctor eye flashed through spectacle 'how dared win daughter affection in clandestine way ' must not speak so of cyril returned audrey calmly though be little pale little disturbed at unexpected severity 'it be not what think there be nothing clandestine dishonourable did not mean to speak to be more fault than will hear word from beginning do think must hide anything from father ' here two large tear welled slowly from audrey eye wiped away perhaps gentleness sight of tear mollified dr ross for when audrey laid clasped hand upon knee did not again repulse nay more when faltered once in telling story put hand on head reassuringly 'be that have to tell dear now dr ross spoke in old kind voice father dear have heard everything now ' beseechingly 'you will not be hard on ' 'hard on suppose mean ' returned dr ross with rather sad smile ' man be not likely to be hard to own flesh blood still think have acted rather badly can make allowance for better now be sorely tempted now want to tell something be sure that happiness be involved in that must really cost too much to give up ' audrey looked at father with astonishment that wide clear eyed glance conveyed reproach 'do think necessary to ask question said with little dignity behould have engaged to man without loving ' 'but may have talked into may have mistaken feeling suggested dr ross audrey shook head ' be not child said rather proudly have always liked mr blake can surely have objection to personally ' 'yes liking did not go to extent of wishing to be son in law ' replied with touch of grim humour opinion audrey mr blake be far too young 'he be three twenty ' pleaded be two month older than be what doe age matter father will grow older day know men be boyish at age think cyril life have matured ' must rather have entrusted to older man one who have in measure made position mr blake be only at beginning of career will be year before achieves sort of position audrey know well enough by time be not speaking of poverty though alone must have deterred from aspiring to daughter think alike on point care nothing about rich son in law mr blake have only talent good character to recommend be far too young be poor family have social standing ' 'but father surely good character be everything how often have heard say what high opinion dean have of what excellent character have borne at school college then think what son brother be how unselfish how hard working how must girl be afraid of entrusting future to ' dr ross sighed audrey mind be evidently made up why have brought misfortune on by engaging fascinating young master for certainly looked upon a misfortune after be wonder cyril blake with perfect face lovable disposition have found way to daughter heart 'why must not have fallen in love with someone else groaned to for audrey be very apple of eye there be one thought good enough for unless be not that such idea ever really occurred to michael ill health put thing out of question michael be adopted son far above average of men in opinion will remember that happiness be involved in audrey said after little more talk have passed between 'you will be good to cyril when speaks to to morrow ' 'oh yes will be good to ' then audrey laid hot cheek against thanked a bid good night when have gone there be debate read that night dr ross have too many thought to occupy a sat alone in empty study chapter xxiv felt culprit see ' betill seems to that love true profound love must be source of light calm religion revelation in there be place left for lower victory of vanity ' amiel can not be denied that cyril blake have rather hard time of in doctor study dr ross received kindly kindness be trifle iced a shook hand with young man then seated in big easy chair groaned inwardly be old fool thought 'ever to have brought here how confoundedly handsome fellow be if one must only honestly dislike then assumed judicial aspect a listened to culprit on whole cyril acquitted fairly be very pale hesitated little over word stated case with sufficient eloquence love for audrey bore triumphantly even through ordeal have reason to be angry with ' said with ingenuous frankness have right to speak to miss ross until have gained permission to do so 'it be certainly grievous mistake mr blake ' 'you be very kind not to call by name will own frankly be mistake must beg to make allowance for very strong temptation under circumstance man be not always master of ' dr ross half smiled after braw wooer be bearing with manly dignity ' hope will believe ' continued cyril earnestly 'when say that acted with preconceived intention first declaration be perfectly hopeless expected nothing asked for nothing on second occasion here paused in spite of nervousness light came in eye 'circumstances forced to speak ' 'circumstances can be controlled mr blake if have come to for example ' have be intention to come to dr ross to tender resignation have made up mind that be duty to leave place have even spoken to mother on subject love daughter therefore will not be right for to stay be very word must have spoken to only asked not to go ' here young man voice trembled dr ross magisterial aspect relaxed little good heart yearning only for child happiness began to relent ' be quite sure of affection for audrey mr blake ' 'you may be sure of there be proof must ask must be refused by if thought be if thought that must not be for happiness must be ready even now to go away 'thank can quite believe that mean what say will not put to so severe proof child told last night that mind be made up indeed understand that be already engaged ' 'only with permission sir ' see how be to withhold when girl tell that happiness be involved will speak to plainly mr blake be certainly not in position in must wish to see future son in law man of age at very beginning of career have right to think of marrying ' cyril flushed think of must work way before such thing must be possible 'you mean because be poor poverty be of course serious obstacle just then be thinking more of position must hardly be willing for daughter to marry junior classical master sister be in far better position ' will hope not always to be junior master dr ross 'true of course interest can do great deal must speak to charrington see what be to be done in future perhaps know audrey have little money of own be sorry to hear ' 'their grandfather left five thousand pound a audrey be of age be of course own mistress be intention to give couple of thousand on marriage geraldine have anything else will only come to on death ' wish have not told ' dr ross smiled 'you be young blake said in old friendly manner 'or must not be so romantic a to wish audrey be penniless will find few thousand very serviceable by by when in course of time house fall vacant be speaking of future mind for mean to have audrey for at least couple of year be in hurry to lose must make way little first now think have talked enough for present will just have word with audrey send to ' then held out hand cyril grasped with word two of gratitude meanwhile audrey seated close to mother on drawing room couch be pouring out whole story told very comfortably with face resting against mother shoulder only interrupted by tearful inquiry at interval audrey oh darling child ' exclaimed mr ross in sighing sort of voice when girl have finished recital 'be sorry why do speak in tone know have always liked cyril ' dear ' here mr ross sighed again 'how can one help liking when be so lovable audrey what will sister say percival ' 'poor dear mother so that be reason of dolorous voice well do know ' with engaging air of frankness ' be afraid will have bad time with gage will want put in strait waistcoat fed on cooling diet of bread water father will have to assure that there be insanity in family a to percival oh percival face when hears news will be joke must say see joke audrey be really afraid will be dreadfully shocked must tell must not take news to hillside for world just now too when dear geraldine ought to be spared agitation audrey did not dare laugh mother be far too much in earnest 'you must go audrey ' repeated 'and hope will be very very careful ' think must be better to write mother be so sure that gage will disapprove say cutting thing of course will not be pleasant if be to write sisterly little note just telling news saying must go to to morrow after good deal of consideration mr ross be brought to own that plan must be best mr ross be so oppressed by fear of geraldine disapproval that must hardly give attention to audrey yet motherly heart be stirred to foundation audrey pretended to be hurt at last 'oh let talk more about gage ' said impatiently 'we must give time to come round want to think about cyril cyril be not nice name must be very fond of treat like own son be to be second michael ' 'dear audrey wonder what michael will say can never have guessed anything before went away ' know mother michael be very sharp know struck once twice that be watching cyril liked always liked ' here audrey voice be full of gladness michael approval be necessary to happiness whoever else might choose to cavil at choice must not be michael dear old michael wish must come back said softly for felt strange sort of longing to see kind face again must write to must tell everything just a though be brother ' interrupting ' want to tell something very pretty that cyril said yesterday be talking of father said must not be hurt have fallen in love with first think sweetest woman have ever seen ' 'dear fellow murmured mr ross for little compliment pleased with loyalty to geraldine husband there be time when be little formidable to perhaps in secret heart felt too young to be mother in law of man of forty in spite of mr harcourt real liking respect for wife mother have never be guided by have not be with a with younger men to say 'your think so so must be done indeed if truth be told geraldine very rarely quoted mother opinion be so certain that percival must contradict be surely able to make up own mind without consulting parent dear ' must say in rather crushing tone for prosperity have fed self confidence needed discipline of trouble to teach humility at moment dr ross entered room at first sight of face audrey sprang up opened arm to receive 'oh daddy be all right ' 'well be a far right a can be replied in rather inexplicable voice dear girl of ours have taken bit between teeth geraldine never gave trouble fell in love with right man at right time everything be arranged properly 'and now right man have fallen in love with ' whispered audrey in father ear 'but have given consent john ' returned wife in pleading tone in spite of fear about geraldine sympathy be by time enlisted on side of lover course mr blake be poor man daresay dr charrington will push when know how thing be be so nice pleasant clever dear audrey really love ' 'be sure of ' trying to catch glimpse of daughter face 'girls make mistake sometimes then a faint protest reached 'well will find fellow in study if want to talk to perhaps have better bring in to see mother audrey withdrew blushing like rose behe be very fond of john ' observed mr ross with trace of anxiety in tone a though husband manner did not quite satisfy behe have be talking to for last hour audrey never cared for anyone before remember young silverdale fred langton be in love with must have spoken if have given chance be a distant a possible 'yes fred langton have fifteen hundred year father be member of parliament be nice fellow too only little too stout for so young man be not sort audrey must fancy blake be good fellow liked from first continued doctor in musing tone 'but never must have picked out for audrey ' 'perhaps think too young ' hazarded wife 'yes must have liked to have married older man be too much of age audrey with good nature have will of own blake be by mean weak man on contrary must say be strong will have to give in to ' 'oh hope not ' for mr ross held old fashioned doctrine of wifely submission obedience 'they will not find out for little if be not mistaken blake will discover in time that be somewhat handicapped girl have too much on side there be position little bit of money equality a regard age blake will have to steer way prudently will find among shoal mr ross looked distressed husband opinion be infallible to never occurred to that might be occasionally wrong in premise geraldine will be dreadfully shocked ' replied ' quite dread effect on geraldine ' then dr ross mood changed 'it be business of hers of harcourt ' said rather sharply 'if audrey have parent consent need not trouble about other people opinion then mr ross knew that stormy discussion might be in store for must not expect husband to come to assistance have more than once hinted that son in law took rather too much upon on one occasion have gone so far a to say that be pity geraldine have married man so much older than 'harcourt be clever fellow play autocrat rather too much man have right to be master in own house woodcote be not hillside speech have alarmed mr ross dreadfully wish father cared for percival a much a doe for michael ' said once little plaintively to audrey 'nothing michael say doe be ever wrong in eye 'but there must not be two michael mother returned audrey really percival doe lay down law far too much wonder father be little put out for of course be older man ' meanwhile lover be enjoying after own fashion when audrey entered study cyril be standing in bay window with back towards door at sound of footstep turned round quickly crossed room a took hand looked at for moment without speaking saw at once that be deeply moved then put arm round very gently kissed somehow that silent caress touched audrey be so much more eloquent than word when did speak speech be very grateful to ear father have be so good to ' 'yes know told yesterday how good must be 'ah have rather bad time of at first replied shaking head see that chair ' pointing to high backed oaken chair always occupied corner by writing table 'dr ross sat there stood leaning against mantelpiece just opposite to ' 'do mean that father did not ask to sit down 'oh more than once pressed to take seat felt must be unbecoming for culprit not to stand before judge felt culprit see when man steal man dearest possession without asking leave must regard a sort of traitor audrey smiled a cyril drew gently down beside on wide cushioned window seat made faint protest think mother will be looking for ' said little shyly 'but not just now ' pleaded 'you will stay with for few minute will not darling must not talk to before mother want to tell what dr ross said in spite of presumption have treated most generously audrey ' half whispering name a though thrilled to say say that will not spare to for at least two year 'oh of course not must not leave father mother for long long time returned audrey somewhat troubled by allusion to marriage be one thing to be engaged to make cyril happy to be married be far more serious consideration have be asked must have said at least three year added quickly for one instant young lover felt wounded good sense enabled to hide from 'you be right dearest said quietly 'it must be mere selfishness for to wish to take away from beautiful home until have made one will in degree be fitting for will not expect grand one know have linked lot to poor man 'of course know ' replied calmly 'you need not trouble about cyril think be different from other girl have never cared for wealth luxury in least woodcote be home love stone of must be just a happy in cottage ' be like gray cottage for example ' 'oh have always be fond of gray cottage returned smiling at look of sweet gray eye made young man pulse beat faster ' must be perfectly satisfied with home like why a interrupted with rapturous expression of gratitude think must be hard to please be not fine lady like geraldine ' be finest lady in world to ' be cyril answer took self control to sit there just holding hand listening to felt a though in joy must have be guilty of extravagance a though ought to be kneeling before lady of delight pouring out very soul in tumultuous incoherent stream of word spoke well for knowledge of audrey character that restrained so utterly such passionate love making must have disturbed serenity destroyed ease in society inborn love of freedom certain coyness be natural to must have revolted against such wooing cyril have reward for unselfish forbearance when saw how quietly rested against arm how willingly left hand in a talked to in frank guileless way suppose mother be pleased about said presently 'you must have said so if have heard talking last night until one o'clock in morning have made more than one person happy dear mother will be debtor for life ' wonder be not little jealous of ' returned audrey have have so long to herself must think must find little in way ' 'oh be too grateful to for making happy darling must cause utter misery if mother did not get on have be one thought year be not right of course a audrey eye expressed disapproval at have have more than fair share be only stating fact from point of view if have refused if have gone away must have broken heart a be be ready to worship for goodness to ' must take to by by ' returned audrey gently 'but now cyril indeed must go to mother ' time made objection mr ross welcomed very nicely 'audrey tell that be to have son said softly a held out hand to 'if will only let be one ' returned gratefully a carried soft motherly hand to lip audrey might be forgiven if regarded cyril behaviour a perfect a for mr ross tear started to eye at act of reverential homage told audrey afterwards that felt a though must have kissed 'what pity did not think cyril must have liked ' be quiet answer heard mother inviting to dinner a turned to tea table for afternoon be nearly over 'we will be just by mr blake ' 'will call cyril now asked in almost whisper blush came to mr ross comely face will try remember ' said in kindest possible voice then joined audrey at tea table made very busy in waiting on be soon a easy comfortable a possible 'must like mother to come see to morrow ' asked presently when lamp have be brought in october twilight have be excluded 'that will be correct thing will not mr ross ' suppose so ' assented audrey with usual impulsiveness interrupted 'why must not take across now said ' think be so stupid thinking about etiquette mother be older than be for to go to ' audrey spoke with decision cyril looked enchanted ' did not like to propose ' said delightedly 'will really come may take mr ross ' audrey did not wait for mother permission left room returned presently in hat jacket ' be quite ready ' said speaking from threshold smiled a said word be interrupting interesting conversation cyril be on couch beside mother be talking eagerly perhaps though audrey did not know be making up for previous self restraint by pouring out of pent up feeling understand ' said a stood up mr ross beamed at in answer 'be two having confidence already ' observed audrey happily a looked on at little scene cyril laughed a followed into hall behe be sweetest woman in world one ' said a went out together into soft damp air audrey perhaps in gratitude for word took arm unasked a walked with through dark village street chapter xxv mr harcourt speaks mind 'it be idle to talk young woman in love out of passion love doe not lie in ear horace

asked to bring be because knew be what wished though did not like to ask dear mr blake be likely must stay away when have always be such friend for moment mr blake seemed unable to answer curious emotion impeded utterance turned very pale trembled visibly 'and will be better friend than ever now ' continued audrey taking hand for felt very tender towards beautiful woman who be cyril mother '

sorry repent word said then same be rather hard on ' 'you certainly made very wretched ' 'yes felt be very cruel one can not measure one word at moment felt a though child be being driven out of

lecture must have have be cruel to that one woman must have taken mean advantage time looked so happy that forgave well that end well be what told ' cyril shook head even in happiness have be unable to refrain from uttering disapproval of mother tactic nature be almost a simple transparent a audrey hurt to remember how mother have appealed to girl sense of compassion let talk more of ' said quickly think audrey have great deal to forgive mother know generosity ' look accompanied word left audrey silent for moment 'where be mollie ' exclaimed presently when after little more conversation mr blake insisted that must have just one cup of tea in vain audrey protested that have have tea already at woodcote that in hour so must have to dine mr blake must not be induced to let off 'where be mollie ' continued beay go look for mr blake before mr blake must answer audrey have exchanged glance with cyril disappeared found mollie in dining room be pacing up down room with small black kitten

very important business on hand there be letter to geraldine very difficult one be to write so difficult that more than once audrey thought that must put on hat go up to hillside instead remembered that gage be expecting visitor to luncheon must probably come early drive away before dusk letter must not be delivered before then so addressed again to task after be very sweet womanly letter might have touched sister heart 'if can not conscientiously approve can at least wish joy in life have chosen for ' wrote ' have accepted mr blake of own free will because think be worthy of affection know yet be so good so good sometimes think even michael be not more to be trusted so on after be far easier to write to michael audrey have need to pick word arrange idea with must tell everything a frankly a though be brother there need be limit to confidence michael must never misunderstand one drawback be that be still away ' finished affectionately ' will not feel thing be perfect until have have one of long talk on michael bench when be coming home will soon be november tree will be stripped of leaf why do trouble about man business one want more than devoted cousin friend audrey ross ' when letter be in post note for geraldine lying on marble slab in hall felt sense of relief have leisure to think of cyril have walk together after afternoon school soon grew dusk audrey suggested that a mother be alone must go back to woodcote to tea there be invitation to dinner that night cyril did not expect have dormitory work a audrey promised to see before went away for night be quite content 'you must not think that mean to bore mr ross with intruding on occasion said ' know will tell when may come mean to be guided entirely by under circumstance man be tempted to be selfish 'you will never be selfish said with one of charming smile must never have promised to marry selfish man cyril will be guided by in other thing ' changing tone looking at very seriously for have have rather hot argument cyril be going to peterborough next day to buy betrothal ring audrey have petitioned for gold one 'but will only look like wedding guard ' have remonstrated for must rather have denied everything for six month if only must buy something fit for acceptance pearl sapphire ring for example diamond be beyond mean audrey must not be induced to say that liked pearl on contrary manifested extraordinary preference for idea of broad chased gold band with own cyril initial inside ' be going to marry poor man said decidedly 'and must not waste money on what doe matter if look like guard can serve purpose afterwards please look so disappointed cyril when can afford will give ring like pearl diamond like diamond best be so evidently in earnest that have to yield to audrey wore gold ring with immense satisfaction audrey spent evening quietly with parent dr ross played chess together when went off to study stayed talked to mother mr ross be not lively companion that evening fear of geraldine disapproval be quickening latent feeling of uneasiness into activity must not keep feeling to herself wonder if geraldine will answer letter evening audrey ' think so mother dear be to go there to morrow see so there will be need for to write ' be afraid that will be hurt because have not gone to to day will think rather odd for to write ' 'why mother ' opening eye rather widely at remember mr mr bland be to lunch there how must gage have given attention then with guest to entertain must never have done to run risk of upsetting percival must have glared at through luncheon if have noticed eye be red know how easily gage cry 'did tell in letter ' think implied be not sure ' well must wait until to morrow ' with sigh 'but can not deny be very anxious will go up to hillside directly after breakfast will not dear do beg geraldine to come back with feel will not have moment peace until have seen 'poor dear mother ' observed audrey caressingly for there be look of care on mr ross brow though audrey cheered up mother made little joke be quite aware of ordeal be before be with undefined idea of propitiating sister that laid aside red cashmere next morning put on certain gray gown gage especially admired have hat to match with gray wing geraldine always looked at approvingly when came to hillside in gray gown be on terrace picking two three yellow chrysanthemum when saw brother in law coming towards visit from at hour be most unusual proceeding audrey at once guessed that business be with idea of interference from brother in law be decidedly unpalatable nevertheless awaited smilingly mr harcourt be man who walked well have fine carriage of head though people said held little too erect too much with air of man who recognises own superiority a audrey watched a walked up terrace thought have never held head so proudly before 'you be very early visitor morning percival ' observed a arranged chrysanthemum in gray dress looked up at pleasantly a shook hand with there be answering smile on mr harcourt face 'it be very unusual business brings ' replied rather solemnly 'be there anyone in drawing room audrey must like to speak to quietly ' beusan be in there dusting ornament can easily send away ' rejoined audrey cheerfully be in study then led way to drawing room gave susan hint to withdraw mr harcourt waited until door be shut then put down hat faced round on sister in law 'this be very sad business said still with same portentous air of solemnity be sorry to say sister be dreadfully upset ' hope not returned audrey quickly have never seen more upset about anything hardly slept at last night be half afraid must have to send for dr musgrave morning be not quite strong enough to bear shock 'gage be so sensitive see ' behe be not more sensitive than other people feeling bound to defend wife nerve be not in least surprised to find how much have taken to heart think feel very properly about be a disappointed a possible hoped better thing of audrey ' 'be not that little severe ' think not be bound to tell truth plainly that geraldine strongly disapprove of engagement ' be so sorry ' returned audrey with provoking good humour see percival one must be guided by one own feeling in such personal matter hope when gage know mr blake little better that will alter opinion ' be afraid must differ from there even at risk of displeasing must say that think mr blake be last man to make happy ' what reason can have for making such sweeping assertion asked audrey waxing little warm at percival have right to stand there lecturing after fashion be not in brother in law province to interfere with choice of lover if parent have given sanction to engagement allowed to throw away on poor man be surely one else be business to say dissenting word percival might go home lecture own wife if liked 'it be pity gage be so worldly ' said in what be meant to be withering tone audrey have never be so near quarrelling with brother in law 'worldly repeated in rather perplexed tone dear girl confess understand ' 'it be very easy to understand ' returned coldly 'you gage object to mr blake because be poor have not made position think be throwing away because have engaged to junior classical master who have to work way up 'just so ' observed mr harcourt 'that be exactly what do think 'and yet be surprised because call worldly if only knew how differently father think perhaps be disappointed too indeed know that be wanted to marry older man same agrees with that man so honourable clever one who have borne so high character who be so good son brother must be likely to make woman happy mr harcourt shrugged shoulder be arguing from different point audrey be not likely to convince have started with preconceived dislike to whole business now proceeded to pull audrey impulsive speech to piece deny that blake be good fellow be clever too in marrying will be descending in social scale who be blake one know anything about edith always declared father be city man do know that mother be distinctly objectionable ' 'excuse percival be speaking of close friend even if be not cyril mother friendship for must prevent from speaking against in presence ' mr harcourt groaned a heard word felt at same time that have gone too far quick temper have carried away hastened to apologise must forgive audrey if speak little too plainly be such bitter disappointment to very affection for make object more strongly to engagement a geraldine said to last night have only one sister make harder for 'yes understand be very sorry to disappoint percival thing be done now want gage to make best of ' 'will not reconsider decision ' asked there be softness real affection in look 'perhaps after may have mistaken feeling girl be sometimes talked into thing ' shook head ' have not mistaken ' said quietly say more percival have wish to quarrel of course be little sore about then mr harcourt felt that mission have be unsuccessful girl be contumacious must listen to one dr ross fault ' said to a took up hat prepared to walk with to hillside 'if have refused consent must have given thing up in worldly matter respected father in law be mere child chapter xxvi how geraldine took to heart 'this world be comedy to who think tragedy to who feel ' horace walpole may be doubted if audrey brother in law enjoyed walk to hillside mr harcourt felt that have failed signally in brotherly mission sort of failure be intolerable to to do justice be thinking only of audrey future welfare a took up wide clerical looking hat that affected walked with down terrace told sorrowfully that might a well have held tongue same must not refrain from speaking word two ' do so wish must make see thing a friend will see ' said no longer laying down law speaking in tone of mild insistence a became man who knew to be right 'they may not be so closely interested in matter perhaps view may be le prejudiced think dear girl what serious what terrible thing must be if be to discover too late that have made mistake must never own to be one ' said trying to smile must not be denied that found brother in law little depressing 'and may be quite sure must abide by there be fund of obstinacy in nature that one seems to have discovered ' then mr harcourt gave vent to impatient sigh must leave to geraldine thought even then must not forbear from one parthian thrust will live to repent ' said very seriously 'and then will remember warning must not look to to help out of difficulty then audrey must have done anything for now ' ' will promise will not ask for help ' returned so promptly that looked quite hurt hastened to soften word one make mistake of kind one must only look to one self ' have always regarded interest a identical with edith ' returned little stiffly mean have always treated a though be own sister of course if can not rely on a brother ' audrey must not let finish sentence percival ' said gently ' do believe be quarrelling with just because be taking at word be not just little illogical for once in one breath tell not to look to for help then reproach with unsisterly feeling how be to understand other at rate ' then faint smile played round mr harcourt mouth be true that in heat of argument did not always measure word even geraldine have ventured to tell so once 'well well will say no more about ' returned somewhat magnanimously though must not pluck up spirit to turn conversation into channel refrained from more depressing remark gave friendly nod smile a parted in hall will find geraldine in morning room ' said audrey be much relieved that did not offer to accompany mr harcourt evidently regarded a invalid that morning be sitting in corner of big couch in pale pink tea gown rose at sister entrance however crossed room with languid step percival bring ' asked a kissed audrey felt a though be to blame when saw geraldine heavy eye be afraid be far from well gage ' said little anxiously for after geraldine be only sister if thing must go wrong with felt momentary compunction one of keen pin like prick of conscience a remembered how often have be vexed with little way mr harcourt looked at mournfully can be well said with reproachful sweetness in voice ' think have three hour sleep last night percival got quite concerned about at last oh audrey have made so very unhappy eye filled with tear bey dear gage must not willingly make unhappy for world 'but same have be shock cruel disappointment to percival be nearly a upset about a be if must have seen walking up down room last night must be mad to throw away in fashion must say nothing else for long time be quite aware of percival sentiment returned audrey coldly manner alarmed geraldine 'but have not quarrelled with for telling truth asked with unmistakable anxiety audrey know how fond percival be of be a proud of a though be own sister have always looked forward to marriage used to say none of men knew be half good enough for that ought to have someone who must be in way superior to whom must look up 'yes be such blessing can look up to cyril ' be so young though be nice yes of course be very nice good looking clever still one want more in husband somehow never realised thing until be actually standing at altar with percival said solemn word for myself for better for worse for richer for poorer in sickness in health until death do part felt then that if have not be so sure of percival must rather have died than have said word faint shiver passed over audrey a geraldine spoke have never heard talk in way before 'dear dear audrey continued taking sister hand 'can wonder that be anxious that must be a happy a be that nearly break heart to know that be taking false step ' painful flush crossed audrey face be worse ordeal than have expected have be prepared for reproach even for bitter word softness tearful caressing gentleness seemed to deprive of strength to cut away ground from under foot be at once touched grateful for sister forbearance 'you be very good to gage ' said in low voice know how utterly have disappointed percival from worldly point of view daresay be right cyril be poor have to work way up be not what people must call good match then know have always be terribly unpractical 'it be not only that ' sighed geraldine far a mr blake be concerned one can not say much against be very gentlemanly suppose one must get used to though will never never think good enough for there be other objection idea mr blake will be mother in law make utterly wretched 'poor woman be so nice be so fond of often wonder why be so prejudiced against gage of course be tiresome mr bryce ' 'no indeed be not ' returned mr harcourt quickly want to vex audrey thing be miserable enough without quarrelling however unhappy make will never quarrel with only sister must let say for once can not like mr blake from first moment have distrusted know percival feel same gage do be reasonable be going to marry cyril not mr blake ' woman marries enters husband family ' returned geraldine in old decided manner will belong to not to at least correcting a thought of daily visit to woodcote occurred to 'you will have to share husband interest responsibility with regard to family can not divide from without failing in wifely duty ' be quite of opinion returned audrey happily 'cyril mother kester mollie will be very dear to never dreamt for one moment of separating interest from thought really loved ' observed geraldine here stopped warned by indignant flash in audrey gray eye might have spared that gage ' said rather sadly ' think have have enough to bear already from percival have done best to depress dishearten have not even wished happiness ' then geraldine burst into tear want to be unkind sobbed in such distress audrey repented quick word must give time to get over be first real trouble have ever have then a audrey kissed coaxed allowed to be somewhat consoled 'you know must think of gage must not make ill about be not worth ' then geraldine did summon up smile 'and will be good to cyril poor fellow must not help falling in love with know ' 'of course will behave properly to ' returned geraldine drawing up little stiffly must not expect to receive with open arm mr blake must know how entirely disapprove of engagement of course a father have given consent have right to make ourselves disagreeable must give little time audrey just to recover then will be asked to dinner ' hope will not ask at same time exclaimed audrey in genuine alarm geraldine looked rather shocked course must come with be understood will be asked everywhere if if looking at suggestively 'you mean engagement to be known ' beost certainly object very strongly to secrecy under circumstance 'then in case must be prepared for congratulation round of dinner ' prefer congratulation to condolence returned audrey little wickedly then a though to atone for joke suddenly knelt down before sister put arm round 'dear gage do feel wretch for having upset like wonder percival owes grudge now do say something nice to before go there be darling ' of course geraldine melted in moment ' do pray with heart that may be happy sighed then kissed other very affectionately 'give love to mother tell be not well enough to come to to day ' be geraldine parting word a audrey left mr harcourt came out of study moment heard door close 'well asked with shade of anxiety in tone made impression dear ' percy ' returned wife sadly behe be bent on taking own way blake influence be far too strong ' 'ah well ' in tone of strong disgust behe be making own bed must lie on be evil day for of when father engaged blake for junior classical master wanted to have sowerby sowerby be better man people be gentlefolk there be turning doctor when have got idea in head one blake must do now mischief have come of same wo have making ill about remember

gratefully assented may be doubted whether heard much of brilliant essay mr harcourt have selected for delectation be very soothing to lie there listen to husband voice sentence grew involved presently there be humming a though of bee in quiet room mr harcourt smiled to a went on reading sleep must do more good than essay thought in be right when mr ross received daughter message at once prepared to go up to hillside spent remainder of afternoon there geraldine have awakened from nap much refreshed be disposed to take le lugubrious view of thing be certainly somewhat depressing at first mother found implied reproach somewhat hard to bear be still too languid subdued to speak with usual decision suppose that will have to make best of ' observed presently in resigned tone of voice 'it will always be great trouble to one must expect trouble in world a said to percy just now be afraid have be too happy ' dear must not say such thing 'it be better to say than to think percy never mind how much complain to if will only not brood over worry by say that be so bad for ' 'percival be quite right love mr ross looked anxiously at daughter pale face know one duty be to keep cheerful try put away from mind leave audrey to be happy in own way mr blake be really very nice lovable fellow be quite fond of already so be father be sure father be good judge of character ' mother dear must not think percy mean to be tiresome disagreeable be not young man so much that mind though will always think audrey be lowering in marrying be that odious mr blake then for moment mr ross felt uncomfortable mr blake have called on very morning while audrey be at hillside in spite of mildness toleration have be obliged to confess to herself that mr blake manner have not quite pleased geraldine managed to extract whole account of interview though mr ross gave rather reluctantly 'and suppose be absurdly impulsive a usual mother asked when mr ross have finished somewhat brief narrative yes be always rather effusive people have own style see ' 'only mr blake be unfortunately very bad style ' daresay be right dear certainly prefer quieter manner be not quite good taste lauding father to sky for goodness in allowing match poor woman daresay be little excited only be pity to let feeling carry away still be very nice about audrey ' behe will be daughter in law know ' then mr ross winced slightly be glad that mr charrington be that moment announced be pleasant chatty woman always paid long visit geraldine be special favourite a news of engagement have not yet reached talk be confined to certain local interest new grant of book to library difficulty of finding butler lameness of one of dr ross carriage horse mr ross be in manner relieved from more awkward question husband be only confidant to did disburden herself ' do wish that mr blake be different sort of woman john ' observed that night behe be very handsome amusing be certainly too unrestrained in talk ' 'we must take folk a find emmie ' returned dr ross quietly bers blake be not sort in spite of having grown up son be not quite grown up middle aged people ought not to talk out feeling a though be child be very pleasing person for ' beo always thought tire one not must let audrey know ' 'oh audrey must keep dozen mr blake in order ' be husband response then mr ross said more geraldine kept word about week later cyril blake received civil little note asking to dine at hillside on following evening 'we will be quite by ourselves will be only family party just husband brother mr walter harcourt wife ' for walter harcourts have come on visit cyril looked little grave a showed note to audrey suppose must go will be very terrible mind telling audrey that be awfully afraid of sister ' 'poor fellow returned audrey with one of charming smile wish must spare ordeal can give one bit of comfort gage will behave very nicely to ' though cyril still felt little dubious on point be obliged to own afterwards that be right evening be far pleasanter one than expected mr harcourt be thawed by brother presence though there be slight stiffness reserve in manner to cyril there be aggressiveness geraldine be too much of gentlewoman to behave ungraciously to guest of be quite civil to cyril though must not be said to be demonstrative there be attempt to treat a one of mr walter

woman observed confidentially to geraldine bey dear must congratulate that future brother in law of yours be one of handsomest men have ever seen always thought walter good looking fellow daresay thought much same of percival husband looked very ordinary people beside in fact walter be quite clumsy ' 'nonsense maggie returned geraldine glancing behind to see if audrey be within earshot can make such absurd comparison of course mr blake be good looking for own part always distrust handsome men 'they be generally such fool see hate talking to man who be too self engrossed to pay attention mr blake be thoroughly nice must go to audrey tell how much admire fiance ' goodness be over ' exclaimed cyril fervently a audrey joined in porch have not have word with yet ' audrey smiled a gathered

returned quickly 'and admire excessively same will never feel at ease with a audrey uttered protest at continued seriously 'of course know what mr harcourt think of presumption manner told that at once be not one of be what tone said to yet be quite kind civil oh audrey ' interrupting speaking almost passionately 'if be only more worthy of have patience with people will respect yet ' 'dear cyril please talk so audrey stole closer to in october darkness 'you have behaved so beautifully to night felt oh so proud of sweetheart if be content what doe matter what other people think ' 'forgive darling ' returned remorsefully be only sometimes little sore because can give so little ' then mood changed for subtle comfort of sweet word be thrilling through for be young girl worshipped from depth of honest heart be alone with under dim cloudy sky be wonder that world be forgotten only golden haze of future seemed before a walked together through quiet street to woodcote chapter xxvii what michael thought of 'not to be solitary one must posse entirely to one human creature belong exclusively to ' guizot then be one to recover courage enough for action by extracting richer experience out of loss lesson amiel captain burnett have finished troublesome piece of business be thinking of return home friend be metaphorically speaking on foot again michael be now free to leave london have waited however for day two on kester account friendly doctor who have undertaken to look into case have already done wonder kester be making rapid progress under care bright look evident enjoyment of town life reconciled michael to long protracted stay must certainly go back to rutherford next week observed one morning a sat at breakfast together kester have appointment with fred somers called out early captain burnett good naturedly left letter unread that might pour out coffee attend to want will keep have nothing to do morning ' remarked carelessly a took up laid down again after must not be sorry to read alone there be indian letter one from audrey several note be evidently invitation when kester have left sat down in easy chair by window there be little table beside with red jar full of brown leaf chrysanthemum picked out one played with for moment then booty jumped up uninvited curled up on knee read invitation first then threw aside ' will be at rutherford ' thought then opened indian letter be from fellow officer contained amusing account of visit have lately paid to calcutta just at end said 'by bye somebody told other day that uncle mr carlisle be ill have got nasty attack doctor be shaking head over fellow who told be donarton mentioned that be likely to take lively interest in news be that true old man have mr carlisle nearer relative than from what hear be sort of nabob in part captain burnett put down letter looked dreamily out of window be really so wondered major glenyow be not sort of fellow to mention mere report uncle be by mean old man once twice rumour of intended marriage have reached ear have never be verified if be true that uncle be in bad way that must not recover then indeed there be possibility here in spite of michael

care of people to feel necessary to ' here smile came to lip have never spoken to never dropped hint of feeling somehow think must be surprised if ever told have be so much to other think must teach to love in time at least must try sweet ' here there be sudden gleam fire in eye then took up audrey letter began to read when have finished first sentence curious dull feeling came over found that must not understand what be reading must go over passage again a re read same numbness impossibility of comprehension came over yet word be very clearly written behall be very much surprised dear michael to hear news have to tell be engaged to mr blake will tell about presently just a though be father confessor will not hide one little thing from be never one to beat about bush hope abruptness have not made jump oh michael dear be so happy ' etc read sentence dozen time until something of meaning have taken hold of dense brain then read letter straight through to very end slowly often pausing over sentence seemed to little involved a read there be pinched gray look upon face a though sudden illness have seized be not conscious of active pain though whole plan purpose of life lay crushed in dust before like chrysanthemum that booty be tearing petal by petal until master coat sleeve be covered with golden brown shred on contrary a sat there holding letter between limp hand mind wandered off to story have once read be wreck of royal george wondered name of vessel have escaped knew story be true one have really happened have read how vessel be doomed be troop ship there be hundred of brave english soldier on board when knew there be hope officer drew up men on deck just a though be on parade gallant fellow stood there in rank file a went down to watery grave 'and not man of flinched may depend on ' said half aloud 'for be englishman englishman know how to die ' seemed to that be still ruminating over old story have happened so many many year ago when kester returned must need tell story again told very well too 'and not man of flinched ' repeated rising little feebly from chair 'for be englishman englishman know how to die why be staring at boy be good story be not ' havery good indeed be only afraid be not quite well captain burnett look so queer somehow hand be shaking ' ' have sat too long think must walk off stiffness wait lunch for kester may go to club then took down hat went out in street with booty ambling along at heel did not go far strolled into park sat down on bench air refreshed miserable numb feeling left have power to think there be deep line in face a sat there great sadness in eye just before rose to go home few word escaped 'oh darling what mistake when belong to will ever find out for will ever recognise that be mistake then set teeth hard like man who know strength refuse to be beaten next morning a sat at breakfast michael looked up from newspaper asked kester if have heard rutherford news 'perhaps mother mollie have written to ' observed a carelessly scanned column kester looked up little anxiously 'no one have told anything ' said rather nervously ' hope be not bad news ' beost people must call good news brother miss ross be engaged well a kester jumped from seat flushing scarlet 'be delighted think ought to write pretty note to miss ross to go with letter ' 'have written to will give message from must rather write to cyril take in somehow be quite sure be true captain burnett of course be glad that cyril must be happy always thought ' here kester stammered got confused michael did not help took up paper again left to finish breakfast in silence after that remarked that be going down to club kester curled up on window seat a soon a be left alone fell into brown study somehow must not make out at be sharp witted by nature year of suffering forced inaction have made more thoughtful than most boy of age have long ago grasped idea that idolised hero be not happy during stay in scotland dim surmise of truth have occurred to 'dear old cyril observed half aloud be awfully glad for sake always seemed to a though miss ross be cut above if only be sure that be glad too ' here troubled look crossed boy face be thinking of story captain burnett have told yesterday of strange dazed look in michael eye 'and not man of flinched for be englishman englishman know how to die 'ah to live too thought kester a roused at last sat down to greek when audrey heard that michael be really coming home felt a though have nothing more to wish have read letter at least dozen brotherly tenderness anxiety for welfare have touched to heart be very grateful for confidence ' wrote after few earnest wish for happiness ' must like if be possible to keep old place a mentor have always be such friend dear such true trusty comrade think that mr blake will object to cousinly surveillance must not afford to lose out of life audrey so let subscribe now for ever faithful friend brother michael ' audrey sighed gently a put down letter touched did not completely satisfy michael have not said be glad to hear of engagement be truthful almost to fault conventional falsehood that other men uttered be never on lip if must not approve must take refuge in silence beilence never damage man character ' be fond of saying many people found oppressive audrey have secretly longed for such word of approval if michael have only told that applauded courage in marrying poor man if have praised unworldliness must have be utterly content letter michael have written with breaking heart held such comfort for have accepted decision without word though message of congratulation to cyril be must be wished there be further allusion to think have be rash said to herself little sorrowfully suppose too considers that cyril be rather too young if michael be only on side must not care what rest of world think then folded up letter on day michael be expected face be so radiant that cyril pretended to be jealous 'you be very fond of cousin ' observed a followed to window where be watching cloud little anxiously audrey heard rather absently be thinking that dampness might bring on michael neuralgia that if have only named train carriage might have be sent for indeed must have driven out to meet kester 'oh yes rejoined ' have missed terribly time nothing be right without michael a cyril looked little surprised at added quickly 'he be like own brother cyril so be perfectly natural see ever since illness have be one of a cyril professed satisfied with explanation there be nothing more said audrey went up to put finishing touch to michael room to arrange chrysanthemum coloured leaf in big indian jar if have only known how michael must shudder at sight of chrysanthemum have taken dislike to flower ever since booty have covered coat sleeve with golden brown petal after michael came before be expected audrey be sitting chatting to mother in twilight when heard hall door open close next moment saw michael standing on threshold looking at bey dear michael ' exclaimed mr ross audrey have already crossed room hand be in michael be looking at with old kind smile though did not say word audrey did not seem to notice silence walked from gray cottage did not hear wheel why did not let know train must have driven in to meet mother be going to ring for lamp tea michael will be tired audrey did a said then picked up booty lavished sort of caress on little animal while listened to quiet explanation that michael be giving to mr ross 'you be looking very well audrey ' said at last 'you have not lost moorland colour yet though said in usual tone thought that never in life have seen look so sweet ' wish must return compliment be answer 'you be looking thin pale michael have be giving such good account of london never suit ' ' think suit better than did ' returned quietly must not quite meet affectionate look will have to run up there pretty frequently now one must look up one friend more out of sight be out of mind in many case audrey gave incredulous smile thought michael must not act up to resolution fully meant what said woodcote dearly a loved must never be home now of course must do thing by degree brief absence must grow longer more frequent until have become used to perhaps in time might break with old life altogether put away thought talked to in usual easy fashion asking question about geraldine husband presently dr ross came in monopolised entirely audrey felt a though have not have word with when went upstairs to dress for dinner true have asked after cyril inquired if be coming in evening on audrey replying in negative have made observation father be in room never will let michael talk to anyone else said to herself rather discontentedly 'if must only get alone ' have wish presently for on return to drawing room found lying back in easy chair looking at fire be evidently thinking intently for did not hear entrance until be close beside at touch of hand on shoulder started violently ' penny for thought michael ' said gaily a jumped up stood beside on rug be too valuable to be saleable returned lightly beuppose let hear yours instead will have welcome oh michael how delicious be to be talking to again letter be so stupid unsatisfactory ' mean letter in particular 'oh no be a nice a possible same did not quite satisfy do know ' here tone be little wistful 'you have not told that be glad about engagement said so many nice thing somehow be longing for just one word of approval from old mentor ' uneasy flush crossed michael face firelight be flickering just then audrey must not see distinctly for one moment be silent then put gently in seat placed beside must be easier to talk to so perhaps be conscious of sudden weakness cold hand be ' observed anxiously 'if will break big coal fire will burn more brightly a obeyed continued 'ah now can see other do dislike flickering uncertain light now will tell frankly if be glad sorry when got letter ' be more prepared now voice be quite steady a answered beentor have objection to be catechised wish to put one question first be quite content happy audrey be ' turning to one of brightest face have ever seen dear be satisfied too 'oh will not do must tell own private opinion know like cyril have always spoken well of be sure that in heart thoroughly approve choice ' be pressing close did not flinch only turned to rather gravely bey dear audrey there be limit even to mentor privilege when two people make up mind to take other for better for worse third person have right to give opinion know little of mr blake have already respect for be perfectly sure that in time will be good friend hope so hope so from heart ' returned earnestly 'you be very guarded michael though be too kind to say so know think have acted rather hastily perhaps must rather have waited little longer cyril be so unhappy well be not quite comfortable be so much nicer to have settled 'yes see 'and now everything be just perfect oh michael must not go away for long time can not do without ' ' hope expect to believe that ' be perfectly true assure actually

for honest man really remark make inclined to light own private farthing dip look for curious anomaly unselfish man 'you must not have to go far returned innocently 'there be two of in rutherford at present moment only shook head laughed at guileless flattery at moment to relief dr ross came into room a took place at dinner table have curious sensation a though have be racked though laughed talked have odd feeling time a though be not quite sure of own identity that evening few word audrey have said haunted like refrain 'if be own brother michael must not want more if be own brother must not want more ' chapter xxviii michael turn over new leaf privilege be to be spectator of own life drama to be fully conscious of tragus comedy of own destiny more than to be in secret of tragus comic 'without grief be string of venturesome kite man must soar too quickly too high chosen soul must be lost for race like balloon for gravitation must never return from empyrean amiel michael return have greatly added to audrey happiness in spite of lover society natural joyousness of disposition have be conscious that something have be lacking to complete contentment 'no one michael must take michael place ' a told little pathetically that first evening when few day have elapsed became aware that thing be not quite same between that michael who have come back to be not exactly old michael old michael have be somewhat of autocrat good natured autocrat certainly who tyrannised over for own good who assumed brotherly right of inquiring into movement small daily plan have always be much together especially since geraldine marriage have deprived of sisterly companionship have be understood thing in ross family where audrey be michael be generally not far off under circumstance be therefore quite natural that audrey must expect cousin to resume usual habit have counted on companionship during hour cyril be engaged in schoolroom duty in old time michael have often accompanied on visit to various protegee have always be escort to garden party be greatly in vogue at rutherford must drive to brail of outlying town village where have business be somewhat of disappointment then to find that michael have suddenly turned over new leaf be far too occupied to be at beck call kester came to almost daily became custom to spend remainder of morning in dr ross study have habit too of writing letter after luncheon in fact be seldom disengaged until evening when be always ready to take place in family circle audrey accused herself of selfishness of course ought to be glad that michael health have so much improved father be always remarking on change in tone of satisfaction 'he be like old mike said once 'he have taken new departure have shaken off listlessness why work quite steadily now for hour without knocking up be different man take class for morning doe good to see with dozen boy round blake will have to look out for be hardly a popular a captain audrey took to task severely when father said be evident that michael have spoilt be determined not to monopolise so selfishly somehow when came to point be always forgetting good resolution thing puzzled audrey michael be certainly quieter than used to be when be alone be rare occurrence now seemed to have so little to say to sometimes must take up book read out few passage if begged to put down talk to instead must dispute point in most tiresome fashion think people talk too much nowadays must say in lazy way 'it be lip service now if woman must only cultivate mind little more learn to hold tongue until have something worth saying world must not be flooded with muddy small talk now for example if must allow to read fine passage from emerson if audrey must allow nothing of kind if on contrary manifested obstinate determination to talk must argue with in same playful fashion must never draw into one of old confidential talk when be together of evening michael must be more like old self must sit beside piano when sang turn over leaf for must coax to be partner in game of whist lecture in old fashion time must be looking at so kindly that lecture never troubled in least when cyril spent evening at woodcote be generally once twice week michael never seemed to think that wanted must bury in book paper challenge dr ross to game of chess never took notice of audrey appealing look kindly attempt to draw into conversation with cyril be disregarded audrey bore for time then made up mind that must speak to be little shy of approaching subject michael never seemed to give opening now felt must have out with one evening when cyril have exchanged parting word in hall went back to drawing room found michael standing alone before fire went up to at once a turned to be struck with air of weariness depression 'oh michael how tired look ' observed laying hand on arm 'have neuralgia again a shook head continued anxiously 'be sure be quite well that nothing be troubling have be so very quiet evening michael ' here blushed little want to say something to yet hardly know how to put be just like thoughtfulness indeed there be need be never in way enigma if so may a well tell give up at once never must guess conundrum michael twirled moustache in most provoking way same perfectly understood ' give up ' repeated audrey pretended to frown beichael never knew so tiresome before be impossible to speak seriously to really be serious then tone changed looked at very gently 'you mean so kindly indeed be not necessary cyril must ever find in way looked down at rug a spoke there be moment silence before answered have come straight to from lover to say thing to be so like audrey to tell odd thought occurred to a listened to one of sudden flash of memory sometimes dart across mind remembered once in life have kissed have be lifetime ago be only child be staying in london have come to see on way from review remembered how audrey have stood looked at have same clear gray eye then 'how grand look mike ' exclaimed in awestruck tone for a child have always called beike ' wish must always wear that beautiful scarlet coat think if did not mind must like to kiss just for once ' michael remembered how have felt a made that innocent request how dr ross have laughed then when kissed cheek thanked quite gravely slipped back to father 'why ask for kiss too gage ' dr ross observed in joking way geraldine have looked quite shocked at idea thank father never kiss soldier replied discreetly at reply there have be fresh laugh 'he may be soldier be mike wanted to kiss ' returned audrey stoutly 'why do laugh daddy little girl may kiss anybody ' have cared for ever since then wondered then pulled up with sort of start why do not answer ' 'because be thinking ' returned quietly 'audrey do know be just a much child a be dozen year ago doe ever occur to dear that blake might not always endorse opinion stop a be about to speak 'we know what kind hearted person lady bountiful be how never think of herself at have sort of fellow feeling with blake quite understand view of case that two be company three be none ' michael ' here audrey blushed again most becomingly 'indeed cyril be not so ridiculous know what people generally think that engaged couple like to be left to daresay be pleasant sometimes see why be to be selfish cyril have plenty of opportunity for talking to when come of evening there be need for to turn hermit ' 'it be character prefer old bachelor develop sort of tendency to isolate at time from fellow creature to be sure be naturally gregarious then hate to spoil sport do a must be done by be burnett motto so by favour intend blake to have own way how silly must think ' returned impatiently wish must not be so self opinionative michael for be wrong quite wrong must be far happier if must make one of a do on other evening 'and be role have selected for ' replied michael mournfully 'to play gooseberry in old age get hated for pain dear child listen to word of wisdom leave mentor to enjoy surreptitious nap in arm chair be content with blake audience ' in spite of coaxing argument must not induce to promise that must mend way be incorrigible said a bade good night cyril give own way far more than do ' michael seemed quite impervious to reproach smile be still on face a left a door closed elbow dropped heavily on mantelpiece sombre look came into keen blue eye have to give up go away said to 'life be not worth living at price oh darling innocent darling why do not leave in peace why do tempt with sweet look word to be false to own sense of honour will not yield dare not for sake if will not let take own way must just throw up go abroad god bless know mean what say mike be mike still then groaned head dropped on arm tide of desolation swept over be still young in prime of life yet what good be life to audrey be healthy minded young person be not given to introspection never took to piece in morbid way to examine inner working of own mind after manner of folk who regulate in bungling fashion wind up afresh daily who must even time own heart beat if be possible audrey be not one of scrupulous self critic must have considered waste of time to be always weighing feeling in nicely adjusted balance 'know thyself ' said old thinker audrey ross must have altered saying out of self forgetfulness be better than amount of self knowledge ' nevertheless audrey be little thoughtful after conversation with michael during next few week be conscious of feeling vaguely dissatisfied with now then wondered if be different from other girl if absence of mood constant serenity gaiety be not sign of phlegmatic temperament be perfectly content with own position have never imagined before how pleasant must be to be engaged to have one human being entirely devoted to be very much attached to fiance never disappointed on contrary discovered day new admirable trait excited admiration a lover be simply perfect never made uneasy by demanding more than felt inclined to give at same time deepened sense of security restfulness to feel how completely understood now then must ask if love for cyril be that ought to be began to compare with others with geraldine for example remembered month of geraldine engagement how entirely percival have be absorbed in other geraldine have never seemed to have eye ear for anyone lover in absence have hardly seemed like at have be obliged to pay few week visit to friend in scotland audrey have accompanied remembered how when visit be half over have jestingly observed that must never be engaged to anyone if be compelled to lose own identity know be not same person gage have said 'instead of taking pleasure in friend society shut up write endless letter to percival when drive out go in boat never seem to see beautiful scenery mountain loch might be in cloud when anyone asks question seem to answer from distance everyone know that thought be at rutherford though geraldine have chosen to be offended at plain speaking have not be able to defend then have not audrey once found cry in room for long time have refused to be comforted audrey have be much alarmed for thought something must be wrong at woodcote be only that percival have headache seemed so dull without 'he say really can not bear place without that think must go to edith want to go home dreadfully finished geraldine tearfully think engaged people ought to leave other know percival think so too ' audrey remembered little episode when during christmas holiday cyril be obliged to go up to town for ten day missed excessively wrote charming little letter day nevertheless time did not hang heavily on hand be glad when day of return arrived went down to gray cottage to welcome mr blake have suggested a little surprise audrey have agreed at once cyril delight at seeing almost deprived of good manner knew fiancee objected to sort of demonstration before people only just remembered in time a audrey drew back with heightened colour made up for afterwards when mr blake left alone audrey be almost overwhelmed by vehement expression of joy at finding with again have be longest ten day have ever spent in life ' observed ' be horribly bored a homesick a possible be afraid norton found very poor company if have not be for letter must not have borne will never send away again dearest ' 'but be nonsense ' returned in sensible way 'you can not stop at rutherford year round will not do for to lose friend will have to pay visit be afraid will not always ask leave if very tempting invitation come ' 'you will not need to do so answered quietly 'do think must begrudge pleasure have wish even if have right to curtail freedom be not so selfish ' 'you be never selfish ' returned softly 'cyril dear suppose ought to be pleased that feel like do know be just little sorry ' indeed must hardly believe ear for be not paying pretty compliment 'yes make rather uncomfortable seems to a though ought to feel same a though there be something wanting in sometimes fancy be different from other girl ' compare with other people returned quickly for must not bear to look troubled for moment mood be new to have never seen shade on bright face before 'you have calm temperament be great charm be not subject to cold hot fit of ordinary mortal be own fault can not be happy without expect to share restlessness ' be right ' replied very much relieved by 'you be always so nice at understanding thing cyril do know be blaming for feeling so comfortable in absence be so busy have so many thing to interest then have michael ' young man flushed slightly have learnt to repress knew far better than did that love be infinitely greater than hers what of be woman made to be worshipped never troubled when talked of michael cyril nature be too noble for jealousy just for moment frankness jarred on ' think be nearly a happy a usual went on determined to tell truth yet by own account be perfectly miserable ' be own fault returned lightly been be unreasonable creature be not patient like woman be true have life apart from now always want to be near expect to feel same audrey looked at thoughtfully gave so much yet seemed to demand so little 'you be very good to cyril ' said in low voice ' never thought must understand so thoroughly leave so free make so happy wonder where have learnt to be so wise ' love for have taught many thing answered really make happy sweetheart ' look in eye be sufficient answer be reward to see perfect content trust in to bask in sweet look smile chapter xxix two family event solemn thing be to to look upon babe sleep wearing in spirit deep undeveloped mystery of adam taint woe when developed be will not let slumber so mr browning one morning a ross family be sitting at breakfast audrey noticed that michael seemed very much absorbed by letter be reading laid down presently made remark only seemed little grave absent during remainder of meal just a be rising from table heard ask father in rather low tone if must come into study for moment a wanted few word with a went out together mentioned word dogcart must have in time to catch train audrey felt sudden quickening of curiosity michael manner be so peculiar that be sure something must have happened wondered what sudden summons to town meant be bitterly cold day light fall of snow have whitened ground three mile drive in dogcart be not very agreeable proceeding only michael seemed so strangely callous to weather now surely father must insist on having fly from town be always so careful of michael comfort audrey must settle to nothing be impossible to practise answer note until have have word with michael so took up paper pretended to read until study door opened heard cousin go up to room next moment dr ross walked in looking a though be very much pleased be droll fellow ' said addressing wife who be looking over tradesman book have just told with very long face that uncle mr carlisle be dead that have left money be a lugubrious over a though have be made bankrupt ' audrey uttered exclamation mr ross said in quiet way 'perhaps be grieved at loss of uncle john must hardly be becoming to rejoice openly at death of relative however rich might be be afraid many men must if be in mike shoe why say mr carlisle be worth six seven thousand year most of solid capital locked up in safe security investment be always canny scotsman liked to take care of money here be mike pretending not to care jot about looking a though have care of world on shoulder think show very good feeling michael be never mercenary loss of only near relative must make dull for time bey dear emmie be very pretty sentiment unfortunately doe not hold good in case mike have never seen uncle since be lad of eighteen be about seventeen year ago have often owned to that mr carlisle be very close in money dealing be pity there be sympathy between said once uncle andrew doe not seem to have thought beyond money grubbing be decent sort of old fellow believe daresay will end by marrying pretty girl other then will be properly miserable rest of life doe not sound much like affectionate nephew 'oh never cared for ' interposed audrey beichael have often talked about seems so strange that must leave money when took so little notice of year 'well be not demonstrative man returned father 'but in way seemed fond proud of mike remember when got victoria cross be lying between life death poor lad mr carlisle wrote very kindly enclosed cheque for two hundred pound have to answer letter for remember when got better first came down here that recommended to keep up friendly intercourse with uncle though believe took advice mike be always such lazy beggar 'and have to go up to town to see lawyer suppose 'yes think may be away week two there must not stand here talking have told reynolds to order fly from town need not start for three quarter of hour audrey waited impatiently for twenty minute before michael made appearance looked very cold at once proceeded to wheel easy chair in front of fire may a well get warm observed ' expect will have regular snowstorm before night look at leaden sky well what now ' for audrey be kneeling on rug be looking at with brightest most bewitching smile beichael be so glad so very very glad think be a pleased a though fortune be mine ' think be decent remark to make to fellow who have just lost uncle really audrey may well look ashamed of quite blush for avarice thy name be woman ' michael be absurd be not bit ashamed of myself of course be sorry poor man be dead a never saw can not be excessively grieved be delighted that have done right thing left money be sure in heart that be glad too 'it doe not strike may regard in light of unmitigated bore what doe old bachelor like want with heap of money must like to know how be to spend six seven thousand year why very idea be oppressive ' 'you be very good at pretence michael a though be not clever enough to see through flimsy attempt at philosophy think must be infra dig to look too delighted ' think be going in for stoic returned blandly 'yes be not really one be never cut out for poor man michael role did not suit at be pain grief to to travel second class be only best of everything be good enough for like to put up at first class hotel to have waiter railway official crowding round even when be in scotland gillie took for titled aristocrat be so lavish with money be way have michael to open purse for everyone wonder poor widow living down by fir plantation called noble

oak can have beautiful house furnish just a like can buy picture old china book why can have quite famous library if want assistance gage will be proud to help if will only consult will be loveliest house ever saw ' 'what do want with house returned little morosely must think room must be far better for bachelor 'ah need not be bachelor longer replied gaily 'you have always told that must not afford to marry now can have house wife too here stopped for moment for somehow word sounded oddly a said michael wife what curious idea must be quite willing for michael to marry wife must be very nice nicer than most girl said to herself here looked at little wistfully michael did not make response have poker in hand when left off speaking broke up huge coal into dozen glowing splinter then do remember ' went on 'how used to long for mail phaeton pair of bay horse when ship come will drive pair how often have said that to will drive in park sometimes michael until have someone else whom want to take for of course when have wife ' here interrupted with marked impatience ' will never have wife wish must not talk such nonsense audrey there be such bitterness in tone that looked quite frightened next moment spoke more gently 'do not see dear that be little upset about money coming to be great responsibility a well a pleasure then a looked little downcast at rebuke put hand lightly upon brown hair turned face towards 'why there be tear in eye foolish child ' said quickly 'did really mind what said dear audrey ' in more agitated tone for to surprise large bright tear fell on other hand 'oh be not that ' returned in rather choked voice look so concerned michael know never mind scolding ' 'then what be ' asked anxiously 'what can have troubled be want of sympathy with little plan old oak carving book even mail phaeton may come by by when have have time to realise position a croesus did apathy vex audrey ' 'no for of course understood liked better for not caring about thing just now be only will think very foolish michael here did look ashamed of herself felt somehow a though money must separate will not go on living at woodcote will have home of own other interest perhaps be vexed if ever do marry hope hope wife will be good to ' ' think can promise that ' returned quietly 'thank dear for telling truth 'yes michael be not shocked at selfishness ' 'not in least understand far better than understand ' here looked at rather strangely a rose go now ' 'yes be quite time can hear wheel coming up terrace then took hand old smile be on face ' have more mistaken fancy audrey gold of indie must not separate if furnish house will promise that gage will ransack wardour street with when be married dear will choose what will give a said stooped over for be still kneeling before fire kissed very gently just above eye be done so quietly almost solemnly that be not even startled ' suppose blake must object to from cousin michael ' said gravely 'good bye for few day then be gone ' be glad did that ' thought audrey have never done before a though cyril must mind be so afraid have really vexed with foolish talking looked so sad so unlike wanted to rouse

brown study work have taken up lay in lap after be who be leaving when be cyril wife how must look after michael audrey must think of nothing else for remainder of day told cyril about cousin good fortune when took out for walk afternoon of minded hard road gray wintry sky when few snowflake pelted only walked on faster cyril showed proper interest in news be delighted to hear ' said heartily 'captain burnett be one of best fellow know deserves all have got ' then a be growing dark must hardly see other face coaxed to go back with to gray cottage to tell kester wonderful news now so happened that mr blake mollie have gone to neighbour be not expected back for hour cyril begged to stay make tea for very cosy hour spent sitting round fire making kind of possible impossible plan for hero next day audrey thought be diverted into different channel for geraldine boy be born great be family rejoicing dr ross telegraphed to michael audrey never liked brother in law so well a on morning when came down to woodcote to receive congratulation mr ross be at hillside only audrey father be sitting at breakfast mr harcourt looked pale fagged there be marvellous content in whole mien

finest child that have seen for long time mr ross perfectly agrees with commanded with difficulty wonder if be like gage percival ' 'it be impossible to say at present one can not get to see eye be little red mr lockhart say be red at first be astonishingly heavy in fact be a fine boy a must see anywhere ' audrey went on with breakfast be so inexpressibly droll to see percival in character of proud father dr ross seemed perfectly to understand son in law audrey pleasure be little damped when found that must not see geraldine went about with head in air calling aggrieved aunt pretended to be jealous of mother who have taken up residence at hillside during first week when day came for audrey to be admitted to quiet room saw geraldine looking lovelier than ever in weakness with dark downy head nestled against arm great rush of tenderness filled heart felt a though have never loved sister so dearly 'will take aunt audrey ' geraldine smiled at 'no move let see mother son together for moment oh two darling how comfortable look ' audrey tone be trifle husky then gave little laugh 'actually boy be week old to day be first time have be allowed to see nephew ' did seem hard '

in extremity of anguish made answer must induce to speak again until reached gray cottage where fly stopped got out assisted to alight kept face averted from ' will be with to morrow ' repeated a touched hand to there be audible reply only bowed head a passed through gate held open for disappeared from sight chapter xxxii did not love ' 'when man begin to do wrong can not answer for how far

nothing for yet have be in town whole month only thought of cyril observed quietly a closed case that be certainly very kind of captain burnett close observer must have said that michael generosity have not quite pleased suppose will wear to night at charringtons '' asked presently 'yes lovely flower have brought ' added with one of charming smile somehow cloud passed in moment from young man brow what did matter after that must not give diamond have not given to did not belong to other for time for eternity a thought took in arm with loving speech 'you be sweet a very sweetest of flower said holding close to be very dearest thing in world to audrey sometimes when think of future be almost beside with happiness ' when little excitement of diamond be over michael relapsed again into gravity be still grave when went up to hillside next day wakeful night reflection have brought comfort felt a though gulf be opening before whom loved that dared not for very dread giddiness look into when returned from church be about to sit down to sumptuous luncheon took geraldine aside presented offering to surprise be quite overcome must have called husband to share pleasure begged to say nothing just then have present too took far more calmly said in rallying tone a spoke wondered at cousin beauty complexion have always be very transparent now excitement have added soft bloom be

under cousin roof until have made known to grievous thing a soon a rose from table dr ross be preparing a usual to follow wife into drawing room until prayer bell summoned into schoolroom michael said little more seriously than usual ross must mind giving hour in study after prayer want advice about something ' for wished to secure quiet time before audrey returned from party doctor be observant man in spite of occasional absence of mind saw at once that something be amiss behall be able to do without evening emmie ' said with usual old fashioned politeness that wife daughter thought very model of perfection 'it be too bad to leave alone when audrey be not here to keep company ' mr ross assured that must not in least mind such solitude be reading third volume of exciting novel must not be sorry to finish a soon a be settled coffee served gong sounded adjourned to schoolroom michael never missed function a called liked to sit in corner watch row of boyish face before try to imagine

captain footstep be ready to be hewed slashed into small piece if only victoria cross might be reward a soon a curly haired champion have left michael followed cousin into study dr ross have already lighted lamp roused fire into cheerful blaze 'what be mike look bothered ' asked a michael drew up chair 'nothing wrong with money hope ' must be wrong about ' returned michael rather disdainfully 'it be about a safe a bank of england be something very different matter may say concern heard something other day rather uncomfortable about blake 'nothing discreditable hope ' returned doctor quickly be afraid must answer yes to question at least can assure that there be nothing against blake ' then dr ross looked relieved 'whatever blame there be attache solely to mother 'humph with good look never quite liked woman ejaculated dr ross sotto voce nevertheless have always be extremely pleasant with perhaps man find difficult to be otherwise with pretty woman have unfortunately found out perhaps ought to say fortunately for mr blake be not widow husband be living ' 'good heaven 'neither be name blake changed at time discarded husband be afraid must prepare for shock dr ross for whole thing be distinctly reprehensible ' mean to tell ' returned doctor with anxious blackness gathering on brow cyril that future son in law be cognisant of fact ' 'no ' replied michael eagerly 'you be doing injustice blake be a ignorant of thing a be have more to do with than did not tell that sole blame rest with mother ' then doctor in spite of christianity pronounced malediction against blake womankind behe be just sort to get into mischief ' continued 'there be dangerous look in eye go on michael keep in suspense there be something disgraceful behind what reason have woman to allege for giving up husband ' excuse be that brought shame dishonour on on child that must have nothing more to do with have committed forgery have be condemned to penal servitude for seven year then doctor

finish story a quickly a possible 'you know audrey friend thomas o'brien ' 'to be sure do be retired corn chandler went to shop once in peterborough 'and have probably heard of brother mat ' then dr ross gazed at with face of despair misfortune be accumulating have sense of nightmare oppression surely hideous thing must not be true such disgrace must threaten if earthquake have opened in woodcote ground must not have looked more horrified 'do mean to tell mike that mat o'brien be cyril father ' then michael gave detailed carefully worded account of interview with mr blake 'then be true quite true ' in hopeless tone can not be doubt of have from own lip to morrow must see o'brien hear side can not help saying that be sorry for woman in spite of falseness be utterly crushed with misery ' may be doubted if dr ross heard be occupied with own reflection will break audrey heart be devoted to fellow 'oh hope not have more strength than other girl 'of course can not allow affair to go on must see blake tell so at once 'there be hurry be there think must let speak to o'brien first 'well if wish confess see necessity 'and hope will be gentle with blake remember that not vestige of blame attache to be simply misfortune that be son of such parent expect will be utterly broken hearted then dr ross gave vent to impatient groan man have softer heart than have liked cyril from first must think of child mike ' said at last 'yes must think of must be merciful to too think what will suffer when know be a innocent a babe suppose then hesitated looked at cousin 'that there will be way of hushing up thing letting engagement go on ' then doctor nearly sprang out of chair out of sens michael to put question to be likely that man in position must allow family to be allied to convicted criminal must amount of hushing up render alliance tolerable suppose not ' ' have never cared much for conventionality for mere show of thing suppose that in sense good opinion of fellow men be necessary for comfort when blake came to told that have not shilling in world beside earnings a classical master did not let poverty stand in way told that a girl happiness be involved must not find in heart to withhold consent 'you be certainly not in position in must wish to see son in law said to will speak to charrington see what be to be done have spoken charrington only promised other day that must push on have doubt at that with interest standing in place cyril must have have house in time audrey position must have be equal to sister 'and mean to say that be at end 'of course be at end ' almost shouted doctor cyril career be practically at end too do suppose public school in england must employ master whose relative be so disreputable that be obliged to make use of assumed name when refuse to allow to marry daughter must give conge at same time ' 'then in case be ruined man to dr ross gave sorrowful assent be to help mike will do in power to soften weight of blow to when be at end between audrey how be to keep in rutherford thing must impossible must not wish be very proud high spirited by nature position must be intolerable to must go if money will help may command to reasonable amount 'he will not take money then added 'poor beggar ' under breath will stand by mike ' beost certainly will mean to befriend blake too a far a will let ' ' must not think must refuse sympathy man need someone at time when spoke be thinking of girl have great influence with michael sometimes think brother influence must be stronger how must be if be to hear news first from ' then michael recoiled a though someone have struck in face must not tell must rather be shot returned vehemently 'well be not pleasant business suppose must do only idea crossed mind that perhaps might come better from will not be able to refrain from indignation be apt to get little warm sometimes michael firmly negatived notion will go hard with tell ' said decidedly 'nothing can soften such blow be far better for to hear from father see ' continued rather sadly 'it will be fair division for have to break to poor blake will have tough work with for worship ground walk on ' 'ay poor fellow know doe what cruel affair be mike that woman deceit will go far to spoil two life to michael must not agree said with great deal of feeling that audrey be not girl to let love affair spoil life thought too little of herself be too considerate unselfish to allow private unhappiness to get too strong hold over so spoil other people life 'you will see what sort of stuff have in said with enthusiasm of lover who can find flaw at behe will bear sorrow bravely not allow to interfere with others be far too good noble need not fear for have strength enough for dozen woman dr ross felt little comforted by such word mind waiting up for to night ' asked presently 'unfortunately emmie have sent servant to bed because said have writing to do feel very upset about will find out from manner that something be amiss must bother mike will just come in here warm herself if tell be tired will not detain ' ' can have objection to do ' replied michael trying to hide reluctance indeed dr ross looked so pale jaded that audrey suspicion must have be excited 'go to bed get good night rest be nearly twelve now meant to be home by one then dr ross allowed to be persuaded know about good night rest ' replied must be glad to think over whole thing quietly before see of there be hurry a say perhaps have better get interview over with o'brien ' tell cousin emmeline ' emmie ' here doctor voice be somewhat irritable a one disagreeable detail opened after 'not to night certainly why will be asleep must never do to tell before audrey must get round to geraldine there must be deuce of row tell child be tired bid good night then dr ross shook michael hand with fervour took off michael spent dreary hour by in study be relief to when heard carriage wheel a opened door be quite dazzled at scene before be brilliant moonlight night terrace wide lawn be bathed in pure white light crisp frost have touched grass silvered blade effect against dark background of tree shrub be intensely beautiful moonlight shone full on audrey upturned face a stood talking to lover silken fold of dress soft furred cloak hood looked almost of unearthly whiteness in michael bewildered eye seemed invested at present moment with new regal beauty light musical laugh dispelled illusion michael what have become of father ' be tired went off to bed more than hour ago hope object to deputy suppose be not coming in blake a be so late ' 'of course be not ' returned audrey in tone allowed of appeal have early work to morrow must get a much rest a can good night cyril have have delightful evening have not ' to cyril responded gaily for be not possible there must be lingering adieu before michael a cyril ran down terrace audrey waited until michael have fastened door then accompanied to study nice warm be ' observed in pleased tone always keep up such splendid fire ' be chilly mortal know march night have touch of december in ' 'yes be quite frosty audrey threw back hood cloak sat down in dr ross favourite chair 'have idea how like picture looked ' michael wondered 'with soft white drapery about sparkling cross upon neck ' then turned away head with mute sensation of pain how happy how very happy looked 'we have have nice evening began in most animated manner 'everything be so well arranged there be dinner party first be followed by what called cinderella dance actually mean to break up for hour half mr charrington be quite annoyed because came home so early ' enjoyed ' 'oh immensely waltzed twice with cyril do know dance splendidly be certainly best partner ' 'yes look a though must dance well must believe audrey that when be youngster be considered good dancer too be rather droll to remember now ' can very easily believe do everything well michael ' 'pshaw then michael added with pretended yawn think must sleep well though ' audrey refused to take very broad hint 'what hurry be in have not warmed yet do stay little longer michael so seldom get to myself ' be very late ' returned unwilling to yield ' will only keep few minute replied eagerly 'but want to tell something ' then be obliged to sit down again 'what be ' asked little languidly for spell of presence be so strong that threatened to subjugate be never willingly alone with now fear be always upon that in weak moment might betray fear be idle one man be le likely than michael to lose self control nevertheless be there 'it be about cyril ' returned softly 'dr charrington have be so nice to to night stood out once during lancer dr charrington came up to have quite long talk together said father have be speaking to that have quite made up mind that cyril must be in upper school next year when mr hanbury left must be better position must be able to have private pupil a good a told that must do best to push for father sake ' must have be very pleased at replied michael spoke in dull monotonous way 'yes be quite excited see ' continued little shyly will make difference to if dr charrington push cyril for of course will make possible for to marry ' then michael felt a though have accidentally touched full charged battery waited until numb tingling sensation have left before answered ' did not know that wished to shorten engagement ' said very quietly understood that there must be talk of settling for next two three year of course if father have objection 'how talk michael returned audrey blushing with annoyance at obvious misunderstanding of meaning 'it be cyril who be in hurry for must be perfectly content to go on a be for next five year do not remember tirade on pleasure of freedom ' think do recall something of kind ala have ever forgotten anything have said to 'well be afraid be of same opinion still only dare not let cyril know that must be so hurt suppose ' reflectively been be different from woman do always seem in such dreadful hurry about everything when cyril complains that feel unsettled get between work pretend to understand be very matter of fact be not michael ' must not have said so ' 'oh be be afraid cyril think so well a have told good news will not detain longer then michael rose with feeling of relief a followed few minute later upstairs wondered what must have thought of with effort have be unable to bring to utter one word of congratulation must have be lie said to vehemently must find in heart to deceive for moment may be last happy day heaven help ' michael went to bed in profound wretchedness rose be withered ' thought audrey a regarded drooping bud leaf bey poor beautiful rose be cyril gift too what pity that flower must die must grow old that in world there must always be decay change will ever be happier than be to night with cyril to love michael dear michael to be friend what make so grave be always grave now then sighed laid down flower took glittering cross from neck poor michael must like to see happy too finished a put away in case chapter xxxv 'olive will acknowledge anything ' 'evil like rolling stone upon mountain top

that wind be decidedly easterly perhaps more strictly speaking north east have run down garden to speak to about plant perhaps with intention of intercepting cyril when went across to breakfast have have quite confabulation on subject when got back to house found rather subdued state of thing mr ross looked tired husband have kept awake by restlessness have got firmly in mind that fit of gout be impending dr ross have once have touch of gout very slight touch to be sure have given wholesome fear of complaint have implanted in deep distrust of other men port wine devoted wife have never forgotten circumstance 'and be sure observed in undertone to daughter 'that if be not quite certain that there be nothing troubling father for of course must have told of at once must have said there be something on mind for tossed groaned so mark word audrey be old enemy gout if only must induce to speak to dr pilkington might ward off still 'what be that be telling child emmie ' asked doctor who have very sharp ear stuff nonsense never be better in life ' think complexion look little sallow morning john ' returned mr ross rather timidly for knew husband objection to form of ailment 'and be sure never closed eye night at dr ross pished impatiently be then that audrey hazarded brilliant suggestion about east wind look rather limp too went on 'and never must endure east wind 'have own way audrey ' returned cousin good humouredly to to mr ross did confess that night have be sleepless too when have finished breakfast went round to stable where dr ross joined have ordered dog cart to be got ready for told groom that there be need to bring round to front door dr ross watched silently a drew on driving glove turned up collar of coat will have cold drive be afraid said at last a michael took rein brown mare began to fidget 'come to study moment get back michael nodded much a disliked business before be anxious to get over so drove a fast a possible a mare be fresh skittish gave plenty to think about be quite warm with exertion of holding in restraining playful antic by time pulled up at village inn went by name of cat fiddle here have mare put up while walked down one main street of brail down lane two until came to mr o'brien sequestered cottage mr o'brien opened door when saw michael shook head with air of profound sadness led way without speaking into parlour where usually sat where sam be basking before fire after luxurious habit of cat got up however rubbed sleek head against michael knee a sat down in black elbow chair mr o'brien still stood on rug shaking head sadly have come captain made up mind must come to day to get at right of told mat so depend upon captain will look up said to be man of action be not likely will let grass grow under foot will be round sure enough will have to be ready with answer 'where be brother mr o'brien ' have gone out for bit will be back presently told not to go far will be wanted may take word for will be wanted mat told then promised must be round directly ' be afraid affair have be great shock to mr o'brien miss ross once told that have idea whom brother married 'well sir ca say a much a mat told that name of girl be going to wed be olive carrick that came of respectable people did not tell much more than now put to captain how be to know that woman must falsify husband name that must be living close to door a one might say for what be matter of three mile gave sort of shiver have not properly got rid of yet when think of dear young creature whom susan have always loved that must be entrapped through woman falseness into engagement with mat son go to heart doe indeed captain to see that dear sweet lady dragged into connection will only disgrace bey cousin must think disgrace to be connected with mr o'brien ' for knew too well audrey large mindedness absence of conventionality behe have always looked upon a friend ' captain be very handsomely said wish prissy must have heard for have done nothing cry since news reached rachel refusing to be comforted be nothing compared to prissy when mood be on literally water meal with tear yes mean handsomely be old man captain burnett know world bit have sense to see that thomas o'brien honest painstaking a may be be fit connection for dr ross daughter why to think might be niece call uncle ' here old man face flushed a spoke 'it be not right be not a must be must give up must indeed captain ' be afraid dr ross hold that opinion mr o'brien will understand that mean disrespect to be simply intolerable to that daughter of must marry matthew be son see be speaking very plainly ' 'yes sir be speaking just a plainly to in sort of case be use beating about bush mat have made bed must just lie on child heaven help poor young thing must just lie on too dear dear to think that when be talking to so pleasantly about mollie kester what be lad name that have idea that be speaking to uncle there beat captain doe indeed ' there be tear in old

best in long run if be bit difficult send to will talk to will put thing before in light wo be able to resist ' in spite of sadness of conversation michael must hardly forbear smile ' hardly know what must say to mr o'brien 'you leave to captain be best not to be too knowing about thing mind telling one thing must say dear young lady have be good true friend to thomas o'brien be grateful proud to call friend will not have for niece mat son may be good a gold have nothing to say against poor lad who after be own flesh blood must be sin shame to wed when father picked oakum in felon cell think will fetch sir woman be mostly proud like menkind to have clean hand will say too ' here mr o'brien thumped arm of chair so emphatically that sam woke uttered reproachful mew hope will not be put to pain of saying to ' returned michael in low voice what fine old fellow be wondered what dr ross must say when repeated speech to nature must have intended tom o'brien for gentleman must anything be more touching than way sought to shield girl friend even putting aside natural claim of own flesh blood to prevent from being sullied by contact with michael felt a though longed to shake hand with tell how honoured respected instinctively felt that such testimony must hardly be understood one word did venture to say ' think be very good of to take side ' sir can see nought of goodness in a susan used to say must not praise people for walking along straight road for not taking first crooked path that offer susan thought alike there be of fond of crooked turning there can only be one right one wrong tom a must say hope captain that will always tell truth shame devil a long a be living man ' must think there must be doubt of ' returned michael heartily then faint smile crossed old man face faded in moment a footstep sounded in passage outside 'that be mat have kept word in coming back so soon have better fetch in then will get over ' 'you need not leave room mr o'brien be business a well a ours ' know sir thank kindly feel a if have said say may a well bide quiet with prissy mat have have out with be up night talking always hoped be christian captain doubt when think

foolish lad went half wild for love of sir if will excuse will just send mat along keep in background bit make grind teeth with pain anger to hear how treated poor fellow almost driving mad with bitter tongue ' 'then in case will certainly not keep a spoke noticed how vigorous old man seemed to totter a rose from chair only shook head with same gentle smile a michael offered arm captain be not needed be only bit shaken with be passed must give time to right now will send mat in when have finished will see again ' michael did not have to wait long have only crossed room to look at photograph of susan o'brien always stood on little round table in corner when found light suddenly intercepted a matthew o'brien tall figure blocked up little window to surprise mat commenced conversation quite easily be looking at susan captain burnett be taken twelve thirteen year ago be kind true face be better than handsome one in long run doe not look a though must desert man when head be under water eh captain ' indeed ' returned michael falling at once into other man humour bers o'brien must have be thoroughly good woman for husband never seems to have got over loss be always talking about 'that be so like tom be never given to keep silent tongue in head must always speak out thought good bad be rather different from why have often spent day without opening mouth except to call to dog think tom find relief to talk sound of own tongue soothes ' havery likely will sit down mr o'brien fireside be rather pleasant place bitter march day like ' returned mat indifferently 'for prefer to stand a spoke propped tall figure against wooden mantelpiece half shielding face with one arm looked down into blaze in attitude michael must only see side face be startled at strong likeness to cyril profile be nearly a finely cut be only when turned full face that resemblance ceased to be so striking cyril have same dark eye low broad forehead beautifully formed mouth chin be very different from father expressed far too clearly weak irresolute character be handsome man in spite of shabby coat there be something almost distinguished in appearance anyone seeing man for first time must have guessed have story very probably looking at broad chest closely cropped gray hair black moustache must have taken for soldier a michael did somehow found little difficult to begin conversation hoped matthew o'brien must speak again seemed disinclined to break silence have grown up between 'you be not much like brother mr o'brien ' sir tom be not much alike more be pity tom have be honest man life ' michael be about to reply that be not saying much in favour felt that under circumstance must be awkward so held peace 'there be many men to beat tom ' continued mat folk must be so stanch to own flesh blood when only disgrace must come of tom be too fine hearted to trample on fellow when be down other folk be cry fie for shame on must believe sir ' stretching out sinewy thin hand a spoke 'that that brother of mine never said unkind word to in life when came back to that night feeling none too sure of welcome be just grip of hand come in lad a though be young chap used to be coming home to spend holiday with susan ' think brother one of best men living mr o'brien 'and so be sir so be have not come way to talk about tom ' here paused again shielding hand went over eye

michael much touched at generosity on part of poor prodigal ' will not deny that be very thing suggested even begged to propose to refused do suppose that cousin dr ross must connive at such deceit falsehood be quite true that mr blake child may refuse to have anything to do with be solely affair in few hour mr o'brien eldest son will be made aware of father existence ' be sorry to hear sir ' returned mat in weak hopeless voice will make great mistake nothing good will come of will teach youngster to loathe very name a for lad here spoke with strong emotion will be ready to curse for spoiling life sir let sleeping dog lie better let keep dark bring trouble to one michael shook head such double dealing deceit must only deepen mischief ross will never give sanction to daughter

vowing vengeance on olive threatening to turn away from door if ever dare to show face here ' ' think that will ever molest brother ' be quite of opinion captain olive will give pretty wide berth unless be interest to see then tom rough speech must turn from purpose for tenacity getting own way 'd back against woman a say there be nothing to be gained by talking ' returned michael rising from chair at moment mr o'brien entered hope be not interrupting captain be getting late be thinking must take snack with woman be dishing up dinner just baked shoulder of mutton potato under be plain folk prissy will be glad proud if will join sir ' after moment hesitation michael consented have have idea how late be must already be sitting down to luncheon at woodcote must be better for to take food before set out on cold drive home will allow to leave directly afterwards observed a mat left room moment took opportunity to give mr o'brien brief resume of conversation begged to keep dark finished be thinking more of child than told that course must be impossible 'and spoke truth sir good must come of such crookedness mat meant well lad have good heart doubt have sore conscience when think of evil have wrought leave with sir can manage best there hear prissy calling to will just take place michael felt faint weary homely viand seemed very palatable to noticed how matthew o'brien want of appetite seemed to distress brother be eating nought lad ' kept saying at interval once bade prissy fetch remains of meat pie mat have enjoyed previous day will find more toothsome said in hearty way mat must have nothing to say to let be tom said at last ' man have not always got stomach for food captain have taken away appetite with talk sight of meat make sick ' then got up from table saw pacing up down garden with pipe michael got away a soon a possible mr o'brien walked with to inn when dogcart be brought out shook hand very heartily 'let know how thing go on captain god bless then a though by afterthought 'if girl give trouble send to will just talk sense into then stood in road watched until dogcart driver be out of sight afternoon work have begun a michael entered woodcote found dr ross alone in study have only few minute to give michael ' said looking up from letter be writing ' expected back at least two hour ago then michael gave concise account of interview with brother o'brien be grand old fellow said enthusiastically 'you must have heard talk dr ross a for poor mat have making of good fellow about too only devil somehow spoilt batch must believe poor beggar wanted to efface to clear out altogether for sake of youngster a called be not very polished in language what can expect still meant well ' daresay did ' returned doctor with sigh 'you have better keep paper to show cyril must send away now a carter other boy be coming to will see later on ' then michael took off must hear audrey voice a passed door of sitting room mollie be with few minute later a stood at window wondering what must do with saw walk down terrace towards gate with mollie hanging on arm seemed laughing talking long will wear that bright face said to a threw into easy chair took up paper have just fallen into doze with booty stretched on softest of rug at foot when there be light tap at door to surprise discomposure cyril blake entered room visit be so wholly unexpected that michael stared at for moment without speaking cyril have never come to private sitting room before without special invitation must apologise for intrusion captain burnett ' began cyril quickly wanted to speak to particularly be asleep be so sorry if have disturbed ' 'no nonsense only felt drowsy because have be out in cold wind room be so warm take chair blake will be wide awake in moment have seen paper to day there be nothing in only remarkably stupid article on bismarck ' will look at by by to tell truth have come to speak to about mother be seriously uneasy about be ill there be something grievously wrong understood from mollie that be with for more than hour yesterday in fact that sent for ' fire have burnt hollow during michael brief nap seized opportunity to stir vigorously into blaze afforded momentary respite few second reflection convinced however that be use beating about bush with man of cyril calibre truth have to be told amount of preparation must render palatable 'you be right returned quietly bers blake sent for thought must be able to help in difficulty cyril looked intensely surprised ' thought mollie must have made mistake seems very strange that mother ' stopped a though civility did not permit to finish sentence michael perfectly understood 'it seems strange to of course doe acquaintance with mr blake be so slight that certainly give right to confidence be in trouble in great trouble may say chance threw in way so ' here cyril interrupted bey mother in trouble ' returned incredulously michael thought looked little pale 'excuse captain burnett if seem rude from boy have be mother friend have never kept anything from find almost impossible to believe that must give confidence to comparative stranger must refuse to son may beg to speak plainly abhor mystery cyril spoke impatiently curtly tone be almost displeased michael took offence regarded young man very kindly ' abhor too ' replied gravely 'but want to understand one thing be mere chance brought in mr blake way at moment when needed assistance be only like other stranger who see lady in difficulty now have told can speak more plainly ' wish to heaven must ' returned cyril with growing excitement 'do know impression be giving that there be mysterious confidence between mother be too much to ask if may know what difficulty trouble mean ' blake will know in good time replied michael with disarming gentleness 'if speak out at once be because fear to give too great shock 'too great shock 'yes mother out of mistaken kindness have kept child in ignorance year that have father living be not father of whom must be proud tried to keep fact of existence from ' 'wait moment exclaimed cyril poor fellow have turned very white ' must take in be telling burnett mother widowed mother have husband living ' ' be telling truth be ready to hear say more will wait time like be long story sad one mother have left to tell ' 'go on let hear word hide nothing nothing ' cyril spoke in dull stifled voice a though felt choking when michael began to speak very slowly quietly almost turned back to a story proceeded michael noticed how clutched carved arm of chair did not once see face michael afterwards owned that telling miserable story to olive o'brien son be one of toughest job have ever done in life have idea how well did there be not unnecessary word with utmost care strove to shield woman to show conduct in best light 'it be for child sake did ' said again again there be answering word from cyril if have be turned to stone position must not have be more rigid 'have understood blake poor dear fellow if knew how sorry dr ross be for ' then a michael mentioned dr ross name cyril seemed galvanised into sudden life know know for god sake give air ' before michael must cross room cyril have stumbled to window flung up stood there with bitter east wind blowing on face a though be refreshing summer breeze chill air made michael shiver knew by experience how intolerable be that sense of suffocation stood by patiently until deadly feeling have passed 'be better now blake poor fellow can sit down speak to ' then cyril turned face towards michael be shocked to see how strained haggard looked 'does know too ' 'not yet father will tell ' then poor boy shuddered from head to foot 'they will make give up o god how can bear burnett think will go mad tell be not true that mother have not lied to year 'at least have lied for son sake ' knew how futile be word a saw bitter contempt in cyril honest eye will never forgive have ruined life have made wish be dead will never never ' michael interrupted somewhat sternly 'hush hush know what be saying be mother blake nothing can alter fact ' have deceived will not speak nothing can make better worse if lose audrey care what becomes of ' michael looked at pityingly 'do think ought to marry blake ' then cyril flung away from with groan even in misery understood that appeal to generosity put from be too much stunned too dazed altogether to follow out train of reasoning in vague sort of way understood two fact that kester mollie be disgraced that mother mother whom adored have deceived beyond must not go human mind have limit afterwards in chill hour of darkness solitude michael word must come back to 'do think ought to marry blake do think ought to marry ' chapter xxxvii ' will never be free 'but there be true heart sight of sorrow summons forth though known in day of past delight know not worth ' bayly word escaped from michael almost unconsciously hardly knew that spoke aloud in inner consciousness have doubt at of course ought to be pursued if have be in cyril place must not have hesitated for moment dearly a loved audrey what that love be only knew must have refused to marry must have separated from utterly at once michael strong long suffering nature must have carried nobly through such ordeal be man who must have acted up to spirit of gospel command pluck out offending eye to cut off right hand there must have be parleying weak dalliance with temptation love be duty to leave so farewell for ever be what must have said to knowing time that life must be utterly joyless to must cyril in hot untried youth be capable of like generosity must cleave to betrothed with passionate one sided fealty vowing nothing on earth must separate a long a two loved other will make give up ' be have said that seemed to be one deadly terror assailed cyril have turned away with groan when michael spoke made audible answer next moment hand be on door 'where be going blake ' inquired michael anxiously be impossible to keep yet how must let leave in condition must get away from here returned cyril hoarsely must be alone somewhere ' michael understood 'let at least walk with ' returned quickly might meet someone perhaps may be of use refuse will not speak to ' a cyril made objection indeed be doubtful whether even heard what michael said followed downstairs just a reached hall drawing room door opened before must warn cyril audrey came out have music in hand uttered exclamation of surprise pleasure when saw beichael thought be lost what have be doing with day be going out with cyril please go just yet be just beginning to rain want to practise duet with will ' looking up in cyril face with one of bright smile can not time please keep cyril hardly knew what said pushed by a stood there smiling with music in hand went out bareheaded into rain darkness audrey looked bewildered 'what doe mean be ill have anything happened be so white have forgotten hat have never left like before oh michael do call back must speak to ' ' can not think something be troubling let go audrey will tell everything by by ' michael snatched up hat cyril hurried after a fast a halting gait permitted cyril have not gone far be standing by gate quite motionless hair face be wet with heavy rain michael took by arm walked on with must see safely to room charge mr blake not to go near must have time be simply stunned incapable of thought now said to a piloted through dark wet street biddy admitted gave searching glance a entered cyril disordered condition must have told everything for put wrinkled claw like hand on arm with warning gesture ' let mistress see like mr cyril avick will fright to death go up softly will hear ' biddy warning be in vain staircase be badly lighted made false stumbling step next moment mr blake came out on landing sight of two men together seemed to transfix with horror 'you have told oh heaven have told ' cried in despairing voice cyril raised heavy eye looked at did not speak passed a have passed audrey went up to room heard door close heavily behind ' will go to how dare detain captain burnett will go to son ' michael took notice of angry remonstrance hand be on arm very gently firmly made enter drawing room bers blake will listen to for moment 'no will not listen ' answered passionately bosom began to heave ' will go to make speak to did see how looked at mother a have never looked at in life ' unhappy woman broke into tear sob 'oh boy boy let go to captain burnett will bless a long a live let go kneel to if must do think boy will see mother at foot not forgive 'he will forgive mr blake returned michael in pitying voice must give time can not speak to now can speak to one be simply stunned give promise that will not see to night ' 'impossible will make such promise be son not yours if can not speak to can at least take hand tell that be sorry ' 'he will not be able to hear a far a can tell have taken nothing in news have simply crushed if will give time will pull together must not answer for consequence if persist in seeing to night be not there must be word said that ought never to be uttered mr blake do be persuaded be speaking for sake a well a 'you be always so hard moaned from manner thought must not disobey have managed to frighten 'you will be wise if take advice ' returned moving away from door be going to now will not stay be above thing necessary that must be alone 'will speak to for will tell that heart be nearly broken with cold reproachful look of will at least say captain burnett ' ' think must be better not to mention name to to night ' then threw back on couch in hysterical outburst michael thought useless to stay with found biddy outside a usual sent in to do best for mistress then went up to cyril room found sitting on edge of bed window be wide open rain be driving in have already wetted carpet candle someone have lighted be guttering in draught michael closed window then looked at fireplace there be plenty of fuel at hand cyril often worked in own room now then mother care have provided with fire room felt cold damp there be match at hand michael have scruple in lighting fire now crackle of wood seemed to rouse cyril 'why do do that there be need ' said irritably 'pardon there be need do know coat be wet blake must change at once cyril only gave impatient shrug let see change before go ' persisted actually have way perhaps because cyril be anxious to get rid of 'now be going only want to say one word blake will be safe to night mother will not come near ' then look of relief crossed cyril wan face will at least have peace for few hour if can help in way have only to speak will remember that ' 'thank ' ' mean there be have got to say god bless a grasped cyril hand there be faint response michael crept down a softly a must a passed drawing room door must hear mr blake hysterical sob biddy soothing 'the nemesis have come ' said to then went into lower room where found mollie kester reading over fire let disturb ' said hurriedly a sprang up to greet beollie brother wish to be quiet to night have just heard something trouble good deal have desired that one must go near if be must take notice at what be to do about supper ' returned mollie with housewifely anxiety 'we have nice supper cyril will be so cold hungry shut up in room have made big fire because be going to spend evening with ' have fire too be very wet room felt damp so lighted might take up tray to presently put outside door perhaps cup of nice hot coffee 'ah will go make at once mamma will have too mollie ran off in usual impetuous manner kester sat still in place 'what be matter captain burnett ' asked anxiously 'we heard mother cry just now saying that cyril must not speak to mollie heard quite plainly so did ' 'you will know in good time dear boy returned michael laying hand on kester shoulder ' ask more just now ' kester looked at wistfully be trained to self discipline asked more michael went back to woodcote be just dinner time gong sounded before be ready made easy excuse slipped into place began to talk to dr ross about new swimming bath be being built be first topic came handy to dr ross at once followed lead subject lasted until end of dinner audrey be unusually silent of made remark on gravity now then michael addressed observation to answered briefly without interest went into schoolroom for prayer a usual audrey played harmonium a be following mr ross back into drawing room audrey tapped on arm go in there just yet michael want to speak to ' then suffered very reluctantly to be detained by hall fire began in rather peremptory tone ' can not understand either cyril to night be very strange think cyril leaf without word go out looking like ghost tell that something be troubling yet of vouchsafes one word of explanation ' can not help audrey be not affair blake be in hurry must have seen that for ' 'he be very extraordinary in behaviour so be of course if choose to answer michael will just send note across to cyril tell must see at once ' must hardly do that if be ' 'not write to ' in offended voice beally michael be too mysterious why border on absurdity cyril be in trouble in one breath tell that then must prevent writing to ask to come to will certainly write to ' 'will go to father instead have just gone into study then audrey looked at with intense astonishment have father got to do with ' 'never mind ' returned michael slowly 'go to dr ross ask why blake be in trouble will tell may take word for ' audrey still gazed at be grave manner left in doubt a to seriousness of matter eye looked little troubled dear ' repeated gently 'it will be best for to hear from ' then left without word went straight to study seemed a though father expected for looked at a came slowly towards put out hand have come to talk to darling sit down beside not that chair be too far off come closer to child ' then a audrey obeyed felt sense of growing uneasiness what did sorrowful tenderness in father voice mean for moment courage failed lip must not frame question have come to ask 'you want to tell about cyril trouble ' then sat gazed at in speechless dread dr ross cleared throat shifted spectacle began to find task difficult only knew how to prepare audrey can think of word will break force of such shock will tell one thing few hour ago cyril be a ignorant of great trouble have befallen a be at present moment touched with hand have grown suddenly very cold 'wait for one minute father must ask something did michael tell thing to cyril afternoon ' 'yes dear by strange chance michael be put in possession of terrible secret there be one else to break to poor fellow a know mike be not man to shirk unpleasant duty understand may go on now father dear be prepared be quite prepared know be light trouble brought look on cyril face michael too be very strange unlike then composed to listen dr ross told story a carefully a must made attempt to soften fact skilful surgeon cut deep patient may quiver under relentless knife present pain will prevent lasting injury dr ross wished daughter to see thing from point of view be impossible to spare suffering be young hoped time own strong sense of duty must bring own healing must not judge of effect on almost at first word have dropped head upon knee face be hidden from though hand rested on soft hair made sign movement 'that be have to tell darling one know michael have not told mother thought best to wait ' then stirred little uneasily under caressing hand bey own child need to be told how grieve for cyril be bitter disappointment to ' voice dropped little 'you must give up ' there be perceptible start only a said audrey raised face from knee looked at be very pale eye be quite dry only firm beautiful lip trembled little understand father why must give up ' 'why dr ross must hardly believe ear a heard bey child ' said with touch of sternness 'it be very easy to understand cyril be not to blame be a innocent a be son of matthew o'brien can never be son in law ' returned slowly ' suppose not ought not to be surprised to hear say that ' 'it be what father must say audrey ' be for to say if think right be for to obey ' then put arm round with endearing word two be good obedient child dearly loved daughter who have never grieved in life ' trust may never grieve ' replied gently there be great solemnity in eye if tell must not marry cyril will be compelled to obey will break heart to think that mind be fully made up on point ' bey darling be very young in time ' stopped arrested by strangeness of look think that will get over be meaning be not be afraid be wrong cyril love too well must never get over ' dear ' will listen to for moment need not fear must ever disobey be father be enough will live in hope that will change mind ' child must forbid that hope can not let cheat with such false supposition mind will know change in matter ' 'then in case will never marry cyril if can not give blessing on marriage will remain a be audrey ross father will never give up never never ' cyril be man think will give up audrey will be far too proud honourable to hold to engagement ' may be answered little wearily know strong pressure will be put on will have difficulty with will do a wish poor cyril how can do otherwise same will be true to a long a live will feel that belong to ' darling do be sensible when engagement be broken off will be free utterly free ' shook head ' will never be free while cyril life father understand may set free to morrow will still consider bound when come here will tell so think will misunderstand ' dr ross sighed here be unexpected difficulty must obey must regard a victim of filial obedience must not marry lover without consent must have nothing to say to other man must consider fettered by hopeless betrothal have declined to accept son of matthew o'brien a son in law must not own death set free to fulfil engagement dr ross groaned within a thought of if only must bring to reason at first word of pleading eye filled with tear can bear more have made very unhappy have promised not to marry without consent one on earth must make give up ' then looked at very sorrowfully said more if have thrown into arm must almost have wept with must ever know how heart bled for only kissed very quietly be not angry with father ' 'angry with oh audrey child how can ask question 'that be well ' returned calmly 'there must never be anything between must not bear that ' then breast heaved little large tear stole down face tell mother michael what have said that will never give up ' then walked very slowly out of room hour later michael came into study did not speak doctor shook head a came silently towards 'it be bad business mike that girl of mine will give trouble be a good a gold will give trouble ' behe refuse to give up ' michael sat down a asked question strength seemed to have deserted be what say that will regard a altogether bound to be very firm with goodness sweetness audrey have strong will 'do mean that will still marry ' 'not unless will give consent mike be dutiful child will never give to man without parent blessing approval will not marry anyone else then there be curious fixed look on michael face ' be not surprised dr ross audrey be too generous to forsake man when be in trouble will not think of never doe whole heart will be set on thought of giving comfort must not try to change resolution must be useless ' 'the deuce take ' returned doctor irritably there will be peace of mind for of mike ' dr ross voice be hardly a clear a usual suppose must just go have out with emmie there be nothing like getting unpleasant job over geraldine can put head together have better keep harcourt away from doctor stalked out of room with unwonted gloom on genial face michael did not follow sat still for few minute looking at doctor empty chair ' knew must have said audrey be just sort of woman will never give up whether love not a long a feel need poor blake poor fellow of two hardly think be one to be pitied will never find out for never never then booty scratched whined at door got up let in chapter xxxviii will comfort ' 'earth have nothing more tender than woman heart when be abode of piety ' dr ross have deferred telling wife for more than one reason dreaded effect on emotional nature above thing hated scene for once be agreeably disappointed mr ross received news more quietly than expected very suddenness force of shock made summon up womanly fortitude to bear such overwhelming misfortune first thought be for audrey must have gone to at once husband gently detained 'give time emmie have only just left will not be ready even for mother sit down again dear can not spare yet ' mr ross very reluctantly took seat again on couch talked little more mr ross wept a thought of poor dear boy a called for cyril have grown very dear to have begun to look on a own son seemed a though whole vial of wrath be to be emptied on head of mr blake at other time in different circumstance dr ross must have be amused at scathing invective be uttered by sweet tempered wife dear emmie must consider provocation think of woman being tied to feckless ne'er do well like matthew o'brien ' ' talk to john will not listen to be not wedded wife mother of child have not vowed to be faithful to for better for worse 'yes dear must allow be for worse ' 'that may be be bound to same by wifely duty might have saved instead of have be ruin how dare woman rob husband of own child forbid to lay claim to be false perjured wife exclaimed mr ross with rising excitement bey dear be not defending at least be to be pitied now ' think so be cyril kester mollie who be to be pitied for having such parent heart bleeds for not for what will become of how will poor boy bear life ' know emmie tell one thing agree with that audrey must not marry ' 'of course must not marry must geraldine percival say ' then doctor muttered 'pshaw 'why name be not blake at how must daughter of ours form connection with o'brien poor audrey now john must let go to time dr ross made objection be nearly midnight by time audrey have not thought of retiring to bed be sitting by toilet table with hand folded in lap mother appearance seemed to surprise 'dear mother why have come there be need no need at then a mother put arm round laid head on shoulder a though be conscious of sudden weariness mr ross eye be red with weeping audrey be still quite bright dry beother dear will be so tired ' doe that matter be father who be tired feel so terribly own darling what be to say to in awful trouble have come upon to beg to be brave for sake 'yes for too 'if must only bear for be what mother feel when child suffers if must only take from carry a own burden then girl gently pressed with arm 'that be what feel about ' returned there be pained look in eye a spoke be so young be so terrible pride will suffer heart mother will be comfort to if only have ' then did break down little soon recovered ' have be sitting here trying to find out why have be allowed to happen to think there be one so good except michael be very dreadful ' here shuddered slightly 'how will live out daily life not grow bitter over poor poor cyril bey darling be not thinking of at mother why must think of have father michael will all comfort who will comfort ' 'his heavenly father audrey ' yes be right do young men think a do cyril be good never speaks of thing be not like michael ' be trouble that taught michael ' 'yes know must fain have spared poor cyril such bitter lesson mother want to tell not to talk to mean michael gage percival must not bear a told father will never give up if go away must bid good bye if will write to will answer letter think father must approve of audrey child consider must not be better more for cyril good that must give up entirely 'no mother think so believe in heart that knowledge that be still true to will be only earthly comfort one know a do nature be very intense be almost a intense a michael be saying great deal love will let mother say one thing to that think be making grievous mistake that father think so too ' ' know mother pain to differ from in will never convince plighted troth to cyril because loved dearly nothing will change that love be quite true ' continued dreamily a though be following out train of habitual thought have often asked if loved in same way in other girl cared for lover a gage did for percival for example if mine be not too quiet matter of fact attachment have never be able to answer satisfactorily ' 'have not audrey ' mother dear of course be in confidence must be sacred to think be different from most girl have never wished to be married dear a cyril be to thought of wedding day have always oppressed have made unhappy sometimes because saw that shrank from ' mr ross felt quick sense of relief that almost amounted to joy be audrey in love with after have never heard girl talk so strangely what unutterable blessing must be to if be not utterly crushed by misfortune if future healing must be possible be careful not to express to daughter bey experience have be very different ' answered quietly bey happiest moment be in dear father spoke of future home think be quite a averse to long engagement a be ' ' can believe dear nature be not alike there be one thing on be agreed that engagement be almost a binding a marriage be ' correcting 'as long a two person love other 'it ought not to be binding under such circumstance audrey ' 'ought not ah there differ with want of enthusiasm absence of sentimentality will hold fast to cyril have never yet regarded a wife did not wish to so regard now will give up in thought wholly to pray god that knowledge will give comfort ' mr ross be silent felt that hardly understood daughter be a though have entered on higher ground where wrapping of sacred mist enveloped be not language of earthly passion sublime womanly abnegation be not even tender language of ruth widowed in affection cleaving with bounteous love faith to mother of young jewish husband thou goest will go yet inward cry of heart seemed to be like of honest tom o'brien 'the lord do so unto more also if ought death part thee ' one thought wholly possessed that might give comfort bey poor dear child if must only make feel differently then audrey laid hand gently on mother lip be old habit of hers when be child too much argument have proved wearisome let talk more be so tired so tired mother know be too 'will let stay with darling ' then audrey looked at trim little bed then at mother smiled 'there be room what can mean mother dear be not ill be never ill be ' 'thank god at least for be worse than ill be unhappy dear will let help to undress then sit by until feel can sleep audrey only shook head with smile 'there be need kiss mother bid good night will like to be with own self in darkness there kiss now go will be frozen audrey gently pushed to door must not let stop with john ' exclaimed mr ross a entered husband dressing room behe be very calm unnaturally so thought hardly cried at be thinking nothing of only of ' 'do know be one o'clock emmie ' returned husband rather shortly be tired sore poor man in mood to hear of daughter suffering deuce take woman said to fretfully a mr ross meekly turned away without word be certainly not alluding to wife when spoke 'from day of eve have always be in mischief other ' from may be deduced that mr ross be not so far wrong when thought husband be threatened with gout only malaise be more of mind be thinking of interview awaited on morrow must a lief cut off right hand a tell that must not have audrey said to a laid head on pillow now a michael lay awake through dark hour revolving many thing in uneasy brain occurred

of solitude of own society nevertheless told that amount of isolation must be preferable to penalty of hearing geraldine discus matter must hear in imagination clear sensible premise sound logical conclusion annotated by womanly lamentation over family disaster probable opinion of mr bryce mr charrington must be cited commented on in spite of very real sympathy with sister michael shrewdly surmised that knowledge that blake influence be waning must give large amount of comfort in future when crauford announced that lady be having tea in drawing room begged that cup might be sent up to

be light tap at door started to foot with quick exclamation of surprise a audrey entered have be thinking of at moment almost felt a though intensity of thought have attracted by unconscious magnetism glance at dispelled illusion be dressed for dinner noticed that there be air of unusual sombreness about attire a though felt that gaiety of apparel must be incongruous a came closer to be struck with paleness sadness in large gray eye said in low voice ' want to speak to hope be not interrupting ' 'you never interrupt ' returned quickly 'besides be doing nothing sit down dear then will talk more comfortably ' for noticed that spoke with air of lassitude be unusual to strong lithe figure swayed little a though with weakness 'do think must be here ' asked with grave concern look ill audrey a though ought to be resting in own room ' have be resting ' replied gently 'and then gage came to after thought have be idle long enough michael ' here lip quivered a though found difficult to maintain self control know have happened cyril have gone away have said good bye to look a though heart be broken have done must to comfort have told that will always be true to be not in power to help more ' 'dear audrey said for understood meaning well there be need for to speak more plainly 'it be not for to go to after parting a that presence of one dearest friend must be intolerable did not mean to

will be a solicitous for a though be brother will content ' must not easily forget look of gratitude answered 'god bless michael will not try to thank perhaps day stopped a though unable to say more 'oh said lightly crushing down dangerous emotion a spoke ' have done nothing to deserve thanks even if have not asked do think must have gone on own way like levite in parable left that poor fellow to

protestingly ' be not ill michael what doe matter where one eats one dinner be true be not hungry there be father why must make uncomfortable must think of other people always under circumstance seemed to be saying to herself more than to a though must remind herself of duty michael said more a followed downstairs told that other girl must have borne so bravely so sweetly under circumstance wondered at still more a sat opposite to at table saw quiet gravity with took part in conversation spoke word two about sister mentioned of own accord that have promised to bring leonard to see next day mean to call baby ' said be far too important personage did hear nurse speak of a master baby other day think gage must have given hint about ' then listened with air of interest a mother related

head 'one can not always be hungry mother dear said gently be evident that mother kindly notice did not please seemed still more distressed when father once rose from place to give wine do do ' asked with touch of impatience 'it be not for to wait on father michael must have filled glass quite easily 'you be paying very bad compliment audrey ' returned dr ross with smile be telling that be too much of old fogey to wait on lady mike be younger man of course if must prefer that must help to madeira ' father be not that be for to wait on must never never do for again ' somehow dr ross seemed to have answer ready a went back to chair when be alone with mother spoke still more plainly mr ross have persuaded to take corner of couch a stood by manipulating cushion adjusting more comfortably audrey turned round quickly took hold of hand do please sit down think have entered into conspiracy to night to kill with kindness ' 'we be so sorry for darling ' 'perhaps be sorry for myself be that reason why must be treated a though have lost use of limb want to behave to a usual will be far better for too why did not father michael talk politics instead of making little cut dried speech seemed to fit into nothing ' daresay found very difficult to talk at under circumstance sound a though have better have remained upstairs a michael suggested indeed must do so if will persist in regarding a skeleton at feast bey darling child how talk surely will allow parent to share sorrow ' mother be just what can not allow one will be burdened with trouble listen to dear think people make great mistake about mean to be kind be not true kindness be ready to give everything sympathy watchfulness attention withhold greatest gift of freedom solitude for sufferer craves 'do mean that be to leave alone audrey oh dear be hard saying for mother to hear ' be not too hard for mother ' returned audrey caressingly must have leave alone until recover must be treated a have always treated not a though

for of tell to night because be own dear mother such confidence be due after to night will not say again if father wish to help will be by allowing to feel that be still comfort then threw in mother arm 'tell father ' whispered 'and ask to give time one day perhaps will be more like old self must wait be too soon to expect much of yet ' ' will tell father be good dear child audrey will have way ' knew must understand after there be one like one mother ' then sighed mr ross knew where thought have wandered 'now for one evening will take advice rest will go up to room now to morrow ' stopped then said firmly 'to morrow everything will be a usual then gave cheek to mother kiss went up to room michael did not make appearance in drawing room night to booty secret rapture put on great coat

time must have felt when liege lady have given hazardous work quest to be sure there be special guerdon attached to man like michael burnett doe not need reward if must only give audrey peace of mind

surely intend to see father ' see necessity captain burnett father be nothing to to ' 'you be wrong returned michael warmly 'you be altogether wrong will let tell something ' then repeated substance

smile touched to heart stepped back from grave told that be ready somehow michael felt comforted by few word intuition knowledge of audrey character gave hope that after time must recover old elasticity now said to have so fully identified with that have simply have life of own sympathetic nature have reflected only thought feeling doubt whether have ever questioned a to love for have taken everything for granted now have lost thought of happiness seems to swallow up thought of own grief such unselfishness will bring own healing ' in way michael comforted about that evening audrey received message surprised greatly kester brought mother must see next day someone have told that audrey be going back to woodcote have at once expressed wish that must not leave without bidding good

saint doing knew mistress must come to sens heaven be praised for ' room be somewhat dark be not until audrey be quite close to mr blake that noticed change in have so shocked kester blackness of plain stuff gown unrelieved by whiteness may have made contrast of pale face more striking audrey noticed that dark hair be now streaked with gray have drawn back from face coiled tightly behind a though own appearance have ceased to interest sunken eye certain sharp look about cheekbone made seem at least ten year older with pity amounting to tenderness audrey must have put arm round mr blake drew back only suffered to kiss cheek mr blake ' interrupted ' call that again said hastily 'there have be enough of deception lie name be olive o'brien a long a remain in world wish to be called by name ' then audrey gazed at in speechless consternation what must strange speech portend sit down ' continued at same time seating in high backed chair stood beside bed crucifix lay on little table beside with framed photograph of cyril that always carried about with from time to time looked at a spoke told that be going back to rutherford must not let go without bidding good bye 'it must have made very unhappy if have not allowed to see ' ' can not believe that of course mean for truth be why boy loved because be so absolutely true ' voice sank into whisper gloomy light came into eye 'that be why mother disappointed why lost trust in because falsehood be easier to than truth ' 'but not now dear mr blake nay must call by old name what doe matter between two if have sinned if wrong doing seems heavy burden can at least repent ' have repented ' said in voice so strange thrilling that audrey felt inwardly troubled 'in hour of darkness by boy coffin have humbled before maker have craved to expiate sin audrey listen to ' continued ' have sent for because loved cyril because for few month made happy be idol be why have be taken from because forgot god truth sinned for sake ' 'yes be sorry now ' 'what doe such sorrow avail except for own purging in little while world cruel hard outer world will know more be going back to ireland with mollie biddy when have made peace with church

now in desolation mean to shelter in bosom of holy mother church receives penitent will not refuse ' 'but child mollie must forsake mollie pleaded audrey with tear in eye 'must neglect sacred responsibility for duty one must demand of mother 'be fit to discharge responsibility returned in cold hard voice anyone cyril ever kept straight do think mollie must go on living same old life without audrey know what say such existence must rob of reason ' what will become of mollie ' asked audrey concealing alarm at wild speech must not only think of ' beollie will go with ' returned ' will not forsake convent propose to enter have home attached to where educate girl belonging to upper class mollie will have plenty of companion nun be kind woman will not coerce in way there will be sufficient for maintenance ' 'but when grows up when education be finished what will become of then mr blake did not seem clear on point convent have boarder remarked with superior permission mollie might still remain there lead tolerably happy life 'there will be other young lady will not be dull went on 'the rule be strict one be why chose must be allowed to see sometimes perhaps too may turn catholic then will be well audrey honest nature revolted against merciless arrangement saw clearly that mr blake weak excitable nature have be under strong influence though be not until later that heard that during last few month have secretly attended roman catholic chapel near doubtless biddy who be stanch romanist have connived at now have planned strange expiation for herself poor mollie must be sacrificed what must cyril have thought of such unnatural arrangement for cyril sake for mollie audrey felt must combat notion blake ' said very earnestly 'it be not for to question action with regard to yourself if be at heart roman catholic if year have be unprofessed member of church may be a well for to acknowledge openly believe that convent life be free from trial temptation human nature be same everywhere even sanctified human nature be liable to error wiser people than must tell that peace of mind must be more surely attained by remaining in path of duty dear mr blake forgive if pain must ' hesitated moment 'must not cyril have disapproved of mother taking such step ' think not ' be response boy eye be purified now must judge differently will devote remainder of life to praying for repose of soul in repentance for miserable past may be here lifted clasped hand faint light came into eye heaven may release from misery before many year be over purified soul may be allowed to find rest ' grant may find poor misguided woman ' be secret prayer merely said aloud 'we must live out life a long a divine will ordains mr blake must speak of mollie if will sacrifice have right to sacrifice for cyril sake let have 'you audrey 'yes have not be like sister month think cyril must love to know be with be so fond of mollie liked to see together will make happier to have when michael be away have companion really mean ' asked mr blake in astonished voice 'you be very good audrey be not own mistress dr ross must never consent to arrangement have own money one must be put to expense for mollie unless wished to provide for ' ' must certainly wish that ' 'then in case there will be difficulty at know father too well to fear refusal from will go back to south audley street speak to mother to morrow will know answer must promise one thing before go that if consent will let have mollie behe will be happier with than in convent replied mr blake in musing tone 'after must have be dull existence for poor child ' there be touch of motherliness in voice a spoke will have think boy must have wished ' audrey grateful kiss sealed compact there be something else must say continued mr blake when have talked little more about mollie at least audrey have talked ' want to give mat message from ' ber o'brien ' husband have not told have humbled to dust before leave world must make peace even with will give message ' 'assuredly will ' 'tell have repented at last must fain have forgiveness that know now that have right to rob of child if time came over again how can tell whether thing must have be different mat must always have be mat must not alter own nature oh if have only be good like audrey ' sighed bitterly 'you must not talk more observed audrey alarmed by look of utter exhaustion on wan face leave now to rest little best audrey never forgot tone in unhappy woman uttered word can one rest on pillow of thorn time be too short must be up about work will bid good bye now after to day will not meet again will write to about mollie interview have exhausted must husband strength ' 'if must only comfort ' sad yearning in audrey voice seemed to touch mr blake a girl clung to pressed to bosom bless for goodness to to day live will pray for ' voice broke with sudden impulse kissed again again then pushed gently from 'go go ' said faintly 'and send biddy to ' audrey dared not linger looked quite white shaken when rejoined michael must scarcely speak to mollie seemed relieved when cousin told that hansom be at door soft autumnal breeze seemed to refresh after little while be able to tell michael have passed between mr blake michael took very coolly seemed to have fully expected something of kind soul will always be true to herself ' observed be singular how unbalanced pleasure loving nature lean towards asceticism how rapidly pas from one extreme to even repentance be not free from selfishness must free from maternal responsibility a freed from marriage vow under mistaken notion of expiating sinful past will labour under delusion that ill conceived sacrifice will be pleasing to almighty 'yes be great mistake returned ' very great mistake longer live audrey more marvel at way people deceive name of religion cloak hidden selfishness to extent must hardly credit majority be too much engrossed in trying to save own soul to care what becomes of other people one must think be save devil take hindmost when one see so called christian scurrying along narrow way a call without thought to brother sister who have fallen beside ' 'it be very grievous ' returned audrey sadly 'what must poor cyril have said to expiation michael interview with mother have tried more than anything think hardest thing in life be when see love turn down wrong path when entreaty will induce to retrace step 'it be sight one see day ' be michael reply then a saw how jaded weary be began to tell about kester after talked of mollie when audrey found that michael approved of plan be a anxious a be that mollie must accompany to woodcote began to discus subject with old animation by time drive be over harassed look have passed away from face chapter xlviii on michael bench 'what can give thee back o liberal princely giver who have brought gold purple of thine heart unstained untold laid out outside of wall for such a to take leave withal in unexpected largesse mr browning dr ross wife listened very kindly to daughter project indeed if audrey have expressed wish to establish small colony of street arab at end of woodcote garden mr ross must have offered objection to scheme audrey must have ruled mother a well a ever geraldine have ruled be too generous to exert influence mother must have refused nothing from morning to night one thought be how might console child will be such companion for audrey john suggested when for one moment husband have hesitated ' be thinking about matthew o'brien replied 'brail be rather too near people will talk will leak out in time that o'brien be mollie father ' 'will that matter ' interposed michael 'talk will not hurt anyone think can answer for o'brien be last man to lay claim to own child brother tell that be perfectly content if see from time to time kester often writes to be never tired of reading letter mollie kester have grown quite fond of ' ' think must be kept quiet for mollie sake ' returned dr ross judgment matthew o'brien be very unfit person to take care of girl approaching womanhood brother be old may outlive wish to be hard on seems to very irresponsible sort of person when mollie be of age will of course judge for herself until then friend will be wise not to give up to father guardianship ' will never claim ' replied michael dryly will quote own word irresponsible person be only too glad to evade responsibility mollie may live at woodcote quite safely visit to brail will be taken a matter of course of people know o'brien be least likely to chatter about private concern matthew o'brien will be too thankful that daughter must enjoy such privilege to wish to rob of ' will make so happy to have whispered audrey in father ear then doctor eye glistened with tenderness 'it will be a wish dear ' said very gently beollie will come mother be very fond of so be will have daughter emmie ' continued looking at wife with kind smile so matter be settled poor mollie be horrified when heard what have escaped idea of convent be terrible to 'oh dear miss ross ' exclaimed can mamma do anything so dreadful will be miserable quite miserable of course must not like living with only biddy must have fretted ill to be nun say prayer day long poor poor mamma mollie eye grew round with misery 'dear mollie mother think know best one can control perhaps if doe not like if life be too hard will come out at end of novitiate ' view of case seemed to comfort mollie little 'and be really to live at woodcote at dear beautiful place continued miss ross seems too good to be true 'yes be to be little sister returned audrey tranquilly 'but mollie will not be called miss ross longer if live with must call audrey ' mollie promised that must mollie said very little about parting interview with mother cried bitterly for hour afterwards poor mamma oh what must cyril say exclaimed over over again be long time before anyone must comfort michael went down with to woodcote remained with for next month two cyril sudden death have occurred first week in october tree in woodcote garden be glorious in autumnal livery of red golden brown while day careful hand swept up fallen leaf from shrubbery path michael resumed old habit when audrey wanted be always ready to walk drive with one knew effort cost to appear a usual when day passion gained stronger mastery over dearly a have loved in youthful brightness have never loved a did now when saw in uncomplaining sadness fulfilling daily duty devoting to mollie geraldine used to look at with tear in eye behe be sweeter than ever never knew anyone so good ' said to husband mr harcourt have assented to very cordially a for mr ross before many week be over have drawn down on maternal head more than one reproof from daughter audrey said to one day 'have forgotten what once told that be not to be so kind to be spoiling dreadfully give way in everything when say anything ought not to say contradict be growing demoralised be michael fault if get more selfish day selfish darling ' 'yes selfish stupid a idle a possible yet never scold ask to do anything for ' 'you be always doing something audrey be busy from morning till night michael say work far too hard 'but must work be duty to work ' returned little restlessly 'and mother must help not spoil when see gage looking at with tear in eye trouble to see want to be happy want everything to go on a usual mean to be happy too then went away gave mollie music lesson when be over went in search of michael michael knew be necessary to that in certain restless mood be able to soothe so stayed manfully at post until after christmas with new year resumed bohemian life spending two three week at south audley street then running down to woodcote for few day felt be wiser to do so must leave more comfortably now be better in way drooped le visibly smile became more frequent constant society of mollie intercourse with fresh girlish mind be evidently beneficial must do now without told a went back to lodging need no longer put force on 'until can speak until time have come for to open heart to be better that must be apart that audrey held different opinion be evident must not always conceal disappointment when michael brief visit became briefer more infrequent 'it be that troublesome money said once when one spring morning stood waiting for dog cart to take to station course woodcote doe not content now want house of own to be own master well be perfectly natural ' added quickly have always be own master returned quietly a for house be so fond of talking about seems still in cloud a far a be concerned neither have once visited wardour street ' have be very slow about ' replied smiling 'you be never in hurry to posse good thing michael have often envied patience ' then mare trotted round corner 'there be old saying that come round to who wait do think be true audrey did not wait for answer a climbed up into driving seat took rein then lifted hat to with rather sad smile 'yes have waited long time will not come yet then touched mare little smartly next moment be trotting briskly towards gate have looked so sad ' wondered a went back to mollie have not seemed like week now have gone 'if only knew how much want think must not go away so often ' said to herself a sat down to correct mollie french exercise be in early day of june that michael paid one of flying visit to rutherford a drove through green lane with sweet summer breeze just stirring leaf suddenly remembered that cyril have lain in quiet grave just eight month hardly knew why thought have occurred to for have be pondering far different subject 'eight month have idea that have be so long ' said to 'time pass more quickly a one grows older if live to end of year will be nine thirty wonder feel sober middle aged man ' reflection be hardly exhilarating be glad when woodcote be in sight 'you need not drive in fenton said to groom 'take mare round to stable will walk up to house ' garden of woodcote looked lovelier than ever afternoon thought a walked slowly up terrace tender green of foliage gay tint of lilac laburnum pink white horse chestnut made gorgeous background here guelder rose thrust soft puffy ball almost in face while white shimmering leaf of maple contrasted superbly with dark veined leaf of copper beech dr ross have always prided on rare tree shrub indeed other garden in rutherford must compete with ground of woodcote long lawn stretched below terrace be kept free from daisy be a smooth a velvet lad be playing tennis there now young lady in gray dress be sitting under clump of lilac watching for moment michael hesitated thinking be stranger a beckoned to sudden gleam came into eye hastily crossed lawn have be waiting for be little late michael said a shook hand with beollie have gone out with mother asked to take place ' stood looking at there be strangely pleased expression on face ' did not know ' said in low voice ' thought be strange young lady sitting on bench be suppose touched gown a spoke audrey coloured remark evidently pained ' left off black gown yesterday ' replied hurriedly found out that troubled father though be too kind to tell so be gage who spoke to said that be pity to wear so long ' ' see that gage have right to speak to be affair not hers there be trace of sharpness in michael tone light have faded out of eye after there be cause for to rejoice have not left off mourning of own accord what fool have be of course have only done to please father 'no be kind of to speak after what doe matter father seemed so relieved when put on can remember cyril without help of black gown be better to please other people than to please one self after first moment did not mind boy be so noisy ' continued in ordinary manner a though be not willing to discus subject more fully behall go to michael bench booty be making for direction a usual pond be so pretty afternoon ' like ' returned little moodily strange to say little episode of dress have upset equanimity must not at once regain old calmness have ever gown become so well wondered with exaggeration natural to lover have spray of laburnum in hand sunshine seemed to thread brown hair with gold seemed to a though there be softer look in gray eye a though return be very welcome to beichael ' said suddenly a stood watching eiderdown snowflake a came sailing proudly up pond in majesty of unruffled feather booty a usual pattered to water edge to bark at until be hoarse 'what be that hear about going away father tell that have made sort of plan for ' bey money be burning hole in purse see ' returned picking up dry twig from ground proceeding seemed to drive booty frantic with excitement ' be beginning to realise responsibility a man of property a of course first duty be to look after number one ' must not allow to finish beichael will come sit down how can talk properly while be picking up stick for booty ' then followed to bench instead of seating leaned lazily against baby willow ' be going abroad with dick abercrombie said a though be mentioning everyday occurrence know how often have planned tour in switzerland italy have never be able to carry out now can combine duty pleasure ' 'where doe duty lie michael ' did not smile a put question struck that looked little dull with dick of course ' returned quickly know poor fellow be terribly out of health father be very anxious about have be over working fancy there be sort of love affair a well at least doctor hinted a much anyhow be to strike work for six month a wanted travelling companion offered humble service 'but will not be away that time ' asked with visible anxiety month be not so very long be ' returned coolly 'and see how will work out plan even in time be to do switzerland thoroughly to spend at least month in engadine then there be swiss tyrol italian lake afterwards rome florence venice naples if dick tire of throw up can still keep on alone want to do thing properly for once in life have even thought of greece holy land following spring ' again interrupted time saw pained look in eye will leave for time will let come back alone go on by oh michael what will do without be more necessary to than ever now ' so seldom thought of herself that speech took by surprise there be tone of reproach in voice a though thought unkind for leaving michael be not ordinary calm self afternoon for month have dreaded to find alone with now very sweetness of loving reproach seemed too much for ' man be not always master of cyril have once said at moment michael felt that be no longer possible for to be silent must bear more will stay away said in strangely suppressed voice 'because be only right for to do so because be duty to leave ' 'your duty to leave ' faltered michael why ' 'do wish to tell ' said looking at fully a stood opposite to there be gleam in keen blue eye that made suddenly avert face 'be possible that year have not known what have be to that have not guessed love ' then for first time in life shrank from do mean ' said helplessly 'we have always loved other have be like own brother michael ' 'then can be brother no longer ' returned passionately 'from child have be far dearer to never remember time since be subaltern did not love love have grown year 'do mean that cared for a cyril cared even a asked question saw that face be suffused with burning blush ' do mean from child have be one woman in world to only one wished to make wife ' then covered face with hand must see that be trembling from head to foot 'it be too soon ' heard say 'it be terribly soon knew shock of discovery be very great 'it be not too soon ' said sitting down beside trying to draw away hand dearest can not bear must not shrink from so misunderstand be asking for nothing surely be not afraid of of michael ' think be afraid of ' whispered michael if be true can not can not believe why have never told before why have let then stopped a though sob impeded utterance ' be never in position to tell so ' returned with old gentleness 'for year doubted whether must ever be well enough to marry do think must have condemned wife even if must have won to life of nursing be far too proud to demand sacrifice of woman then be poor man audrey ' did that matter ' replied with touch of scorn in voice 'cyril be poor too 'you must not think blame if say be very different men be prouder than knew generous nature too well to take advantage of when money came be too late be engaged to have only to hide pain so that must not be made unhappy by thought be bad actor never guessed secret must not have guessed now 'how must ' returned simply ' be only thinking of cyril 'yes be thinking of now be a much rival now be dead a when be living be why be going away because can bear no longer ' go ' audrey voice sank so that must hardly hear faint word perhaps did not know what implied be too shaken miserable that michael own dear michael must have suffered year that have never known cyril be in grave no longer needed what did matter if idea of man wooing so soon gave pain if must only comfort michael happily for michael guessed at secret thought a caught word flush mounted to brow 'yes must go said firmly 'it be best only chance in absence will think of more kindly old michael who be friend faithful devoted friend will unconsciously blend with new michael who know be lover there ' continued in pained voice speak word shrink again from yet be asking nothing dear if be to promise moment that must be wife if be to tell that must try to love a wish to be loved must not marry though be dearer to than anything in life must not marry ' 'do not wish to try then asked rather bewildered by strange wooing be because cyril be young that have never feared a feared michael there be quiet power about that in spite of gentleness seemed to subdue though be very pale there be fire in eye that made unwilling to look at yes be indeed new michael one must hardly understand 'certainly wish ' replied quickly 'can love come by trying ' must not answer 'any such love must not content ' went on ' must have heart none forgive if say one thing audrey believe that poor blake have not that have to give have thought more than once love for be so great that yours must hardly equal nay dear did not mean to hurt by saying ' for be weeping now 'you be goodness to ' ' loved be sure loved ' said little piteously for michael word seemed to touch sore spot how often since cyril death have blamed for not loving more more than once excessive tenderness have wearied must have be content with le have be in hurry to shorten engagement thought of resigning maidenly freedom have always be distasteful to must be possible that michael be right that there be something defective in love loved blake have often told that be angel of goodness to missed nothing may be sure of audrey can not help nature must ask more than ever did ' then head drooped knew that answer be possible beo know why be going away now rose again stood before 'because under circumstance must no longer be possible for to be together at least must not be possible for will leave to question own heart let speak truly perhaps say will be so perhaps may find that be more to than think if time ever come will send for ' beend for ' 'yes be true to own noble self own honest nature be true to need not say many word just michael come will be enough to bring from very end of earth 'but will come before will not wait for such word though gave special answer to saw by face that must wait 'but will write michael will not leave then hastily substituted 'us complete silence may be away six month whole year may even be longer ' 'yes may be longer returned now be who be calmer of two 'it be impossible for of to tell now how long exile may last will write not often perhaps may not even speak of have passed between will write will find difficulty in answering letter when have said looked at very kindly then without word walked to house chapter xlix heart plead for ' 'we be apart yet day by day bade heart more constant be bade keep world away grow home for only thee fear 'd thy love likewise grew like mine day more tried more true matthew arnold audrey never knew how got through rest of day during remainder of michael visit seemed in uneasy dream never before in life have be oppressed by such painful self consciousness freedom of speech be impossible to spoke with reluctance felt a though word be weighed in inward balance more than once mother asked if be well happily michael be not present to see how blood rushed to face a framed evasive answer must not have told mother whether be ill well only knew moral earthquake have shattered old illusion that be looking out at changed world be conscious through that michael watchfulness care shielded from observation that be for ever throwing into breach when unusual effort be required once when sister mr harcourt be present challenged to game of whist that audrey might leave place at piano very likely have heard slight quaver in voice that told song tried audrey longed to thank a stole out into summer dusk wandered down path between tall sentinel lily gleamed so ghostly white in darkness with thought for be never alone with for moment until last day came went to morning room to wish good bye be tending fern took off gardening glove at once a came up to 'you be going michael will see again before really start ' said with attempt at cheerfulness shook head ' think not abercrombie have just written to say that dick want to get away week earlier will not be down here again ' something choking seemed to rise in audrey throat if life have depended on must not have got out word michael saw troubled look in eye seemed to ask again that question beust go ' 'yes dear must go replied gently 'it be better for better for far far better for ' a still looked at without speaking drew towards kissed cheek be with dearest said very tenderly 'think of a kindly a can let heart plead for ' next moment be gone audrey stood rooted to spot felt a though nightmare oppression be on heard father voice calling to 'where be audrey ' said must bid michael good bye then someone michael perhaps answered great longing be on to see again a hesitated wheel of dog cart sounded on gravel knew that be too late with sudden impulse leant out of window michael be looking back at house saw raised hat have just time to wave hand a dr ross drove rapidly through gate when mother came to find be still standing there looked very pale pained wistful look be still in eye said have left now michael have gone too world seems different place to ' beichael will come back darling ' replied mr ross vaguely troubled by look on girl face 'your father say have long wanted thorough change trip will do so much

nature be having revenge will be better presently darling ' be right audrey strong will sense of duty soon overcame hysterical emotion think be tired ' acknowledged to mother relief consented to lie still hing ' will make up for idle day to morrow ' said with faint smile a closed eye 'now go downstairs mother dear trouble about more unless want to make ashamed of for having be baby behe be just worn out with keeping everything to herself trying to spare pain ' mr ross said to husband a recounted little scene to ' never knew audrey hysterical before be obliged to give sal volatile think be asleep now ' ' hold with sal volatile returned doctor little grimly beleep be far safer remedy emmie leave to herself will be right in day two ' dr ross sighed a got up went to study audrey little knew that father be in secret that in pain perplexity michael have at last taken best friend into confidence must leave thing to work round ' have be parting word to michael that morning 'no one not even father must coerce year have be like son to mike if child must bring to love a deserve to be loved one must be better pleased than must be 'and will tell one not even cousin emmeline ' 'why must not dare tell ' returned doctor with rather dejected smile for hated to keep thing from wife must get hold of then must come round to harcourt will keep own counsel mike now good bye good luck to ' 'it be burnett motto ' replied michael with touch of solemnity in voice 'good luck god send take care of cousin john then two men grasped hand parted 'if have to search whole world over for husband for 'd choose mike ' be dr ross thought a drove back again to woodcote audrey kept promise made up for one idle day be good for everyone ' said 'and be especially good for ' so following morning resumed lesson with mollie have complained few week before german be becoming rusty by father advice mollie be taking lesson together of herr freiligrath master have selected be very strict one lesson entailed great deal of preparation discipline must have be more wholesome audrey forgot perplexity while translated wallenstein followed unhappy fortune of max theckla did not at once regain cheerfulness daily round of duty be not performed without great deal of effort inward prompting if task be left unfulfilled if be always ready to give mother geraldine companionship needed if father never missed one of usual ministration be because must listen to plea of self indulgence 'you be unhappy fear must be unhappy not at ease for long time must say to herself in interval of work 'but idleness will not help ' to give due be never busier than during summer followed be leave taking have idea that michael knew be doing that father often wrote to michael have kept word letter to audrey be very few far between there be not word in that mother geraldine must not have read if have chosen to show be letter have always be sacred to still be impossible to answer with old freedom happy sisterly intercourse be now thing of past must no longer pour out to friend innocent girlish thought barrier strange unnatural barrier have be built up between audrey letter with painstaking effort gave very little pleasure to michael 'poor child be still afraid of ' thought a folded up thin paper must not always suppress sigh a missed old playfulness open hearted affection used to breathe in carelessly worded sentence knew that must not help that be impossible for now to tell how missed how heavily day passed without how must know if thought le of cyril more of day michael must not guess at inward self questioning that seemed for ever making dumb utterance in breast now then when one needed must wander down to beichael bench ' in dusk moonlight go over strange conversation again 'let own heart plead for ' have be parting word indeed seemed a though subtle influence be for ever bringing word to memory why have left must not have trusted to do even for have loved cyril have not wished to marry have wished to marry man be instinct of nature to make others happy not to think of if michael have wanted next moment sort of despair seized be not like cyril what have to give must not content in least must have heart none ' have said to eye seemed to dominate a spoke ' must ask more than did ' have not dared to answer must not deceive knew that kindness on part must ever wear in eye semblance of love wanted what must do for for 'can love come by trying ' have asked must recall vividly bitterness of tone a said speech over pondered most sometimes for hour together be very different one will leave ' have told there have be strange light in eye a spoke ' will leave to question own heart let speak truly perhaps say will be so perhaps may find that be more to than think if time ever come will send for ' 'what did mean by saying ' must ask did look seem to reproach pierce to heart how must know unless told be not fault have be so blind can not send for can not be too soon ' audrey did not finish sentence even under dark tree hot flush be scorching face be so tired of ' must say springing to foot with sudden quick impatience old tranquil life happy careless life be gone for ever cyril poor dear cyril be in grave now there be new lover with proud gentle wooing not old michael who have so satisfied new powerful michael who half drew half repelled for whom have fitting answer audrey be glad when august came must find relief in change of scene dr ross have taken large roomy cottage at keswick for summer holiday harcourts kester be to join audrey be thankful that father have not selected scotland a son in law have suggested made up mind in sensible way that a far a lay in power must enjoy a much a possible after time effort be not unsuccessful derwent water be in unusual beauty that year spell of warm sunny weather enabled to enjoy boating expedition on lake audrey liked to paddle mollie to one of island sit there reading working while kester percival fished geraldine roamed by lake side with bonnie boy sitting like young prince in little wheeled carriage beside there be long tailed shaggy pony belonging to cottage sturdy sure footed good tempered animal dr ross must often drive wife through of lovely dale mr ross never thoroughly enjoyed in boat have dislike to find surrounded by deep clear water much preferred chaise jemmy 'you be always goose emmie suppose be why married dr ross remarked a tickled up jemmy broad back with whip nevertheless doctor loved expedition quite a much a wife did 'what handsome darby joan look jerry ' mr harcourt once said a walked beside with leonard proudly seated on shoulder doubt if will make such good looking couple love in thirty year time ' mr harcourt be smiling in sly fashion a took sidelong glance at graceful wife geraldine be looking lovelier than ever in broad brimmed hat that husband have chosen for sad event happened soon after return to woodcote matthew o'brien died on anniversary of son death end have be very sudden one have suspected that for month insidious disease have be making stealthy progress have seemed much a usual have made complaint only mr baxter have remarked to father that uncle mat seemed quieter like more peaceable 'he have given up wearisome prowl of take more kindly to chimney corner a said one evening mat put pipe down silently before be half smoked went off to bed next day complained of pain drowsiness prissy cooked of mess soothing posset made much of a lay on pillow looking idly out on october sunshine next day a pain drowsiness did not diminish very wisely suggested that doctor must be sent for a dr foster stood beside asking question rather gravely sudden thought came into mat mind looked into doctor eye little solemnly need not be afraid to tell doctor ' said sadly bey life have not be much good to will not be sorry to part with ' doctor answer be kindly evasive two three night afterwards a thomas o'brien be sitting beside bed for hour to relieve prissy mat stretched out lean arm grasped brother coat sleeve 'it be coming tom ' said ' will soon be with boy be if god mercy will grant admittance to good place give love to mollie little chap tom old fellow god bless ' murmured something drowsily then again more clearly 'tell olive that be not to blame so much after have be too hard on poor girl must not help nature be there something about to whoever little be forgiven same loveth little seem to remember susie reading ' thomas o'brien bending over gray face repeated word slowly 'wherefore say unto sin be many be forgiven for loveth much ' mat interrupted have forgiven plenty lad too love for ' be matthew o'brien last word mat o'brien did not go unwept to grave in spite of unsatisfactory life brother mourned for long sincerely in way kester mollie grieved too at audrey wish mollie wrote full particular of father death to convent sister monica answer be in audrey opinion singularly suggestive of ci devant mr blake be strange medley of mysticism motherly yearning at end be touch of real honest feeling 'tell audrey that when pray for boy pray for too mollie think that mother forgets for perhaps may do better service now than ever did when be together think of sometimes child be glad that father spoke of so kindly can pray for now a never must when be living poor man be ill world to be out of now loving repentant mother beister monica mary ' audrey went over to brail constantly during autumn winter month followed be death sometimes mollie accompanied oftener be alone nothing cheered thomas o'brien more than society of favourite loved to talk to of dear one who have passed within veil to audrey visit be very soothing liked solitary walk under gray november sky when december sun hung redly behind distant hedgerow how often have walked there when cyril have met half way have come upon lingering in lane with zack bounding beside be in brail lane that first told of love when have

say be in fever to get back to england do think captain burnett will come too kester looked anxiously in face audrey must not satisfy kester on point nevertheless felt secret hope stirring in heart that michael must not stay away much longer after be likely that must wait for message when must know how impossible must be for to send have be away seven month by time must be growing homesick almost same thought occurred to michael a early in march sat in loggia of old florentine palace where friend have suite of room how long have be away wondered a looked out on sunset seven nay eight month a yet there have be no recall have really expected must not be a well to go back plead own cause see what month of absence have done for must wait little longer michael self imposed exile have not be unhappy companion be congenial to varied scene through have passed historic interest of city have engrossed interested perhaps for first time tasted delight of well filled purse a accumulated art treasure picture above latent hope to gave voice title kept patient cheerful 'it be too soon by by will find out for herself ' must say a strolled through gallery stood by moss grown fountain to buy flower from dark eyed florentine girl must go back with abercrombie next week must push on towards greece holy land be little difficult to decide somehow michael never answered that question fate took matter into own hand a often doe when knot becomes too intricate for bungling finger of poor mortal somehow audrey became convinced in own mind that michael must certainly accompany friend back to england have started together be likely that michael must allow to return alone when march came began to look anxiously for letter announcing intention be thinking of one afternoon a sat talking to mother be cold dreary day audrey have just remarked that one in rutherford must think of leaving fireside on afternoon when geraldine entered glowing from cold wind looking cosy comfortable in warm fur dear what day to venture out remonstrated mother audrey say wind be cruel ' be not such foe to east wind a michael be returned geraldine cheerfully a seated out of range of fire percival never like to cosset be why never take cold by bye heard something about michael little while ago just a be talking to mr charrington who must come in dora abercrombie know dora audrey be second one be not

lady love have turned restive now thing be smoother hoped that must soon be married poor michael be afraid have not have very cheerful companion month 'did miss abercrombie mention michael ' asked audrey speaking with manifest effort how tiresome gage be a though anyone wanted to hear about dick abercrombie love affair dear yes be worst part of returned geraldine with zest be always shown by bearer of bad news even by superior person like young mr harcourt ' have idea michael must play truant for so long actually say brother be coming home without be going to spend summer autumn in greece holy land perhaps winter in algiers in fact dick abercrombie say doe not know when mean to come back 'what be that say dear asked dr ross who entered room in time to hear last clause 'be speaking of michael ' 'yes father dear geraldine willingly recapitulated whole of speech for benefit do wish someone must write give good scolding for staying away so long a though one wanted have be missing so badly ' 'by bye reminds that be called away just now to speak to fergusson have actually left letter to michael open on study table meant to go by post do mind just slipping into envelope audrey be already directed thank dear a audrey silently left room be dr ross really anxious about letter have noticed white look on daughter face feared that others might notice too audrey never knew how long

perhaps long silence have angered michael who have always be so gentle to on whose face have never seen frown michael have grown weary of endurance have given up hope of winning oh if have only trusted if must only have believed that must have done very best to make happy how must be so cruel to to how must have heart to punish so bitterly a though be to blame must help nature more than must help separation from dearest friend then there came over deadly feeling of possible loss desolation too terrible to contemplate have mourned very tenderly for cyril if michael died if ill must befall in distant land must not bear ' be inward cry without michael must be impossible a thought flashed through mind eye suddenly fell on empty space at end of father letter with sudden impulse took up pen wrote three word across page in clear legible writing beichael come audrey ' be almost breathless with haste a thrust into envelope carried to boy who be waiting for letter then went back to drawing room for dare not trust to be alone moment what have done what must michael think of what must think of wonder geraldine looked at in surprise a crossed room took up work 'what time have be audrey

must not sleep properly morning afternoon evening be endless to mollie merry chatter seemed to jar on mother kindly commonplace remark seemed devoid of interest yet above thing dreaded to be alone be growing nervous for sudden sound unaccustomed footstep even clanging of door bell made start drove blood from heart must write must telegraph must hear one day that be on way home audrey be asking question morning noon night felt a though suspense must wear out in time if anyone have told audrey that for first time in life have symptom belong to certain well known disease that cold hot fit self distrustfulness new timidity be transforming into different audrey be only salient feature must have scouted idea very fiercely that be in love with michael that love for cyril be very dim shadowy sort of affection compared with love for michael thought must have utterly shocked yet be truth michael have always be more to than ever have guessed long absence have taught unmistakable fact that must not do without audrey struggled on a well a must through restless miserable day must not give in have never given in in life to passing tide of emotion must not be weak now morning after wakeful unrefreshing night braced to meet day duty read french german with mollie superintended practising only wandered off in dream when mollie scale exercise became too monotonous went up to hillside played with leonard in nursery though geraldine sharp eye discovered that something be amiss audrey be not in usual spirit have tact wisdom not to press for immediate confidence audrey be very grateful for forbearance audrey sturdy nature must brook self indulgence though march wind be cold brail lane deep in miry clay persisted in paying accustomed weekly visit to thomas o'brien mollie have cold so have established claim to remain by fireside audrey must listen to weak persuasion to ensconce comfortably in opposite easy chair on contrary put on thickest boot tucking up skirt braved wind mud even cold mizzle of rain on way back have reward for walk freshened in cheering old friend felt own spirit revive be in happier mood a let in shook out wet cloak be in far too disreputable state to present in drawing room besides be late must get ready for dinner ran upstairs lightly at top of staircase suddenly stopped a though have be turned to stone yet there be nothing very astonishing in fact that small brown dog with very short leg must be pattering in cheerful manner down corridor that must utter whine of friendly delighted recognition when saw audrey if stared at a though be ghostly apparition be not booty fault next moment have caught up have darted with into own room booty booty ' gasped a little animal licked pale face in most feeling manner think have come booty if application of warm tongue must have given comfort assurance audrey must have have plenty of for little while must hing sit there hugging dog making little plaintive speech to until heard mollie step at door then put down hastily audrey dear exclaimed mollie breathless with excitement 'have really got back at last be asking for dinner be nearly ready have not begun to dress yet who do think be in drawing room ' for booty who always knew when be not wanted have pattered softly out of room thinking high time to rejoin master michael ' asked audrey with face well hidden in wardrobe think of guessing like ' returned mollie in vexed tone put captain burnett in head audrey everyone else be so surprised mr ross nearly jumped off chair when heard voice have be here two hour have be so busy getting room ready ' be very glad have come ' returned audrey trying to speak a usual 'but now will go down mollie dear for will dress more quickly if talk to may give dress if like there will do ' for mollie chatter be unendurable 'how be to go down meet before ' thought a trembling finger bungled with fastening cheek be burning yet hand be cold a ice must see how nervous be how dreaded to meet yet thought that be there in house that in few minute must hear beloved voice made almost dizzy with happiness a clasped brilliant cross on neck hardly dare look at herself for fear must read own secret in eye gong sounded before be ready dared not linger for fear mollie must come again in search of without giving time for thought hurried down stood panting little before drawing room door yes be there father mother mollie someone else imperfectly seen through sort of haze be there too audrey never knew what word of greeting came to lip a michael took hand eye be never lifted a felt that strong warm pressure low toned have come audrey might mean anything nothing be met by absolute silence on part perhaps michael felt meeting embarrassing for dropped hand in moment spoke to mollie audrey took refuge with father dinner be on table must take seat opposite to be mollie who be beside happily one spoke to for first few minute dr ross be questioning michael about route michael seemed to have great deal to say about journey audrey recovered breathed little more freely be talking to father must venture one glance at how well looked be not so pale moustache seemed darker have never thought handsome before at point a though aware of scrutiny michael turned face full on flash from keen blue eye made head droop over plate during rest of dinner scarcely spoke more than once mr ross looked at in perplexity audrey be very strange thought have michael quarrelled that have met so coldly with not even cousinly kiss after long absence now did not speak to other dinner be later than usual that night prayer bell sounded before left table audrey whispered to mollie to play hymn be almost sorry have done so when found that michael have hymn book must offer hers took from perhaps because noticed that hand be not steady must hear clear full bass though must not utter note be still beside a left schoolroom a be about to follow mother mollie felt hand on hers with moment said ' want to show something ' there be resisting firm grasp compelled to obey be taking to father study there shut door a though to exclude outer world be trembling with fear of what must say to how be to answer when came up to said in old familiar voice never going to look at again audrey ' something amused yet caressing in tone made raise eye look that met hers said so plainly that understood everything that embarrassment shyness passed away for ever a took in arm with word two told of deep inward gladness sense of well being utter content seemed to assure that have found true rest at last chapter li 'love aftermath ' seek copy now of life first half leave here page with long musing curled write new future epigraph new angel mine unhoped for in world mr browning of spoke for minute perhaps michael strong emotion felt need of silence presently said in voice thrilled with tenderness 'audrey must never be afraid of again ' ' will never need to be afraid again returned softly michael if only knew how dreadful have be week must not go through again for world 'have be so bad a ' in old rallying tone for saw how greatly be moved 'you have idea how bad be felt that have done something very bold unmaidenly in writing postscript to father letter have longed for return after began to dread be so afraid of what must think of ' ' think have known opinion on subject for great many year replied gently 'if have not be different from other girl if have not be immeasurably above in eye must never have asked to send that message knew must rely on perfect truth have not disappointed ' delicate flattery soothed appeased sensitiveness michael watched for moment then drew up chair to fire in old way must sit there talk to for little while said quietly a looked at rather doubtfully suggested that mother must be wondering at absence negatived idea at once 'by time father will have told everything have be in confidence month will not want have not seen yet at least have not seen be quite sure of ' a audrey dimple came into play at remark very nearly made feel shy again by saying 'you have idea how lovely have grown audrey have anyone told so wonder ' 'no of course not who do think must talk such nonsense to ' blush made still more certain of fact rate be dearest face in world to ' went on still more earnestly 'audrey think even if have not written three little word must still have come home must not have stayed away from longer 'if have only known that might have spared great deal of pain ' replied quickly 'but told that be going to greece holy land mr abercrombie have come back alone thought thought that must never see again ' ' began to have same sort of feeling then be so tired of waiting how long have wanted audrey ten twelve year at least begin to think that there never be such fellow for constancy ' 'ten twelve year what can mean michael knew well enough what meant only be woman enough to love to hear say 'oh be quite twelve year ago can remember occasion quite well be in short white frock have hair streaming over shoulder be pretty little girl audrey admired far more than admired gage with regular feature 'oh what nonsense michael ' will tell next that remember asking to give kiss want to kiss mike because be so nice smart do think will ever forget that lost heart to then ' must not expect to remember thing returned blushing like rose 'no darling suppose not be only child then same memory be very sweet to have be one only love know that now michael ' now gray eye filled with tear for word sounded like reproach to 'you must not misunderstand ' returned shocked at evident misconception of word think that begrudge love gave that poor fellow day when be wife will tell think on subject not now not to night of night when know feel for first time that treasure be in own keeping then stopped in rather agitated voice begged that might not see tear in dear eye to night ' did not mean to be foolish returned in low voice 'only when think of have suffered how patient have be how beautifully bore for sake feel a though must never make up to for have gone through michael ' here look be little wistful 'be sure that will never disappoint that what have to give will content ' answer fully satisfied on point be more than content said needed assurance of affection must never need first look at face have told wanted to know ' think can read very thought audrey know better than know ' a michael said there be smile upon face seemed to baffle smile so penetrating sweet that lingered in memory long afterwards few minute later michael proved truth of word be showing ring that have chosen half hoop of diamond of finest water lustre brilliancy almost dazzled audrey remember love for diamond said a took hand did not answer be looking rather sadly at little gold ring have always worn ' take off ' said hastily a read tender reluctance in face audrey why must not diamond keep company with ring ' a eye expressed gratitude slipped brilliant ring into place will soon have to make way for diamond will make capital guard though evidently expected answer to audrey made response except to remark on lateness of hour then michael did consent to adjourn to drawing room be eagerly expected heartily welcomed a father folded in arm with murmured blessing received mother tearful congratulation audrey felt how truly appreciated choice on occasion there be drawback no whispered fear of what geraldine husband might say mr ross begged that might be allowed to carry good news to hillside be coming up to dinner thought that be due to that must be prepared beforehand a everyone assented to mr ross started early next morning on delightful embassage have miscalculated amount of pleasure that news must impart geraldine cried with joy when heard news nothing must satisfy except to put on bonnet walk back with mother to woodcote interrupted delightful tete tete between lover not that of minded for a michael sensibly remarked expected that must have plenty of tete tetes in life audrey be sufficiently fond of sister to welcome under circumstance did think must wait until evening ' said a threw arm round audrey darling do know how glad be about to think that one ever imagined must be michael then a gave brotherly kiss begged that too might be congratulated continued earnestly 'yes indeed have be a blind stupid a possible yet when one come to think of audrey be cut out for other be afraid might say something about disparity in age five twenty forty actually have gray hair already gage ' 'nonsense ' returned indignantly ' never saw look younger better in life a for disparity a call be just same between percival can couple be happier if be only a good to audrey a percival be to will be happiest woman in world be pity mr harcourt must not see wife a made speech for looked so lovely in matronly dignity that michael audrey exchanged admiring glance climax of success be felt to be reached when mr harcourt arrived that evening 'you have done best day work that ever did in life when said yes to burnett ' be first speech to audrey then have turned very red wrung hand with such violence that throbbed with pain ' think ought to give kiss percy ' suggested wife little mischievously for be well known that mr harcourt objected to such demonstration except to own wife thank ' returned audrey stepping back ' be quite sure of percival sympathy without putting to such painful proof will kiss audrey on wedding day replied mr harcourt solemnly 'that be if husband will permit ' with bow to michael remark drove sister in law to other end of room so that lost certain straightforward complimentary speech gave great deal of pleasure to michael never must be induced to repeat to
