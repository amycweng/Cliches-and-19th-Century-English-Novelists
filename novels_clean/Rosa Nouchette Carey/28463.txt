over pebble merry party be about to embark tall man in straw hat two boy in knickerbockers sister be watching oh reggie do be careful nan heard one of girl say a waded knee deep into water come nan ought not to dawdle like exclaimed phillis impatiently went on quickly past long row of old fashioned white house with green before that sweet sussex border of soft feathery tamarisk then past cricket field down to whitewashed cottage of preventive station then turned back walked towards steyne after nan declared satisfied there be plenty of people on parade most of looked after two girl a passed nan sweet bloom graceful carriage always attracted notice phillis although generally suffered from comparison with sister be still very uncommon looking must like to know who young lady be observed

occupied looking over strip of garden ground full of marigold marigold in row cottage have named in home letter be nearly opposite white house where mr cheyne lived nan remembered handsome sad looking woman who always wore black drove out in such handsome carriage always alone how sad nan thought wondered a walked past low stone wall with grassy mound slopping from belt of shrubbery shutting out view of house whether mr cheyne lived there still have reached quiet country corner now there be clump of tree guarded by post chain white house stood far back there be two three other house cottage dotted down here there road looked shady inviting nan began to look about more cheerfully be glad be so quiet so far away from town that neighbor will not be able to overlook be just thinking of a disadvantage returned phillis with placid opposition be pity under circumstance that be not nearer town after nan held peace be passing old fashioned house with green door in wall when suddenly opened tall grave looking young man in clerical attire came out quickly upon then drew back to let pas suppose be new vicar whispered phillis when have gone few step know poor old dr musgrave be dead most likely be successor forgot be vicarage returned nan happily did not turn round to look at again if have done so must have seen young clergyman still standing by green door watching be shabby dull old

near neighbor observed phillis somewhat shortly a paused before green door set in long blank wall for here be at friary have better just run over way get key from mr crump nan nodded then stood like image of patience before shabby green door must open let into new untried life what sort of fading hope of dim regret must be left outside when crossed threshold thought of empty room not yet swept garnished made shiver upper window looked blankly at like blind unrecognizing eye be quite glad when phillis joined again swinging key on little finger humming tune in forced cheerfulness what dull shut in place think name of friary suit exactly observed nan disconsolately a went up little flagged path bordered with lilac bush feel like miniature convent prison might have grating in door answer outsider through nonsense returned phillis who be determined to take bright view of thing go into house just yet want to see garden led way down gloomy side path with unclipped box yew that made dark decidedly damp brought to little lawn with tall rank grass might have be mown for hay side bed full of old fashioned flower such a lupin monkshood pink small pansy dreary little greenhouse with few empty flower pot turned up box be in one corner attempt at rockery with periwinkle climbing over undesirable number of oyster shell old medlar tree very warped gnarled be at bottom of lawn beyond small kitchen garden with abundance of gooseberry currant bush vast resource in shape of mint marjoram lavender oh dear oh dear what wretched little place after dear old glen cottage garden in spite of good resolution nan eye grew misty comparison be odious retorted phillis briskly have just to make best of thing deny be horrid put rest away between lavender on shelf of memory smiled grimly a picked one of gray spiky flower then a walked round weedy path pointed out how different must look when lawn be mown weed oyster shell removed box yew clipped little paint put on greenhouse look at splendid passion flower growing like weed over back of cottage remarked with wave of hand only want training nailing up poor miss monk have neglected garden shamefully then be always ailing went into cottage after entry be rather small dark kitchen came first be tolerable sized apartment with two window looking out on lilac green door blank wall be afraid dorothy will find little dull nan observed

dorothy other two room looked upon garden one have three window be really very pleasant parlor must be work room began phillis solemnly a stood in centre of empty room looking round with bright knowing glance oh what ugly paper nan can easily put up prettier one smaller room must be where live take meal be not quite so cheerful a be so nice having side window will give more light will be able to see who come in at door yes be advantage assented nan be agreeably surprised to find such good sized room in cottage be decidedly low window be not plate glass thought that on summer morning might sit there very comfortably looking out at lawn medlar tree will be glad of cupboard suggested after pause while phillis took out sundry piece of tape from pocket commenced making measurement in business like manner work will make such litter must like thing to be a tidy a possible be thinking continued might have mother great carved wardrobe in recess behind door be really magnificent piece of furniture in work room must not be so out of place must hang up finished unfinished dress in out of dust must have little drawing room chiffonnier between window for piece odds end in cupboard be pity table be round perhaps will look more comfortable sewing machine must be in side window added nan who be quite in element now for loved housewifely arrangement mother easy chair little table must

comparison even dropped disparaging word of agreed must do very well there be place for large roomy couch that mother so much affected favorite chair knick knack must soon make look cosey after went upstairs hand in hand there be only four bedroom two of be not large most cheerful one be of course allotted to mother next in size must be for phillis dulce nan be to have small one next to mother

bustling miss milner came to at once phillis put question to in low voice for there be other customer exchanging book over counter same young clergyman have before noticed have just bought local paper be waiting evidently for young lady who be turning over magazine quite close to do know of good dressmaker in place repeated miss milner in loud cheerful voice very much to nan discomfort for

life just by will be very happy to give lady address for be widow with little child be anxious to procure work then looked at nan hesitated be if be not very particular added with sudden embarrassment for even in morning dress there be certain style about nan that distinguished from other people thank miss drummond returned miss milner gratefully will write down address for ma'be yes thank very much perhaps doe not matter returned nan hurriedly feeling awkward for first time in life phillis who realized humor of situation interposed address will do harm may a well have although must not trouble mr langley will call in again miss milner to morrow morning then will explain what be really want be in hurry now continued phillis loftily turning away with dignified inclination of head toward officious stranger phillis be not prepossessed in favor be dark wiry little person not exactly plain with odd comical face be dressed so dowdily with such utter disregard of taste that phillis instinctively felt mr langley be not to be dreaded what queer little body do think belongs to asked nan a walked rapidly toward beach house what in world made strike in after fashion demanded young man a companion followed more slowly in stranger footstep be just way mattie interfering meddling in other folk affair why can not mind own business sometimes continued irritably instead of putting foot into other people be a cross a two stick afternoon archie returned sister composedly have sharp little pecking voice seemed to match somehow for be not unlike bright eyed bird have quick pouncing movement wait moment braid have got torn be dragging wish must think little more of position take greater pain with appearance returned brother in annoyed voice what must grace say to see what fright make of yourself be sin shame for woman to be untidy careless in dress be unfeminine be unlady like hurling separate epithet at perhaps miss drummond be used to compliment for merely pinned braid without seeming least put out think be little shabby remarked tranquilly a at last walked on perhaps mr langley have better make dress too with laugh for in spite of sharp voice be even tempered little body last remark only added fuel to wrath really have le sense than child idea of recommending person like mr langley to young lady woman who work for miss masham be very plainly dressed archie returned poor mattie who felt last snub acutely for if there be one thing upon prided be good sense have dark print dress not a good a one have on nothing must be quieter oh absurd little goose exclaimed brother burst into laugh for drollery of comparison restored to instant good humor if can not see difference between frumpish gown of yours with little bobtail fringe pretty dress before must say be a blind a bat mattie oh never mind gown returned mattie with sigh have have home thrust to meet parry nearly day ever since have come to keep house for fastidious brother be very active bustling little person who have done great deal of tough work in day never must be made to see that unless woman add grace of life to cardinal virtue be comparatively speaking failure in eye of other sex so though mattie be frugal housekeeper worked from morning to night in service veriest little drudge be ever seen be perpetual eyesore to brother who loved feminine grace repose whose taste be fastidious somewhat arbitrary so be poor mattie have more censure than praise wrote home piteous letter complaining that nothing did seemed to satisfy archie that mother have made great mistake in sending not grace to preside over bachelor establishment oh phillis how will have courage to publish plan exclaimed nan when be at last discussing much needed tea chop in little parlor at beach house window be wide open returning tide be coming in with pleasant ripple wash over shingle parade be nearly empty child voice sounded from green space before house brown sail of fishing craft dipped into horizon be so cool so quiet so restful nan eye be weary put question wistfully phillis looked into teapot to gain moment reprieve corner of mouth have odd pucker in never said be not hard burst out at last felt like fool while be speaking to miss milner then that clergyman be peeping at between fold of paper seemed nice looking gentlemanly sort of man do think that queer little lady in plaid dress

band nevertheless mattie presence at vicarage be felt by brother a sore burden there be nothing in common between nothing that cared to discus with on wished to know opinion be naturally frank outspoken man one demanded sympathy from belonging to with mattie be reticent a far a possible restrained in speech one reason for might be that mattie with virtue be really most estimable little person be sadly deficient in tact never knew when be treading on other people pet prejudice must not be made to understand that presence be not always wanted that be a well to keep silence sometimes must intrude advice when be not needed in good natured way have always interfered with everything everybody meddlesome mattie have called at home be so wonderfully elastic too in temperament that nothing long depressed took brother snubbings in excellent part if scolded at dinner time made ready tear come to eye for be not least of mattie sin that cried easily on possible occasion have

be ashamed of such cowardice hope mean to do without friend stammered archie must be too painful to bear thought be excusing from partaking of neighbor hospitality because be too poor to return wanted to set at ease may have reason for wishing to be quiet perhaps mr challoner health party be not always desirable went on floundering little in speech signing to mattie to come to help did at once

when be kind enough to call at oldfield be always good friend with clergyman be such dear old man do mean to forbid sister visit then asked archie looking anxiously at sweet face nan looked so pretty in spite of discomposure oh mean to be so rude do phillis will be so glad to see miss drummond faltered nan losing breath little have be unfortunate must work for living sister perhaps must not care to visit dressmaker what exclaimed archie almost jumped out of chair in surprise phillis have uttered faint bravo nan one heard dulce cheek be crimson must not look at one nan who have got out dreaded

willingly act a friend began young man confusedly looking not at at nan be so bewildered so utterly taken aback hardly knew what said here come dorothy with tea interrupted nan pleasantly a though dismissing subject have not forgotten old custom friend always came around in afternoon mr drummond perhaps will make useful cut cake dorothy need not have unpacked best silver teapot nan be moving about in frank hospitable way laddie be whining for cake breaking into short bark of impatience be one of glen cottage cake susan always pride on recipe said nan calmly a pressed on guest mr drummond almost envied sister a praised cake asked for recipe have always found fault with manner now nothing must be finer than simplicity pure good nature innate womanliness be teaching mattie something better than tact nan have dropped painful subject must not revive in brother presence there must be plenty of time for to call talk over with quietly help of course must help must have new silk dress uncle conway have just sent be risk for perhaps might spoil such fine creature must have chance at present must only enjoy nice tea talk to poor little frightened dulce who seemed unable to open lip after sister disclosure archie must not emulate ease man be always at disadvantage in such case interest have sustained no shock be even stimulated by what have just heard sympathy seemed at once congealed must find vent for in spite of best effort manner grew more more constrained moment nan looked at more than once with reproachful sweetness thought have lost caste in eye phillis who be shrewd sharp set in wit read more truly knew having already met score of such how addicted young englishman be to mauvaise honte how will hide acute sensibility under blunt stolid exterior there be certain softness in mr drummond eye belied stiffness most likely be very sorry for did not know how to show in be right mr drummond be very sorry for be still more grieved for oxford fellow have not long be parish priest must not at understand position in found taking tea with three elegant young dressmaker who talked purest english have decided view on tennis horticulture have just be congratulating on securing such companionship for sister being rather classical minded have be calling gray eyed grace one of at least daughter of god divinely tall most divinely fair for where have seen anything to compare with bloom charming figure dressmaker oh if only grace be at hand that might talk to gain opinion how be to act in such case grace have stiff necked drummond pride a well a must hesitate long behind barrier of conventionality wonder with thought passing through mind that nan with bright surface talk found little vague be quite relief to party when mattie gave signal for departure bell be rung for dorothy to show out well nan what do think of visitor asked phillis when garden door have clanged noisily after have treated nan to aforesaid hug for be so brave darling actually took wind out of sail exclaimed enthusiastic phillis miss drummond be not so bad after be in spite of dowdiness fussy way mean well so doe brother be very nice only self consciousness spoil returned nan in calm discursive tone a though be discussing ordinary visitor be impossible for young girl to see that ordinary language be not humble enough for new circumstance must make mistake at turn like dorothy who got out best china brewed tea in melon shaped silver teapot phillis opened eye rather widely at nan be not often so observant be true self consciousness be torment to archibald drummond frankenstein of own creation have grown imperceptibly with growth to fell measure of manhood a inseparable a shadow from substance phillis have recognized at once then a said one be faultless then be so handsome very handsome chimed in dulce whose opinion be full fledged in such matter be well never cared for man with long fair beard observed nan carelessly poor archie how vanity must have suffered if have heard for in masculine way prided excessively on soft silky appendage grace have so often praised certain boyish countenance with kindly honest eye little sandy moustache be more to nan taste than handsome young anglican oh know nan opinion in such matter said dulce slyly then nan blushed suddenly remembered that dorothy be waiting for in linen closet hurried away leaving sister to discus visitor to heart content chapter xix archie be in bad humor oh archie be never more astonished in life exclaimed mattie a tried to adapt uneven trot to brother long swinging footstep then glanced up in face to read mood archie feature be inscrutable presented appalling blank in mind be beginning letter to grace wondering what must say to about new neighbor writing be such nuisance when one want to talk to person thought irritably oh archie wo tell what be to do went on mattie excitedly must not take archie silence a hint that wanted to keep thought to poor girl oh how nice pretty be especially eldest be not youngest dulce think called very image of isabel isabel not bit be so like mattie always see likeness when other people can not trace faintest resemblance for remark be sure to draw out opposition isabel be silly flirting little thing in brother estimation thought must not hold candle to youngest miss challoner oh dear now have made cross sighed poor mattie who especially wanted to keep in good humor yet one think isabel so pretty be sure from what grace said in last letter mr elli burton mean to propose to suppose will all consider that catch sneered archie be so like parcel of woman thinking man who come to house make few smooth tongued speech be in fact civil must be after girl of course have helped to instill nonsense into child head dear how talk archie returned mattie feeling snubbed a usual why archie have be quite excited about only other day have said quite seriously that with seven girl in family must be great blessing if isabel must make such match for be very unlikely that laura susie even clara must do much for in way unless decidedly improved in look well be nothing to returned in chilling manner know own mind best if angular lantern jawed fellow like burton who by bye doe not speak best english be to isabel taste let have by mean be well to do dare say will keep carriage for by by be what woman think great advantage finished archie who certainly seemed bent on making disagreeable mattie heaved great sigh did not dare to contradict grace must have punished on spot by dose of satire must have brought to reason good nature in moment mattie ventured only on laborious sigh jerked up from bottom of honest little heart archie sigh felt ashamed of bad temper did not know why felt so suddenly cross secret irritation be at work within must scarcely refrain from bidding mattie quite roughly to hold tongue not tease with chatter if expected in present state of mind be at once contradictory aggressive to talk to about challoners must just make up mind to be disappointed for must not bring to speak of to just now wanted to hold counsel with own thought with grace must call at friary again see mr challoner find out more of strange matter a to talking over with mattie quite shrugged shoulder a swung open green door be going in faltered mattie a noticed movement well yes have letter to write be too hot for longer walk returned decidedly then a mattie stood hesitating wistful in middle of road strode off leaving door to close noisily after not caring to inquire into further movement such being occasional graceless manner of brother when sisterly friendship be not to liking mattie felt snubbed for first time in life did not take snubbing meekly be too much to expect of who be only woman not one of archie divinity that must follow into house hold tongue just because be pleased to refrain from speaking water must find vent mattie tongue must not be silenced in way if archie must not talk to miss middleton must so at once trotted off for brooklyn thereby incurring archie wrath if must only have known purpose for gossip be to a sin of witchcraft unless stooped to then be amiable sociability miss middleton be listening to father reading a usual welcomed mattie with open arm literally a well a metaphorically for kissed mattie on cheek then scolded tenderly for looking so flushed tired for somebody who be always looking after other people never have time to spare for be growing quite thin be not father must write to grace if go on finished miss middleton with one of kind look be cordial to poor mattie who though be used to snubbing took a kindly to a spaniel to water yet felt growing rather like thread paper shabby with day worry never encouraging word to inspirit so gave misty little smile mattie smile be pretty though feature be ordinary then sat up straight began to enjoy be to talk never noticing that colonel middleton looked at paper in crestfallen manner not much liking interruption cessation of own voice oh dear began mattie generally prefaced remark by oh dear be one of jerky way a archie said must not help coming straight to for archie must not talk felt must tell somebody oh dear miss middleton what do think have just called at friary here colonel middleton countenance relaxed dropped paper young lady eh come elizabeth be interesting well what sort

dark purple gold just what admire so ah reduced in circumstance told so elizabeth ejaculated colonel never saw archie enjoy so much seem so thoroughly at home anywhere somehow girl put so at ease though be hanging up curtain when went in one else must have be annoyed at intruding so soon actually before be in room moment archie be on step helping eldest miss challoner fasten hook miss middleton exchanged amused look with father mattie narrative be decidedly interesting oh tell repeated that for be always calling chatterbox implored mattie who feared have be indiscreet that colonel be not to be trusted be quite true a far a joke be concerned one understood art of teasing better than young vicar have already have taste of kindly satire archie only meant to be good natured put one at ease quite right mr drummond be always kind returned elizabeth benignly have forgotten mattie frequent scolding poor little thing tired face must never have hazarded compromise with truth somehow elizabeth always forgot people weakness especially when be absent be so nice easy to praise people if always believed what said be because faith be so strong charity be love be second nature oh yes of course returned mattie innocently be far too loyal little soul to doubt archie kindness for moment be not pride ornament of family domestic pope who issued bull without possibility of contradiction archie did must be right be not that domestic creed little slavish perhaps still so exquisitely feminine mattie be of opinion well to use mild term irritability be necessary adjunct of manhood men be cross sometimes behooved womankind then to throw oil on troubled water to speak peaceably to refrain from sour look even shadow of frown archie be never cross with grace therefore must be mattie on whom blame lay be such silly little thing so on there be need to follow self accusation of one of kindest heart that ever beat did not visit end a pleasantly a began asked elizabeth who though be over merciful in judgment be not without good deal of sagacity shrewdness something lay beyond margin of mattie word must see that plainly then father be getting impatient well see that spoiled everything returned mattie jumbling narrative in oddest manner archie be so sorry so be got quite know way when feel uncomfortable thought miss challoner be joking at first that be just bit of make believe fun until saw how grave miss phillis be second one looked then little one at least be not little somehow one fancy be seemed a though be going to cry what did miss challoner say to distress mr drummond so

be putting out returned elizabeth mildly be one of idiosyncrasy to call people a soon a possible by christian name though one father brother ever called elizabeth perhaps gray hair certain soft dignity belonged to forbade such freedom dear father must let mattie speak even elizabeth let work lie unheeded in lap in engrossing interest of subject mean have be dressmaker time be plan for future miss challoner said be not clever enough for governess that did not want to separate be what mean to do to make dress for people who be not half so good a preposterous absurd groaned colonel where be

colonel there be sewing machine rosewood davenport for account chiffonnier of course for piece oh mean business must not be surprised if understand work well went on mattie warming up to subject thinking of breadth of green silk reposed so snugly between silver paper in drawer at vicarage first silk dress have ever owned for drummond finance did not allow of such luxury new color too such soft invisible shadowy green like autumn leaf shrivelled by sun richness oh if must spoil thought mattie with sigh a magnitude of intended sacrifice weighed heavily upon mind be sheer girlish nonsense

worst part of returned phillis with little disdain in voice about making sensation mean there be that mother so entirely misunderstood what said be if dressmaking scheme be undertaken just to make sensation must of course achieve success for thought novelty might take then added that be merely stating hypothesis by way of argument then mr challoner looked shocked came in be that asked phillis

fresh effort people began to talk of young vicar sermon be changed somehow there be more in le of husk more of kernel a miss middleton once remarked rather pithily be wonderfully brief discourse whereas have once be elegant somewhat scholarly production be now earnest even pungent if sentence be le carefully compiled more rough hewn deficient in polish there be matter in roused people made think never must remember mr drummond sermon before dulce once observed now can recollect whole sentence quite nicely phillis to whom spoke assented by nod if have chosen must have admitted fact that must remember not sentence entire sermon in secret marvelled also at change be more earnest must say to herself preaches now not from outside from inside of thing from own experience not from other

of badly shot arrow doe not goulburn say that now then one touch mark when be let fly hither thither anyhow preacher shuts up book hearer cease to yawn oh phillis how absurd be suppose mr drummond be to hear must have objection nan seriously do not notice how formal cut dried most sermon be come round regularly like sunday people have to bear being preached at so unfortunate parson must hammer out of head somehow pick out text writes out composition drag in learning by ear delivers in best fashion people listen to politely best behaved yawn phillis be positively irreverent be shocked at on contrary be very reverent well in 'hints to clergy must say first 'never preach what feel current of electricity sympathy whatever be that communicates between preacher people will be checked impeded preach out of book can read for preach out of own head own experience just a much a can ' bless continued phillis in wise half sad tone pulpit must be empty must get sometimes sermon at be too much for nan simplicity people must be so disappointed observed plaintively middle aged people like sermon must not hurt to be disappointed sometimes must appreciate real thing more when came be a well to go without food altogether a to be fed on husk after people forget that come to church to say prayer together sing glorias be very nicely said dear be nan admiring comment on phillis waved aside praise be quite in earnest if be speaking to one of real not make believe preacher must say to 'never be discouraged say what have got to say if really feel mean one will feel too ca see into people heart good thing too friend arrow at venture may tell one may be hit between joint of armor there come along will have more of hint time have said say for present phillis rose from boulder with eye bright kindled by moving thought went down to edge of water watched sea gull dipping towards shore in midst of windy light while nan marvelling at sister unusual earnestness followed more slowly challoners be holding up head in place now there be denying by people at vicarage white house be owned regarded a equal mr cheyne made secret of affection for phillis be full of kindness also to nan dulce be own fault if declined frequent invitation there be one person who refused to hold out hand of amity to eccentric new comer colonel middleton still shook white head delivered protest into daughter ear elizabeth declared laughingly that challoner girl be to father what red rag be to bull never met one of without coming home relieving mind a called father be dying to know must say to mr

girl passed archie smiled at nodded phillis in pretty way have waved hand then went on rapidly towards friary a did so colonel middleton groaned touched companion arm impressively there now drummond did ever see girl with better carriage head up light springy step why be pleasure even to old fellow like to watch fancy that taller one on horseback in row why must cut out girl think that one dare not notice struck stick into ground almost angrily archie smiled must not help colonel be so whimsical in wrath have plenty of notice from folk at white house returned quietly ah cheyne be always bit of radical madam be better can do a like without being afraid of consequence be not case a archie looked at rather mystified went on bless suppose be afraid of knowing for own sake elizabeth tell that be intimate with be not business so long a doe not have at brooklyn must draw line there elizabeth ' said 'if choose to visit dressmaker be not for to prevent be old enough to select own friend so may be a eccentric a like brother be coming home young men be young men choose to expose hammond to such temptation oh hammond be son suppose asked archie who be much amused at colonel earnestness yes boy hammond finest fellow in regiment though say who must not do think that father must expose to such danger a to throw into society of set of fascinating young woman who have chosen to emancipate from conventionality who call stuff rubbish dressmaker not call so be excellent dressmaker be archie somewhat malicious reply more reason that son must not know thundered old man what sir officer in one of majesty regiment son grandson of officer be such one to be mixed up with family have lost caste to flirt with make love to girl who be not above making gown for butcher wife before hammond doe thing a here colonel paused from excess of emotion be perfectly right to defend son from such danger returned young clergyman with covert sarcasm in case must probably feel same in position being intimate with lady of whom speak having have good opportunity to form opinion of can not help saying in defence that even son excellent officer a be be sure most worthy young man must scarcely be dishonored by alliance with finest young gentlewoman ever met a said with due gravity archie released arm with farewell nod went off leaving colonel open mouthed gasping with astonishment at own gate elizabeth met on threshold oh father why did not bring mr drummond in said reproachfully be so long since have paid visit poor drummond replied colonel with mournful shake of head be just a thought have almost owned in fact be seriously smitten with one of challoner girl before long there will be wedding in place now father be just one of whimsy replied elizabeth placidly mr drummond be going to have favorite sister grace to live with keep house told so that doe not look a though expected to bring home wife so may just put idea out of head though elizabeth be well aware of truth of word that new mistress be to come to vicarage still fine sympathy unerring woman divination have read meaning of young vicar clouded brow knew that too have to try be grateful for blessing went over head archie grand somewhat heroic speech failed in effect a far a colonel be concerned elizabeth be right in saying father be longing to know challoners old man fancy have be mightily taken by girl for hammond for boy sake be capable of amount of self denial once be sorely tempted to give in when turning corner of braidwood road not far from own house came suddenly upon daughter who be standing on side path talking to dulce dulce who always seemed sort of reflection shadow of sister who withdrew somewhat in background obscured little by nan beauty phillis sprightliness be nevertheless in way most bewitching little maiden there come father observed elizabeth tranquilly never doubting that must join dulce looked up little shy fluttered from under broad brimmed hat for have taken fancy to colonel with white moustache kindly inquisitive eye be sort of hero in fancy dulce loved hero especially when wore medal colonel middleton saw little girl dimpling blushing with pleasure old heart thumped little with excitement conflict of feeling innocent child look appealed to fatherly sympathy there be moment wavering then lifted white hat with muttered good morning next minute be walking on with squared shoulder tremendous energy poor little dulce lip quivered with disappointment thought hard when other people be so kind to elizabeth said nothing bade child good bye with greater tenderness than usual sent sort of message to mother nan colonel meanwhile have retreated into house be opening paper with more than usual fuss be for hammond murmured to when one have boy one must do one duty

so on to end of story be enough to surprise one whose nerve be not of strongest when one life in lonely country road master of house be out to see gigantic specimen of manhood not very carefully dressed with hair like red glory come suddenly striding through one open gate without by leave waiting for possible permission mattie dropped umbrella for be dressed in waterproof oldest hat ready for district work stranger picked up handed to promptly then removed hat politely how do do cousin said broad genial smile revealed set of white teeth mattie retreated step in genuine affright for know

masterful have run down step flashing back disdainful look at have felt there be change in manner to have be such good friend of late have become habit with to turn to phillis when wanted silent scarcely perceptible understanding have seemed to draw together in one moment at word mere light jest of meant nothing girl have become at once reserved frozen up impenetrable even to friendship in
