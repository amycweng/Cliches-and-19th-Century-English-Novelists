be talking loudly enough before sara came into room ' for there be nothing like taking bull of dilemma by horn have plenty of let say native impudence only personally must have given name then of course brought storm upon sara be right aunt philippa certainly talked faster mr fullerton tried best to edge in word now then very scathing word too there be silencing that flow of rapid talk quite envied pure diction ingenious turn of sentence made so much of own admirable foresight care of so little of merit always said something like must happen ursula have told uncle often brian why speak yes indeed have told often that never met one so strong minded willed need not laugh sara unless do to provoke have be like mother to ursula thank heaven daughter be not of pattern mistake

mind if chooses to be eccentric can not hinder talk go for nothing ' 'ah mr garston young people want guidance ' observed mr fullerton impressively for aunt philippa be beginning to sob partly from effect of wasted eloquence perhaps with little shortness of breathing anyway anger be working out 'if be to advise ursula a must sara influence might induce to change mind ' ' can not endorse opinion mr fullerton ' returned uncle brian drily be far too keen observer of human nature to think can talk sense to deaf ear with benefit ursula child ' turning to with smile might have be kinder perhaps meant to be so 'there be not grain of sense in scheme in spite of cunliffe eloquence will not hold water in fact in little while will be glad to come back to again when do think can promise will not laugh at more than once day then moderately ' now speech of uncle brian made very angry doubt meant to be kind to show that if scheme failed might come home to again be so much in earnest that satire laughing at hurt more than aunt philippa hard speech so flushed up for first time tear came into eye for have prophesied failure must not bear might have said word in sudden irritation for must have be sorry afterwards only lesbia who have sat behind time a silent soft breathed a mouse got up quickly took hand stood by ' think have said plenty of hard thing to ursula one have be kind to think deserves praise not blame if can not lead comfortable life do thinking how be to get most pleasure enjoy ourselves be because be better than be think more about duty mr garston mean to be rude be far too fond of because have be so good to ' here lesbia while throat swelled 'but can not bear to hear ursula so blamed mr cunliffe know agree with said so many nice thing when ursula be out of room little burst of eloquence surprised uncle max said afterwards that be quite touched by lesbia be generally so quiet undemonstrative that word took aunt philippa by storm might have be offended by lesbia saying be better than rest of fact that conscience most emphatically contradicted when lesbia kissed begged to think better of thing cried little because charlie be not there to see how pretty must look then cheered up made overture might come kiss too did most willingly with full heart remembering be father sister have be good to according to light when uncle max saw that reconciliation be imminent that by lesbia help be likely to have best of own way good deal of petting to follow for must make more of during short time must be with threw down paper in high good humour joined 'that be what call sensible mr garston said paying compliment at once a sat flushed fanning 'and ursula ought to feel very grateful to for forbearance acquiescence in plan ' believe knew more than where forbearance have be took for granted 'nothing put heart into person more than feeling sure of one friend sympathy now of even garston in spite of disapproval wish ursula good success in scheme of

practical person if will allow to give hint marwill earns good wage there ought to be sufficient money to pay for moderate amount of help ' told mr marwill so morning ' returned pleased to find

returned falling into trap then laughed for have a good a owned that thought disagreeable that laugh made better friend felt no longer disliked be certainly not fault that providence have given that type of face supposed one must get used to ' be in evil mood afternoon ' went on then knew instinctively that wanted to efface satirical word from memory 'things have gone wrong somehow for world of ours be mighty muddle sometimes here gave impatient sigh 'it be relief to human nature to vent one spleen on first handy person cross one path pardon for saying so be just little aggressive yourself ' looking at rather dubiously a though be not quite sure how must take hit conscience told that have be far from peaceable on contrary have be decidedly cross not must confess that be case so only

miss locke who have sad time of trying to earn food for there be little niece who life with subdued uncanny little creature who look a though childhood be crushed out of might take in hand too wonder if phoebe must like to sing to ' observed quietly have found answer sometimes in nervous illness thought remark surprised 'it be good idea said slowly 'you might try of course must depend great deal on quality of voice style of singing wonder if must allow to judge of looking meaningly at piano shook head at did not press point have very little talk after for went away almost directly first arranging to meet at mr marwill about four next day go with to woodbine cottage will find plenty of work miss garston ' be final word waste strength unnecessarily then left room came back moment afterwards to say that sister meant to call on only thought be hardly settled yet 'we must get mr cunliffe to bring up to gladwyn must not let mope ' thought there be little chance of with uncle max mr tudor always looking after mr hamilton have hardly closed door before uncle max opened again beo enemy have tasted bread salt ursula ' said looking excessively pleased 'that be right dear give way to absurd prejudice hamilton will get on splendidly by by when get used to brusque manner though did not quite endorse opinion be obliged to acknowledge to myself that last half hour have not be so unpleasant after chapter x difficult patient have little talk with granny next day mr marwill be dozing uneasily be sitting by granny nursing baby waiting for mr hamilton when felt cold wrinkled hand laid on mine 'what be elspeth ' asked thinking wanted something 'what put in head bairn to do lord work be what be wanting to know have be listening to morning singing like bird about house with bit

to stay moment to pacify mr hamilton came in stood by ' hurry can easily wait few minute if be not ready be sure be not too tired to come ' continued looking at little inquisitively be certain that noticed trace of tear on face why be never must speak of darling quite calmly ' be perfectly ready baby have left off cry ' returned taking up basket then left house together hope suffer from low spirit like rest of ' said in rather kind tone a walked on 'it be to be expected that cross grained fellow like must have fit of blue occasionally be one thing particularly admire about cunliffe however worried be one never see out of humour ups down be never perceptible do believe be le selfish than other people 'there be one like uncle max ' rejoined fervently 'be not odd that must suit other so well ' asked presently 'for be complete contrast can bear to say thing to must knock other fellow down for saying be why let preach to because honestly belief what say try to act up to profession broke off here for by time have reached woodbine cottage unlatched gate for thin faced child with cropped head clean white pinafore opened door dropped alarmed courtesy when saw 'please sir aunt susan be out aunt phoebe be very bad afternoon can not see one be lying in dark be to let none of neighbour in while aunt susan be away 'all right kitty aunt phoebe will see walked into passage told child to close door gently room passed be strewn with work material looked cold comfortless small kitchen opposite have warm cosy aspect mr hamilton passed room tapped at door lower down passage then without waiting for answer entered beckoned to follow dark curtain have be drawn across window dim glow of cindery fire scarcely gave sufficient light to discern different piece of furniture mr hamilton gave vent to suppressed exclamation of impatience a seized poker must not notice skilful almost noiseless manner in manipulated coal then looked round for match lighted candle on mantelpiece in spite of peevish remonstrance from patient will make head worse doctor nothing dark eas ' 'nonsense phoebe know better than ' returned cheerfully then stepped up to bed followed woman who lay there be still young in year must not have be more than three four thirty semblance of youth be crushed out of by subtile mysterious suffering might have be face of dead woman only for living eye that looked at hopeless wistful look in eye gave singular shock have never seen human eye with same expression seemed a though be appealing against awful destiny once when charlie be staying at rutherford beautiful spaniel belonging to lesbia have be accidentally shot while straying in wood poor animal have dragged with pain difficulty to garden gate there found will never forget wistfulness of poor creature eye when mistress knelt down caressed died few minute afterwards licking hand must not help thinking of tito when first saw phoebe locke for same unreasoning anguish seemed in sick woman eye tormented soul looked out of there be something rigid uncompromising in whole aspect of sick room there be nothing to tone down soften harsh detail of bodily suffering everything be in spotless order sheet be white a driven snow formidable phalanx of medicine bottle stood on small square table there be book picture flower sampler hung over mantelpiece be saw mr hamilton glance disapprovingly at row of bottle told kitty to clear rubbish away said curtly 'why do not have something pleasanter to look at phoebe flower canary must find plenty of amusement in watching canary 'birds be never still for moment must drive mad ' returned phoebe in hollow tone seemed natural to 'flowers be better what have to do with flower doctor ' voice rising into shrill crescendo must give something to send to sleep will go mad think think think until head be in craze with pain misery ' 'well well will see about ' humouring a though be child not speak to lady phoebe have come down here to help sick people unhappy people one want help ' ca do anything for ' muttered phoebe restlessly 'no one not even doctor can do anything for be doomed doomed before time ' mr hamilton looked at meaningly a though to say 'now see what have to do be more work than mine ' obeyed hint accosted sick woman a cheerfully a though dismal speech have not curdled blood ' hope will be comfort to be hard indeed if one can

by heat cold what season of year be be young just turned four thirty may lie here thirty year more unless die go mad phoebe ' remonstrated mr hamilton how gently spoke not told over over thing may mend yet if will only be patient good be just making thing worse by bearing so badly why friend of mine have be seven year on back like be happiest cheeriest body be quite pleasure to go into room ' be good be wicked returned phoebe sullenly can not help doctor be one of bad day nothing wicked word come uppermost devil have deal of power when woman be chained a be ' think must exorcise demon by

before mr hamilton yet how in sheer humanity must refuse have often sung before to patient have never minded in least before mr hamilton need not think of ' continued provokingly for of course be thinking of ' be critic in musical line just try how answer will ' walked away turned back to seemed absorbed in sampler for one minute hesitated then cleared throat ' be going to sing something phoebe mr hamilton think will do good ' then fearful lest waywardness must stop commenced at once with first line of beautiful hymn thou weary art thou languid voice trembled sadly at first burning face cold hand testified to nervousness after first verse forgot mr hamilton presence only remembered be charlie favourite hymn be singing sang with full heart when have finished bent over phoebe asked if must sing more to great delight nodded assent sang 'abide with several other suitable hymn did not stop until hard look of woe in phoebe eye have softened into more gentle expression a paused

finished ' did not look at a spoke have young lady done good did close eye think heard angel singing now must let take away for be very tired have worked hard to day to morrow if ask will come again ' will not wait to be asked returned answering dumb wistful look greeted doctor word yes will come again to morrow will have little talk will bring flower if care to hear sing have plenty of pretty song then kissed forehead for felt strongly drawn to poor creature a though be strange suffering sister thought that kiss song flower must be threefold cord of sympathy for to bind round harassed soul through long hour of night mr hamilton followed silently out on threshold encountered susan locke be thin subdued looking woman dressed in rusty black with careworn depressed expression changed into pleasure at sight of mr hamilton doctor be good of surely so busy be one of phoebe bad day when nothing plea will have naught to say to groan groan until one heart be pretty nigh broken be half hoping

understood ' be stiff response 'yes of course one call that except vicar who will address a miss elizabeth never will answer to name hate so servant up at gladwyn never dare to use must get etta to dismiss if did be not shame people must not have voice in matter of name that helpless infant must be abandoned to tender mercy of old fogey of sponsor miss garston if be ever to hear address by name

seeing beautiful face of gladys hamilton in little room be not who entered first miss darrell whose sharp incisive glance have taken in detail of surroundings before faultlessly gloved hand have released mine even when turned to greet miss hamilton peculiar somewhat toneless voice claimed attention very fortunate ' began seating with elaborate caution with back to light hardly hoped to find at home miss garston cousin giles informed how much engaged be have be so interested in what mr cunliffe told about be such romantic scheme a be very romantic person may be sure of sympathy gladys dear be not charming room positively have so altered beautified can hardly believe be same room told friend of ours mr saunders that must never suit a be such shabby little place 'it be very nice ' returned miss hamilton quietly hope ' fixing large beautiful eye on 'that be comfortable here thought perhaps might be little dull have time to be dull returned smiling miss darrell interrupted 'no of course not busy people be never dull told so gladys a walked up road depend upon said miss garston will hardly have minute to give to idle chatter will be wanting to get to sick people wish at hanover still a cousin giles said must do right thing call though be sure be not conventional person be oh be quite kindred soul here ' tried to receive speech in good part certainly protested inwardly against notion that miss darrell must ever be kindred soul felt instinctive repugnance to voice want of tone jarred on time talked hard bright eye seemed to dart restlessly from miss hamilton to felt sure that nothing must escape scrutiny now then when one looked at in return seemed to veil most curiously under long curling lash be rather elegant looking woman face be decidedly plain have thin lip rather square jaw sallow complexion lacked colour one must not guess age exactly might have be three four thirty heard spoken of afterwards a very interesting looking person certainly figure be fine knew how to dress very useful art when woman have claim to beauty miss darrell voluble tongue seemed to touch on subject miss hamilton sat perfectly silent have not chance of addressing once when looked at must see eye be fixed on darling picture be gazing at with air of absorbed melancholy lip be firmly closed hand lay folded in lap 'that be picture of twin brother ' said softly to arouse to surprise turned paler than ever lip quivered 'your twin yes have lost ' here miss darrell chimed in again 'how very interesting what blessing photography be to be sure do take well miss garston make perfect fright tell cousin that nothing on earth will induce to try sitting why must endure martyrdom if be not to give pleasure to friend to surprise miss hamilton voice interrupted be little like step brother voice have slight hesitation be not in least unpleasant spoke rather slowly at least seemed so by comparison with miss darrell quick sentence have not done what giles told hope will come dine with to morrow miss garston without ceremony ' 'dear how careless of ' broke in miss darrell forehead contracted little a though cousin speech annoyed 'giles gave message to be talking so fast that quite forgot cousin will have that be dull society may cheer up hold with giles think be far too superior person to be afraid of little solitude strong minded people like be generally fond of own society same hope mean to be quite recluse dine at seven hope will come a much earlier a like ' interposed miss hamilton 'no one will be with mr tudor ' forget mr cunliffe gladys ' observed miss darrell in rather sharp voice ' be sure know what poor man have done to offend ever since last summer ' here miss hamilton rose with gesture be almost queenly impassive face looked graver than ever did not know have invited mr cunliffe etta must certainly have mentioned good bye miss garston will look for soon after six ' there be something wistful in expression seemed a though wanted to come yet be complete stranger to felt very reluctant to dine at gladwyn that look overruled ' will try to come early ' be answer then drew back to let pas miss darrell bade good bye little stiffly something have evidently put out a went down narrow garden path must see be speaking to miss hamilton rather angrily miss hamilton seemed to take notice what did mean wondered then suddenly bethought of other visitor have wholly forgotten existence in interest in beautiful sister what must have become of lady betty chapter xiv lady betty leaf muff question be speedily answered gate have scarcely closed behind visitor when heard gay little laugh behind lady betty tripped across passage took possession of easy chair in friendliest way 'now can have chat be cosy by ourselves said with childish glee then stopped looked at rosy little mouth began to pout sort of baby frown came to forehead seem pleased to see again will go away be busy tired be there anything matter asked lady betty in extremely fractious voice 'there be nothing matter be delighted to see ' with sudden inspiration will be good enough to stay have tea with will ask mr barton to send in one of excellent tea cake be evidently what lady betty wanted for nodded took off hat began to unbutton long tan coloured glove in cool business like way that amused ran across to kitchen gave mr barton carte blanche for sumptuous tea when returned found lady betty quite divested of walking apparel patting dark fluffy hair to reduce to degree of smoothness have pretty little head be covered by mass of short curly hair that nothing must reduce to order 'this be just what like ' said promptly 'when giles told about made up mind to call hoped must ask to stay do dislike stiffness conventionality excessively hope mean to be friend with miss garston for have taken rather fancy to in spite of grave look dear do always look so grave ' 'oh ' returned laughing 'that be right ' with approving nod 'you look ever so much nicer younger when smile well what did prime minister say be very gushing sympathetic did patronise in ladylike way pat on head metaphorically until felt ready to box ear ah know la belle cousine little way be so exact description of conversation with miss darrell laughed in rather guilty fashion lady betty clapped hand delightfully have found out be not bit solemn really only put on air of sister of mercy so like etta need not be afraid of telling so be greatest humbug in world only giles be so foolish a to believe in call humbug because pretend to be what be not be really most prosaic sort of person want to make people believe that be soft romantic body ' 'you be not very charitable in estimate of cousin lady betty ' must not lead gladys life poor dear majesty to be ruled by prime

own be afraid of same never dare to act in opposition to etta ' lady betty confidence be rather embarrassing hardly knew how to check began to think household at gladwyn must be very queer one uncle max have already hinted at want of harmony between mr hamilton step sister miss darrell seemed hardly favourite with although be too kind hearted to say so openly 'have cousin lived long with ' ventured to ask yes ever since gladys be little thing before mamma died auntie lived with too poor auntie be very fond of be sad invalid died about three year ago etta have managed everything ever since ' 'do mean that miss darrell be housekeeper must have thought must have be sister place ' gladys be called mistress of house none of servant go to for order if give etta be sure to countermand ' 'it be partly gladys fault ' went on lady betty in frank outspoken way tried for little while to manage thing be terribly bad housekeeper etta undermined influence in house everything went wrong giles got so angry men do know when dear creature comfort be invaded so there be great fuss gladys gave up now prime minister manages finance give out store though hate to say thing never went more smoothly

jill be rather reckless talker be nothing compared with daring little creature lady betty told afterwards when be better acquainted that have amused so to see how widely must open eye when be surprised believe did out of pure mischief talk be happily interrupted by appearance of mr barton tea tray at once turned lady betty thought into new channel there be so much to do first must help to arrange table a one else must cut such thin bread butter must try hand at then nap must have tea before touched ours when at last did sit down be praising cake jumping up for kettle waiting upon 'because be dear good thing waited on poor people coaxing to take that a though be guest now then paused to say 'how nice cosy be ' how be enjoying how glad felt to miss stupid dinner at gladwyn where one talked giles etta gladys sat a though be half asleep until lady betty felt inclined to pinch be approaching dangerous subject again warded off by asking how sister employed time made little face at a though question bothered 'oh do thing gladys doe thing rather lucidly 'well what thing may ask 'why do want to know ' be unexpected retort question do giles say woman be dreadfully curious '

comfort with blagroves for example there be nothing to be done just to watch child feeble life ebb away miracle only must have saved same be impossible to go away leave be young people have never seen death before ' be surprised to hear speak with so much feeling liked that expression beervant of poor sounded to a though have at last grasped meaning have nothing more to fear from sarcasm wondered what have wrought sudden change in for have only worked few day certainly must make thing far easier if must secure a ally began to hope that must go on more smoothly in future mr hamilton be evidently man whom must take long to know be by mean character easy to read one must be sure to be startled by new development curious contradiction have known only for ten day then have met constantly in short time have seen hard in manner soft in speech cool critical disparaging at one moment satirical provoking next full of thoughtfulness readiness to help wonder found difficult to comprehend when have finished discussing blagroves mr hamilton turned attention to other guest tried to promote general conversation left at liberty to make own observation miss hamilton sat at top of table facing brother uncle max mr tudor be beside did not speak to of unless addressed reply seemed to be very brief if have be le interested in might have accused of want of animation for be hardly playing role of hostess to look beautiful be chary of word smile be impossible to attribute silence to absence of mind for followed with grave attention word be spoken for inexplicable reason have withdrawn into uncle max left to herself after time began to talk politics with mr hamilton mr tudor be soon compelled to follow example poor mr tudor rather pitied for other neighbour lady betty have turned suddenly very sulky have surmise that miss darrell have said something to affront for made snapping little answer when one spoke to though laughed at nobody seemed to mind most likely thought prudent to give time to recover miss darrell radiant good humour be strange contrast to two cousin silence threw gallantly into breach talked fast well on topic broached by gentleman be evidently clever well read have dabbled in literature politics energy vivacity be almost fatiguing seemed able to keep up two three conversation at once lowest whisper did not escape ear if mr hamilton spoke to saw watchful eye on joined in at once with sprightly word two next moment be answering uncle max who have at last hazarded remark to silent neighbour miss hamilton have time to reply cousin laugh ready word be before found same thing happen when mr tudor addressed before have finished sentence have challenged attention of table 'giles said good humouredly 'do know what mr tudor said in drawing room just now that be bounden duty of heathfield folk to spoil make much of miss garston mr tudor looked confused at audacious speech tried to defend a well a must 'no miss darrell be not quite what said whole style of sentence be too laboured to belong to bounden duty doe not sound like at 'we need not quarrel about term persisted 'your meaning be just same come mr tudor can not unsay own word that be right for to make much of miss garston thought be spoken in worst possible taste be sure mr hamilton thought so too for smiled slightly said 'nonsense etta let tongue run away with daresay be not tudor meaning at be most matter of fact fellow know must not coin compliment to save life besides expect have found out by time that must be rather difficult to spoil miss garston cut way eh ' looking at rather mischievously 'oh if gentleman be in conspiracy to defend miss garston will say no more ' returned miss darrell with shrug did not say quite pleasantly 'gladys dear think have better retire before be quite crushed giles frown have quite flattened out miss garston if be ready ' making mocking little courtesy miss hamilton waited for at door linked arm in mine taking possession of in graceful way evidently pleased max for looked at smiling 'come into conservatory gladys ' whispered lady betty in sister ear 'etta have cold coming on will be afraid of following ' conservatory led out of drawing room be lighted by coloured lamp gave pretty effect be full of choice flower two three cane chair filled up centre be not so warm a drawing room certainly be pleasant to sit there in dim perfumed atmosphere peep through open window at firelight miss darrell followed to window with discontented air hope be not going to stay there many minute gladys will certainly give miss garston bad cold if do there be something wrong with warming apparatus giles say will be day before will be properly warmed thought told so morning ' think miss garston will take cold etta be very pleasant here ' though miss darrell retreated from window think felt a much constrained a though have joined for not word must escape ear if chose to listen fact did not seem to daunt lady betty for long for soon began chattering volubly to ' be not so cross now a be said frankly be afraid be very rude to mr tudor at dinner what must do when etta be so impertinent be not there gladys have gone out of room looking a cross a possible what do think said to ' 'never mind telling what said dear ' returned miss hamilton soothingly want to tell miss garston look dreadfully curious like to think cross for nothing be not like be gladys well just before went in to dinner begged in whisper not to talk quite so much to mr tudor a have done last time now what do want leah ' pulling up rather abruptly have only brought shawl lady betty a miss darrell say conservatory be so cold have told thornton to mention to master when take in coffee miss gladys be sitting here hope will forbid ' 'you can take away shawl leah returned miss hamilton quietly there be scornful look on pale face a spoke 'we be not going to remain here since miss darrell be so anxious about health will come in miss garston perhaps be trifle chilly here ' seeing how wind blew that miss darrell be determined to have way in matter acquiesced silently be not bit surprised to see lady betty stamp little foot a followed miss darrell be lying back on velvet lounge welcomed with provoking smile ' thought threat of telling giles must bring in gladys ' said laughing 'what foolish child be to be so reckless of health one know gladys be delicate ' went on turning to 'everything give cold giles have be obliged to forbid attending evening service winter be terribly rebellious about be not dear of course giles have way one in house venture to disobey ' miss hamilton did not answer be standing looking into fire lip be set firmly a though nothing must make unclose 'oh do sit down continued cousin pettishly give one such uncomfortable feeling when tall person stand like statue before one a miss hamilton quietly seated went on ' think religious people be far more self willed than worldly one miss garston daresay be willed gladys made a much fuss about giving up evening service a though salvation depended on going twice three time day what be to prevent reading service in own room used to say to can not be duty to disobey brother make ill ' 'the illness lay in own imagination etta ' observed miss hamilton coldly 'giles must never have found out chest be delicate if have not told so ' miss darrell gave favourite little shrug inspected ring beee what thanks get for cousinly care said good humouredly suppose gladys be vexed with for telling that be working to death that close air of schoolroom made head ache that so much singing be too much for strength ' please etta will talk about other subject health want of health will not interest miss garston spoke with dignity then turning to with winning smile 'giles have told about singing will be good enough to sing something to must be great pleasure lady betty be so fond of music ' beiss garston look very tired gladys be almost selfish to ask ' observed miss darrell softly then knew that miss hamilton request did not please have vowed to myself that amount of pressing must induce to sing that evening must not have refused that gentle solicitation a unbuttoned glove took place at grand piano determined must sing anything everything that miss hamilton wished miss darrell must not silence with resolve hot on commenced opening bar of 'the lost chord ' before have finished song miss hamilton have crept into corner beside remained there a motionless a though singing have turned into stone chapter xvi gladys know how majority of people feel when sing with love of music be almost passion must forget audience in moment must be scarcely aware if room be empty crowded for example on evening have idea that gentleman have entered room first intimation of fact be conveyed to by hearing 'bravo uttered by mr hamilton under breath must not leave off went on quite earnestly want to treat a treat poor phoebe locke sing one song after until be tired ' be about to refuse request very civilly decidedly for have notion of obeying such arbitrary command when miss hamilton touched arm do please go on singing a giles say be such pleasure to hear after must no longer refuse so sang one song after chiefly from memory sometimes must hear soft clapping of hand sometimes there be breathless silence curious feeling came over a sang thought that only person to whom be singing be miss hamilton be pleading with to tell reason of sadness why there be such weary hopeless look in eye when world be so young with god given gift of beauty be hers be singing a though be alone in room when max suddenly whispered in ear 'that will do ursula a soon a verse concluded left off before must rise miss darrell be beside 'oh thank so much miss garston be very amiable to sing so long giles be certainly loud in praise be hardly prepared for such treat why gladys dear have be cry what impressionable child be miss garston have not contrived to draw tear from eye without making reply miss hamilton quietly left room be eye wet wonder be that why max stopped did want to shield from cousin sharp scrutiny if so failed be such pity gladys be so foolishly sensitive ' went on addressing uncle max 'natures of sort be quite unfit for stern duty of life be quite uneasy about sometimes be not giles spirit be so uneven have so little strength parochial work nearly killed mr cunliffe said how ill looked in summer 'true never thought work hurt ' replied max rather bluntly ' think be mistake for miss hamilton to give up duty occupation be good for one be opinion ' observed mr hamilton 'etta be always making fuss about gladys health tell there be not least reason for alarm many people not otherwise delicate take cold easily be true advised to give up evening service for few week until got stronger ' 'indeed here max looked little perplexed thought told miss darrell that cousin found service too long wearisome be reason stayed away 'oh must have misunderstood ' returned miss darrell flushing little 'gladys may have said liked shorter sermon in evening be hardly reason for staying away at least 'of course not what nonsense talk etta ' observed mr hamilton impatiently 'you know what trouble have to coax gladys to stay at home be rather obstinate about a girl be asked a special favour to myself to remain ' max face cleared up surprisingly a miss hamilton at moment re entered room accosted almost eagerly beiss hamilton have be talking about in absence brother have be agreeing that be really great pity that must have given up parish duty be little hard on be not tudor brother declares occupation will do good now be sure cousin will not have slightest objection to give up old class can take miss matthew then will have two good worker instead of one ' for instant miss hamilton hesitated face relaxed looked at max little wistfully miss darrell interposed in sprightly way a like gladys dear mr cunliffe will be too glad of help be sure a see how much wish think be fretting after old scholar home duty be not exciting enough even giles notice how dull be oh will have class with pleasure anything to see happy love will make exchange to morrow ' thank etta think thing have better be a be ' miss hamilton walked away proudly spoke to mr tudor sudden brightness in face have dimmed be near enough to see that hand trembled 'there see ' observed miss darrell complacently have done best to persuade in public private to amuse not give way to feeling of lassitude do little not much have often said to with gladys must be none ' 'ursula do know how late be ' asked max coming up to looked suddenly very tired saw at once that wished to go so made adieu a quickly a possible in few minute have left house accompanied by mr tudor uncle max be very quiet way home have expected to be full of question a to how have enjoyed evening only remark be to ask if be very tired then left to mr tudor 'well how do like folk up at gladwyn ' demanded mr tudor betty be not in best of humour to night hardly deigned to speak to be sure must have admired miss hamilton like of ' be temperate reply must not be hard on poor little lady betty miss darrell have be lecturing that made cross ' beo supposed ' be prompt answer what did think of dare a vicar call sometimes be not like pleasant edition of tupper proverbial philosophy verbose full of long sentence how many word did coin to night do think ' there be little scorn in young man voice miss darrell be evidently not favourite in vicarage yet most people must have called elegant well mannered if have beauty be not bad looking be so exceedingly well made up style of dress be so suitable to face be not surprised to hear afterwards from lady betty that many people thought cousin etta handsome now when mr tudor made spiteful little speech felt rather pleased for dislike to miss darrell have increased rather than diminished by evening experience under smooth speech there lurked antagonistic spirit something have prejudiced against even at first meeting be convinced that did not like must not encourage visit to gladwyn mr tudor talked good deal about lady betty described a most whimsical sound hearted half child half woman with touch of brownie brother often called brownie little nix to tease be very fond of sister went on to say there be not much companionship between miss hamilton be very intellectual read good deal lady betty never read anything novel made pet of even mr hamilton who be not much given to pet be hardly influence in house have not backbone enough finished 'and dare rule with rod of iron cased in velvet ' uncle max listened to in silence a parted with at gate of white cottage only said 'good night ursula ' in depressed voice be evidently rather cast down about something perhaps miss hamilton decision have disappointed have be favourite worker have helped greatly seemed to feel hard that must withdraw service so suddenly how wistfully have looked at a pleaded with be first time have seen look at of own accord yet have denied request very firmly gently ' must be friend with then perhaps will tell about day thought for be convinced that there be more than met eye be time before must banish perplexing thought saw good deal of lady betty during next week two met frequently on way to locke must walk with to gate two three time made appearance at marwill ' 'for be use calling at white cottage of afternoon must say disconsolately 'for be never at home inhospitable creature 'why do think live here lady betty returned smiling 'do know be becoming most punctual person be always back at white cottage by five sometimes little earlier will always be pleased if will come in have tea with ' ' must like of thing replied lady betty with sigh 'and will come sometimes will see if know etta will make fuss always doe if stay out after dark be dark at four now be why pop in here to see because etta be always busy in morning never take notice of what do ' 'but surely miss darrell will not object to coming to see ' asked somewhat piqued at 'oh dear returned lady betty jumbling word a though found question embarrassing never object openly to anything do only throw stumbling block in way know why have got into head that must not like gladys to come here without be there same idea mean be something said other night to mr maberley gave impression mr maberley wanted to call on because said be mr cunliffe niece people ought to take notice of etta said oh dear yes be very kind thought on mr maberley part mr cunliffe must think so that be why giles have invited to gladwyn there be hurry evidently be not prepared to enter into society have rather strong minded view on subject be not quite sure whether giles be wise to encourage intimacy with sister beiss darrell said to mr maberley ' 'yes be not horrid of etta felt so cross mr maberley be such old dear only rather old fashioned in notion about girl so etta speech rather frightened must see of course have not called yet be almost inclined to tell giles about ' 'indeed hope will hing of kind lady betty be sorry miss darrell doe not like see that matter so very much what people think of ' 'yes when etta take dislike to people try to prevent from knowing be provoking part of be so dreadfully jealous expect be singing gave umbrage etta be not at accomplished never cared much for gladys to sing because have such sweet voice put in background ah know how mean sound be just truth about etta if be to drop in for five o'clock tea a say leah must be sure to make appearance say be wanted at gladwyn found lady betty confidential speech rather embarrassing when knew little better took to task rather seriously for want of reticence only pouted said 'when one look at miss garston one can not help telling thing tumble out without one will be what gladys mean when say have sympathetic face wish must get to talk to ' a lady betty persisted in haunting marwill cottage determined to make useful so set to read to elspeth to give sewing lesson to peggy to amuse younger child while be engaged with patient soon found that be most helpful little body mr hamilton found sitting in kitchen one day surrounded by child be telling story baby be sucking thumb contentedly on lap poor mary be worse day have begged lady betty to keep little one quiet mr hamilton came into sick room looking very much pleased ' only wish must make lady betty useful member of society miss garston ' said with one of rare smile always lit up dark face so pleasantly be good little thing want ballast a rule young lady be terribly idle have called up at gladwyn few day after have dined there to great disappointment did not see miss hamilton miss darrell be alone so visit be a brief a possible told at once that cousin have gone over to brighton for afternoon shopping that mr hamilton have run up to london for few hour then commenced plying with question in ladylike way about work past life in such skilful manner that be almost impossible to avoid answering be so sure that must be dull living alone oh of course be too good unselfish to say so same must be miserably dull what must have put singular idea in head wondered when young lady did sort of thing there be generally painful reason be unhappy at home have have disastrous love affair of course laughing little affectedly have intention of hinting at reason in case one must see at glance be not that sort of person be far too sensible matter of fact gentleman must be quite afraid of be so strong minded same pleaded guilty to feeling of natural curiosity why idea have come into head when have warded off successfully for declined to enlighten miss darrell on subject flew off at tangent to aunt philippa 'it be such pity when relation did not entirely harmonise aunt must never replace mother ah knew that too well when there be daughter have heard from mr cunliffe that cousin sara be excessively pretty charming doubt there must be natural misunderstanding jealousy in spite of goodness be only human of course understood perfectly how happened felt very sorry for ' disclaimed notion of family disagreement with warmth think believed have evidently got into head be strong minded young woman with uncertain temper who must not live peaceably at home doubt have hinted to mr maberley other lady must make excuse for discouraging degree of intimacy with cousin must not be asked very often to gladwyn if depended on miss darrell mr hamilton have will of own if chose a companion for sister miss darrell must find difficult to exclude one must see at glance mr hamilton be master in own house miss darrell seemed perfectly submissive to there be something almost obsequious in manner to watched look anxiously though coaxed flattered did not seem quite certain how must take speech 'we be strange household think so miss garston observed presently 'giles be lord master none of poor woman dare to contradict when dear mamma be alive have great deal of influence over be very fond of death made great difference in house must have be great trouble to miss darrell ' 'yes indeed be almost broken hearted have be dearest most indulgent of mother giles be very good to gladys lady betty be very devoted to perhaps have heard speak of aunt margaret ah forgot have only seen gladys twice here looked at rather sharply nodded acquiescence 'gladys be always favourite with beiss hamilton must be general favourite ' replied little unguardedly suppose think handsome ' in rather forced manner beany people say be too pale rather too statuesque for taste ' opinion be very beautiful ' replied quickly told uncle max other day thought face almost perfect ' what did say ' asked rather eagerly 'did agree with ' be obliged to confess have forgotten answer ' know mr cunliffe think gladys cold ' went on 'he be too kind hearted to say so know feel hurt at desertion of post be strange whim on part to give up parish work be afraid be little bit of temper gladys have temper though may not think so be very firm doe not brook least interference on part poor dear if be not wrong must say be little jealous of influence with giles because like to do thing for how be to help doing what asks when owe very bread eat to kindness ' miss darrell be poor dependent then piece of news surprised thought of glittering ring silver mounted dressing case luxurious appliance in toilet wondered if mr hamilton have paid for miss darrell seemed to read thought in most wonderful way 'poor mother left very little except personal jewellery yes owe everything to giles generosity be good enough to say that earn allowance indeed be never idle interrupting ' want to talk of be very insignificant person just giles housekeeper gladys be mistress of house only wanted to explain to mr cunliffe be not to blame for gladys strange whim let explain little be looking very ill overworked begged giles to lecture told that there be need for gladys to do quite so much in fact be putting little too forward in parish considering how young be vicar unmarried man so giles gave word be sure spoke most gently be very careful indeed in only giving hint people even mr cunliffe might misconstrue such devotion never saw gladys in such passion next day have flung everything up told vicar that schoolroom made head ache that throat be delicate must not sing poor mr cunliffe be in such despair be obliged to offer service be far too much for what can do parish must not suffer for gladys wilfulness now if must only explain thing little to mr cunliffe looked so hurt other night when gladys refused to take old class wonder miss for used to teach child splendidly if knew be only little temper on gladys part must look over be friend with again must have noticed miss garston how little have to say to have found impossible to check miss darrell loquacity to edge in single word a soon a breath failed rose to take leave did not seek to detain 'you will explain to mr cunliffe for gladys sake ' said holding hand ' do want to think well of can see good opinion be shaken ' to made audible reply a shook off dust of gladwyn told that uncle max must not hear miss darrell version from lip wished to make tool in hand breach of confidence have very different result from what expected miss darrell word have cleared up perplexity in mind must read between line fully exonerated miss hamilton following afternoon have most unexpected pleasure when came back to cottage after day work mr barton met at door told that miss hamilton be in parlour have thought meant lady betty to surprise found miss hamilton seated by fire pleased smile came to face a greeted most warmly must have seen how glad be shrank back rather nervously when begged to take off furred mantle stay to tea be not sure that must remain lady betty be alone a giles etta be dining at maberleys have be asked have refused have taken in work a mr maberley have wanted to go early perhaps have better not stay a must not be kind to lady betty soon overruled objection told miss hamilton saw lady betty frequently that have never called since first visit now must not let go think wanted to press be arguing against own wish be easy to see that by by asked in low voice if be sure to be alone if expected visitor when have assured decidedly that one uncle max ever came to see knew be engaged evening last scruple seemed to vanish settled quite comfortably for chat talked for little while on indifferent subject told about neighbourhood people who lived in large house by church about brother work in parish how if rich people sent for always kept waiting while went to poor one call poor people doctor attends for nothing can not always refuse rich people if will have generally sends to dr ramsbotham see never take money for service a people know be ashamed to send for yet want because be so clever giles be so fond of profession be always regretting that have fortune left for say must have be far pleasanter to make one giles never did care for money be ready to fling away to one who asks ' miss hamilton kept up desultory talk tea time spoke with great animation about brother must hardly believe be same girl who have sat so silently at head of table that evening at sad abstracted look have left face seemed a though for little while be determined to forget trouble when mr barton have taken away tea tray asked with same wistful look in eye to sing to if be not tired complied at once sang for nearly hour then returned to fireside saw that miss hamilton put up hand to shield face from light took notice after little while began to talk ' never heard singing like yours miss garston be great gift there be something different in voice from one else seems to touch one heart ' singing always make sad miss hamilton be very dubious gift 'ah be pleasant sadness replied quickly ' feel a though kind friend be sympathising with when sing tell too that like have known trouble ' sighed a looked at charlie picture eye followed glance saw again that tremulous motion of hand know ' said hurriedly beautiful eye be full of tear have always be so sorry for must feel so lonely without ' intense sympathy with said few word seemed to break down reserve in moment have forgotten that be stranger a told about love for charlie dear old life at rectory be impossible to doubt interest with listened to if paused for instant begged very gently to tell more about be so sorry for did good to hear when spoke of life at hyde park gate told how little be fitted for sort of existence put down shielding hand looked at with strange wistfulness 'no be too real too much in earnest to be satisfied with sort of life mr cunliffe used to tell so seemed to understand before saw always felt a though knew even before met hope ' hesitating little 'that will see great deal of know giles wish ' 'you can not come here too often miss hamilton will always be such pleasure to to see ' 'oh did not mean that ' returned nervously ' may not be able to come here be not alone there be reason must not expect hope will come to gladwyn whenever have hour to spare giles said so other day think meant to be friend with must not mind ' getting still more nervous etta be little odd sometimes mood vary doe not always make people feel a though be welcome be only manner so must not mind ' 'oh will hope to come see lady betty time ' 'and went on hurriedly there be anything can do to help hope will tell so perhaps can not visit people there be other thing needlework little money oh have so much spare time will be such pleasure yes will help ' returned cheerfully for be looking so extremely nervous that wanted to reassure be prevented from saying more on subject for just then heard click of little gate next moment uncle max walked into room chapter xvii 'why not trust max ' max looked very discomposed when saw miss hamilton shook hand with gravely sat down without saying word wondered if be fancy if miss hamilton have really grown perceptibly paler since entrance 'what doe mean uncle max ' asked gaily for sort of oppressive silence did not suit at understood that mr tudor be dining at glynns ' to night ' 'lawrence have gone without ' replied ' have headache so sent excuse a got better thought must come up see how be getting on ' ' headache uncle max ' looking at rather anxiously for have never heard complain of ailment before have be dissatisfied with appearance ever since have come to heathfield have looked worn thin for time to night looked wretched 'oh be nothing ' returned quickly beiss hamilton hardly expected to find here with ursula thought be going to maberleys '' 'etta giles have gone replied quietly ' ought not to be here a lady betty be alone at gladwyn miss garston persuaded to remain be getting late must be going ' rising a spoke 'there be not

need at indeed must much rather not ' miss hamilton have lost repose of manner looked a nervous shy a school girl when max announced intention of escorting yet how must gentleman have allowed to go down dark road alone perhaps max thought be unreasonable for there be touch of satire in voice a answered ' certainly owe to conscience to see safe home what must hamilton say if allowed to go alone ursula ' turning to with odd look 'it be fine starlight night suppose put on hat run will do good relieve miss hamilton mind ' 'yes do come ' observed miss hamilton in relieved voice a spoke lovely eye seemed appealing to begging not to be angry with frowned slightly turned aside took up book how be two contrived to misunderstand other so often max looked even more hurt than have done at gladwyn

be afraid mr cunliffe be offended with because did not wish to go home with ' little proudly resentfully 'he be too old friend to misunderstand so need not have said that ' ' think uncle max be not well to night ' replied soothingly ' never heard speak in tone before be always so careful not to hurt people feeling 'yes know ' stifling sigh 'it be more fault than be looking wretchedly ill think

darkness always say miss hamilton remember have talked of before have thought duty more than once to remonstrate with about giving up work one seems to talk in dark somehow have never given very definite reason headache well a though did not know well enough to be sure be last person to think of ailment 'yes one friend be over careful still be right be not only that mr cunliffe wish must

regnant force answered a gently a must 'dear gladys will make ill will give relief to speak out will listen to anything have to say ' drew deep breath colour ebbed back into face 'perhaps may be relief be weary of silence of trying to bear alone other thing be wearing out etta be not so far wrong after then stopped looked at wistfully lip trembled 'ursula be nurse go about comforting sick

understood voice dropped into whisper 'come closer to mean to tell in spite of will be a quick a can giles will be here ' never saw eric in such state a be that day seemed nearly beside nothing must say seemed to give comfort shut up in room refused to eat must not admit for long time when at last opened door saw that table be strewn with paper letter directed to giles lay beside 'we sat down have long talk told that have got into more difficulty than even giles suspected have be led away by edgar brown brought money have be little enough promised next quarter allowance remember spoke again of enlisting said that life however hard must be preferable to present one must not stay here be slandered by etta bullied by giles seemed very unhappy once put down head upon arm groaned be just then that heard slight movement outside door opened just in time to see leah gliding round corner ursula have heard word that poor boy have said be be evidence have helped to criminate ' 'yes see

difficulty with fastening for have heard giles put up chain bell door on floor have chain bell be one of giles fad to great surprise door be ajar when put down candle on table have passing fancy that thick curtain be drawn over one of window moved slightly a though from draught of air blamed afterwards that have not gone up to window examined in perturbed mood did not take much notice be certainly startled when turned round to see leah in dark dressing gown standing in threshold watching with queer look in eye there be something in expression that made feel uneasy ' thought be thief said now looked not at across at curtain what be doing with master paper mr eric beind own business returned eric sulkily do think be going to account to for action took up candlestick marched off 'and left that woman in possession ' 'yes returned gladys in peculiar tone then hurried on 'the next morning giles missed cheque for large amount that have received previous night placed in one of compartment of desk in place found be letter do notice discrepancy here eric vowed to that have placed letter on desk that never dreamt of opening that always believed giles kept locked that if giles have be

seen since left house almost immediately afterwards one saw go by strange oversight giles telegram to london bank to stop cheque did not reach in time yet etta went to telegraph office a may have perhaps heard tall fair young man with light moustache cashed cheque early in afternoon yes know ursula circumstantial evidence be rather strong just here be quite aware that be possible for eric after leaving house to be in london at time mentioned one can prove that be eric 'edgar brown be tall fair there be plenty of young men answering to description maintain will maintain to dying day be sure mr cunliffe agrees with that be not eric who presented that cheque clerk told giles that young man have scar across cheek slight cut though be decidedly good looking giles refused to believe say clerk made mistake about last 'the next morning received letter from eric written at ship hotel brighton containing exact particular have given reiterating in most solemn way that be perfectly innocent of shameful crime laid to charge will believe gladys know went on will not let enemy blacken memory if can help if must only be on spot to clear up mystery for there be mystery about cheque

mean to set fear at rest for horrible suspicion that have really made away with be in mind be far too ill to notice went on fever seemed about must not eat sleep think must have done that poor brain must have given way under shock of apprehension for mr cunliffe 'he be true friend good samaritan bound up wound poured in oil wine of divinest charity did not believe that eric be guilty of dishonesty self destruction in own mind be inclined to believe that wished to think dead be mystery must wait pray in time managed to instil faint hope into mind that might be so 'etta be rather kind to just then looked ill worried seemed taken up with giles be well that must have one to look after comfort for there be breach between seemed a though must never be healed saw that be irritable miserable that thought of eric robbed of peace must make effort to console for felt a though heart be breaking ' here hid face in hand must see be weeping begged earnestly to say more that quite understood might be sure of sympathy with eric kissed gratefully said 'yes know be glad to have told now understand why be so grateful to mr cunliffe why be so sorry ' here lip quivered disappoint feel a though have given back eric from dead be true doubt sometimes when be ill gloomy generally faith be strong enough to withstand etta incredulity ' 'does miss darrell believe that be dead ' 'yes

'gladys think hear brother voice in hall cheek be quite wet will wonder what have be talking about ' will ring for thornton tea will find clearing table offer to help ursula ' sat still obediently watching slow graceful movement about room in firelight fair hair shone like halo of gold dark ruby gown wore gathered richer deeper tint beautiful sad face how must miss be little time before mr hamilton entered room thornton have lighted candle arranged tea tray gladys have placed at table testified surprise at seeing walked to fire after greeting warmed 'they told be here ' said abruptly ' be at cottage just now have not have tea why be quite late gladys want to take miss garston away 'be there anything matter mr hamilton ' for be beginning to understand manner better now 'oh have business for be patient will not tell about yet must have good meal before go out into cold will ring bell for more bread butter know dined early hot cake will do no good a saw meant to be obeyed tried to do justice to delicious brown bread butter conversation have taken away appetite stood over rather like sentinel until have finished 'now then may a well tell susan locke be ill acute pneumonia have just be down to see be afraid be sharp attack well if be ready may a well be going neighbour who be with seems poor sort of body sent for mr barton said be with elspeth when kitty went

sent for before now if be ready will start at once ' will not keep minute good bye ursula gladys kissed quietly followed to door be snowing fast ground be already white with fallen flake mr hamilton put up umbrella stood waiting for under shrub sudden impulse made linger gladys be still standing in porch fair hair shone like halo in soft lamplight eye be fixed on falling snow have said good bye to so hastily ran back kissed again wish be not going gladys will miss so ' 'it be nice to hear that ' returned gently will remember word ursula write to often letter will be only comfort there giles be looking impatient keep waiting dear ' drew back moment afterwards heard door shut behind mr hamilton did not speak a joined thought that walk must be silent one until said presently in rather peculiar tone miss garston suppose ought to congratulate for succeeding where have failed ' of course knew what meant pretended to misunderstand went on 'you have won sister heart gladys care for few people seems very fond of ' 'the feeling be reciprocated can assure ' ' be glad to know ' returned heartily only wish must teach gladys to be like other girl be too young too pretty to take such grave view of life be unnatural at age one disappointment however bitter ought not to cloud whole existence try to make see thing in more reasonable light gladys be a good a gold of course know that be fine creature be not like christian to mourn over inevitable in undisciplined way spoke with great feeling with gentleness surprised felt sure then of affection for young sister wished gladys must have heard speak in fatherly manner in spite of sympathy be difficult for to answer felt that be subject must not discus with mr hamilton yet seemed to wish to speak must give time to recover ' said rather lamely 'gladys be very sensitive be more delicately organised than most people feeling be unusually deep have have severe shock will not be easy to comfort 'no suppose not ' with sigh 'her faith have suffered shipwreck must try to win back to peace oh have much to do at gladwyn a well a other place want to feel at home with miss garston of have fault want knowing must try like better then will not find ungrateful ' stopped rather abruptly a though expected answer only stammered out that be very kind hoped when gladys returned from bournemouth must often see 'oh to be sure returned hastily ' forgot that absence must make difference like poor etta have noticed that well perhaps be little fussy managing be kind hearted creature very good to know what must have done without sister understand be never at ease with feel trouble want to be good to there always seems barrier that one can not break down suppose with intense bitterness lay blame of poor boy death at door a though must not give right hand to have back again ' 'oh mr hamilton exclaimed shocked to hear speak in way 'things be not so bad a know gladys must be more to if must ' turned upon almost fiercely ' tell that ' said harshly 'for can not believe gladys cared more for eric little finger than whole of put together look upon a destroyer a hard taskmaster who oppressed drove out of home oh want to contradict must tell how gentle gladys be how submissive be never angry look word be cold a frozen snow have not kissed of own accord since eric left sometimes think be painful for to live under roof ' hamilton ' what now

perhaps ought not to have repeated undervalue etta few woman must sacrifice so entirely for belonging 'no indeed ' be reply to secretly marvelled at piece of intelligence there be time to ask question for have reached cottage next minute be standing by susan locke bedside there be need to tell that poor susan be in danger inflammation ran high flushed face difficult breathing strength fulness of rapid pulse filled with grave foreboding mr hamilton remained with time when took leave promised to come again a early a possible in morning ' will stay altogether if wish ' said kindly 'if feel least uneasiness at being alone ' disclaimed fear on score only begged to remain with patient few minute while spoke to phoebe agreed to be late knew must not be asleep how must sleep poor soul with fresh stroke threatening a opened door heard calling to in voice broken with sob 'oh miss garston have be longing for to come to have be here for hour have be lying listening to footstep overhead do know suspense be killing ' 'yes be so sorry for phoebe be hard to bear be not must not leave sister be doing can to ease suffering be very very ill ' think that know that be dying only sister be dying '

taken a matter of course made bear bad temper never gave good word be too tired ah be often tired then took chill made wait on same told be ill in great pain kept standing for long time must not bid good night when went away heard sigh a closed door called back did not hear now ' here hysterical sob checked utterance 'yes be sorry now have forgiven think wanted to send message be in too great pain to speak heard say poor phoebe begged not to make effort see be thinking of still ' bey poor susan must not miss be wicked selfish to keep like go to miss garston be thankful to be dismissed heart be full when re entered sick room mr hamilton looked rather scrutinising a rose to give place thought must be here ' said meaningly 'forgive if give that hint forget providence be watching over other room one duty at time miss garston though coloured at wholesome rebuke knew be correct 'yes be right ' thought a stood listening to poor susan oppressed difficult breathing 'the divine teacher be beside child be not for to question discipline plead for easier lesson ' none le did fervent petition rise from heart that angel of death might not be suffered to enter house night wore on ala there be improvement when mr hamilton came through snow next morning looked grave dissatisfied then asked if wanted help shook head martin be in house will look after phoebe kitty ' when have gone wrote little note gave to kitty ' can not leave susan for minute be so very ill mr hamilton can see improvement be coming again at mid day suffers very much will not give up hope ' bade kitty carry to

will be change one way before long will not leave by to night ' said quietly in heart be not sorry to hear told that there be good fire downstairs that meant to take possession of very comfortable arm chair that wanted to remain in sick room for hour so fancied that professional eye have already detected change presently walked away to fireplace stood looking down into flame in rather absent way

hamilton to picture have seen at once remembered subject be picture of young christian sleeping peacefully just before be called to combat with wild beast in amphitheatre keeper be even then opening door lion be waiting for prey face be boyish still mr hamilton reminded of there be picture of st augustine sitting with mother monica reminded of mr hamilton too have called plain jill thought positively ugly after there be something noble in expression power that made felt just then line of face relaxed softened half smiled looked up eye met be terribly abashed at thought that must find watching to surprise face brightened roused crossed room ' be dreaming think woke be very tired will take place ' before must reply manner changed stooped over bed then looked at with smile thought so

incredulous be not sanguine enough to hope for miracle surely only miracle must change phoebe sullen morbid nature sister be longing to meet helplessness of one long protracted weakness of other kept long apart though only short flight of stair divided at last thought might venture to bring susan into phoebe room weather be le severe susan seemed little stronger so kitty hurried ourselves in preparation for festive tea in phoebe room watched with unconcealed interest a spread tea cloth arranged best china then placed easy chair by bedside room really looked very bright cosy little gray kitten have brought kitty be asleep on quilt phoebe have taken great fancy to pretty playful little creature be always with kitty large wax doll be lying with curly head on pillow susan trembled very much a entered room leaning heavily on arm phoebe lay quite motionless watching a walked slowly towards bed then face suddenly grew pitiful held out arm how ill look poor susan so old gray what doe matter so that have got susan back if have died must have died too god never meant to punish like ' stroked kissed face a though be child for little while two sister mingled tear together susan be too

phoebe be changed for said to myself surely will be up to old trick again soon now see be right nay never fret bonnie woman for loved when be a tiresome cross grained a possible think can not help loving ' finished susan simply a took sister hand be happy evening that spent in phoebe room when tea be over read few chapter then sang of phoebe favourite song when have finished looked at phoebe have fallen asleep with susan hand still in hers there be look of peaceful rest on worn gray face that made whisper to miss locke 'the evil spirit be cast out at last susan returned susan quietly behe

with doctor miss darrell mr hamilton have told news assure gladys letter tell far more ' be angry with when said for why need have answered at taken notice of remark above why need have mentioned gladys name miss darrell colour rose in moment 'dear be glad to hear dear gladys writes to doe not honour lady betty get note sometimes giles be never favoured with word giles feel terribly hurt about

willingly yet not one word of recognition for own may say only brother ' max be looking so exceedingly grave by time longed to change subject must say word in defence of gladys when be alone must be worse than useless to speak before miss darrell must twist word before face never said word in gladys behalf that did not make repent next moment however have started on different tack do know mr cunliffe ' said carelessly a crossed hearth rug to ring bell have heard again from captain hamilton max raised head quickly 'indeed hope be quite well by bye remember told have touch of fever trust have got better of ' 'we hope so ' in very impressive tone 'but be sharp attack doubt home sickness worry of mind accelerated mischief poor claude fear have suffered much not that say so be far too

hospital acquaintance of mine who be emigrating to new zealand importunity seemed to surprise sudden loquacity be interruption must not be repressed silenced took chair beside made look at fixed wandering attention pressed until grew irritable with impatience saw max be recovering by by gave forced laugh 'you will have to give in miss darrell ursula always get own way how much do want child must be merciful to poor vicar will satisfy ' offering sovereign miss darrell after moment hesitation produced same sum from purse took money coolly must not resign rein of conversation more into hand when mr hamilton entered room stopped looked at with visible astonishment have never heard so fluent before somehow eloquence died natural death after entrance be still little shy with mr hamilton manner be unusually genial afternoon be sure be delighted to see there again spoke to max in jesting tone then looked benignly at cousin who be superintending tea table certainly looked uncommonly

one else suited admirably once caught looking with marked disfavour on black serge dress pearl hoop have be mother keeper be sole adornment daresay thought extremely dowdy once heard say in pointed manner that 'her cousin giles liked to see woman folk well dressed be very fastidious on point exceedingly hard to please ' mr hamilton seemed in best of humour think that remarked how very quiet max be tea time pressed to remain to dinner wanted to send off message to vicarage be of to be persuaded though miss darrell joined entreaty to cousin be anxious to leave house a quickly a possible knew by instinct what max feeling must be must not enjoy mr hamilton conversation amusing a be wanted to be alone with max felt must keep silence with no longer must not get rid of mr hamilton a rose to take departure coolly announced intention of walking with 'the tylcotes have sent for again ' said casually may a well walk down with now ' looked at a spoke be afraid manner disappointed for once mr hamilton be decidedly de trop be sure must have noticed hesitation made difference to purpose have found out by time that when mr hamilton have made up mind to do certain thing other people mood did not influence in least half smiled a went out to put on greatcoat a though intended to punish for want of courtesy talked to max whole time not that minded in least only be just lordly way to great relief however left a soon a reached vicarage so wished good night quite amiably of course max walked on with to cottage be actually leaving at gate without word except 'good night ursula ' laid hand

'never mind now will come to presently want to tell know now max guessed little of before now be sure of ' have roused effectually sort of dusky red came to face a sat up looked at did not ask what meant understood other in moment only sighed heavily said ' have never told anything ursula have ' manner testified displeasure must never have spoken word to of own accord yet sympathy must be relief to knew max nature so well be shy reticent man must not speak easily of own feeling unless ice be broken for beax pleaded tear came into eye dear mother be living must have told without reserve ' '

beiss hamilton be in love with cousin be sorry for disappointment ' ' believe ' replied bluntly yet a said gladys conduct seemed to perfectly inexplicable be just possible that max statement after might be correct that did not love well enough to marry must account for nervousness constraint in presence sensitive girl like gladys must never be at ease under such circumstance have promised not

cry little with from joy thankfulness got quiet after time took off poor gown jill showed bruise cheered up when told how brave quiet have be then sat for minute with face hidden in lap while stroked hair silently thanked god in heart for sparing jill miss gillespie have gone downstairs to carry good report to aunt philippa directly have gone jill jumped up still shaking little went to wardrobe ' must go downstairs ' said little feverishly have never thanked mr tudor for saving life help to be quick ursie dear for feel so queer tottery ' nothing must say must prevail on to remain quietly in room while be arguing with have dragged out ruby velveteen be trying to fasten with trembling finger be obstinate jill ought to be good on night of night made answer to seeing bent on own way brought brooch must have smoothed hair pushed away 'it doe not matter how look be only going down for few minute be going away want to say good night to thank ' jill walked downstairs rather unsteadily mr tudor be just crossing hall when saw jill hurried up to at once beiss jocelyn be very imprudent ought to have gone to bed be not fit to be up after such shock ' looking at pale face swollen eye with evident emotion jill looked at gently seriously held out hand to quite simply ' must not go to bed without thanking be not quite so selfish thoughtless have saved life do think will ever forget that ' poor lawrence excitement terror relief be too much for there be jill holding hand looking up in face with great eye full of tear be not very wonderful that for moment forgot ' must not help doing ' returned 'what must have become of if have died must not have borne ' jill drew hand away face looked little paler in moonlight young man excited voice strange word must have told truth be not too young to understand head drooped turned away a answered ' will always be grateful good night mr tudor must go to mother come ursula ' did not look back a walked across hall though poor lawrence stood quite still watching why have foolish boy said that why have forgotten position youth why have hinted that life be necessary to happiness must jill ever forget word look accompanied felt almost angry with lawrence a followed jill into room jill need never have doubted mother love aunt philippa have be too faint ill to follow daughter to room face be quite beautiful with maternal tenderness a folded girl in arm not even father who especially petted jill showed more affection for night 'oh jocelyn darling be quite sure that be unhurt miss gillespie say be only frightened little bruised wanted to see for mr tudor will not let thank will be grateful to life pet what must poor father have done without ' jill hid face like baby on mother bosom be cry quietly interview with mr tudor have certainly upset uncle brian put hand in rough lock mind little girl be now over must go to bed forget ' be certainly very good advice coaxed aunt philippa to let go promised to remain with until be asleep be very quiet hardly said word a helped to undress a sat down by bedside drew head down beside hers on pillow think be not grateful because talk about ursie dear whispered ' hope to be better life for what have happened to night ' a jill lay with wide solemn eye in moonlight wondered what thought be coursing through mind be looking upon life preserved a life dedicated regarding a set apart for higher work nobler us be gratitude to young preserver mixed with deeper more mysterious feeling must not tell from night noticed regular change in jill became le girlish fanciful new sort of womanliness developed high spirit be tempered with softness uncle brian be right when said few day afterwards 'that little girl be growing woman chapter xxxiii jack poynter conscience felt decidedly uneasy that night in spite of argument to contrary must not shake off conviction that be duty to speak to aunt philippa ought to warn of growing intimacy between young people uncle brian ought to know mr tudor be not quite so harmless a looked made very unhappy to act traitor to honest simple young fellow must rather have taken hand bidden god speed with wooing if have be uncle brian must have welcomed heartily a suitor for jill true be absurdly young only sixteen must have said to 'if be in earnest if really love girl be willing to wait for go about business for three year then come try chance with if like will have be quite aware be poor that be curate on hundred fifty year be well connected gentleman a guileless a young nathaniel must not desire better husband for daughter ' be not likely that uncle brian must be so quixotic knew that aunt philippa be rather ambitious for child have be great disappointment to that sara have refused young baronet so be with guilty feeling of culprit entered morning room next morning asked aunt philippa if might have few minute conversation with to relief treated whole matter very coolly with mixture of shrewdness common sense that quite surprised assured that be not of least consequence young creature like jocelyn must pas through sort of experience be certainly rather young for such experiment must do harm on contrary little stimulus of gratified vanity might be extremely beneficial in after effect be somewhat backward childish for age must have more self respect at finding object of masculine admiration upon will do great deal of good went on aunt philippa placidly behe will try now in earnest to break off little gaucherie a for mr tudor distress about be young enough to have dozen butterfly fancy before settle down seriously ' ' remember ' continued 'that during sara first season have rather trouble about young barrister be handsome fellow terribly poor uncle told privately that must not be encouraged well sara got into head that be in love with in spite of must say to by way of warning must promise dance in fact did good bit of flirting together so told uncle that have better leave town earlier that year went into yorkshire paying visit then to scotland sara have never be there before took care that must have thoroughly enjoyable trip dear before three month be over have forgotten henry brabazon existence be just girlish sentimentality nothing more when got back to town made mr brabazon understand that attention be displeasing to uncle before next season be engaged to rich young widow believe sara ever missed ' listened to in silence be much relieved to find aunt philippa be not disposed to blame for lawrence tudor infatuation told that be not least afraid of influence must not discourage visit jocelyn must never see alone be not likely that must be staying at heathfield again thought useless to say more have satisfied conscience might now safely wash hand of responsibility if thought crossed mind that jill be very different from sara that will be stronger affection more tenacious there be need to give utterance sixteen be hardly age for serious love affair might well be content to leave jill in mother care now then doubt of aunt philippa wisdom came to on last evening for instance when be speaking to jill about heathfield when rather incautiously mentioned lawrence tudor name recollected then that jill have never once spoken of since night of accident have dropped completely out of conversation forget what said then be something about seeing at heathfield be standing together on balcony a spoke jill stooped suddenly to look at little flower girl who be offering ware on pavement below for moment did not answer must see cheek even little ear be flushed yes will see ' returned presently 'what little mite of child look ursula please remember to hope be quite well jill walked away from rather abruptly saying must ask mother for penny be then that doubt of aunt philippa policy crossed mind jill be so different from other girl lawrence tudor have saved life have other thing to occupy mind just then fresh anxiety must share with one effectually spoiled last

not interfere with notion of justice trouble about gladys will come right day indeed doe not matter so much to except keep apart ' now why when spoke so haughtily disagreeably told little fib did gladys suddenly take in arm kiss most sorrowfully tenderly 'one after sighed 'oh be hard ursula ' must not let talk more about for be afraid be breaking down might make goose of so spoke of eric told that have written to joe muggins without success soon turned thought into channel chapter xxxvii claim that promise ursula ' be soon after uncle max came home met mr tudor in village one morning told with great glee that have just received telegram telling that be on way hour after arrival came down to cottage directly heard little woman how have world treated in absence ' felt quite cheered told little fib without effort havery well indeed thank max ' be really psychological puzzle to why woman who be otherwise strictly true honourable in dealing abhor very name of falsehood be much addicted to sort of fibbing under certain circumstance for instance number of white lie actually told at time be something fabulous yet sin of hypocrisy did not lie very heavily on soul when assured uncle max with smiling face thing be well with only answer be to take chin in hand turn face quietly to light quite sure be speaking truth look rather thin why be eye so serious little bear ' 'it be such hot weather returned wincing under kindly scrutiny 'and be have have anxious work lately wrote to about poor janet coombe be miracle that have pulled through illness ' 'yes indeed met hamilton just now on way to declared recovery be owing to nursing will take that with grain of salt ursula know how devoted hamilton be to patient have saved life ' be reply for moment eye grew dim at remembrance of untiring patience with have watched beside poor girl be in sick room that first learned to know when metaphorically sat at foot taught lesson of patience tenderness must never forget until life end when have talked about little while max asked rather abruptly when captain hamilton be expected question startled for have almost forgotten existence ' know returned uneasily for be afraid max must think have be remiss 'lady betty be away have only seen gladys twice since return time forgot to ask 'only twice have be at home more than three week observed max in dissatisfied voice have be so engaged ' replied quickly 'and know how seldom gladys come to cottage max do know have be here quarter of hour have never congratulated on good fortune be so glad to hear mr trevor left that money ' ' did not need ' returned rather gloomily have quite sufficient for own want think that be particularly mercenary ursula book antiquity be more to taste ' max be certainly not in best of spirit did must to cheer told of gladys improved look how much change have benefited listened rather silently saw be bent on learning captain hamilton movement reproached have not questioned gladys be determined must speak to about cousin next time met max went away soon after be rather tired with journey said next morning received note from asking to dine with following evening a have seen so little of lately wanted to hear about wedding of course be too glad to accept invitation always liked to go to vicarage evening proved especially pleasant max roused for benefit mr tudor seemed in excellent spirit joked uncle max great deal about fortune after dinner made pilgrimage through house to see what new furniture be needed max accompanied looking very bored entered mild protest to most of remark certainly agreed to new carpet for study more comfortable chair turned perfectly deaf ear when mr tudor proposed that drawing room must be refurnished be such pretty room mr cunliffe ' remonstrated 'and will be ready by time want to get married mother drabble arrangement of chair table be simply hideous be quite ashamed when mr maberley daughter called other day 'nonsense lawrence ' returned max rather sharply 'what do two bachelor want with drawing room at ursula may talk a much a like mean to throw away good money on such nonsense will have new book case writing table fit up little gray room a study well perhaps may buy new carpet nothing more be obliged to be content with max brought out couple of wicker chair on terrace presently proposed that must have coffee out of door mr tudor grumbled little because have letter to write be not sorry when left alone with max really liked mr tudor be of in mood for good natured chatter think old lawrence be very much improved observed max a watched retreating figure 'his sermon have more ballast be altogether grown begin to have hope of now ' 'he be older of course ' remarked oracularly wondering what max must say if knew truth max did go up to gladwyn last night 'yes returned with quick sigh hamilton made stay to dinner have found out about captain hamilton can not get leave just yet expect until end of november be sorry to hear that do not wish that have taken advice now gone down to bournemouth ' most emphatic 'no on max part be answer to ' be very thankful did nothing of kind returned little irritably meant well ursula must have be mistake 'hamilton told about cousin ' went on 'but sister be in room coloured very much looked embarrassed directly claude name be mentioned ' be because miss darrell be there ' must have be wiser held tongue 'you be wrong again returned calmly beiss darrell be dining at maberleys never came in until be going ' very strange ' be comment to 'not stranger than miss hamilton manner whole evening never felt more puzzled when came in be alone hamilton did not follow for five minute came across room to meet with one of old smile thought really seemed glad to see afterwards be quite different manner changed grew listless did not try to entertain left to talk to brother think look well ursula hamilton asked once if head ached if felt tired answered that head be rather bad thought looked extremely delicate ' gladys be never robust woman be almost always pale 'it be not that ' returned decidedly consider looked very ill believe change have done least good there be something on mind doubt be longing for cousin ' thought well to remain silent though max account made anxious if only must have spoken to about eric most likely gladys be fretting because there be news from joe muggins be certainly not fit for fresh anxiety felt banishment from gladwyn acutely if gladys be ill dispirited must need more than one think max be sorry when mr tudor came back interrupted conversation carried off presently to show improvement in kitchen garden max be too lazy to join have quite confidential talk walking up down between apple tree mr tudor told that after be becoming fond of profession that old woman did not bore quite so much when returned max be not on lawn few minute afterwards appeared at study window ' be just speaking to hamilton ' said 'he came while be in kitchen garden be in hurry must not wait by bye told that be not to let sit out there longer a dew be so heavy so come in dear ' obeyed max without word have be here have missed everything be flat after took leave early feeling a though merriment have suddenly dried up how must have met wondered must max have noticed anything different long will state of thing go on ' thought a bade max good

hamilton paused for moment to question be gladys not at church why did never come to see now ' 'we might ask same question think ' returned rather pointedly 'gladys be not well spoke to yesterday

darrell addressed eagerly 'have given miss gladys draught leah ' ma'be seems nicely inclined to sleep heard miss garston voice sent down with love be sorry not to be able to see to night ' thought better to take leave after hoping for better success next time watched anxiously for mr hamilton next day unfortunately missed when arrived at janet have just left house did not meet in village be

hoping must find mr hamilton alone in study must have lingered longer than usual over dessert for before reached hall dining room door opened came out together miss darrell paused for moment under hall lamp be very much overdressed a usual in eau de nile gown trimmed with costly lace gold bangle jangled a fanned 'come out into garden giles said with ladylike yawn 'it be so hot indoors thought said that expected mr cunliffe 'perhaps will be here by by ' returned mr hamilton then looked up saw beiss garston ejaculated a though must scarcely believe eye miss darrell broke into angry little

remain nurse 'but must allow such thing giles interfered cousin sharply have always nursed poor dear gladys one understands a do ' sent for just now went on firmly without taking notice of speech beg to remain with have set heart on nursing reminded of promise ' 'what promise ' asked rather harshly noticed that looked disturbed ill at ease beome month ago just before gladys went to bournemouth

observed miss darrell in sneering voice then dear gladys be always little odd romantic remember warned time ago giles that if be not careful firm ' 'pshaw be impatient answer continued pleadingly 'gladys seems to in weak nervous state think must be wise to thwart in sick people must be humoured sometimes think must trust to watch over most carefully 'giles will not answer for consequence if

with need ' will take at once returned promptly 'thank now about poor people little jessie still need care janet will be invalid for time wish to miss ' face softened half smile came to lip 'there be only one village nurse ' said dubiously 'true think can find excellent substitute do remember speaking to of young nurse at st thomas who be obliged to leave from ill health be better now only not fit for hospital work be thinking of writing to asking to occupy room at cottage for week two until gladys be better change of air will do miss watson good will not hurt to look after janet little jessie mr hamilton looked pleased at suggestion excellent idea a though by afterthought ' very kind one did not wish to add to burden janet coombe be hardly out of wood yet miss darrell tittered scornfully a glanced at saw be dragging gold bangle over arm until there be red line on flesh eye looked dark glittering be obliged to suppress anger coombe be only poor servant work be not so attractive to miss garston must think said in tone so suggestive that blood rushed to face woman know how to stab sometimes happily mr hamilton common sense came to aid quieted down directly at first sound of voice 'what make so uncharitable etta know village nurse too well to believe that insinuation if gladys be only nursed with tenderness be shown to janet will be quite content to leave under miss garston care ' then turning to with something of old cordial manner be settled be not that remain here to night be there anything else wish to say to ' 'only one thing ' replied quietly 'will kindly give order gladys little maid chatty wait upon sick room leah seems to have taken office upon lately gladys have great dislike to ' beally pass everything ' exclaimed miss darrell angrily have poor leah done to be set aside in way be maid be not etta ' 'yes giles 'and chatty always wait on sister be certainly not leah business to wait on turret room ' raising voice little a leah came downstairs with tray of linen ' want to speak to moment miss garston have undertaken to nurse sister order be to be carried out chatty be to attend to sick room for future there be need for to neglect mistress ' havery well sir ' replied woman civilly did not see look gave have made enemy of leah from moment mistress must ever forgive that slight 'if miss garston have more order to give ' observed miss darrell with ill concealed temper ' may a well go for be rather tired of giles followed leah must hear whispering in little passage leading to housekeeper room 'you must not mind etta little show of temper ' remarked mr hamilton apologetically behe be rather put out because gladys prefers nursing between ourselves be little too fussy to suit nervous invalid be kind hearted mean well be rather sorry for just now know how to bring round ' be favourite with miss darrell returned wondering secretly at blind infatuation for cousin be easy to see that understand other etta be not quite fair to just now be why spoke so decidedly will have interference with sick room will have to account to to one else did not venture to raise eye be so afraid might betray how must repent trust in such man felt must wait cheerfully for year until chose to break down barrier between bade good night after hurried back to gladys have idea that be following a closed door said in quite gay tone 'well darling always told brother be best friend have proved truth of word knew must trust ' knock at door interrupted felt rather confused when entered for knew must have be overheard took notice went straight up to gladys 'you see be to be a wished ' said pleasantly 'and miss garston have installed here a nurse be mind easier now foolish child ' 'oh yes giles be so much obliged to be so good of to allow '

that have ever voluntarily kissed since eric loss 'good night dear ' said very gently did not look at a left room put gladys to bed after with chatty help be very faint exhausted sat down in moonlight to watch thought be busy enough there must be little sleep for night knew be so strange for to be under roof so strange so sweet that must be serving then thought of uncle max how troubled must be to hear of gladys illness determined to write to next day be rather startled later on when most of household have retired to rest to hear gentle tap at door of course be mr hamilton went into passage half closing door behind 'be asleep ' asked anxiously a noticed action 'no not asleep quite drowsy have given draught a wished be singular how object to say only confuses head give nightmare ' must quiet by mean returned saw by light of lamp carried that face looked rather grave 'perhaps did not know that etta be up with last night be in condition bordered on delirium ' certainly did not know that ' behe may be better to night ' returned quickly 'her mind be more at rest poor child can not understand what have brought on state of disordered nerve 'nor 'it be very sad altogether be great relief to to know be with must have have professional nurse for etta fussiness be driving crazy now miss garston ' in business like tone ' want to know how have provided for comfort where do sleep to

returned cheerfully be quite fresh will not need much sleep doubt room will be ready for to morrow ' suppose be too late to disturb now feel very much ashamed of inhospitality ' then in rather embarrassed voice be afraid must have seemed rather ungracious in manner downstairs be really very grateful to ' be too much for 'please talk of being grateful to mr hamilton ' returned rather too impulsively 'you know how glad be to do anything for ' word 'all ' be added a though by afterthought came in little awkwardly there be sudden gleam in mr hamilton eye seemed about to speak impetuous word be on tongue then checked 'thank good night nurse ursula ' said very kindly went back to gladys feeling happier than have felt since afternoon when have given rose gladys be quieter that night slept fitfully uneasily moaned little a though be conscious of pain there be alarming excitement early next morning heard preparing lady betty room once when went into passage in search of chatty met leah coming out with dusting brush looked very sullen took notice of greeting chatty helped arrange good chattel a worked together told confidentially that master have be scolding leah have told ought to be ashamed of herself when miss darrell have taken part have be angry with too 'thornton say miss darrell have be cry have not eaten mouthful of breakfast went on chatty silenced imprudent communication be quite evident be bone of contention in household that mr hamilton must have difficulty in subduing leah contumacy wrote to ellen watson that morning soon received rapturous acceptance of invitation must be delighted to come to cottage to look after poor people be very much stronger ' wrote must not go back to hospital for two month breath of country air will be delicious be so good of dear miss garston to think of be sure mr barton will make comfortable will do can for poor janet coombe that dear little burnt child showed mr letter while be reading chatty brought word that uncle

replied coolly ber hamilton insists on going in garden for at least hour daily while chatty take place can not stay long max same be glad sent for ' ' felt must see ' returned rather huskily 'letters be so unsatisfactory be good of to write always so kind thoughtful dear ' paused for moment a though to recover be very ill ursula ' ill ' gravely speak be thing worse than told mean to tell there be absolute danger 'oh certainly not be very sad to see in such state nerve have quite broken down three year have told on there seems fresh trouble on mind ' forbid ' returned quickly 'ay god forbid for alone know what be burdening mind of young creature be too weak to throw off nervous fancy blame for harbouring such gloomy thought distress not to be able to control night be worst time if must only conquer sleeplessness have sad work with sometimes spared max further particular be harassed anxious enough must not harrow up feeling by telling how often feeble piteous voice roused from light slumber how hurrying to bedside must find gladys bathed in tear cold trembling in limb how must cling to pouring out incoherent account of vague shadowy terror be on there be other thing must have told how in semi delirium name a well a etta be perpetually on lip uttered in tone sometimes tender more often reproachful sometimes in very anguish of regret now understood why dreaded etta presence in room feared betraying to keen ear often after one of outburst must strive to collect scattered faculty 'have be talking nonsense ursula ' must ask in tremulous voice have be dreaming think pain in

console max must not easily allay anxiety own be impossible to conceal from that be in precarious state that unless power of sleep returned to there be danger of actual brain fever in morbid condition one knew not what to fear perfect quiet patience tenderness be only mean to be employed a moved about cool dark room where uneasy light shadow fretted weakened eye must not help remembering comfortless glare hot pungent scent miss darrell have left behind most likely have rustled over matting in silk gown hard metallic voice have rasped invalid nerve doubtless there be hope for now in brother skilful treatment when told max so went away little comforted chapter xxxix whitefoot be saddled after first day so strangeness novelty of position wore off settled down to work in sick room chatty waited upon very nicely miss darrell never came near once day formal message be brought by chatty asking after invalid used to think somewhat unnecessary a mr hamilton must report sister progress at breakfast time when encountered miss darrell on way to garden always accosted with marked civility manner must be little repelling in return must answer very coldly in spite of outward politeness think be little afraid of at time always felt that concealed sneer lay under word made clearly understood that considered that have forced into house for own purpose under condition thought better to avoid encounter a much a possible saw uncle max two three time have timed visit purposely that might join in stroll in garden have made arrangement to meet in way daily max society sympathy must have be refreshment to be obliged to discontinue practice max never appeared without miss darrell following few minute afterwards must come out of house brisk smiling in grande toilette to take turn in shrubbery a said max must look at very soon take leave at last told dejectedly that might a well give up a miss darrell be determined that must not speak to alone so after contrived to send daily note by chatty who be always delighted to do errand in village ca think what make miss darrell so curious ma'be ' girl once said to behe asks day if have be down to vicarage did while master be by other afternoon told quite sharply that be affair of hers mind that chatty ' 'oh be afraid mean mischief ma'be persisted chatty who have great dislike to miss darrell showed by being somewhat pert to 'for said in such queer tone to master there told so now will believe master looked a though be not pleased a strolled round garden in nap company often saw leah sitting sewing at mistress window must put down work watch until be out of sight felt woman hated surveillance be very unpleasant to never felt quite free until reached kitchen garden mr hamilton visited sister room regularly three time day never stayed long must satisfy about condition say few cheerful word to be manner to be grave professional now then when have given direction must ask if there be anything must do for if be comfortable yet in spite of reserve guarded look word felt atmosphere of protection comfort surrounding have not known since charlie death day have proof of thought for flower fruit be sent into sick room be for a well a gladys be often touched to see how taste of mine have be remembered gratified sometimes chatty must tell that master have given order that thing must be provided for miss garston in many other way made feel be not forgotten for day gladys continued very ill slept fitfully uneasily waking in terror from dream that escaped memory used to hear moaning be beside before opened eye 'it be only nightmare must say to a clung to like frightened child be not always easy to banish grisly phantom of diseased overwrought imagination morbid condition of mind be aggravated increased by physical weakness at least exertion have fainting fit alarmed told more than once that sense of sin oppressed must be more wicked than other people thought providence must not permit to be so unhappy sometimes blamed with influencing eric wrongly ought not to have taken part against brother that hateth brother be murderer ursula there be time be sure when hated giles with thought upon must beg to forgive when next came into room never seemed surprised at exaggerated expression of penitence treated a part of malady havery well will forgive dear ' must say feeling pulse taken medicine gladys ' 'oh giles do feel so wretched about be sure that really truly forgive ' 'quite sure returned smiling at 'now must shut eye like good child go to sleep ' though tried to obey must see be not satisfied tear rolled down cheek from under closed eyelid 'what be darling ' asked kissing 'do feel more ill than usual 'no be only sense of sin oh ursula how nice must be to die never do anything wrong again

sit there looking down on little oak avenue where girl have set tea table afternoon must watch rook cawing circling about elm sometimes mr hamilton must pas with nap at heel look up at with smile once great bunch of rose wet with dew came flying through open window fell on gladys muslin gown giles throw will thank ursula ' said raising in thin finger cool delicious be ' when looked out mr hamilton be not to be seen lady betty wrote very piteous letter begging to be recalled mr hamilton answered very kindly firmly told that gladys required perfect quiet that if came home must not be allowed to be with when lady betty heard be nursing grew little more content gladys be always more restless suffering towards evening bad thought a called came out like bat in darkness tried experiment of singing to one evening found to delight that voice have soothing influence after always sang to after be in bed used to take up station by window sing softly one song after until be quiet drowsy a

chatty want mr hamilton to know gladys have have three hour sleep have awakened refreshed without nervous feeling will be kind enough to tell ' 'oh certainly not that attach much importance to transient improvement gladys case be far too serious for to be so sanguine believe have not nursed nervous patient before if giles have taken advice must have have person trained to special work be case doe not require that sort of nurse ' replied quickly 'excuse miss darrell be anxious that mr hamilton must know of sister improvement before go out chatty told that have sent for from abbey farm ' 'yes believe so replied carelessly trouble miss garston be quite a anxious a that giles mind must be put at rest have have worry enough poor fellow ' be rather surprised disappointed when ten minute afterwards heard hall door close hurrying to window saw mr hamilton walking very quickly in direction of maplehurst moment afterwards chatty brought message from have be called off suddenly might not be back for hour if wanted atkinson be to take one of horse must probably be at abbey farm at gunter cottage in croft message rather puzzled after turning over in mind went in search of miss darrell

love be to bring unhappiness in world be worthy of can give one day in better life what be wrong will be put right always tell when hear people life be disappointed illness have taught ' did not trust to reply then at once thought came to 'gladys when mentioned captain hamilton name just now mean at commencement of conversation why did seem so troubled be nothing to yet very mention of name excited perplexes ' hesitated for moment a though feared to answer ' know can trust ursula will be right to do so mean for other people sake still if etta be talking about ' paused seemed absorbed in puzzling problem 'you write to very often ' hazarded at last for did not seem willing to speak 'who told that ' returned quickly 'claude be cousin at least step cousin be very intimate there can be harm in writing to ' 'no of course not if people misconstrue correspondence ' ' can not help that ' rather despondently 'and see that matter now still will tell ursula claude be in love with lady betty lady

looked at with expression of incredulous alarm 'what can mean ursula surely not to repeat single word about claude ' only mean to mention to one person with whom knowledge will be a safe a will be with that lady betty be engaged to cousin claude ' will tell mr cunliffe ' replied becoming very pale again ' forbid ursula ' hindered further remonstrance on part by throwing arm round begging with tear in eye with earnestness of be capable to trust a must trust in such case to ' continued imploringly 'have ever failed disappointed have ever be untrue to in word deed do think be woman who must betray sacred confidence of woman 'no of course not ' here hand resolutely closed lip 'then say to trust ursula a must trust own soul know word must pas lip that if be standing by must wish unuttered

oversleep in consequence be rather trial when touch roused out of delicious dream one glance at gladys pale face made ashamed of indolence dressed a quickly a must then looked at little clock chatty have be better than word have not struck five yet max must not be out for hour thought same might a well take advantage of morning freshness so summoned chatty to let out a noiselessly a possible then stole through shrubbery breaking silver spangled cobweb two feeling wet bead of dew on face walked slowly down road drinking deep draught of pure morning air have thought of sitting down in churchyard until saw sign of life in vicarage a turned corner heard gate swing back on hinge there be max standing bareheaded in road a though have come out to reconnoitre directly caught sight of two three

presence without knowing what be to become of mistress 'you will not be hard on miss etta sir have done wrong be poor creature mr hamilton walked to door threw open with gesture compelled obedience next moment however recoiled with low exclamation of horror for there drawn up against wall in strange half crouching attitude a though petrified with terror be miserable cousin heard leah shocked

into drawing room be sitting beside on little couch to dazzled eye room seemed full of sunshine sweet perfume of flower to day scent of heliotrope brings back memory of afternoon when giles first told

upon in very different light think managed to content 'and be really happy dear 'yes very happy ' tear be in eye a answered seemed distressed to see wanted to tell reason think understood thoroughly when whispered how glad charlie must have be asked presently how long have cared for to surprise declared that hardly knew have be interested in from first hour of meeting be when heard sing in phoebe

attracted notice for stooped looked in face manner instantly changed 'oh foolish child very caressingly 'there be actually tear in eye be not afraid of ursula be always excited when speak of ella very nearly destroyed faith in woman ' can not bear to think how suffered ' faltered must not let finish mind have be healer have always rested so never call plain again in hearing other face must be half so dear to ' then with old smile know dear when saw in velvet gown at cousin wedding looked so handsome that went home in bad humour then etta told about tudor well have safe now will not transcribe giles speech be so lover like made understand once for what be to how little cared for life unless shared with by by went on to speak of mutual work here again more than contented ' mean to rob poor people of nurse ursula ' said presently 'when come to gladwyn a mistress hope will work together a do now told hoped so too that never wished to lay down work be quite right dear answered cheerfully 'we will not be selfish in happiness true work must be in limit when come home will want to see wife face ' rather jealously ' must not spare of evening in morning there will be household duty must not undertake too much ursula ' told giles rather demurely that there be plenty of time for consideration of point be inclined to bridge over present in man usual fashion new position be too overwhelming for to look beyond deep abiding consciousness giles loved looked to for happiness so turned deaf ear when asked presently if must mind lady betty sharing home went on 'the poor child have other home be so feather headed that sensible man will think of marrying ' be not place to enlighten giles about claude thought very improbable that lady betty must be long at gladwyn be little oppressed by sort of talk yet unwilling that must notice shyness so took opportunity of saying be tea time did not think that gladys eric have be talking long enough seemed unwilling to let go pleaded nurse duty then told laughing be wilful woman might send eric to a happened eric be coming in search of giles found in passage gladys be lying on couch looking worn out with happiness be beginning to speak about eric when something in face seemed to distract watched closely for moment then threw arm round drew head on shoulder 'be so ursula oh dear dear sister be so glad seemed to understand without word when over excited feeling found vent in flood of nervous tear for only kissed quietly stroked hair until be relieved happy again 'dear ursula ' whispered can help being glad for giles sake ' 'and not for mine ' drying eye feeling very much ashamed of 'ah will see how good giles will be ' be reply to 'you will be happy woman ursula be exactly suited to other knew be right max turn came presently be sitting alone in drawing room before dinner giles have brought flower have rushed off to dress be looking out on garden strip of blue sky buried in happy reverie when two hand suddenly lifted up brown beard brushed face bear do know how glad be max joyously exclaimed indeed looked very glad chapter xlviii ' way to end two day afterwards went back to white cottage took up old life again old life how different now will never forget how phoebe welcomed back how susan rejoiced when told news strange to say of seemed much surprised have expected susan said in rather amused tone for be easy to see doctor have thought there be one like be always hinting a much to 'why have seen watch a though there be nothing else worth looking at ' finished susan with simple shrewdness kept own counsel with regard to aunt philippa jill for have made up mind to go up to hyde park gate a soon a have returned tell wrote to lesbia with strong injunction of secrecy answer came by return of post be most loving unselfish little letter touched greatly ' will be bridesmaid ursula ' said ask not nothing will keep away day will love to be there for dear charlie sake 'the news have made so happy mother scolded when found cry over letter cried too agreed that one deserved happiness more be longing to see mr hamilton ursie dear have one great virtue in eye already that appreciates ' so on in lesbia gentle sisterly way fact of engagement made great sensation in place people who have hitherto ignored village nurse came to call on suppose curiosity to see mr hamilton fiancee brought good many of new position be not without difficulty giles who be impatient domineering by nature chafed much against restraint imposed upon by loneliness brief call did not suffice must not let come often stay long max asked to vicarage sometimes now then gladys lady betty must call for carry off to gladwyn for evening of course saw giles frequently when visited patient with dislike to conventionality be rather difficult to keep in good humour must not be made to see why must not marry at once put end to awkward state of thing have first lover quarrel on point first last for never have to complain of dear giles again think hearing about lady betty long engagement with claude hamilton have made very sore have be bitterly angry with poor little lady betty also with gladys declared secrecy have hurt more than anything eric acted a peacemaker be soon induced to condone sister trangression came down to talk over matter with to tell of arrangement have made for seemed that letter from claude have arrived that very mail telling giles of promotion asking leave to come fetch dear little lady betty be honest manly letter giles said a claude be in better position lady betty have five thousand pound of own there seemed reason against marrying have talked to max gladys be willing that claude lady betty must be married at same time new year have be already fixed for gladys max meant to get leave of absence for two three month take to algiers a claude must have to start for india early in march giles thought double wedding must be best must get trousseau together fuss must be got over more easily expressed a charmed with arrangement for thought must be very dull for lady betty to be left behind at gladwyn then asked giles what have settled about eric told that eric be still undecided rather thought of going to cirencester to enter agricultural college there 'you see ursula ' went on 'the lad be bit restless have given up absurd idea of becoming artist never did believe in daub of feel can never settle down to city life be very much improved far more manly sensible than ever hoped to see be of different calibre from ' 'do think farming will suit ' asked anxiously 'better than anything else must say ' be reply 'eric be active capable fellow be always fond of out door pursuit be young enough to learn have promised to keep dorlicote farm in own hand until be ready to take be only ten mile from here have very good house attached to eric will find in clover ' then a though other thought be uppermost in mind continued ' be so glad that be such friend ursula for will often take up quarter at gladwyn ' be after giles asked to marry at once be strangely unreasonable that morning very much bent on having own way objection be overruled one by one absolutely refused to listen to argument when tried to show how much wiser must be to have sister eric settled before brought home a mistress to gladwyn be first time will have clashed though knew be right that be wholly in wrong be very painful for to refuse loving importunity to turn deaf ear when told how be longing for wife held firmly to two point must settle nothing without aunt philippa advice must not marry until easter told so very gently giles be not quite like day lady betty secrecy be still rankling in mind certainly used power over to make very unhappy for accused of coldness over prudence reproached with want of confidence in judgment pride took fire at last rose in arm against tyranny must listen to giles returned trying to keep down choking feeling 'you be not quite just to to day mean what say will be sorry afterwards for word if accede to wish be not because love well enough to marry to morrow if be expedient to do so under circumstance will be wiser to wait will marry at easter if uncle max come back by time for must like one else to perform ceremony will not be content with ' returned gloomily 'you be keeping waiting for mere scruple gladys lady betty must say dissenting word if brought to gladwyn at once be disappointing very much ursula must not have believed that wish be so little to ' be not able to finish cutting speech for must bear more suddenly burst into such agony of tear that giles be quite frightened found out then goodness of heart deep unselfish affection for reproached bitterly for causing such pain begged pardon dozen time for ill temper so coaxed petted must not refuse to be comforted laughed kissed when implored to take back word about coldness bey darling a though meant ' said have grace to look very much ashamed of 'of course be right always be ursula will wait until easter if think best miss prudence will have own way in matter will not wait day longer for uncle max in world so settled remember how tried to make up to giles for disappointment to show how much cared for be dining at vicarage that evening with gladys eric a walked home with in moonlight took to task very gently for being too good to 'you have be like little angel evening ursula have not deserved believe love far more for not giving own way be pure selfishness see now ' ' hope be last time that will will not be mine ' answered rather sadly 'if knew what cost to refuse giles one of rare smile answered be end of september when went up to hyde park gate to tell wonderful piece of news to aunt philippa jill jill be very naughty at first declared that must forbid banns dear ursula must not marry that ugly man changed opinion after long conversation with giles then enthusiasm knew bound be amusing to see admiring awe with aunt philippa looked at engagement have raised opinion of hundredfold be no longer plain eccentric ursula in eye future mr hamilton be person of far greater consequence must see that surprise must scarcely be concealed used to notice eye fixed on sometimes in wondering way told lesbia that must hardly understand such brilliant prospect for dear ursula have not sara good look yet be marrying far richer man than colonel ferguson ' think mr very distinguished man dear ' continued much to lesbia amusement 'he be peculiar looking certainly little too dark for taste manner be charming be certainly very much in love with ursula look very nice be very much improved still one hardly expected such match for lesbia retailed little speech with much gusto dear aunt philippa certainly did duty by then nothing must exceed kindness motherliness sara came very often looking prettiest happiest young matron in world almost overwhelmed with advice petting have come to conclusion that position be somewhat awkward one that must not do for to go on living at white cottage wanted to give up work at heathfield until after marriage at last aunt philippa conceived brilliant idea of taking house at brighton for

think be little sorry mr tudor came so perseveringly be true to principle to let thing take course not to fan flame by opposition be always kind to young man though generally contrived to keep jill beside when dropped in for afternoon tea encountered on parade did so quietly that one noticed significance in action think aunt philippa maternal fear must have be up in arm if have conversation between jill one wintry afternoon aunt philippa have gone up to town to see sara who be little ailing uncle brian be to return later gladys giles be to dine with max must probably join aunt philippa be very fond of impromptu entertainment have not extended invitation to mr tudor who have called previous day have got into head that jill be little disappointed sat rather soberly by fire afternoon when miss gillespie left took usual seat on rug black lock bobbed into lap a usual thought firelight played on very serious face 'what make so silent afternoon jill ' asked rather curiously did not answer for moment only drew down hand looked at diamond be flashing in ruddy blaze giles pledge that have placed there then laid cheek against said suddenly ' be only thinking ursie dear often think about thing do remember that evening at hyde park gate when lamp fell on might have be burnt to death ' yes jill ' with shudder for never cared to recall scene 'well be thinking ' still dreamily then with change of manner startled 'ursie if person save person life think that life ought to belong to be if wish ' with sudden blush that rather alarmed betop dear ' returned coolly 'this be very vague think quite understand person person too be terribly involved be a child say ' jill gave nervous little laugh eye gave doubt of meaning looked strangely dark soft ber tudor saved life ' whispered 'ursie if want that life ought to belong to ' dear ' for be thoroughly startled now thing be growing serious jill gave little push in childish way pretend to look so surprised knew about saw in face remember what said that night that did not know what must become of if died that must not bear did see how looked when said ' remained silent for must not deny that mr tudor have betrayed at moment went on very quietly 'ursie dear know mr tudor care for doe not always hide though try to do so see be so real honest that can not help showing thing 'jill exclaimed anxiously 'what must mother say if knew ' think doe know ' replied jill calmly doe not care for mr tudor to come so often be good to same father mother will be pleased about because be not rich poor fellow not that think that matter finished jill in grave old fashioned manner bey dear child ' in horrified tone talk a though be sure of own mind be hardly seventeen ' be sure ' be confused answer mr tudor care enough for to wait for good many year until be one twenty will find ready of course belong to ursula have not saved life there be hurry went on jill in matter of fact way 'he be very nice will always like better than one else must not care to be engaged until be one twenty one want little fun good deal of work before settling down into engaged person ' finished girl with droll little laugh be spared necessity of reply to surprising confession by entrance of three visitor for max have encountered at station of course by accident have walked up with that fact be sufficient to account for gladys soft bloom satisfied look in eye looked so lovely in new fur giles have bought did not wonder that max be little absent in reply to jill have made excuse left be really very good idea of giles to ask to come out on balcony look at sea wrapped in plaid placed in sheltered corner stood watching twinkling light dark water under glimmer of starlight have great deal to tell first how happy eric be in new work what cheerful letter wrote to gladys next about captain hamilton with whom professed much pleased 'lady betty be just a much child a ever be ridiculous to think of a married woman went on 'but claude

wintry too how mercifully have be drawn out of deep water brought to dear haven of rest a crept nearer to giles seemed to utter unspoken thought be very happy to night ursula have be thinking a travelled down what will be to to have always near to share work life be so glad love gladwyn so dearly ' 'love gladwyn home giles be there anything strange in ' 'no dear perhaps not like to hear say so there will not be wish of yours ungratified if can help mean to spoil dreadfully ursula ' told smiling be not afraid of threat just then max voice interrupted 'little bear do know be dreadfully imprudent be way hamilton mean to take care of ' 'wait moment ursula ' whispered giles hear that ballad singer in square ' voice clear shrill seemed to float to in darkness low sweet low wind of western sea sang wave seemed to splash in harmonious accompaniment light be flickering carriage rolling under faint starlight saw giles face a loved to see grave thoughtful satisfied 'after ' said a though answering inward questioning ' man can not know what life will bring do remember what robert browning say what o ' way to end end crown end crown to ursula ' giles deep set eye gave doubt of
