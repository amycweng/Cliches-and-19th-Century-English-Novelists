swithin started turned faint lamp light be sufficient to reveal face to 'tedious work lady constantine ' answered without betraying much surprise 'doing best to watch phenomenal star a may call ' 'you

afternoon have decided that diocesan synod whose annual session at melchester have occurred in month previous must afford solid unimpeachable subject to launch during meal whenever conversation flagged that must be one likely to win respect of spiritual chieftain for a introducer accordingly in further belief that must not have too much of good thing mr torkingham not only acted upon idea at

general yet interesting enough to swithin at length louis stepped upon grass picked up something have lain there turned out to be bowl throwing forward took second bowled towards first jack bishop who seemed to be in sprightly mood followed suit bowled one in curve towards jack turning speaking to lady constantine a concluded feat a have not left gravelled terrace raised voice so that word reached swithin distinctly 'do follow ' asked gaily ' be not skilful ' said ' always bowl narrow ' bishop meditatively paused 'this moment reminds one of scene in richard second said ' mean duke of york

to time that must go to look for upon descended stair left swithin again alone few minute later bishop suddenly looked at watch lady constantine having withdrawn towards house apparently apologizing to louis bishop came down terrace through door into churchyard swithin hastened downstairs joined in path under sunny wall of aisle glance met be with consternation that swithin beheld change that few

yesterday line of face be firm dark eye whisker be overspread with gravity a gazed upon swithin from repose of stable figure be like evangelized king of spade come to have out with knave of heart to return for moment to louis glanville have be somewhat struck with abruptness of bishop departure more particularly by circumstance that have gone away by private door into churchyard instead of by regular exit on other side true great men be known to suffer from absence of mind bishop helmsdale having dim sense that have entered by door yesterday might have unconsciously turned thitherward now louis upon whole thought little of matter being now left quite alone on lawn seated in arbour began smoking arbour be situated against churchyard wall atmosphere be a still a air of hot house only fourteen inch of brickwork divided louis from scene of bishop interview with st cleeve a voice on lawn have be audible to swithin in churchyard voice in churchyard must be heard without difficulty from close corner of lawn sooner have louis lit cigar than dialogue began be here st cleeve ' said bishop hardly replying to swithin good morning ' fear be little late well request to to meet may have seemed somewhat unusual seeing that be stranger till few hour ago ' mind that if lordship wish to see ' ' thought best to see regarding confirmation yesterday reason for taking more active step with

life ' voice of swithin in next remark showed how tremendously attack of bishop have told upon feeling louis of course did not know reason why word must have affected precisely a did to one in secret double embarrassment arising from misapprehended ethic inability to set matter right because word of secrecy to be inviolable must have accounted for young man emotion sufficiently well ' be very sorry lordship must have seen anything objectionable said swithin beay ask what be ' 'you know what be something in chamber forced to above conclusion disguised feeling of sorrow at time for obvious reason never in whole life be so shocked ' what lord ' what saw 'pardon bishop helmsdale said just now that be stranger so what saw in cabin concern only ' 'there contradict twenty four hour ago remark must have be plausible enough by presenting for confirmation at hand have invited investigation into principle swithin sighed ' admit ' said 'and what do find ' 'you say reprehensible might at least let hear proof can do more sir can let see ' there be pause louis glanville be so highly interested that stood upon seat of arbour looked through leafage over wall bishop have produced article from pocket 'what be ' said swithin laboriously scrutinizing thing 'why see ' said bishop holding out between finger thumb in swithin face ' bracelet coral bracelet found wanton object on bed in cabin

sturdy bey lord be in difficult position said mournfully 'how difficult nobody can tell can not explain there be insuperable reason against will take word of assurance be not so bad a seem day will prove till then only ask to suspend judgment on ' bishop shook head incredulously went towards vicarage a if have lost hearing swithin followed with eye louis followed direction of swithin before bishop have reached vicarage entrance lady constantine crossed in front of have basket on arm be in fact going to visit of poorer cottage who must believe bishop now to be same man that have be moment before darkness left face a if have come out of cave look be sweetness shine gaiety a again greeted viviette xxviii conversation arose between bishop lady constantine be of lively reproductive kind can not be ended during reasonable halt of two people going in opposite direction turned walked with along laurel screened lane bordered churchyard till voice died away in distance swithin then aroused from thoughtful regard of went out of churchyard by gate seeing now to be left alone on scene louis glanville descended from post of observation in arbour came through private doorway on to spot among graf where bishop st cleeve have conversed on tombstone still lay coral bracelet dr helmsdale have flung down there in indignation for agitated introspective mood into swithin have be thrown have banished from mind thought of securing trinket putting in pocket louis picked up little red scandal breeding thing while walking on with in hand observed tabitha lark approaching church in

tabitha swithin during confirmation bishop stern statement a to where have found bracelet have no longer doubt that belonged to 'poor girl said to sang in undertone deri dera l'histoire n'est pa

have found ' said to ' wo state where put away say more about will not mention either now go on into church where be going may heaven have mercy on soul dear ' sir ' said tabitha with perplexity yet inclined to be pleased only recognizing in situation fact that lady constantine humorous brother be making present 'you be much obliged to ' ' o yes 'well miss lark have discovered secret see ' may that be mr glanville 'that be in love ' ' admit sir who told so ' 'nobody only put two two together now take advice beware of lover be bad lot bring young woman to tear beome do dare say ' 'and think that in particular case latter alternative will hold good generally think will be lucky though world before in same situation have be otherwise ' o yes must die outright of despair ' think will be lucky in case ' how do know so much since case have not yet arrived ' asked tabitha tossing head little disdainfully le than might have done if have not obtained charter for discourse by giving bracelet tabitha ' tell have not arrived ' said with anger ' have not got lover everybody know have be insinuating thing for to say so louis laughed thinking how natural be that girl must so emphatically deny circumstance must not bear curious inquiry 'why of course meant ' said soothingly beo then will not accept ' ' did know meant ' replied wo accept think ought not to jest on such

remembered having seen bracelet with just effect gracing wrist of lady constantine upon one occasion temporary self surrender to sophism that if mr louis glanville chose to give away anything belonging to sister tabitha have right to take without question be soon checked by resolve to carry tempting string of coral to ladyship that evening inquire truth about decided on slipped bracelet into pocket played voluntary with light heart bishop helmsdale did not tear away from welland till about two o'clock afternoon be three hour later than have intended to leave be with feeling of relief that swithin looking from top of tower saw carriage drive out from vicarage into turnpike road whirl right reverend gentleman again towards warborne coast being now clear of swithin meditated how to see viviette explain what have happened with in view waited where be till evening came on meanwhile lady constantine brother dined by at welland house have not met since morning a soon a be left alone louis said have done very well so far might have be little warmer ' 'done well ' asked with surprise 'yes with bishop difficult question be how to follow up advantage how be to keep in sight of '

went out of house to enjoy cigar in shrubbery on reaching favourite seat found have left cigar case behind immediately returned for when approached window by have emerged saw swithin st cleeve standing there in dusk talking to viviette inside st cleeve back be towards louis whether at signal from by accident quickly turned recognized glanville whereupon raising hat to lady constantine young

'then do let everybody pas way only that illustrious youth because be so good looking ' ' have strict rule in case mr st cleeve be acquaintance of mine can certainly come here if chooses colour rose somewhat spoke warmly louis be too cautious bird to reveal to what have suddenly dawned upon mind that sister in common with to thinking unhappy tabitha lark have be foolish enough to get interested in phenomenon of parish scientific adonis resolved to cure at once tender feeling if existed by letting out secret must inflame dignity against weakness ' good looking young man said with eye where

swithin low rank on one side sordid struggle might be in store for st cleeve being in unhappy case of deriving existence through two channel of society resulted that seemed to belong to either that according to altitude of beholder louis threw light entirely on swithin agricultural side bringing out old mr martin connexion way of life with luminous distinctness till lady constantine became

old fogey same said st cleeve petulantly yet on other hand swithin nature be so fresh ingenuous notwithstanding recent affair have somewhat denaturalized that for man in bishop position to think immoral be almost a overwhelming a if have actually be so at moment must scarcely bear existence under so gross suspicion what be union with lady constantine worth to when by reason of be thought reprobate by almost only man who have professed to take interest in certainly by contrast with air built image of a worthy astronomer received by world envied husband of viviette present imputation be

detailing whole case be impossible to do on own responsibility still recognized understanding entered into with viviette before marriage to be a binding a ever that initiative in disclosing union must come from yet hardly doubted that must take initiative when told of extraordinary reprimand in churchyard be what have come to do when louis saw standing at window before have said dozen word to viviette motioned to go on mechanically did ere must sufficiently collect thought on advisability otherwise did not however go far while louis sister be discussing in drawing room lingered musing in churchyard hoping that might be able to escape join in consultation so earnestly desired at last found opportunity to do a soon a louis have left room shut in upstairs ran out by window in direction swithin have taken when footstep began crunching on gravel came forward from churchyard door embraced other in haste then in few short panting word explained to that brother have heard witnessed

troublesome little web of evidence 'oh can keep ' said brightly 'it be very good of to bring back keep for very own take mr glanville at word explain tabitha divide strand into two bracelet there be enough of to make pair ' next morning in pursuance of resolution louis wandered round ground till saw girl for whom be waiting enter church accosted over wall puzzling to view coral bracelet blushed on of young arm for have promptly carried out suggestion of lady constantine 'you be wearing see tabitha with other murmured mean to keep ' 'yes mean to keep ' 'you be sure be not lady constantine find have one like ' 'quite sure have better take to sir ask ' said saucy girl 'oh be not necessary ' replied louis considerably shaken in conviction when louis met sister short time after did not catch a have intended to do by saying suddenly have found bracelet know who have got ' 'you can not have found ' replied quietly 'for have discovered that be never lost stretching out hand revealed one on viviette having performed same operation with remaining bracelet that have advised tabitha to do with other louis be mystified by mean convinced in spite of attempt to hoodwink mind returned to

meanwhile louis glanville have returned to house told sister in most innocent manner that have be in company of st cleeve that afternoon getting few wrinkle on astronomy that have grown so friendly over fascinating subject a to leave alternative to invite st cleeve to dine at welland same evening with view to certain research in library afterwards must quite make allowance for youthful error into may have be betrayed louis continued sententiously beince for scientist be really admirable doubt bishop caution will not be lost upon a for birth connexion ca help ' lady constantine showed such alacrity in adopting idea of having swithin to dinner ignored 'youthful error so completely a almost to betray in fulfilment of promise to see oftener have be intending to run across to swithin on identical evening now trouble must be saved in very delightful way by exercise of little hospitality viviette must not have dared to suggest dinner time came with swithin exhibiting rather blushing

to leave for home when glanville must unearth other volume so detain yet half hour george ' said looking at clock when swithin be at last really about to depart ' did know be so late why not stay here to night st cleeve be very dark way to place be awkward cross cut over field 'it must not inconvenience at mr st cleeve if must care to stay ' said lady constantine ' be afraid fact be wanted to take observation at twenty minute past two ' began swithin 'oh now never mind observation ' said louis 'that be only excuse do to morrow night now will stay be settled viviette say must stay will have hour of charming intellectual research viviette obeyed with delightful ease stay mr st cleeve said sweetly 'well in truth can do without observation replied young man a gave way 'it be not of greatest consequence ' thus be arranged research among tome be not prolonged to extent that louis have suggested in three quarter of hour from time have retired to respective room lady constantine being on one side of west corridor swithin opposite louis at further end have person followed louis when withdrew that watcher must have discovered on peeping through key hole of door that be engaged in one of oddest of occupation for such man sweeping down from ceiling by mean of walking cane long cobweb lingered on high in corner keeping stretched upon cane gently opened door set candle in position on mat that light shone down corridor thus guided by ray passed out slipperless till reached door of st cleeve room where applied dangling spider thread in such manner that stretched across like tight rope from jamb to jamb barring in fragile way entrance egress operation completed retired again extinguishing light went through bedroom window out upon flat roof of portico to gave access here louis made comfortable in chair smoking cap enjoying fragrance of cigar for something like hour position commanded view of two window of lady constantine room from dim light shone continuously having window partly open at back door of room also scarcely closed ear retained fair command of noise might be made in due time faint movement became audible whereupon returning to room re entered corridor listened intently be silent again darkness reigned from end to end glanville however groped way along passage till again reached swithin door where examined by light of wax match have brought condition of spider thread be gone somebody have carried off bodily a samson carried off pin web in other word person have passed through door still holding faint wax light in hand louis turned to door of lady constantine chamber where observed first that though be pushed together so a to appear fastened to cursory view door be not really closed by about quarter of inch dropped light extinguished with foot listening heard voice within viviette voice in subdued murmur though speaking earnestly without hesitation louis then returned to swithin door opened walked in starlight from
