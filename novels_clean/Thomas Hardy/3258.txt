remembered that dare in intense warmth of admiration have affected for somerset on first day two of acquaintance have begged for photograph in return for have left one of on mantelpiece taken a said by own process somerset resolved to show production to mr haze a being more to purpose than sketch instead of finishing latter proceeded on way entered old overgrown drive wound indirectly through

bachelor who uttered have not be able to keep question of de stancy domestic state out of head from first moment of seeing assuming de stancy to be husband felt there might be excuse for remark if unmarried somerset liked satire still better in such circumstance there be relief in thought captain de stancy prejudice might be infinitely stronger than of sister father 'going to morrow did say mr somerset asked miss de stancy will dine with to day father be anxious that must do so before go be sorry there will be only own family present to meet can leave a early a wish ' brother seconded invitation somerset promised though leisure for evening be short be in truth somewhat inclined to like de stancy for though captain have said nothing of value on war commerce science art have seemed attractive to younger man beyond natural interest soldier have for imaginative mind in civil walk of life de stancy occasional manifestation of taedium vitae be too poetically shaped to be repellent gallantry combined in with sort of ascetic self repression in way be curious be dozen year older than somerset life have be passed in groove remote from of somerset own life latter decided that must

at rate will see to morrow morning can do anything for since be leaving early ' somerset replied that business be of great importance briefly explained suspected intrusion into studio that have with photograph of suspected young man be mistake added somerset must regret putting draughtsman portrait into hand of police since might injure character indeed must be unfair to so wish to keep likeness in own hand merely to show to mr haze be why prefer not to send ' bey matter with haze be that barrack furniture doe not correspond with inventory if like will ask question at same time with pleasure ' thereupon somerset gave captain de stancy unfastened envelope containing portrait asking to destroy if constable must declare not to correspond with face met eye at window soon after somerset took

walk up will run up said beee here be way tripped towards path through bush instead of winding like regular track made straight for summit paula have not remotest conception of actual distance to top imagining to be couple of hundred yard at outside whereas be really nearer mile ascent being uniformly steep way when uncle de stancy have seen vanish stood still former evidently reluctant to forsake easy ascent for difficult one though said ca let go alone way suppose 'no of course not said de stancy then followed in direction taken by paula charlotte entering carriage when power de stancy have ascended about fifty yard former looked back dropped off from pursuit to return to easy route giving companion parting hint concerning paula whereupon de stancy went on alone soon saw paula above in
