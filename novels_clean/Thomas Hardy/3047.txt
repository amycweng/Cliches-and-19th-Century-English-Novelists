being sort of stimulant a be often case ive noticed professionally many time danced with such will a only young people in stage of courtship can dance happened that a evening wore on james have for partner stephen plighted one olive at same time that stephen be dancing with james emily be noticed that in spite o exchange young men seemed to enjoy dance no le than before by by be treading tune in same changed order a have noticed earlier though at first one have held others mistress strictly at half arm length lest there must be shown objection to too close quarter by lady proper man a time passed there be little more closeness between em presently little more closeness still later got more did of two cousin dance with wrong young girl tighter did hold to side a whirled round what be very remarkable neither seemed to mind what other be doing party began to draw towards end saw more that night being one of first to leave on account of morning business learnt rest of from that knew

dancing thus happened that on following sunday morning when people be sitting in church with mouth wide open to hear name published a have expected there be small amazement to hear coupled wrong way a seemed congregation whispered thought parson have made mistake till discovered that reading of name be verily true way a have decided so be married one to others original property well two couple lived on for year two ordinarily enough till time came when young people began to grow little le warm to respective spouse a be rule of married life two cousin wondered more more in heart what have made em so mad at last moment to marry crosswise a did when might have married straight a be planned by nature a have fallen in love twas tonys party have done plain enough half wished have never gone there james being quiet fireside perusing man felt at time wide gap between olive wife who loved riding driving out door jaunt to degree while steve who be always knocking about hither thither have very domestic wife who worked sampler made hearthrug scarcely ever wished to cross threshold only drove out with to please however said very little about mismating to of acquaintance though sometimes steve must look at james wife sigh james must look at steves wife do same indeed at last two men be frank enough towards other not to mind mentioning quietly to in long faced sorry smiling whimsical sort of way must shake head together over foolishness in upsetting well considered choice on strength of hour fancy in whirl wildness of dance still be sensible honest young fellow enough did best to make shift with lot a have arranged not to repine at what must not now be altered mended so thing remained till one fine summer day went for yearly little outing together a have made custom to do for long while past year chose budmouth regis a place to spend holiday in off went in best clothes at nine oclock in morning when have reached budmouth regis walked two two along shoretheir new boot going squeakity squash upon clammy velvet sand can seem to see em now then looked at ship in harbour then went up to look out then have dinner at inn then again walked two two squeakity squash upon velvet sand a evening drew on sat on one of public seat upon esplanade listened to band then said what will do of thing said olive mr james hardcome be must like to row in bay must listen to music from water

better than anybody else having have much of from own lip have not perhaps youll oblige gentleman certainly if be wished said curate took up clerk tale stephen wife hated sea except from land couldnt bear thought of going into boat james too disliked water said that for part must much sooner stay on listen to band in seat occupied though did not wish to stand in wife way if desired row end of discussion be that james cousin wife emily agreed to remain where be sitting enjoy music while watched other two hire boat just beneath take water excursion of hour so till must choose to come back join sitter on esplanade when must start homeward together nothing must have pleased other two restless one better than arrangement emily james watched go down to boatman below choose one of little yellow skiff walk carefully out upon little plank be laid on trestle to enable to get alongside craft saw stephen hand olive in take seat facing when be settled waved hand to couple watching then stephen took pair of scull pulled off to tune beat by band steering through other boat skimming about for sea be a smooth a glass that evening pleasure seeker be rowing everywhere how pretty look moving on dont said emily to james a ive be assured enjoy equally in everything liking be same thats true said james must have made handsome pair if have married said yes said ti pity must have parted em dont talk of james said for better for worse decided to do a did there end of sat on after without speaking side by side band played a before people strolled up down stephen olive shrank smaller smaller a shot straight out to sea two on shore used to relate how saw stephen stop rowing moment take off coat to get at work better james wife sat quite still in stern holding tiller rope by steered boat when have got very small indeed turned head to shore be waving handkerchief to said stephen wife who thereupon pulled out own waved a return signal boat course have be little awry while mr james neglected steering to wave handkerchief to husband mr stephen now light skiff went straight onward again must soon see nothing more of two figure contained than olive light mantle stephen white shirt sleeve behind two on shore talked on twas very curiousour changing partner at tony kytess wedding emily declared tony be of fickle nature by account really seemed a if character have infected that night of two be that first proposed not to marry a be engaged hmi cant remember at moment say james talked over know sooner said than done twas dancing said people get quite crazy sometimes in dance do owned jamesdo think care for one still asks mr stephen james hardcome mused admitted that perhaps little tender feeling might flicker up in heart for moment now then still nothing of account said sometimes think that olive be in steves mind good deal murmur mr stephen particularly when plea fancy by riding past window at gallop on one of draught horse never must do anything of sort must never get over fear of horse be horseman though pretend to be on account murmured james hardcome isnt almost time for to turn sweep round to shore a other boating folk have done wonder what olive mean by steering away straight to horizon like have hardly swerved from direct line seaward since started doubt be talking dont think of where be going suggests stephen wife perhaps so said james didnt know steve must row like o yes say often come here on business generally have pull round bay can hardly see boat say james again be getting dark heedless pair afloat now formed mere speck in film of coming night thickened apace till completely swallowed up distant shape have disappeared while still following same straight course away from world of land liver a if be intending to drop over sea edge into space never return to earth again two on shore continued to sit on punctually abiding by agreement to remain on same spot till others returned esplanade lamp be lit one by one bandsman folded up stand departed yacht in bay hung out riding light little boat came back to shore one after hirer walking on to sand by plank have climbed to go afloat among stephen olive did not appear what time be said emily be getting quite chilly did not expect to have to sit so long in evening air thereupon james hardcome said that did not require overcoat insisted on lending to wrapped round emilys shoulder thank james said how cold olive must be in thin jacket said be thinking so too well be sure to be quite close at hand by time though cant see em boat be not all in of rower be fond of paddling along shore to finish out hour of hiring will walk by edge of water said to see if can discover assented reminding that must not lose sight of seat lest belated pair must return miss be vexed that have not kept appointment walked sentry beat up down sand immediately opposite seat still others did not come james hardcome at last went to boatman thinking that after wife cousin might have come in under shadow of dusk without being perceived might have forgotten appointment at bench in asked james one boat said lessor cant think where couple be keeping to might run foul of something other in dark again stephen wife olive husband waited with more more anxiety little yellow boat returned be possible must have landed further down esplanade may have be done to escape paying said boat owner didnt look like people who must do james hardcome knew that must found hope on reason a now remembering what have be casually discussed between steve about wife from time to time admitted for first time possibility that old tenderness have be revived by face to face position more strongly than have anticipated at startingthe excursion having be so obviously undertaken for pleasure of performance onlyand that have landed at step knew of further down toward pier to be longer alone together still disliked to harbour thought must not mention existence to companion merely said to let walk further on did so lingered between boat stage pier till stephen hardcomes wife be uneasy be obliged to accept james offered arm thus night advanced emily be presently so worn out by fatigue that james felt necessary to conduct home there be too remote chance that truant have landed in harbour on other side of town elsewhere hastened home in unexpected way in belief that consort must not have waited so long however left direction in town that lookout must be kept though be arranged privately bare possibility of elopement being enough to make reticent full of misgiving two remaining one hastened to catch last train out of budmouth regis when got to casterbridge drove back to upper longpuddle along very road a do now remarked parish clerk to be surealong very road said curate however stephen olive be not at home have entered village since leaving in morning emily james hardcome went to respective dwelling to snatch hasty night rest at daylight next morning drove again to casterbridge

budmouth inspection revealed to be missing pair be said that have be found tightly locked in others arm lip upon hers feature still wrapt in same calm dream like repose have be observed in demeanour a have glided along james emily questioned original motif of unfortunate man woman in putting to sea be above suspicion a to intention mutual feeling might have led on to underhand behaviour be foreign to nature of conjecture pictured that might have fallen into tender reverie while gazing into pair of eye have formerly flashed for alone unwilling to avow what mutual sentiment be have continued thus oblivious of time space till darkness suddenly overtook far from land nothing be truly known have be destiny to die thus two half intended by nature to make perfect whole have failed in result during life though in death be not divided body be brought home buried on one day remember that on looking round churchyard while reading service observed nearly parish at funeral be so sir said clerk remaining two continued curate whose voice have grown husky while relating lover sad fate be more thoughtful far seeing though le romantic couple than first be now mutually bereft of companion found
