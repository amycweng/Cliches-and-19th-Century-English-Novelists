conversation old friend promised that really must do everything lay in power did not say how simple thought not to perceive that have already by writing to be doing everything lay in power have created feeling prompted entreaty to show good faith in promise asked to wait till later in evening when avice might possibly run across to see pierston who fancied have won younger avice interest at least by part have played upon rock week before have dread of encountering in full light till must have advanced little further in regard accordingly be perplexed at proposal seeing hesitation mr pierston suggested that must walk together in direction whence avice must come if came at welcomed idea in few minute started strolling along under now strong moonlight when reached gate of sylvania castle turning back again towards house after two three such walk up down gate of castle ground clicked form came forth proved to be expected one a soon a met girl recognized in mother companion gentleman who have helped on shore seemed really glad to find that chivalrous assistant be claimed by parent a old friend remembered hearing at diver time about worthy london man of talent position whose ancestry be people of own isle possibly from name of common stock with own 'and have actually lived in sylvania castle mr pierston ' asked avice daughter with innocent young voice 'be long ago ' 'yes be time ago ' replied sculptor with sinking at heart lest must ask how long 'it must have be when be away when be very little ' think be away 'but think must have be here ' perhaps must have be here ' ' think be hiding in parsley bed ' said avice mother blandly talked in general way till reached mr pierston house jocelyn resisted widow invitation desire of own heart went away without entering to risk by visibly confronting advantage that have already gained fancied have gained with re incarnate avice required more courage than must claim in present mood such evening promenade a be frequent during waxing of summer moon on one occasion a be good walker be arranged that must meet halfway between island town in pierston have lodging be impossible that by time pretty young governess must not have guessed ultimate reason of ramble to be matrimonial intention inclined to belief that widow rather than be object of pierston regard though why educated apparently wealthy man must be attracted by mother whose homeliness be apparent enough to girl more modern training must not comprehend met accordingly in middle of pebble bank pierston coming from mainland woman from peninsular rock crossing wooden bridge connected bank with shore proper moved in direction of henry eighth castle on verge of rag stone cliff like red king castle on island interior be open to sky when entered full moon streamed down upon over edge of enclosing masonry whole present reality faded from jocelyn mind under press of memory of companion guessed what pierston be thinking of be in very spot that be to have met grandmother of girl at side in must have met have chosen to keep appointment meeting might nay must have changed whole current of life instead of forty year have passed forty year of severance from avice till secondly renewed copy of sweetheart have arisen to fill place ala be not renewed of pretty young thing at side knew nothing taking advantage of younger woman retreat to view sea through opening of wall pierston appealed to mother in whisper ever given hint of what meaning be then think might if really have objection mr pierston a widow be far from being so coldly disposed in own person towards friend a in day when wanted to marry have now be object of wish must not have needed to ask twice like good mother stifled said must sound avice there then 'avice dear ' said advancing to where girl mused in window gap 'what do think of mr pierston paying address to coming courting a call in old fashioned way supposing be to must encourage ' 'to mother ' said avice with inquiring laugh ' thought meant ' ' o doe mean ' said mother hastily 'he be nothing more than friend ' want address said daughter 'he be man in society must take to elegant house in london suited to education instead of leaving to mope here ' ' must like well enough ' replied avice carelessly give encouragement care enough about to do encouraging be business must think to do ' spoke in lightest

allowed to retain when arrived on level ground altogether be not unsuccessful evening for man with unanchored heart though possibly initial success meant worse for in long run than initial failure there be nothing marvellous in fact of tractability thus far in modern dress style under ray of moon looked very presentable gentleman indeed while knowledge of art travelled manner be not without attraction for girl who with one hand touched educated middle class with other rude simple inhabitant of isle intensely modern sympathy be quickened by peculiar outlook pierston must have regarded
