after second inquiry have slipped out to witness nigger performance round corner julian began to think forgotten by household perception gradually cooled emotion enabled to hold hat quite steadily when picotee gently thrust open door be surprised to find room in darkness fire gone completely out form of christopher only visible by faint patch of light coming from lamp on opposite side of way falling upon mirror be thrown a pale nebulosity upon shoulder picotee be too flurried at sight of familiar outline to know what to do instead of going calling for light mechanically advanced into room christopher did not turn move in way then perceived that have begun to doze in chair instantly with precipitancy of timorous said ber julian touched on shoulder murmuring then ' o beg pardon will get

held utilized solitary spot of light from mirror by making fall upon face recognizing childish feature at once with exclamation dropped hand started back being in point of fact complete bundle of nerve nothing else thin figure shook like harp string in painful excitement at contretemps must scarcely have quickened pulse of ordinary man poor picotee feeling in wind of civil d started back also sobbing more than ever be little too much that first result of discovery of mistake must be absolute repulse leant against mantelpiece when julian much bewildered at superfluity of emotion assisted to

ethelberta be angry with say may stay doe know know how used to meet along road morning be afraid to tell o what will do ' 'never mind ' said christopher sense of true state of case dawning upon with unpleasant distinctness bringing irritation at awkward position though be impossible to be long angry with girl who have not reasoning foresight enough to perceive doubtful pleasure certain pain must

dread of appearing visibly to christopher eye showing precise condition of tear stained face put off moment after moment stirred fire in hope that faint illumination thus produced must be sufficient to save from charge of stupid conduct a entertainer fluttering about on horn of dilemma be greatly relieved when christopher who read difficulty general painfulness of situation said that since ethelberta be really suffering from headache must not wish to disturb till to morrow went off downstairs into street without further ceremony meanwhile other thing have happened upstairs sooner have picotee left sister room than ethelberta thought must after have be much better if have gone down to speak to admirably persistent lover be not drifting somewhat into character of coquette even if

jealous motherly guard over young sister amid contending inquiry foremost feeling be le one of hope for own love than of championship for picotee ethelberta house continued picotee be heard on stair ethelberta covered face 'be waiting ' said faintly on finding that picotee did not begin to speak 'no be gone ' said picotee 'ah why be that ' came quickly from under handkerchief have forgotten be what be ' ' o have not ' said picotee just a bitterly ethelberta have far too much heroism to let much in strain escape though sister be prepared to go length in same suppose ' continued ethelberta in quiet way of one who have only headache matter with 'that remembered after meeting at anglebury ' 'yes remembered ' 'did tell have seen before time ' have seen at sandbourne think told ' 'at whose house did meet ' 'at nobody only saw sometimes ' replied picotee in great distress ethelberta though of woman most miserable be brimming with compassion for throbbing girl so nearly related to in whom continually saw own weak point without counterpoise of strong one be necessary to repress awhile intended way of life be blocked broken up by jar of interest wanted time to ponder new plan must rather be alone now if mind ' said 'you need not leave light make eye ache think ' picotee left room ethelberta have not long be alone in darkness when somebody gently opened door entered without candle 'berta said soft voice of picotee again beay come in ' o yes said ethelberta 'have everything gone right with house evening ' 'yes gwendoline went out just now to buy few thing be going to call round upon father when have got dinner cleared away ' hope will not stay talk to other servant day will let drop something other before father can stop o berta ' said picotee close beside be kneeling in front of couch now flinging arm across ethelberta shoulder shaking violently pressed forehead against sister temple breathed out upon cheek ' came in again to tell something ought to have told just

much matter ' said ethelberta kissing picotee soothingly ought not of course to have come to london in such manner since have come will make best of perhaps may end happily for for who know 'then want

very nice 'yes will be always distant towards go to leave room when come when will call back suppose continue to morrow can tell better then what to do ' when picotee have left second time ethelberta turned over upon breast shook in convulsive sob have little relationship with tear abandonment ended a suddenly a have begun not lasting more than minute half altogether got up in unconsidered unusual impulse to seek relief from stinging sarcasm of event unhappy love of picotee by mentioning something of to member of family eldest sister gwendoline who be woman full of sympathy ethelberta descended to kitchen being now about ten o'clock room be empty gwendoline not having yet returned cornelia being busy about own affair upstairs french family have gone to theatre house on account be very quiet to night ethelberta sat down in dismal place without turning up gas in few minute admitted gwendoline round faced country cook floundered in untying bonnet a came laying down on chair talking at same time place a london be to be sure exclaimed turning on gas till whistled ' wish be down in wessex again lord mercy berta did see be thought be cornelia a be saying thought after biding in underground cellar week making up mess for french folk never pleasing never will because understand line thought must go out see father know ' very well ' said ethelberta 'yes be going to call round when have

older sister le for advice than to get heart ease by interchange of word ala must proceed further wretched homeliness of gwendoline mind seemed at particular juncture to be absolutely intolerable ethelberta be suddenly convinced that to involve gwendoline in such discussion must simply be increasing own burden adding worse confusion to sister already confused existence 'what be going to say ' said honest unsuspecting gwendoline ' will put off until to morrow ' ethelberta murmured gloomily ' have bad headache be afraid can not stay with after a ascended stair ethelberta ached with added pain not much le than primary one have brought down be that old sense of disloyalty to class kin by feeling a felt now caused pain there be escaping gwendoline must have gone to end of earth for must not confide thought to gwendoline 'if only knew of unworthy feeling of mine how must grieve ' said ethelberta miserably next went up to servant bedroom to where cornelia slept on ethelberta entrance cornelia looked up from perfect wonder of bonnet held in hand at sight of ethelberta look of keen interest in work changed to one of gaiety ' be so glad be just coming down ' cornelia said in whisper whenever spoke a relation in house be in whisper how do think bonnet will do may come down see how look in big glass ' clapped bonnet upon head 'wo do beautiful for sunday afternoon look very attractive a far a can see by light ' said ethelberta 'but be not rather too brilliant in colour blue red together like remember a often tell people in town never wear such bright contrast a do in

did not smile turned subject added docilely 'did come up for to do anything will put off finishing bonnet if be wanted ' ' be going to talk to about family matter picotee ' said ethelberta 'but a be busy have headache will put off till to morrow ' cornelia seemed decidedly relieved for family matter be far from attractive at best of time ethelberta went down to next floor entered mother room
