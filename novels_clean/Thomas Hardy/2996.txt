strange whole business after will be to recover right mind margery always declared that there seemed to be power in stranger be more than human something magical compulsory when seized gently trotted round lingering emotion may have led memory to play prank with scene vivid imagination at youthful age must be taken into account in believing however there be doubt that stranger whoever might be whatever power taught element of modern dancing at certain interview by moonlight at top of father garden a be proved by possession of knowledge on subject must have be acquired in other way be of first rank of commanding figure be one of most agile of milkmaid to casual view must have seemed of piece with nature doings thing must go on thus there be side to case whether strange gentleman be wild olive tree not be questionable if acquaintance must lead to happiness fleeting romance possible calamity thus might have be summed up by practical margery be in paradise yet be not at date

interest in now go home week hence invite margthe young woman father to tea with rest be in own hand question often put to jim in after time be why have not occurred to at once that baron liberal conduct must have be dictated by something more personal than sudden spontaneous generosity to stranger to jim always answered that admitting existence of such generosity there have appeared nothing remarkable in baron selecting a object baron have told that took interest in esteem even with most modest be usually sufficient to over ride little difficulty might occur to outsider in accounting for preference moreover considered that foreign nobleman rich eccentric might have habit of acting be quite at variance with of english compeer so drove off homeward with lighter heart than have known for several day to have foreign gentleman take fancy to himwhat triumph to plain sort of fellow who have scarcely expected baron to look in face must be fine story to tell margery when baron gave liberty

at flame to night burnt up brightly shining long way into dark air even up to rampart of earthwork above overhead into bosom of cloud be during proceeding that carriage drawn by pair of dark horse came along turnpike road light of kiln caused horse to swerve little occupant of carriage looked out saw bluish lightning like flame from limestone rising from top of furnace hard by figure of jim hayward widow horse standing out with spectral distinctness against mass of night behind scene wore aspect of unholy assignation in pandaemonium be more impressive from fact that jim woman be quite unconscious of striking spectacle presented gentleman in carriage watched till be borne out of sight having seen to kiln jim widow walked on again soon mr peach father met relieved jim of lady when have parted jim with expiration not unlike breath of relief went on to mr vine having put horse into stable entered house partner be seated at table solacing after labour of day by luxurious

of parasol richard vine have placed margery in front of to protect from crowd a said surveying scene over bonnet margery must have be even more surprised than be if have known that jim be not only
