nose add to plentiful knot of dark brown hair gauzy dress of white with blue facing slightest idea may be gained of young maiden who showed amidst rest of dancing lady like flower among vegetable so dance proceeded mr shiner according to interesting rule laid down deserted own partner made off down middle with fair one of dick pair appearing from top of room like two person tripping down lane to be married dick trotted behind with what be intended to be look of composure be in fact rather silly expression of feature implying with too much earnestness that elopement must not be tolerated then turned came back when dick grew more rigid around mouth blushed with ingenuous ardour a joined hand with rival formed arch over lady head presumably gave figure name relinquishing again at setting to partner when mr shiner new chain quivered in link loose flesh upon tranter who here came into action again shook like jelly mr penny being always rather concerned for personal safety when danced with tranter fixed face to chronic smile of timidity whole time lasted peculiarity filled feature with wrinkle reduced eye to little straight line like hyphen a jigged up down opposite repeating in own

to by stamping arrival up middle of tranter who despising minutia on principle started theme of own assure neighbour said heat of frame tongue can tell looked around endeavoured to give by forcible gaze of self sympathy faint idea of truth mr dewy formed one of next couple yes said in auxiliary tone reuben always be such hot man mr penny implied specie of sympathy that class of affliction

reached bottom when there arose in dick mind minor misery lest tune must end before must work way to top again have anew same exciting run down through dick feeling on actually reaching top in spite of doubt be supplemented by mortal fear that fiddling might even stop at supreme moment prompted to convey stealthy whisper to far gone musician to effect that be not to leave off till partner have reached bottom of dance once more remark be replied to by nearest of convulsed quivering men by private nod to anxious young man between two semiquaver of tune simultaneous right ay ay without opening

prolonged wiping of shoe conveying notion that volume of mud have to be removed road being so clean that not particle of dirt appeared on choir boot of elder member being newly oiled dick brightly polished wiping might have be set down simply a desire to show that respectable men have wish to take mean advantage of clean road for curtailing proper ceremony next there came powerful whisper from

towards leaf thank sir said leaf be then sit down leaf said mr maybold y yes sir tranter cleared throat after accidental parenthesis about leaf rectified bodily position began speech mr mayble said hope will excuse common way always like to look thing in face reuben made point of fixing sentence in vicar mind by gazing hard at at conclusion of then out of window mr maybold old william looked in same direction apparently under impression that thing face alluded to be there visible what have be thinking tranter implied by use of past tense that be hardly so discourteous a to be positively thinking then be that quire ought to be gie 'd little time not done away wi ' till christmas a fair thing between man man mr mayble hope will excuse common way will will till christmas vicar murmured stretching two word to great length a if distance to christmas might be measured in way well want to understand have personal fault to find wish to change church music by forcible mean in way must hurt feeling of parishioner why have at last spoken definitely on subject be that player have be brought under may say pressed upon notice several time by one of churchwarden a organ brought with be here waiting pointing to cabinet organ standing in study there be reason for longer delay made mistake suppose then sir understood young woman did want to play particularly tranter arranged countenance to signify that did not want to be inquisitive in least did did definitely wish to just yet for playing be very good a said one of churchwarden have be so anxious for change that a matter stand must consistently refuse consent now for reason other vicar at point seemed to have idea that have prevaricated a honest vicar be thing determined not to do corrected blushing a did so though why must blush be not known to reuben understand rightly said church warden proposed to have thought myself of getting miss day to play churchwarden might be who proposed sir excusing common way tranter intimated by tone so far from being inquisitive did not even wish to ask single question mr shiner believe clk sonny beg pardon sir be only form of word of mine slipped out accidental nourishes enmity against for reason perhaps because played rather hard upon en christmas night anyhow 't be certain sure that mr shiner real love for music of particular kind be reason have more ear than chair let that be think must conclude that because mr shiner want different music have ill feeling for must own prefer organ music to other consider most proper feel justified in endeavouring to introduce then although other music be better say yours be not good well then mr mayble since death to be will die like men day name excusing common way mr maybold bowed head thought be that for old ancient singer to be choked off quiet at time in particular a now in sunday after easter must seem rather mean in eye of other parish sir if fell glorious with bit of flourish at christmas must have respectable end not dwindle away at nameless paltry second sunday after sunday next before something be got name of own yes yes be reasonable own be reasonable see mr mayble have got do keep inconvenient long sir have got feeling father there especially tranter in earnestness have advanced person to within six inch of vicar certainly certainly said mr maybold retreating little for convenience of seeing be enthusiastic on subject be more gratified to find so laodicean lukewarmness be worse than wrongheadedness exactly sir in fact now mr mayble reuben continued more impressively advancing little closer still to vicar father there be perfect figure o ' wonder in way of being fond of music vicar drew back little further tranter suddenly also standing back foot two to throw open view of father pointing to at same time old william moved uneasily in large chair with minute smile on mere edge of lip for good manner said be indeed very fond of tune now see exactly how be reuben continued appealing to mr maybold sense of justice by looking sideways into eye vicar seemed to see how be so well that gratified tranter walked up to again with even vehement eagerness so that waistcoat button almost rubbed against vicar a continued a to father if man woman of present generation at time music be playing be to shake fist in father face a may be way say ' be delighted with

with nib overhanging at last retreat coat tail came in contact with pen down rolled first against back of chair thence turning summersault into seat thence falling to floor with rattle vicar stooped for pen tranter wishing to show that however great ecclesiastical difference mind be not so small a to let affect social feeling stooped also have anything else want to explain to dewy said mr maybold from under table nothing sir mr mayble be not offended hope see desire be reason said tranter from under chair quite quite must think of refusing to listen to reasonable request vicar replied seeing

that will clearly understand dewy will thank very much for such feeling sir piph h h h how blood do get into head to be sure whenever quat down like said reuben who having also risen to foot stuck pen vertically in inkstand almost through bottom that might not roll down again under circumstance now ancient body of minstrel in passage felt curiosity surging higher higher a minute passed dick not having much affection for errand soon grew tired went away in direction of school yet sense of propriety must probably have restrained from attempt to discover what be going on in study have not vicar pen fallen to floor conviction that movement of chair etc necessitated by search must only have be caused by catastrophe of bloody fight beginning overpowered other consideration advanced to door have only just fallen to thus when mr maybold raised eye after stooping beheld glaring through door mr penny in full length portraiture mail face shoulder above mr penny head spinks forehead eye over mail
