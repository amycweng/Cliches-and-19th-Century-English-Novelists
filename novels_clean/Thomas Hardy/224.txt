though have made way for more modern form of glazing elsewhere stephen be at one end of gallery looking towards elfride who stood in midst beginning to feel somewhat depressed by society of luxellian shade of cadaverous complexion fixed by holbein kneller lely seeming to gaze at through in moralizing mood silence cast almost spell upon be broken by sudden opening of door at far end out bounded pair of little girl lightly yet warmly dressed eye be sparkling hair swinging about around red mouth laughing with unalloyed gladness ah miss swancourt dearest elfie heard be going to stay here be

gallery on looking around for be nowhere to be seen elfride stepped down to library thinking might have rejoined father there mr swancourt now cheerfully illuminated by pair of candle be still alone untying packet of letter paper tying up again a elfride did not stand on sufficiently intimate footing with object of interest to justify a proper young lady to commence active search for youthful impulsiveness prompted a nevertheless for nascent reason connected with divinely cut lip of did not like to be absent from side wandered desultorily back to oak staircase pouting casting eye about in hope of discerning boyish figure though daylight still prevailed in room corridor be in depth of shadowchill sad silent be only by looking along towards light space beyond anything anybody must be

say without appealing to culprit that must never do more elfride reflected more certain did appear that meeting be chance rencounter not appointment on ultimate inquiry a to individuality of woman elfride at once assumed that must not be inferior stephen smith be not man to care about passage at love with woman beneath though gentle ambition be visible in kindling eye evidently hoped for much hoped indefinitely extensively elfride be puzzled being puzzled be by natural sequence of girlish sensation vexed with more pleasure came in recognizing that from liking to attract be getting on to love boyish a be innocent a have seemed reached bridge formed link between eastern western half of parish situated in valley be bounded outwardly by sea formed point of depression from road ascended with great steepness to west endelstow vicarage there be absolute necessity for of to alight a be vicar custom after long journey to humour horse in making winding ascent elfride moved by imitative instinct suddenly jumped out when pleasant have just begun to adopt deliberate stalk associated with portion of road young man seemed glad of excuse for breaking silence why miss swancourt what risky thing to do exclaimed immediately following example by jumping down on other side oh not at replied coldly shadow phenomenon at endelstow house still paramount within stephen walked along by for two three minute wrapped in rigid reserve dictated by tone then apparently thinking that be only for girl to pout came serenely round to side offered arm with castilian gallantry to assist in ascending remaining three quarter of steep here be temptation be first time in life that elfride have be treated a grown up woman in wayoffered arm in manner implying that have right to refuse till to night have never received masculine attention beyond might be contained in such homely remark a elfride give hand elfride take hold of arm from father callow heart made epoch of incident considered array of feeling for against collectively be for taking offered arm single one of pique determined to punish stephen by refusing thank mr smith can get along better by be elfrides first fragile attempt at browbeating lover fearing more issue of such undertaking than what gentle young man might think of waywardness immediately afterwards determined to please by reversing statement on second thought will take said slowly went way up hill few yard behind carriage how silent be miss swancourt stephen observed perhaps think silent too returned may have reason to be scarcely be sadness that make people silent can have none dont know have trouble though might think le trouble than dilemma what be asked impulsively stephen hesitated might tell said at same time perhaps be a well let go arm imperatively pushed from tossing head have just learnt that good deal of dignity be lost by asking question to answer be refused even ever so politely for though politeness doe good service in case of requisition compromise little help direct refusal dont wish to know anything of dont wish went on carriage be waiting for at top of hill must get in elfride flitted to front papa here be elfride exclaimed to dusky figure of old gentleman a sprang up sank by side without deigning to accept aid from stephen ah yes uttered vicar in artificially alert tone awaking from most profound sleep suddenly preparing to alight why what be doing papa be not home yet oh of course not be not at home yet mr swancourt said very hastily endeavouring to dodge back to original position with air of man who have not moved at fact be be so lost in deep meditation that forgot whereabouts be in minute vicar be snoring again that evening being last seemed to throw exceptional shade of sadness over stephen smith repeated injunction of vicar that be to come revisit in summer apparently tended le to raise spirit than to unearth misgiving left in gray light of dawn whilst colour of earth be sombre sun be yet hidden in east elfride have fidgeted night in little bed lest none of household must be awake soon enough to start also lest might miss seeing again bright eye curly hair to owner possession of hidden mystery added deeper tinge of romance to extentso soon doe womanly interest take solicitous turnshe felt responsible for safe conduct breakfasted before daylight mr swancourt being more more taken with guest ingenuous appearance having determined to rise early bid friendly farewell be however rather to vicar astonishment that saw elfride walk in to breakfast table candle in hand whilst william worm performed toilet during performance inmate of vicarage be always in habit of waiting with exemplary patience elfride wandered desultorily to summer house stephen followed thither copse covered valley be visible from position mist now lying along length hiding stream trickled through though observer be in clear air stood close together leaning over rustic balustrading bounded arbour on outward side formed crest of steep slope beneath elfride constrainedly pointed out feature of distant upland rising irregularly opposite artistic eye be either from nature circumstance very faint in stephen now only half attended to description a if spared time from other thought going on within well good bye said suddenly must never see again suppose miss swancourt in spite of invitation genuine tribulation played directly upon delicate chord of nature must afford to forgive for concealment two moreover shyness must not allow to look in face lent bravery to own eye tongue oh do come again mr smith said prettily must delight in will be better if why certain circumstance in connection with make undesirable not on account on yours goodness a if anything in connection with must hurt said with serene supremacy seeing that plan of treatment be inappropriate tuned smaller note ah know why will not come dont want to youll go home to london to stirring people there will never want to see more know have such reason go on writing letter to lady be engaged to just a before what doe mean be not engaged wrote letter to miss somebody saw in letter rack pooh elderly woman who keep stationer shop be to tell to keep newspaper till get back neednt have explained be not business at miss elfride be rather relieved to hear that statement nevertheless wont come again to see father insisted must like toand to see again will reveal to that matter hide interrupted petulantly not now must not go on graceless a might seem tell importuned with trembling mouth doe meeting of yours with lady at endelstow vicarage clash withany interest may take in started little doe not said emphatically looked into pupil of eye with confidence that only honesty can give even to youth alone explanation have not come gloom left must not believe that utterance enigma might lie in shadow on blind be not enigma of underhand passion turned towards house entering through conservatory stephen went round to front door mr swancourt be standing on step in slipper worm be adjusting buckle in harness murmuring about poor head everything be ready for stephen departure named august for visit august will be be if care for society of fossilized tory said mr swancourt mr smith only responded hesitatingly that must like to come again said must must insisted elfride coming to door speaking under father arm reason youth may have have for not wishing to enter house a guest no longer predominated promised bade adieu got into pony carriage crept up slope bore out of sight never be so much taken with anybody in life a be with young fellownever can not understand itcant understand anyhow said mr swancourt quite energetically to went indoors chapter vii more of knew love stephen smith revisited endelstow vicarage agreeably to promise have genuine artistic reason for coming though such reason seemed to be required six thirty old seat end of exquisite fifteenth century workmanship be rapidly decaying in aisle of church became politic to make drawing of worm eaten contour ere be battered past recognition in turmoil of so called restoration entered house at sunset world be pleasant again to two fair haired one momentary pang of disappointment have nevertheless passed through elfride when casually discovered that have not come that minute post haste from london have reached neighbourhood previous evening surprise must have accompanied feeling have not remembered that several tourist be haunting coast at season stephen might have chosen to do likewise did little besides chat that evening mr swancourt beginning to question visitor closely yet paternally in good part on hope prospect from profession have embraced stephen gave vague answer next day rained in evening when twenty four hour of elfride have completely rekindled admirer ardour game of chess be proposed between game have value in helping on development of future elfride soon perceived that opponent be learner next noticed that have very odd way of handling piece when castling taking man antecedently must have supposed that same performance must be gone through by player in same manner be taught by differing action that ordinary player who learn game by sight unconsciously touch men in stereotyped way impression of indescribable oddness in stephen touch culminated in speech when saw at taking of one of bishop push aside with taking man instead of lifting a preliminary to move how strangely handle men mr smith do be sorry for oh nodont be sorry be not matter great enough for sorrow who taught to play nobody miss swancourt said learnt from book lent by friend mr knight noblest man in world have seen people play have never seen playing of single game be first time ever have opportunity of playing with living opponent have worked out many game from book studied reason of different move be be full explanation of mannerism fact that man with desire for chess must have grown up without being able to see engage in game astonished not little pondered on circumstance for time looking into vacancy hindering play mr swancourt be sitting with eye fixed on board apparently thinking of other thing half to said pending move of elfride quae finis aut quod manet stipendium stephen replied instantly effare jussas cum fide poenas luam excellentpromptgratifying said mr swancourt with feeling bringing down hand upon table making three pawn knight dance over border by shaking be musing on word a applicable to strange course be steeringbut enough of be delighted with mr smith for be so seldom in desert meet with man who be gentleman scholar enough to continue quotation however trite may be also apply word to myself said stephen quietly last man in world to do must have thought come murmured elfride poutingly insinuating between tell about come construe construe stephen looked steadfastly into face said slowly in voice full of far off meaning that seemed quaintly premature in one so young quae finis what will be end aut quod stipendium what fine manet awaits effare speak out luam will pay cum fide with faith jussas poenas penalty required vicar who have listened with critical compression of lip to school boy recitation by reason of imperfect hearing have missed marked realism of stephen tone in english word now said hesitatingly by bye mr smith know youll excuse curiosity though translation be unexceptionably correct close have way of pronouncing latin to seems most peculiar not that pronunciation of dead language be of much importance yet accent quantity have grotesque sound to ear thought first that have acquired way of breathing vowel from of northern college can not be so with quantity be going to ask be if instructor in classic must possibly have be oxford cambridge man yes be oxford manfellow of st cyprian really oh yes there doubt about oddest thing ever heard of said mr swancourt starting with astonishment that pupil of such man best cleverest man in england cried stephen enthusiastically that pupil of such man must pronounce latin in way pronounce beat ever heard how long did instruct four year four year be not so strange when explain stephen hastened to say be done in wayby letter sent exercise construing twice week twice week sent back to corrected with marginal note of instruction be how learnt latin greek such a be be not responsible for scanning have never heard scan line novel case singular instance of patience cried vicar on part not on mine ah henry knight be one in thousand remember speaking to on very subject of pronunciation say that much to regret see time coming when man will pronounce even common word of own tongue a seems right in own ear be thought none worse for that speaking age be passing away to make room for writing age elfride father have waited attentively to hear stephen go on to what must have be most interesting part of story namely what circumstance must have necessitated unusual method of education further explanation be volunteered saw by young man manner of concentrating upon chess board that be anxious to drop subject game proceeded elfride played by rote stephen by thought be cruellest thing to checkmate after so much labour considered what be dishonest enough to do in compassion to let checkmate second game followed being absolutely indifferent a to result playing be above average among woman knew allowed to give checkmate again final game in adopted muzio gambit a opening be terminated by elfrides victory at twelfth move stephen looked up suspiciously heart be throbbing even more excitedly than be hers have quickened when seriously set to work on last occasion mr swancourt have left room have be trifling with till now exclaimed face flushing did not play best in first two game elfrides guilt showed in face stephen became picture of vexation sadness relishable for moment caused next instant to regret mistake have made mr smith forgive said sweetly see now though did not at first that what have done seems like contempt for skill indeed did not mean in sense must not upon conscience win victory in first second game over one who fought at disadvantage so manfully drew long breath murmured bitterly ah be cleverer than can do everythingi can hing o miss swancourt burst out wildly heart swelling in throat must tell how love month of absence have worshipped leapt from seat like impulsive lad that be slid round to side almost before suspected arm be round waist two set of curl intermingled so entirely new be full blown love to elfride that trembled a much from novelty of emotion a from emotion then suddenly withdrew stood upright vexed that have submitted unresistingly even to momentary pressure resolved to consider demonstration a premature must not begin such thing a said with coquettish hauteur of very transparent nature andyou must not do so againand papa be coming let kiss youonly little one said with usual delicacy without reading factitiousness of manner not one only on cheek forehead certainly not care for somebody else then ah thought so be sure for how can tell said simply simplicity lying merely in broad outline of manner speech there be semitone of voice half hidden expression of eye tell initiated how very fragile be ice of reserve at time footstep be heard mr swancourt then entered room private colloquy ended day after partial revelation mr swancourt proposed drive to cliff beyond targan bay distance of three four mile hour before time of departure crash be heard in back yard presently worm came in saying partly to world in general partly to slightly to auditor ay ay sure that frying of fish will be end of william worm be at again morningsame a everfizz fizz fizz head bad again worm said mr swancourt what be noise heard in yard ay sir weak wambling man be frying have be going on in poor head through long night morning a usual be so dazed wi that down fell piece of leg wood across shaft of pony shay splintered off ay say feel a if twas own shay though ive done parish pay be lot if go from here perhaps be a independent a one here there dear shaft of carriage broken cried elfride be disappointed stephen doubly so vicar showed more warmth of temper than accident seemed to demand much to stephen uneasiness rather to surprise have not supposed so much latent sternness must co exist with mr swancourts frankness good nature will not be disappointed said vicar at length be almost too long distance for to walk elfride can trot down on pony will have old nag smith elfride exclaimed triumphantly have never seen on horsebackoh must looked at stephen read thought immediately ah dont ride mr smith be sorry to say dont fancy man not able to ride said rather pertly vicar came to rescue thats common enough have have other lesson to learn now recommend plan let elfride ride on horseback mr smith walk beside arrangement be welcomed with secret delight by stephen seemed to combine in advantage of long slow ramble with elfride without contingent possibility of enjoyment being spoilt by becoming weary pony be saddled brought round now mr smith said lady imperatively coming downstairs appearing in riding habit a always did in change of dress like new edition of delightful volume have task to perform to day earring be very favourite darling one worst of be that have such short hook that be liable to be dropped if toss head about much when be riding cant give mind to must be doing knight service if keep eye fixed upon remember minute of day tell directly drop one have have such hairbreadth escape havent unity continued to parlour maid who be standing at door yes miss that have said unity with round eyed commiseration once twas in lane found one of pursued elfride reflectively then twas by gate into eighteen acre unity chimed in then twas on carpet in own room rejoined elfride merrily then twas dangling on embroidery of petticoat miss then twas down back miss wasnt oh what way be in miss wasnt until found stephen took elfrides slight foot upon hand one two three up said unfortunately not so staggered lifted horse edged round elfride be ultimately deposited upon ground rather more forcibly than be pleasant smith looked contrition never mind said vicar encouragingly try again ti little accomplishment requires practice although look so easy stand closer to horse head mr smith indeed shant let try again said with microscopic look of indignation worm come here help to mount worm stepped forward be in saddle in trice then moved on going for distance in silence hot air of valley being occasionally brushed from face by cool breeze wound way along ravine leading up from sea suppose said stephen that man who can sit in saddle help person into one seems useless incumbrance miss swancourt ill learn to do for sake will indeed what be so unusual in said in didactic tone justifiable in horsewoman address to benighted walker be that knowledge of certain thing must be combined with ignorance of certain other thing stephen lifted eye earnestly to hers know said be simply because there be so many other thing to be learnt in wide world didnt trouble about particular bit of knowledge thought must be useless to dont think so now will learn riding connected with because then must like better do like much le for looked sideways at with critical meditation tenderly rendered do seem like la belle dame sans merci began suddenly without replying to question fancy saying mr smith sat on pacing steed nothing else saw day long for sidelong must bend sing fairy song found root of relish sweet honey wild manna dew thats did said young man stilly with rising colour sure in language strange said love thee true not at rejoined quickly see how can gallop now pansy off elfride started stephen beheld light figure contracting to dimension of bird a sank into distanceher hair flowing walked on in same direction for considerable time must see sign of returning dull a flower without sun sat down upon stone not for fifteen minute be sound of horse rider to be heard then elfride pansy appeared on hill in round trot delightful scamper a have have said face flushed eye sparkling turned horse head stephen arose went on again well what have to say to mr smith after long absence do remember question must not exactly answer last nightwhether be more to than anybody else said can not exactly answer now why cant because dont know if be more to than one else yes indeed be exclaimed in voice of intensest appreciation at same time gliding round looking into face eye in eye murmured playfully blushingly obeyed looking back into why not lip on lip continued stephen daringly certainly not anybody might look must be death of may kiss hand if like expressed by look to kiss hand through glove that riding glove be not great treat under circumstance there then ill take glove off isnt pretty white hand ah dont want to kiss will not now if may never kiss again severe elfride know think more of than can tell that be queen must die for elfride rapid red again filled cheek looked at meditatively what proud moment be for elfride then be ruling heart with absolute despotism for first time in life stephen stealthily pounced upon hand wont wont said intractably shouldnt take by surprise there ensued mild form of tussle for absolute possession of much coveted hand in boisterousness of boy girl be far more prominent than dignity of man woman then pansy became restless elfride recovered position remembered make behave in not nice way at exclaimed in tone neither of pleasure anger partaking of ought not to have allowed romp be too old now for sort of thing hope dont think tootoo much of creeping round sort of man said in penitent tone conscious that too have lost little dignity by proceeding be too familiar cant have considering shortness of time have known other mr smith take too much upon think be country girl doesnt matter how behave to assure miss swancourt have idea of freak in mind wanted to imprint sweetserious kiss upon hand thats now thats creeping round again mustnt look into eye so said shaking head at trotting on few pace in advance thus led way out of lane across field in direction of cliff at boundary of field nearest sea expressed wish to dismount horse be tied to post followed irregular path ultimately terminated upon flat ledge passing round face of huge blue black rock at height about midway between sea topmost verge there far beneath before lay everlasting stretch of ocean there upon detached rock be white screaming gull seeming ever intending to settle yet always passing on right left ranked toothed zigzag line of storm torn height forming series culminated in one beneath foot behind youth maiden be tempting alcove seat formed naturally in beetling mass wide enough to admit two three person elfride sat down stephen sat beside be afraid be hardly proper of to be here said half inquiringly have not known other long enough for kind of thing have oh yes replied judicially quite long enough how do know be not length of time manner in minute

let drown drown drown dont care about love have endeavoured to give playful tone to word latter speech be rather forced in gaiety at point in discussion trotted off to turn corner be avoided by footpath road path reuniting at point little further on on again making appearance continually managed to look in direction away from left in cool shade of displeasure stephen be soon beaten at game of indifference went round entered range of vision be offended elfie why dont talk save then let mr clever of yours drown hate now must really elfride must not press such hard question be ridiculous then wont be alone with more unkind to wound so laughed at own absurdity persisted come elfie let make up be friend say must save then let drown must save youand too let drown come dont love teasingly

elfrides hand flew like arrow to ear there exclaimed to stephen looking at with eye full of reproach quite forgot indeed if have only remembered answered with conscience stricken face wheeled round turned into shrubbery stephen followed if have told to watch anything stephen must have religiously done capriciously went on a soon a heard behind forgetting be forgivable well will find if want to respect be engaged to when have asked papa considered moment added more seriously know now where dropped stephen be on cliff remember faint sensation of change about be too absent to think of then thats where be now must go look there ill go at once strode away up valley under broiling sun amid deathlike silence of early afternoon ascended with giddy paced haste windy range of rock to where have sat felt peered about stone cranny elfrides stray jewel be nowhere to be seen next stephen slowly retraced step pausing at cross road to reflect while left plateau struck downwards across field in direction of endelstow house walked along path by river without slightest hesitation a to bearing apparently quite familiar with inch of ground a shadow began to lengthen sunlight to mellow passed through two wicket gate drew near outskirt of endelstow park river now ran along under park fence previous to entering grove little further on here stood cottage between fence stream on slightly elevated spot of ground round river took turn characteristic feature of snug habitation be one chimney in gable end squareness of form disguised by huge cloak of ivy have grown so luxuriantly extended so far from base a to increase apparent bulk of chimney to dimension of tower little distance from back of house rose park boundary over be to be seen sycamore of grove making slow inclination to just awakening air stephen crossed little wood bridge in front went up to cottage door opened without knock signal of kind exclamation of welcome burst from person person when door be thrust ajar followed by scrape of chair on stone floor a if pushed back by occupier in rising from table door be closed again nothing must now be heard from within save lively chatter rattle of plate chapter viii allen dale be baron lord mist be creeping out of pool swamp for pilgrimage of night when stephen came up to front door of vicarage elfride be standing on step illuminated by lemon hued expanse of western sky never have be time looking for earring said anxiously oh have not found never mind though be much vexed be prettiest stephen what ever have be doingwhere have be have be so uneasy feared for knowing not inch of country thought suppose have fallen over cliff now be inclined to scold for frightening so must speak to father now said rather abruptly have so much to say to himand to elfride will what have to say endanger nice time of ours be that same shadowy secret allude to so frequently will make unhappy possibly breathed heavily looked around a if for prompter put off till to morrow said involuntarily sighed too must come to night where be father elfride somewhere in kitchen garden think replied be favourite evening retreat will leave now say thats to be saiddo there be to be done think of waiting anxiously for end re entered house waited in drawing room watching light sink to shadow shadow sink to darkness until impatience to know what have occurred in garden must no longer be controlled passed round shrubbery unlatched garden door skimmed with keen eye whole twilighted space that four wall enclosed sheltered be not there mounted little ladder have be used for gathering fruit looked over wall into field field extended to limit of glebe be enclosed on side by privet hedge under hedge be mr swancourt walking up down talking aloudto a sounded at first voice shouted occasional reply interlocutor seemed to be on other side of hedge voice though soft in quality be not stephen second speaker must have be in long neglected garden of old manor house hard by together with small estate attached have lately be purchased by person named troyton whom elfride have never seen father might have struck up acquaintanceship with member of family through privet hedge stranger to neighbourhood might have wandered thither well there be necessity for disturbing seemed that after stephen have not yet made desired communication to father again went indoors wondering where stephen must be for want of something better to do went upstairs to own little room here sat down at open window leaning with elbow on table cheek upon hand fell into meditation be hot still august night disturbance of silence rose to dignity of noise must be heard for mile merest sound for long distance so remained thinking of stephen wishing have not deprived her of company to purpose a appeared how delicate sensitive be reflected yet be man enough to have private mystery considerably elevated in eye thus looking at thing with inward vision lost consciousness of flight of time strange conjunction of circumstance particularly of trivial everyday kind be so frequent in ordinary life that grow used to unaccountableness forget question whether very long odds against such juxtaposition be not almost disproof of being matter of chance at what occurred to elfride at moment be case in point be vividly imagining for twentieth time kiss of morning putting lip together in position one must demand when heard identical operation performed on lawn immediately beneath window kissnot of quiet stealthy kind decisive loud smart face flushed looked out to purpose dark rim of upland drew keen sad line against pale glow of sky unbroken except where young cedar on lawn have outgrown fellow tree shot pointed head across horizon piercing firmamental lustre like sting be just possible that have person be standing on grassy portion of lawn elfride might have seen dusky form shrub once have merely dotted glade have now grown bushy large till hid at least enclosure containing kissing pair might have be behind of at rate nobody be in sight have enigma ever be connected with lover by hint absence elfride must never have thought of admitting into mind suspicion that might be concerned in foregoing enactment reservation at present insisted on while added to mystery without perhaps must never have seriously loved at be calculated to nourish doubt of kind with slow flush of jealousy asked might not be culprit elfride glided downstairs on tiptoe out to precise spot on have parted from stephen to enable to speak privately to father thence wandered into nook around place from sound seemed to proceedamong huge laurestines about tuft of pampas grass amid variegated holly under weeping wych elmnobody be there returning indoors called unity be gone to aunt to spend evening said mr swancourt thrusting head out of study door letting light of candle stream upon elfrides faceless revealing than a seemed to herself creating blush of uneasy perplexity be burning upon cheek didnt know be indoors papa said with surprise surely light be shining from window when be on lawn looked saw that shutter be still open oh yes be in said indifferently what did want unity for think laid supper before went out did shei have not be to seei didnt want for elfride scarcely knew now that definite reason be required what that reason be mind for moment strayed to subject unimportant a seemed red ember of match be lying inside fender explained that why have seen ray from window be because candle have only just be lighted ill come directly said vicar thought be out somewhere with mr smith even inexperienced elfride must not help thinking that father must be wonderfully blind if failed to perceive what be nascent consequence of herself stephen being so unceremoniously left together wonderfully careless if saw did not think about wonderfully good if a seemed to by far most probable supposition saw thought about approved of reflection be cut short by appearance of stephen just outside porch silvered about head shoulder with touch of moonlight have begun to creep through tree have trouble anything to do with kiss on lawn asked abruptly almost passionately kiss on lawn yes said imperiously now didnt comprehend meaning do now exactly certainly have kissed nobody on lawn if be really what want to know elfride know nothing about performance nothing what make ask dont press to tell be nothing of importance stephen have not yet spoken to papa about engagement no said regretfully must not find directly then went on thinking so much of what said about objection refusalsbitter word possiblyending happiness resolved to put off till to morrow give one more day of delightdelight of tremulous kind yes must be improper to be silent too long think said in delicate voice implied that face have grown warm want to know love stephen why did adopt a own thought of delay will explain want to tell of secret firstto tell now be two three hour yet to bedtime let walk up hill to church elfride passively assented went from lawn by side wicket ascended into open expanse of moonlight streamed around lonely edifice on summit of hill door be locked turned from porch walked hand in hand to find resting place in churchyard stephen chose flat tomb showing to be newer whiter than around sitting down gently drew hand towards no not there said why not here mere fancy never mind sat down elfie will love in spite of everything may be said against o stephen what make repeat that so continually so sadly know will yes indeed said drawing closer may be

on in world in such way be not worthiness be knight who pushed ah always healways yes properly so now elfride see reason of teaching by letter knew year before went to oxford have not got far enough in reading for to entertain idea of helping in classic till left home then be sent away from village very seldom met kept up system of tuition by correspondence with greatest regularity will tell

of odour of norman ancestry ah if have made fortune shouldnt mind be only possible maker of a yet be quite enough so be what trouble be thought be doing wrong in letting love without telling story yet feared to do so elfie dreaded to lose be cowardly on account how plain everything about seems after explanation peculiarity in chess playing pronunciation papa noticed in latin odd mixture of book

perhaps ought to have told before sat down yes let go chapter ix father did fume oppressed in spite of by foresight of impending complication elfride stephen returned down hill hand in hand at door paused wistfully like child late at school woman accept destiny more readily than men elfride have now resigned to overwhelming idea of lover sorry antecedent stephen have not forgotten trifling grievance that elfride have known earlier admiration than own what be young man name inquired felix jethway widow only son remember family hate now say killed stephen mused entered porch stephen love only tremulously whispered pressed finger trifling shadow passed away to admit again mutual more tangible trouble study appeared to be only room lighted up entered with demeanour intended to conceal inconcealable fact that reciprocal love be dominant chord elfride perceived man sitting with back towards talking to father must have retired mr swancourt have seen come in said be only martin cannister come for copy of register for poor mr jethway martin cannister sexton be rather favourite with elfride used to absorb attention by telling of strange experience in digging up after long year body of person have known recognizing by little sign though in reality have never recognized have shrewd small eye great wealth of double chin compensated in measure for considerable poverty of nose appearance of slip of paper in cannister hand few shilling lying on table in front of denoted that business have be transacted tenor of conversation went to show that summary of village news be now engaging attention of parishioner parson mr cannister stood up touched forehead over eye with finger in respectful salutation of elfride gave half a much salute to stephen whom in common with other villager have never for moment recognized then sat down again resumed discourse where have got on to sir to driving pile said mr swancourt pile twas so a be saying nat be driving pile in manner a might say here mr cannister held walking stick scrupulously vertical with left hand struck blow with great force on knob of stick with right john be steadying pile so a might say here gave stick slight shake looked firmly in various eye around to see that before proceeding further listener well grasped subject at stage well when nat have struck half dozen blow more upon pile stopped for second two john thinking have done striking put hand upon top o pile to gie en pull see if be firm in ground mr cannister spread hand over top of stick completely covering with palm well so to speak nat hadnt maned to stop striking when john have put hand upon pile beetle oh dreadful said elfride beetle be already coming down see sir nat just caught sight of hand couldnt stop blow in time down came beetle upon poor john smith hand squashed en to pummy dear dear poor fellow said vicar with intonation like groan of wounded in pianoforte performance of battle of prague john smith master mason cried stephen hurriedly ay other better hearted man god amighty never made be so much hurt have heard said mr swancourt not noticing stephen that have son in very promising young fellow oh how must be hurt repeated stephen beetle couldnt hurt very little well sir good night tye ye sir miss im sure mr cannister have be making unnoticeable motion of withdrawal by time farewell remark came from lip be just outside door of room tramped along hall stayed more than minute endeavouring to close door properly then be lost to hearing stephen have meanwhile turned said to vicar please excuse evening must leave john smith be father vicar did not comprehend at first what did say inquired john smith be father said stephen deliberately surplus tinge of redness rose from mr swancourts neck came round over face line of feature became more firmly defined lip seemed to get thinner be evident that series of little circumstance hitherto unheeded be now fitting together forming lucid picture in mr swancourts mind in such manner a to render useless further explanation on stephen part indeed vicar said in voice dry without inflection being word depends entirely upon tone for meaning mr swancourts enunciation be equivalent to expression at have to go now said stephen with agitated bearing movement a if scarcely knew whether ought to run off stay longer on return sir will kindly grant few minute private conversation certainly though antecedently doe not seem possible that there can be anything of nature of private business between mr swancourt put on straw hat crossed drawing room into moonlight be shining stepped out of french window into verandah required further effort to perceive what indeed reasoning might have foretold a natural colour of mind whose pleasure be taken amid genealogy good dinner patrician reminiscence mr swancourts prejudice be too strong for generosity that stephen moment a friend equal be numbered have even now ceased stephen moved forward a if must follow vicar then a if must not in absolute perplexity whither to turn went awkwardly to door elfride followed lingeringly behind before have receded two yard from doorstep unity ann housemaid came home from visit to village have heard anything about john smith accident be not so bad a be reported be said elfride intuitively oh doctor say be only bad bruise thought so cried elfride gladly say that although nat belief did not check beetle a came down must have done so without knowing itchecked very considerably too for full blow must have knocked hand abroad in reality be only made black blue like how thankful be said perplexed unity looked at with mouth rather than with eye will do unity said elfride magisterially two maid passed on elfride do forgive said stephen with faint smile man be fair in love took finger lightly in own with head thrown sideways in greuze attitude looked tender reproach at doubt pressed hand stephen returned pressure threefold then hastily went off to father cottage by wall of endelstow park elfride have to say to inquired father coming up immediately stephen have retired with feminine quickness grasped at straw must enable to plead cause have told of faltered so that be not discovery in spite of be just coming in to tell coming to tell why hadnt already told object a much if not more to underhand concealment of than do to fact look very much like making fool of of too have be about together corresponding together in way dont at approve ofin most unseemly way must have known how improper such conduct be woman cant be too careful not to be seen alone with dont know whom saw papa have never said word fault of course fault what deuce must be thinking of villager son swancourts connection of luxellians have be coming to nothing for century

remembered that be christian must not for world seem to turn out of door added think will have tact to see that can not stay long after with good taste will because he gentleman see how graceful manner be elfride went on though perhaps stephen manner like feat of euryalus owed attractiveness in eye rather to attractiveness of person than to own excellence ay anybody can be what call graceful if life little time in city keep eye open might have picked up gentlemanliness by going to gallery of theatre watching stage drawing room manner reminds of one of worst story ever heard in life what story be that oh thank wouldnt tell improper matter for world if father mother have lived in north east of england gallantly persisted elfride though sob began to interrupt articulation anywhere

scarcely idea to under proper training must not have added respectable co ordinate saw nothing outside to night what saw within be weariness to flesh yet to dispassionate observer pretension to elfride though rather premature be far from absurd a marriage go unless accidental proximity of simple honest parent must be said to make so clock struck eleven when entered house elfride have be waiting with scarcely movement since departed before have spoken to caught sight of passing into study with father saw that have by mean obtained private interview desired nervous headache have be growing on excitable girl during absence of stephen now must hing beyond going up again to room a have done before instead of lying down sat again in darkness without closing door listened with

that meal such a be passed off between father lover without remark save commonplace a to cucumber melon wholesomeness culture uttered in stiff formal way seemed to prefigure failure shortly afterwards stephen came upstairs to bedroom be almost immediately followed by father who also retired for night not inclined to get light partly undressed sat on bed where remained in pained thought for time possibly hour then rising to close door previously to fully unrobing saw streak of light shining across landing father door be shut must be heard snoring regularly light came from stephen room slight

taper light in hand looking unnaturally tall thin in long dove coloured dressing gown wore did not stop to think of propriety otherwise of midnight interview under such circumstance thought that tragedy of life be beginning for first time almost felt that existence might have grave side shade of enveloped rendered invisible delicate gradation of custom punctilio elfride softly opened drawing room door went in when have placed candle on table enclosed with arm dried eye with handkerchief kissed lid stephen be overhappy love be over there be more sunshine now will make fortune come to have yes will papa will never hear of itnevernever dont know do be biassed in favour of thing prejudiced against argument be powerless against feeling wont think of so said stephen if appear before time

to give up when time have made fainter in memory for remember love for must be nourished in secret there will be no long visit from to support circumstance will always tend to obliterate stephen said filled with own misgiving unheeding last word there be beautiful woman where liveof course know there areand may win away from tear came visibly a drew mental picture of faithlessness wont be fault continued looking into candle with doleful eye will think that family dont want get to include with there will be vacancy in heart others will be let in must not must not elfie be so full of

arose from special feature of own case however remote desired issue may be mere fact of having entered groove lead to cheer to extent with sense of accomplishment have mr swancourt consented to engagement of le length than ten year stephen must have be comparatively cheerful in waiting must have felt that be somewhere on road to cupid garden with possibility of shorter probation have not a

counterpart of hers to marry part secretly live on a be living now merely to put out of anybodys power to force away from dearest away from stephen from be possible to conceive force of circumstance strong enough to make woman in world marry against will conceivable pressure up to torture starvation can make woman once married to lover anybody el wife now up to point idea of immediate secret marriage have be held by a untenable hypothesis wherewith simply to beguile miserable moment during pause followed stephen last remark fascinating perception then alluring conviction flashed along brain of perception be that immediate marriage must be contrived conviction that act in spite of daring fathomless result deceptiveness must be preferred by to life must lead under other condition youth spoke first voice trembled with magnitude of conception be cherishing how strong must feel elfride going on separate course a before without fear of ultimate separation o elfride think of think of be certain that young girl love for stephen received fanning from father opposition made blaze with dozen time intensity must have exhibited if left alone never be condition more favourable for developing girl first passing fancy for handsome boyish facea fancy rooted in inexperience nourished by seclusioninto wild unreflecting passion fervid enough for anything element of development be there chief one being hopelessnessa necessary ingredient always to perfect mixture of feeling united under name of loving to distraction must tell papa soon must not inquired timidly nobody else need know must then be convinced that heart can not be played with love encouraged be ready to grow love discouraged be ready to die at moment notice stephen do not think that if marriage against parent consent be ever justifiable be when young people have be favoured up to point a have then have have that favour suddenly withdrawn yes be not a if have from beginning acted in opposition to papa wish only think elfie how pleasant be towards six hour ago liked praised never objected to being alone with believe must like now cried if found that irremediably belonged to must own help o stephen

stephen seemed to meit seems to nowlike trying to catch youa girl better in world than not that indeed be better in worldly station whats use of have beens may have be something once be nothing now then whispered long earnestly together stephen hesitatingly proposing plan elfride modifying with quick breathing hectic flush unnaturally bright eye be two oclock before arrangement be finally concluded then told to leave giving light to go up to own room parted with agreement not to meet again in morning after door have be time closed heard softly gliding into chamber chapter xi journey end in lover meeting stephen lay watching great bear elfride be regarding monotonous parallelogram of window blind slept that night early next morningthat be to say four hour after stolen interview just a earliest servant be heard moving aboutstephen smith went downstairs portmanteau in hand throughout night have intended to see mr swancourt again sharp rebuff of previous evening rendered interview particularly distasteful perhaps there be le honest reason decided to put off whatever of moral timidity obliquity may have lain in such decision perception of be strong enough to detain wrote note in room stated simply that did not feel happy in house after mr swancourts sudden veto on what have favoured few hour before that hoped time must come soon when original feeling of pleasure a mr swancourts guest might be recovered expected to find downstairs room wearing gray cheerless aspect that early morning give to everything out of sun found in dining room breakfast laid of somebody have just partaken stephen gave maid servant note of adieu stated that mr swancourt have risen early that morning made early breakfast be not going away that knew of stephen took cup of coffee left house of love turned into lane be so early that shaded place still smelt like night time sunny spot have hardly felt sun horizontal ray made willow dip in ground to show a well marked hollow even channel of path be enough to throw shade very stone of road cast tapering dash of darkness westward a long a jaels tent nail at spot not more than hundred yard from vicar residence lane leading thence crossed high road stephen reached point of intersection stood still listened nothing must be heard save lengthy murmuring line of sea upon adjacent shore looked at watch then mounted gate upon seated to await arrival of carrier whilst sat heard wheel coming in two direction vehicle approaching on right soon recognized a carrier there be accompanying sound of owner voice smack of whip distinct in still morning air by encouraged horse up hill other set of wheel sounded from lane stephen have just traversed on closer observation perceived that be moving from precinct of ancient manor house adjoining vicarage ground carriage then left entrance gate of house wheeling round came fully in sight be plain travelling carriage with small quantity of luggage apparently lady vehicle came to junction of four way minute before carrier reached same spot crossed directly in front proceeding by lane on other side inside carriage stephen must just discern elderly lady with younger woman who seemed to be maid road have taken led to stratleigh small watering place sixteen mile north heard manor house gate swing again looking up saw person leaving walking off in direction of parsonage ah how much wish be moving way felt parenthetically gentleman be tall resembled mr swancourt in outline attire opened vicarage gate went in mr swancourt then certainly be instead of remaining in bed that morning mr swancourt must have taken into head to see new neighbour off on journey must have be greatly interested in neighbour to do unusual thing carrier conveyance have pulled up stephen now handed in portmanteau mounted shaft who be lady in carriage inquired indifferently of lickpan carrier that sir be mr troyton widder wi mint o money shes owner of part of endelstow be not lord luxellians only be here short time came into by law owner formerly be terrible mysterious partynever lived herehardly ever be seen here except in month of september a might say horse be started again noise rendered further discourse matter of too great exertion stephen crept inside under tilt be soon lost in reverie three hour half of straining up hill jogging down brought to st launce market town railway station nearest to endelstow place from stephen smith have journeyed over down on to memorable winter evening at beginning of same year carrier van be so timed a to meet starting up train stephen entered two three hour railway travel through vertical cutting in metamorphic rock through oak copse rich green stretching over slope down delightful valley glen ravine sparkling with water like many rilled ida plunged amid hundred fifty thousand people composing town of plymouth there being time upon hand left luggage at cloak room went on foot along bedford street to nearest church here stephen wandered among multifarious tombstone looked in at chancel window dreaming of something be likely to happen by altar there in course of coming month turned away ascended hoe viewed magnificent stretch of sea massive promontory of land without particularly discerning one feature of varied perspective still saw that inner prospectthe event hoped for in yonder church wide sound breakwater light house on far off eddystone dark steam vessel brig barque schooner floating stilly gliding with tiniest motion be a dream then dreamed of event be a reality soon stephen went down from hoe returned to railway station took ticket entered london train that day be irksome time at endelstow vicarage father daughter alluded to departure of stephen mr swancourts manner towards partook of compunctious kindness arises from misgiving a to justice of previous act from lack of capacity to grasp whole coup doeil from natural endowment for certain kind of stoicism woman be cooler than men in critical situation of passive form probably in elfrides case at least be blindness to greater contingency of future be preparing for enabled to ask father in quiet voice if must give holiday soon to ride to st launce go on to plymouth now have only once before gone alone to plymouth be in consequence of unavoidable difficulty being country girl good not to say wild horsewoman have be delight to canter without ghost of attendant over fourteen sixteen mile of hard road intervening between home station at st launce put up horse go on remainder of distance by train returning in same manner in evening be then resolved that though have successfully accomplished journey once be not to be repeated without attendance elfride must not be confounded with ordinary young feminine equestrian circumstance of lonely narrow life made imperative that in trotting about neighbourhood must trot alone else not at usage soon rendered perfectly natural to herself father who have have other experience did not much like idea of swancourt whose pedigree must be a distinctly traced a thread in skein of silk scampering over hill like farmer daughter even though must habitually neglect what with not being able to afford regular attendant inveterate habit of letting anything be to save trouble circumstance grew customary so there arose chronic notion in villager mind that lady rode without attendant like miss swancourt except few who be sometimes visiting at lord luxellians dont like going to plymouth alone particularly going to st launce on horseback why not drive take man be not nice to be so overlooked worm company must not seriously have interfered with plan be humour to go without when do want to go said father only answered soon will consider said only few day elapsed before asked again letter have reached from stephen have be timed to come on day by special arrangement between in named earliest morning on must meet at plymouth father have be on journey to stratleigh returned in unusual buoyancy of spirit be good opportunity since dismissal of stephen father have be generally in mood to make small concession that might steer clear of large one connected with outcast lover of hers next thursday week be going from home in different direction said father in fact will leave home night before might choose same day for wish to take up carpet such thing think a said dont like to be seen in town on horseback alone go if will thursday week father have named very day that stephen also have named that morning a earliest on must be of use to meet be about fifteen day from day on have left endelstow fifteen daysthat fragment of duration have acquired interesting individuality from connection with english marriage law involuntarily looked at father so strangely that on becoming conscious of look paled with embarrassment father too looked confused what be thinking of there seemed to be special facility offered by power external to herself in circumstance mr swancourt have proposed to leave home night previous to wished for day father seldom took long journey seldom slept from home except perhaps on night following remote visitation well must not inquire too curiously into reason of opportunity did a must have be natural proceed to explain of own accord in matter of fact there have hitherto be reserve between though be not usually confidential in full sense divergence of emotion on stephen account have produced estrangement just at present went even to extent of reticence on most ordinary household topic elfride be almost unconsciously relieved persuading that father reserve on business justified in secrecy a regarded owna secrecy be necessarily foregone decision with so anxious be young conscience to discover palliative that ex post facto

take on to house why miss be doing what father have done for last fortnight did not comprehend why come to corner take letter of morning writ in same handwriting letting others for go on to house on postman went sooner have turned corner behind back than heard father meet address man have saved letter by two minute father audibly went through precisely same performance a have just be guilty of herself stealthy conduct of be to say least peculiar given impulsive inconsequent girl neglected a to inner life by only parent following force alive within to determine resultant first love acted upon by deadly fear of separation from object inexperience guiding onward frantic wish to prevent above named issue misgiving a to propriety met by hope of ultimate exoneration indignation at parental inconsistency in first encouraging then forbidding chilling sense of disobedience overpowered by conscientious inability to brook breaking of plighted faith with man who in essential have remained unaltered from beginning blessed hope that opposition must turn erroneous judgement bright faith thing must mend thereby wind up well probably result must after have be nil have not following few remark be made one day at breakfast father be in old hearty spirit smiled to at story too bad to tell called elfride little scamp for surreptitiously preserving blind kitten ought to have be drowned after expression said to suddenly if mr smith have be already in family must not have be made wretched by discovering have poor relation do mean in family by marriage replied inattentively continuing to peel egg accumulating scarlet told be meaning a much a affirmative reply must have put up with doubt mr swancourt observed so that must not have be driven into hopeless melancholy have made best of elfrides erratic mind have from youth upwards be constantly in habit of perplexing father by hypothetical question based on absurd condition present seemed to be cast so precisely in mould of previous one that not being given to synthesis of circumstance answered with customary complacency if be allied to irretrievably of course sensible man must accept condition must not be altered certainly not be hopelessly melancholy about dont believe anything in world must make hopelessly melancholy dont let anything make so either wont papa cried with serene brightness pleased certainly mr swancourt must have be far from thinking that brightness came from exhilarating intention to hold back longer from mad action have planned in evening drove away towards stratleigh quite alone be unusual course for at door elfride have be again almost impelled by feeling to pour out why be going to stratleigh papa said looked at longingly will tell to morrow when come back said cheerily not before then

pseudonym in vanity conceit because be afraid must be thought presumptuous to publish name that did not mean story for such a a sweetener of history for young people who might thereby acquire taste for what went on in own country hundred of year ago be tempted to dive deeper into subject oh there be so much to explain wish might write now elfie ill tell what will do answered mr swancourt tickled with sort of bucolic humour at idea of criticizing critic will write clear account of what be wrong in will copy send a mine yes now directly said elfride jumping up when will send papa oh in day two

critic mind at noon at night have be pestering with endeavour to perceive more distinctly conception of a woman apart from author whether really despised whether thought more le of than of ordinary young woman who never ventured into fire of criticism at now must have satisfaction of feeling at rate knew true intent in crossing path annoying so by performance be taught perhaps to despise little

swancourt also laughing in low quiet jerk will make meeting such comical affair afford splendid by play for father idea of running head against harry knight time can not get over vicar have immediately remembered name to be that of stephen smith preceptor friend having ceased to concern in matter made remark to effect consistently forbearing to allude to anything must restore recollection of to disagreeable mistake with regard to poor stephen lineage position elfride have of course perceived same thing added to complication of relationship mesh that stepmother knew nothing of identification scarcely heightened knight attraction now though twelvemonth ago must only have cared to see for interest possessed a stephen friend fortunately for knight advent reason for welcome have only begun to be awkward to at time when interest have acquired on own account made no longer necessary coincidence in common with relating to tended to keep elfrides mind upon stretch concerning knight a be custom when upon horn of dilemma walked off by among laurel bush there standing still splitting up leaf without removing from stalk fetched back recollection of stephen frequent word in praise of friend wished have listened more attentively then still pulling leaf must blush at fancied mortification must accrue to from word when met in consequence of intrusiveness a now considered in writing to next development of meditation be subject of what man personal appearance might bewas tall short dark fair gay grim must have asked mr swancourt for risk might thereby incur of teasing

mile up valley leaving luggage to be brought on behind wandered helter skelter boy of whom knight have briefly inquired way to endelstow by natural law of physic cause lesser body to gravitate towards greater boy have kept near to knight trotted like little dog close at heel whistling a went with eye fixed upon knight boot a rose fell when have reached point precisely opposite that in mr miss swancourt lay in ambush knight stopped turned round look here boy said boy parted lip opened eye answered nothing here sixpence for on condition that dont again come within twenty yard of heel way up valley boy who apparently have not known have be looking at knight heel at took sixpence mechanically knight went on again wrapt in meditation nice voice elfride thought what singular temper now must get indoors before ascends slope said mr swancourt softly went across by short cut over stile entering lawn by side door so on to house mr swancourt have gone into village with curate elfride felt too nervous to await visitor arrival in drawing room with mr swancourt so that when elder lady entered elfride made pretence of perceiving new variety of crimson geranium lingered behind among flower bed there be nothing gained by after thought few minute after boldly came into house by glass side door walked along corridor entered drawing room nobody be there window at angle of room opened directly into octagonal conservatory enclosing corner of building from conservatory came voice in conversationmrs swancourts stranger have expected to talk brilliantly to surprise be asking question in quite learner manner on subject connected with flower shrub that have known for year when after lapse of few minute spoke at length considered there be hard square decisiveness in shape of sentence a if unlike own stephen be not there then newly constructed be drawn forth from large store ready made be now approaching window to come in again be flesh coloured variety said mr swancourt oleander though be such bulky shrub be so very easily wounded a to be unprunablegiants with sensitiveness of young lady oh here be elfride elfride looked a guilty crestfallen a lady teazle at dropping of screen mr swancourt presented half comically knight in minute two placed beside young lady complexity of instinct checked elfrides conventional smile of complaisance hospitality to make still le comfortable mr swancourt immediately afterwards left together to seek husband mr knight however did not seem at incommoded by feeling said with light easefulness so miss swancourt have met at last escaped by few minute only when be in london yes found that have seen mr swancourt now reviewer reviewed be face to face added unconcernedly yes though fact of being relation of mr swancourts take off edge of be strange that must be one of family time elfride began to recover now to look into knight face be merely anxious to let know real meaning in writing bookextremely anxious can quite understand wish be gratified that remark must have reached home very seldom do be afraid elfride drew in here be sticking to opinion a firmly a if friendship politeness did not in least require immediate renunciation of made very uneasy sorry by writing such thing murmured suddenly dropping mere cacueterie of fashionable first introduction speaking with of dudgeon of child towards severe schoolmaster be rather object of honest critic in case not to cause unnecessary sorrow to make sorry after proper manner that ye may receive damage by in nothing a powerful pen once wrote to gentile be going to write romance write said that somebody may pen condemnation nailt wi scripture again a do now mr knight may do better next time said placidly think will must advise to confine to domestic scene thank never again well may be right that young woman have taken to writing be not by mean best thing to hear about what be best prefer not to say do know then do tell please wellknight be evidently changing meaningi suppose to hear that have married elfride hesitated what when have be married said at last partly in order to withdraw own person from argument then to hear more about be a smeaton said of lighthouse greatest real praise when novelty of inauguration have worn off be that nothing happens to keep talk of alive yes see said elfride softly thoughtfully of course be different quite with men why dont write novel mr knight because couldnt write one must interest anybody why for several reason requires judicious omission of real thought to make novel popular for one thing be that really necessary well be sure must learn to do with practice said elfride with ex cathedra air a became person who spoke from experience in art must make great name for certain continued so many people make name nowadays that be more distinguished to remain in obscurity tell seriouslyapart from subjectwhy dont write volume instead of loose article insisted since be pleased to make talk of myself will tell seriously said knight not le amused at catechism by young friend than be interested in appearance a have implied have not wish if have wish must not now concentrate sufficiently have only one cruse of energy given to make best of where energy have be leaked away week by week quarter by quarter a mine have for last nine ten year there be not enough dammed back behind mill at given period to supply force complete book on subject requires then there be self confidence waiting power where quick result have grown customary be fatal to lively faith in future yes comprehend so choose to write in fragment dont choose to do in sense mean choosing from whole world of profession possible be by constraint of accident merely not that object to accident why dont objecti mean why do feel so quiet about thing elfride be half afraid to question so intense curiosity to see what inside of literary mr knight be like kept going on knight certainly did not mind being frank with instance of trait in men who be not without feeling be reticent from habit may be recalled by of when find listener who can by possibility make use of rival condemn reserved even suspicious men of world become frank keenly enjoying inner side of frankness why dont mind accidental constraint replied be because in making beginning chance limitation of direction be often better than absolute freedom seethat be must if quite understood what generality mean why that arbitrary foundation for one work length of thought can alter leaf attention free to fix on work make best of lateral compression forcing altitude a must be said in tongue said mischievously suppose where limit exists a in case of rich man with wide taste who want to do something will be better to choose limit capriciously than to have none yes said meditatively can go a far a well resumed elfride think better for man nature if doe nothing in particular there be such case a being obliged to yes yes be speaking of when be not obliged for other reason than delight in prospect of fame have thought many time lately that thin widespread happiness commencing now of piece with day of life be preferable to anticipated heap far away in future none now why thats very thing said just now a being principle of ephemeral doer like oh be sorry to have parodied said with confusion yes of course be what meant about not trying to be famous added with quickness of conviction characteristic of mind there be much littleness in trying to be great man must think good deal of be conceited enough to believe in before try at be soon enough to say there be harm in man thinking good deal of when be proved have be thinking wrong too soon then sometimes besides must not conclude that man who strives earnestly for success doe so with strong sense of own merit may see how little success have to do with merit motive may be very humility manner of treating rather provoked elfride sooner did agree with than ceased to seem to wish took other side ah thought inwardly will have nothing to do with man of kind though be visitor think will find resumed knight pursuing conversation more for sake of finishing off thought on subject than for engaging attention that in actual life be merely matter of instinct with menthis trying to push on awake to recognition that have without premeditation begun to try little say to since have tried thus much will try little more go on because have begun elfride in turn be not particularly attending to word at moment have unconsciously to herself way of seizing point in remark of interlocutor interested dwelling upon thinking thought of own thereupon totally oblivious of that might say in continuation on such occasion artlessly surveyed person speaking then there be time for painter eye seemed to look at past a be then into future past future into eternitynot reading gazing in unused unconscious wayher mind still clinging to original thought be how be looking at knight suddenly elfride became conscious of what be doing be painfully confused what be so intent upon in inquired a far a be thinking of at be thinking how clever be said with want of premeditation be startling in honesty simplicity feeling restless now that have so unwittingly spoken arose stepped to window having heard voice of father mr swancourt coming up below terrace here be said going out knight walked out upon lawn behind stood upon edge of terrace close to stone balustrade looked towards sun hanging over glade just now fair a tempes vale up father be walking knight must not help looking at sun be within ten degree of horizon warm light flooded face heightened bright rose colour of cheek to vermilion red moderate pink hue being only seen in natural tone where cheek curved round into end of hanging hair softly dragged backwards forward upon shoulder a faint breeze thrust against relinquished fringe ribbon of dress moved by same breeze licked like tongue upon part around fluttering forward from shady fold caught likewise share of lustrous orange glow mr swancourt shouted out welcome to knight from distance of about thirty yard after few preliminary word proceeded to conversation of deep earnestness on knight fine old family name theory a to lineage intermarriage connected therewith knight portmanteau having in meantime arrived soon retired to prepare for dinner have be postponed two hour later than usual time of meal arrival be event in life of elfride now that be again in country that of knight necessarily engrossing one that evening went to bed for first time without thinking of stephen at chapter xviii heard musical pant old tower of west endelstow church have reached last week of existence be to be replaced by new one from design of mr hewby architect who have sent down stephen plank pole have arrived in churchyard iron bar have be thrust into venerable crack extending down belfry wall to foundation bell have be taken down owl have forsaken home of forefather six iconoclast in white fustian to whom cracked edifice be specie of mumbo jumbo have taken lodging in village previous to beginning actual removal of stone be day after knight arrival to enjoy for last time prospect seaward from summit vicar mr swancourt knight elfride ascended winding turretmr swancourt stepping forward with many loud breath wife struggling along silently suffering none le have hardly reached top when large lurid cloud palpably reservoir of rain thunder lightning be seen to be advancing from north two cautious elder suggested immediate return proceeded to put in practice a regarded dear wish have not come up exclaimed mr swancourt will be slower than two in going down vicar said over shoulder so dont start till be nearly at bottom will run over break neck somewhere in darkness of turret accordingly elfride knight waited on lead till staircase must be clear knight be not in talkative mood that morning elfride be rather wilful by reason of inattention privately set down to thinking not worth talking to whilst knight stood watching rise of cloud sauntered to other side of tower there remembered giddy feat have performed year before be to walk round upon parapet of towerwhich be quite without battlement pinnacle presented smooth flat surface about two foot wide forming pathway on four side without reflecting in least upon what be doing now stepped upon parapet in old way began walking along be down cousin henry cried mr swancourt up turret follow when like knight turned saw elfride beginning elevated promenade face flushed with mingled concern anger at rashness certainly gave credit for more common sense said reddened little walked on miss swancourt insist upon coming down exclaimed will in minute be safe enough have done often at moment by reason of slight perturbation word have caused in elfrides foot caught in little tuft of grass growing in joint of stone work almost lost balance knight sprang forward with face of horror by what seemed special interposition of considerate providence tottered to inner edge of parapet instead of to outer reeled over upon lead roof two three foot below wall knight seized a in vice said panting that ever must have met woman fool enough to do thing of kind good god ought to be ashamed of close proximity of shadow of death have made sick pale a corpse before spoke already lowered to state word completely over powered swooned away a held elfrides eye be not closed for more than forty second opened remembered position instantly face have altered expression from stern anger to pity severe remark have rather frightened struggled to be free if can stand of course may said loosened arm hardly know whether most to laugh at freak to chide for folly immediately sank upon lead work knight lifted again be hurt said murmured incoherent expression tried to smile saying with fitful aversion of face be only frightened put down do put down cant walk said knight dont know that how can be only frightened tell answered petulantly raised hand to forehead knight then saw that be bleeding from severe cut in wrist apparently where have descended upon salient corner of lead work elfride too seemed to perceive feel now for first time for minute nearly lost consciousness again knight rapidly bound handkerchief round place to add to complication thundercloud have be watching began to shed heavy drop of rain knight looked up saw vicar striding towards house mr swancourt waddling beside like hard driven duck a be so faint will be much better to let carry down said knight at rate inside out of rain objection to be lifted made impossible for to support for more than five step be folly great folly exclaimed setting down indeed murmured with tear in eye say will not be carried say be folly so be isnt be folly think at rate origin of be dont agree to neednt get so angry with be not worth indeed be be worth enmity of prince a be said of such now then will clasp hand behind neck may carry down without hurting have better will foreclose whats deprive of chance elfride gave little toss now dont writhe so when attempt to carry cant help then submit quietly dont care dont care murmured in languid tone with closed eye took into arm entered turret with slow cautious step descended round round then with gentleness of nursing mother attended to cut on arm during progress through operation of wiping binding up anew face changed aspect from pained indifference to something like bashful interest interspersed with small tremor shudder of trifling kind in centre of pale cheek small red spot size of wafer have now made appearance continued to grow larger elfride momentarily expected recurrence to lecture on foolishness knight said more than promise never to walk on parapet again will be pulled down soon so do in few minute continued in lower tone seriously be familiar of course a everybody be with strange sensation sometimes have life for moment exists in duplicate that have lived through moment before will again well felt on tower that something similar to scene be again to be common to god forbid said knight promise that will never again walk on such place on consideration do that thing have not be before know that will not be again vow therefore think more of such foolish fancy there have fallen great deal of rain unaccompanied by lightning few minute longer storm have ceased now take arm please oh be not necessary relapse into wilfulness be because have again connected epithet foolish with nonsense be quite necessary will rain again directly be not half recovered without more ado knight took hand drew under arm held there so firmly that must not have removed without struggle feeling like colt in halter for first time at thus being led along yet afraid to be angry be to great relief that saw carriage coming round corner to fetch fall upon roof be necessarily explained to extent upon entering house forbore to mention word of what have be doing to cause accident during remainder of afternoon elfride be invisible at dinner time appeared a bright a ever in drawing room after having be exclusively engaged with mr mr swancourt through intervening hour knight again found thrown with elfride have be looking over chess problem in one of illustrated periodical like chess miss swancourt yes be favourite scientific game indeed excludes other do play have played though not lately challenge elfride said vicar heartily play very well for lady mr knight will play asked elfride tentatively oh certainly will be delighted game began mr swancourt have forgotten similar performance with stephen smith year before elfride have not have begun to take for maxim undoubted truth that necessity of continuing faithful to stephen without suspicion dictated fickle behaviour almost a imperatively a fickleness fact however must give startling advantage to latter quality must ever appear knight by one of inexcusable oversight will sometimes afflict best of player placed rook in arm of one of pawn be first advantage looked triumphanteven ruthless by george what be thinking of said knight quietly then dismissed concern at accident club law well have wont mr knight said elfride suasively oh yes certainly said mr knight thought however just occurring to mind that have two three time allowed to replace man on religiously assuring that move be absolute blunder immediately took up unfortunate rook contest proceeded elfride having now rather better of game then won exchange regained position began to press hard elfride grew flurried placed queen on remaining rook file therehow stupid upon word did not see rook of course nobody fool must have put queen there knowingly spoke excitedly half expecting antagonist to give back move nobody of course said knight serenely stretched out hand towards royal victim be not very pleasant to have taken advantage of then said with vexation club law think said returned knight blandly mercilessly appropriating queen be on brink of pouting be ashamed to show tear almost stood in eye have be trying so hardso very hardthinking thinking till brain be in whirl seemed so heartless of to treat so after think be began what unkind to take advantage of pure mistake make in way lost rook by even purer mistake said enemy in inexorable tone without lifting eye yes however a logic be absolutely unanswerable merely registered protest can not endure cold blooded way of club professional player like staunton morphy just a if really mattered whether have raised finger from man knight smiled a pitilessly a before went on in silence checkmate said knight game said elfride peremptorily looking very warm with heart said knight checkmate said knight again at end of forty minute game returned resolutely ill give odds of bishop knight said to kindly thank elfride replied in tone intended for courteous indifference a fact very cavalier indeed checkmate said opponent without least emotion oh difference between elfrides condition of mind now when purposely made blunder that stephen smith might win be bedtime mind a distracted a if must throb out of head went off to chamber full of mortification at being beaten time after time when be aggressor having for two three year enjoyed reputation throughout globe of father brainwhich almost constituted entire worldof being excellent player fiasco be intolerable for unfortunately person most dogged in belief in false reputation be always that one possessor who have best mean of knowing that be not true in bed sleep came to soothe gentle thing being very middle of summer friend in respect of flying away at merest troublous cloud after lying awake till two oclock idea seemed to strike softly arose got light fetched chess praxis from library returning sitting up in bed diligently studied volume till clock struck five eyelid felt thick heavy then extinguished light lay down again look pale elfride said mr swancourt next morning at breakfast isnt cousin young girl who be scarcely ill at can hardly help becoming so when regarded a such by eye turning upon at table in obedience to remark everybody looked at elfride certainly be pale be pale said with faint smile did not sleep much must not get rid of army of bishop knight try how must chess be bad thing just before bedtime especially for excitable people like dear dont ever play late again ill play early instead cousin knight said in imitation of mr swancourt will oblige in something even to half kingdom well be to play one game more when now instantly moment have breakfasted nonsense elfride said father making slave to game like want to papa honestly be restless at having be so ignominiously overcome mr knight doesnt mind so what harm can there be let play by mean if wish said knight so when breakfast be over combatant withdrew to quiet of library door be closed elfride seemed to have idea that conduct be rather ill regulated startlingly free from conventional restraint worse fancied upon knight face slightly amused look at proceeding think foolish suppose said recklessly want to do very best just once see whether can overcome certainly nothing more natural though be afraid be not plan adopted by woman of world after defeat why pray because know that a good a overcoming be skill in effacing recollection of being overcome turn attention to entirely be wrong again of course perhaps wrong be more pleasing than right dont quite know whether mean that whether be laughing at said looking doubtingly at yet inclining to accept more flattering interpretation be almost sure think vanity in to think be match for well if do say that vanity be crime in such case well perhaps not though be hardly virtue oh yes in battle nelson bravery lay in vanity indeed then so did death oh for be written in book of prophet shakespeare fear be slain worse can come to fight fight die be death destroying death down sat contest began elfride having first move game progressed elfrides heart beat so violently that must not sit still dread be lest must hear did discover at lastsome flower upon table being set throbbing by pulsation think have better give over said knight looking at gently be too much for know let write down position finish time please not implored must not rest if did not know result at once be move ten minute passed started up suddenly know what be doing cried angry colour upon cheek eye indignant be thinking of letting win to please dont mind owning be knight responded phlegmatically appearing more so by contrast with own turmoil must not wont have very well will not do insist that promise not to do such absurd thing be insulting very well madam wont do such absurd thing will not win be to be proved

cutting up be pursued amid animated discourse on stephen travel at finish first fruit of day slaughter fried in onion be then turned from pan into dish on table piece steaming hissing till reached very mouth must be owned that gentlemanly son of house looked rather out of place in course of operation be mind quite philosophic enough to allow to be comfortable with old established person father friend have never lived long at homescarcely at since childhood presence of william worm be most awkward feature of case for though worm have left house of mr swancourt being hand in glove with ci devant servitor reminded stephen too forcibly of vicar classification of before went from england mr smith be conscious of defect in arrangement have brought about undesired conjunction spoke to stephen privately be above having such people here stephen what must do father be so rough in nature he more mixed up with than need be never mind mother said stephen ill put up with now when leave

looking still a fresh a new a when be first erected white stone in be hewn having singular weirdness amid dark blue slab from local quarry of whole remaining gravestone be formed thought of night when have sat thereon with elfride a companion well remembered regret that have received even unwillingly earlier homage than own present tangible anxiety reduced feeling to sentimental nonsense in

envelope paper contained not word from elfride be deposit note for two hundred pound on back be form of cheque have filled up with same sum payable to bearer stephen be confounded attempted to divine motive considering how limited be knowledge of later action guessed rather shrewdly that between time of sending note in morning evening silent refusal of gift something have occurred have caused total change in attitude towards knew not what to do seemed absurd now to go to father next morning a have purposed ask for engagement with possibility impending while elfride must not be on side only one course recommended a wise to wait see what day must bring forth to go execute commission in birmingham then to return learn if anything have happened try what meeting might do perhaps surprise at backwardness must bring forward to show latent warmth a decidedly a in old time act of patience be in keeping only with nature of man precisely of stephen constitution nine men out of ten must perhaps have rushed off got into presence by fair mean foul provoked catastrophe of sort possibly for better probably for worse started for birmingham next morning day delay must have made difference must not

that new comer be greater man than first by side of instructive piquant snubbings received from knight stephen general agreeableness seemed watery by side of knight spare love making stephen continual outflow seemed lackadaisical have begun to sigh for somebody further on in manhood stephen be hardly enough of man perhaps there be proneness to inconstancy in naturea nature to who contemplate from standpoint beyond influence of inconstancy most exquisite of in plasticity ready sympathy partly too stephen failure to make hold on heart permanent one be too timid habit of dispraising beside hera

complexion of virtue following day be passed without definite avowal from knight lip such solitary walk scene a witnessed by smith in summer house be frequent courted so intangibly that to delicate perception a elfrides must have appeared courtship at time now really began to be sweet with dismissed sense of sin in past action be automatic in intoxication of moment fact that knight made actual declaration be drawback knowing since betrayal of sentiment love for really existed preferred for present in form of essence be willing to avoid for awhile grosser medium of word feeling having be forced to rather premature demonstration reaction be indulged in by sooner have got rid of troubled conscience on matter of faithlessness than new anxiety confronted be lest knight must accidentally meet stephen in parish that must be subject of discourse elfride learning knight more thoroughly perceived that far from having notion of stephen precedence have idea that have ever be wooed before by anybody on ordinary occasion have tongue so frank a to show whole mind mind so straightforward a to reveal heart to innermost shrine time for change have come never alluded to even knowledge of knight friend when woman be secret be secret indeed more often than not only begin to be secret with advent of second lover elopement be now spectre worse than first like spirit in glenfinlas waxed taller with attempt to lay natural honesty invited to confide in knight trust to generosity for forgiveness knew also that a mere policy must be better to tell early if be to be told at longer concealment

responsibility of fickleness seemed partly shifted from own shoulder to father still there be shadow ah must have known how far went with stephen yet have said same how much happier must be be prevailing thought in afternoon lover went out together on horseback for hour two though not wishing to be observed by reason of late death of lady luxellian whose funeral have taken place very privately on previous day yet found necessary to pas east endelstow church step to vault a have be stated be on outside of building immediately under aisle wall being on horseback knight elfride must overlook shrub screened church yard look vault seems still to be open said knight yes be open answered who be that man close by mason suppose yes wonder if be john smith stephen father believe be said elfride with apprehension ah can be must like to inquire how son truant proteg be going on from father description of vault interior must be interesting suppose go in have better do think may not lord luxellian be there be not at likely elfride then assented since must hing else heart at first have quailed in consternation recovered when considered character of john smith quiet unassuming man must be sure to act towards a before love passage with son might have given more pretentious mechanic air so without much alarm took knight arm after dismounting went with between over graf master mason recognized a approached a usual lifted hat respectfully know to be mr smith former friend stephen father said knight directly have scanned embrowned ruddy feature of john yes sir blieve be how be son

have idea sentiment be so flimsily formed a to be perturbed by few remnant of mortality stay out if be so afraid by mean oh be not afraid dont say that held miserably to arm thinking perhaps revelation might a well come at once a ten minute later for stephen must be sure to accompany friend to horse at first gloom of vault be lighted only by couple of candle be too great to admit of seeing anything distinctly with further advance knight discerned in front of black mass lining wall young man standing writing in pocket book knight said one word stephen stephen smith not being in such absolute ignorance of knight whereabouts a knight have be of smith instantly recognized friend knew by rote outline of fair woman standing behind stephen came forward shook by hand without speaking why have not written boy said knight without in way signifying elfrides presence to stephen to essayist smith be still country lad whom have patronized tended one to whom formal presentation of lady betrothed to must have seemed incongruous absurd why havent written to said stephen ah yes why havent why havent thats always query can not clearly answer without unsatisfactory sense of inadequacy however have not forgotten smith now have met must meet again have longer chat than can conveniently be must know have be doing that have thriven know must teach way elfride stood in background stephen have read position at glance immediately guessed that have never mentioned name to knight tact in avoiding catastrophe be chief quality made intellectually respectable in quality far transcended knight decided that tranquil issue out of encounter without harrowing of feeling of knight elfride be to be attempted if possible old sense of indebtedness to knight have never wholly forsaken love for elfride be generous now a far a dared look at movement saw that bearing towards must be dictated by own towards if acted a stranger must do likewise a mean of deliverance circumstance favouring course be desirable also to be rather reserved towards knight to shorten meeting a much a possible be afraid that time be almost too short to allow even of such pleasure said leave here to morrow until start for continent india will be in fortnight will have hardly moment to spare knight disappointment dissatisfied look at reply sent pang through stephen a great a have felt at sight of elfride word about shortness of time be literally true tone be far from being so must have be gratified to talk with knight a in past time saw a dead loss to that to save woman who cared nothing for be deliberately throwing away friend oh be sorry to hear said knight in changed tone of course if have weighty concern to attend to must not be neglected if be to be first last meeting let say that wish success with heart knight warmth revived towards end solemn impression be beginning to receive from scene around abstracting from heart a puerility momentary vexation at word be strange place for to meet in continued looking round vault stephen briefly assented there be silence blackened coffin be now revealed more clearly than at first whitened wall arch throwing forward in strong relief be scene be remembered by three a indelible mark in history knight with abstracted face be standing between companion though little in advance of elfride being on right hand stephen smith on left white daylight on right side gleamed faintly in be toned to blueness by contrast with yellow ray from candle against wall elfride timidly shrinking back nearest entrance received most of light therefrom whilst stephen be entirely in candlelight to spot of outer sky visible above step be a steely blue patch nothing more have be here two three time since be opened said stephen father be engaged in work know yes what be doing knight inquired looking at note book pencil stephen held in hand have be sketching few detail in church since then have be copying name from of coffin here before left england used to do good deal of sort of thing yes of course ah thats poor lady luxellian suppose knight pointed to coffin of light satin wood stood on stone sleeper in new niche remainder of family be on side who be two so snug close together stephen voice altered slightly a replied thats lady elfride kingsmoreborn luxellian be arthur husband have heard father say that theyheran away with married against wish of parent then imagine to be where got christian name miss swancourt said knight turning to think told be three four generation ago family branched off from luxellians be grandmother said elfride vainly endeavouring to moisten dry lip before spoke elfride have then conscience stricken look of guidos magdalen rendered upon more childlike form kept face partially away from knight stephen set eye upon sky visible outside a if salvation depended upon quickly reaching left hand rested lightly within knight arm half withdrawn from sense of shame at claiming before old lover yet unwilling to renounce so that glove merely touched sleeve can one be pardoned retain offence quoted elfrides heart then conversation seemed to have self sustaining power went on in shape of disjointed remark one mind get thronged with thought while standing so solemnly here knight said in measured quiet voice how much have be said on death from time to time how much ourselves can think upon may fancy of who lie here saying for thou to make fall more great didst lift up on high what come next elfride be hundred second psalm be thinking of yes know murmured went on in still lower voice seemingly afraid for word from emotional side of nature to reach stephen day just hastening to end be like evening shade beauty like witherd grass with waning lustre fade well said knight musingly let leave such occasion a seem to compel to roam outside far away from fragile frame live in to expand till perception grows so vast that physical reality bear sort of proportion to look back upon weak minute stem on luxuriant growth depends ask can be possible that capacity have foundation so small must again return to daily walk in narrow cell human body where worldly thought can torture do not yes said stephen elfride one have sense of wrong too that such appreciative breadth a sentient being posse must be committed to frail casket of body what weakens one intention regarding future like thought of thishowever let tune to more cheerful chord for there great deal to be done yet by a knight meditatively addressed junior thus unconscious of deception practised for different reason by severed heart at side of scene have in earlier day united one felt that did not gain by contrast with musing mentor physically not so handsome a youthful architect vicar daughter thoroughness integrity of knight illuminated feature with dignity not even incipient in other two be difficult to frame rule will apply to sex elfride undeveloped girl must perhaps hardly be laden with moral responsibility attach to man in like circumstance charm of woman too lie partly in subtleness in matter of love if honesty be virtue in elfride having none of now seemed being for being scarcely good enough for knight stephen though deceptive for unworthy purpose be deceptive after good result grace such strategy if succeed seldom draw admiration especially when fails on ordinary occasion have knight be even quite alone with stephen must hardly have alluded to possible relationship to elfride moved by attendant circumstance knight be impelled to be confiding stephen said lady be miss swancourt be staying at father house a probably know stepped few pace nearer to smith said in lower tone may a well tell that be engaged to be married low a word have be spoken elfride have heard awaited stephen reply in breathless silence if must be called silence where elfrides dress at throb of heart shook indicated like pulse glass rustling also against wall in reply to same throbbing ray of daylight reached face lent blue pallor in comparison with of other two congratulate stephen whispered said aloud know miss swancourta little must remember that father be parishioner of mr swancourts thought might possibly not have lived at home since have be here have never lived at home certainly since time have seen mr smith faltered elfride well there be excuse for a stranger to other ought suppose to have introduced a acquaintance must not have stood so persistently between fact be smith seem boy to even now stephen appeared to have more than previous consciousness of intense cruelty of fate at present moment must not repress word uttered with dim bitterness must have said that seemed still rural mechanic son be hence unfit subject for ceremony of introduction oh wont have knight endeavoured to give reply laughing tone in elfrides ear earnestness in stephen in effort signally failed produced forced speech pleasant to well let go into open air again miss swancourt be particularly silent mustnt mind smith have known for year a have told yes have said to think have never mentioned knowledge of smith murmured thought with remorse how much conduct resembled own on first arrival at house a stranger to place ascended to daylight knight taking further notice of elfrides manner a usual attributed to natural shyness of young woman at being discovered walking with on term left not much doubt of meaning elfride stepped little in advance passed through churchyard be changed very considerably smith said knight suppose be more than be to be expected however dont imagine that will feel le interest in fortune whenever care to confide to have not forgotten attachment spoke of a reason for going away to india london young lady be not hope be prosperous no match be broken off being always difficult to know whether to express sorrow gladness under such circumstancesall depending upon character of matchknight took shelter in safe word trust be for best hope be beg that will not press further no have not pressed mei dont mean thatbut must rather not speak upon subject stephen word be hurried knight said more followed in footstep of elfride who still kept pace in advance have not heard knight unconscious allusion to stephen bade adieu at churchyard gate without going outside watched whilst sweetheart mounted horse good heaven elfride knight exclaimed how pale be suppose ought not to have taken into vault what be matter nothing said elfride faintly will be in moment be so strange unexpected down there that made unwell thought said very little will get water do think be safe for to mount quiteindeed be said with look of appeal now thenup go whispered knight lifted tenderly into saddle old lover still looked on at performance a leant over gate dozen yard off once in saddle having firm grip of rein turned head a if by resistless fascination for first time since memorable parting on moor outside st launce after passionate attempt at marriage with elfride looked in face of young man first have loved be youth who have called inseparable wife many time whom have even addressed a husband eye met measurement of life must be proportioned rather to intensity of experience than to actual length glance moment chronologically be season in history to elfride intense agony of reproach in stephen eye be nail piercing heart with deadliness word can describe with spasmodic effort withdrew eye urged on horse in chaos of perturbed memory be oblivious of presence beside deed of deception be complete gaining knoll on park transformed into wood copse knight came still closer to side said be better now dearest oh yes pressed hand to eye a if to blot out image of stephen vivid scarlet spot now shone with preternatural brightness in centre of cheek leaving remainder of face lily white a before elfride said knight rather in old tone of mentor know dont for moment chide be there not great deal of unwomanly weakness in allowing to be so overwhelmed by sight of what after be novelty woman worthy of name must think be able to look upon death with something like composure surely think so too yes own obtuseness to cause of indisposition by evidencing entire freedom from suspicion of anything behind scene showed how incapable knight be of deception rather than inherent dulness in regarding human nature clearly perceived by elfride added poignancy to self reproach idolized more because of difference even recent sight of stephen face sound of voice for moment have stirred chord two of ancient kindness be unable to keep down adoration re existent now that be again out of view have replied to knight question hastily immediately went on to speak of indifferent subject after have reached home be apart from till dinner time when dinner be over be watching dusk in drawing room knight stepped out upon terrace elfride went after very decisively on spur of virtuous intention mr

substance of said will do to morrow have be reminded of to day be about something once did dont think ought to have done must be said be rather mild way of referring to frantic passion flight much little in only accident have saved from being scandal in public eye knight thought matter trifle said pleasantly then be not to hear dreadful confession now not now did not mean to night elfride responded with slight decline in firmness of voice be not light a think itit trouble great deal fearing now effect of own earnestness added forcedly though perhaps may think light after have not said

birthday be last be nineteen moment have be too much for now that crisis have come no qualm of conscience love of honesty yearning to make confidence obtain forgiveness with kiss must string elfride up to venture dread lest must be unforgiving be heightened by thought of yesterday artifice might possibly add disgust to disappointment certainty of one more day affection gained by silence outvalued hope of perpetuity combined with risk of trepidation caused by thought on what have intended to say shook so naturally word did say that knight never for moment suspected to be last moment substitution smiled pressed hand warmly dear elfieyes be nowno protestationwhat winning little woman be to be so absurdly scrupulous about mere iota really never once have thought whether nineteenth year be last present by george well may not for must never do for staid fogey dozen year older to stand upon trifle a dont praise medont praise though prize from lip dont deserve now knight being in

knight only two day said smith india ever since nearly ever since be making fuss about at st launce last year fancy saw something of sort in paper yes believe something be said about must congratulate on achievement thanks be nothing very extraordinary natural professional progress where there be opposition there followed that want of word will always assert between nominal friend who find have ceased to be real one have not yet sunk to level of mere acquaintance looked up down park knight may possibly have borne in mind during intervening month stephen manner towards last time have met may have encouraged former interest in stephen welfare to die out of a misplaced stephen certainly be full of feeling begotten by belief knight have taken away woman loved so well stephen smith then asked question adopting certain recklessness of manner tone to hide if possible fact that subject be much greater one to than friend have ever supposed be married be not knight spoke in indescribable tone of bitterness be almost moroseness never will be added decisively be said stephen sadly quietly like man in sick room totally ignorant whether not knight knew of own previous claim upon elfride yet resolved to hazard few more word upon topic have aching fascination for even now then engagement to miss swancourt came to nothing said remember met with once stephen voice gave way little here in defiance of firmest will to contrary indian affair have not yet lowered emotion down to point of control be broken off came quickly from knight engagement to marry often end like thatfor better for worse yes so do what have be doing lately doing nothing where have be can hardly tell in main going about europe may perhaps interest to know have be attempting serious study of continental art of middle age note on example visited be at service be of use to will be glad with themoh travelling far near not far said knight with moody carelessness know daresay that sheep occasionally become giddyhydatids in head ti called in brain become eaten up animal exhibit strange peculiarity of walking round round in circle continually have travelled just in same wayround round like giddy ram reckless bitter rambling style in knight talked a if rather to vent image than to convey idea to stephen young man painfully former friend day have become cankered in way knight be changed man have changed much not a knight have changed yesterday came home continued knight without having to best of belief imbibed dozen idea worth retaining out hamlet hamlet in morbidness of mood said stephen with regretful frankness knight made reply do know stephen continued must almost have sworn that must be married before time from what saw knight face grew harder must said stephen be powerless to forsake depressing luring subject yes simply wonder at whom did expect to marry saw with thank for wonder did jilt smith now one word to knight returned steadily dont ever question on subject have reason for making request mind if do question will not get answer oh dont for moment wish to ask what be unpleasant to younot have momentary feeling must like to explain something on side hear similar explanation on yours let go let go by mean what must explain lost woman be going to marry have not married a intended might have compared note have never asked word about case know inference be obvious quite so truth be stephen have doggedly resolved never to allude to matterfor have very good reason doubtless a good reason a have for not marrying talk insidiously have good onea miserably good one smith anxiety urged to venture one more question did not love enough drew breath in slow attenuated stream a waited in timorous hope for answer stephen rather strain ordinary courtesy in pressing question of kind after what have said can not understand at must go on now why good god exclaimed stephen passionately talk a if hadnt at taken away from anybody who have better claim to than what do mean by said knight with puzzled air what have heard nothing too must go on good day if will go said knight reluctantly now must suppose be sure can not understand why behave so why do have always be grateful to a far a be concerned need never have become so estranged a have have ever be anything well disposed towards stephen surely know have not system of reserve began with know that altogether mistake position be always from first reserved to though be confidential to be suppose natural issue of differing position in life when pupil became reserved like master did not like however be going to ask to come round see where be staying at grosvenor hotel pimlico so be thats convenient not to say odd well be detained in london for day two then be going down to see father mother who live at st launce now will see evening may will not promise be wishing to be alone for hour two will know where to find at rate good bye chapter xxxviii jealousy be cruel a grave stephen pondered not little on meeting with old friend once beloved exemplar be grieved for amid distraction of latter year still small voice of fidelity to knight have lingered on in perhaps staunchness be because knight ever treated a mere discipleeven to snubbing sometimes have at last though unwittingly inflicted upon greatest snub of of taking away sweetheart emotional side of constitution be built rather after feminine than male model tremendous wound from knight hand may have tended to keep alive warmth solicitousness must have extinguished altogether knight on part be vexed after have parted that have not taken stephen in hand little after old manner word smith have let fall concerning somebody having prior claim to elfride must if uttered when man be younger have provoked query a come tell about lad from knight stephen must straightway have delivered of knew on subject stephen ingenuous boy though now obliterated externally by stephen contriving man returned to knight memory vividly afternoon be at present sojourner in london after attending to two three matter of business remained to be done day walked abstractedly into gloomy corridor of british museum for half hour previous to closing that meeting with smith have reunited present with past closing up chasm of absence from england a if have never existed until final circumstance of previous time of residence in london formed yesterday to circumstance now conflict that then have raged in concerning elfride swancourt revived strengthened by sleep indeed in many month of absence though quelling intention to make wife have never forgotten that be type of woman adapted to nature instead of trying to obliterate thought of altogether have grown to regard a infirmity be necessary to tolerate knight returned to hotel much earlier in evening than must have done in ordinary course of thing did not care to think whether arose from friendly wish to close gap have slowly be widening between earliest acquaintance from hankering desire to hear meaning of dark oracle stephen have hastily pronounced betokening that knew something more of elfride than knight have supposed made hasty dinner inquired for smith soon be ushered into young man presence whom found sitting in front of comfortable fire beside table spread with few scientific periodical art review have come to after said knight manner be odd morning seemed desirable to call that have too much sense to notice stephen know put down to wandering in france italy dont say word sit down be only too glad to see again stephen must hardly have cared to tell knight just then that minute before knight be announced have be reading over old letter of elfrides be not many until to night have be sealed up stowed away in corner of leather trunk with few other memento relic have accompanied in travel familiar sight sound of london meeting with friend have with also revived that sense of abiding continuity with regard to elfride love absence at other side of world have to extent suspended though never ruptured at first intended only to look over letter on outside then read one then until whole be thus re used a stimulus to sad memory folded away again placed in pocket instead of going on with examination into state of artistic world have remained musing on strange circumstance that have returned to find knight not husband of elfride after possibility of given gratification begets cumulative sense of necessity stephen gave rein to imagination felt more intensely than have felt for many month that without elfride life must never be great pleasure to honour to maker sat by fire chatting on external random subject neither caring to be first to approach matter most longed to discus on table with periodical lay two three pocket book one of being open knight seeing from exposed page that content be sketch only began turning leaf over carelessly with finger when time later stephen be out of room knight proceeded to pas interval by looking at sketch more carefully first crude idea pertaining to dwelling of kind be roughly outlined on different page antiquity have be copied fragment of indian column colossal statue outlandish ornament from temple of elephanta kenneri be carelessly intruded upon by outline of modern door window roof cooking stove household furniture everything in short come within range of practising architect experience who travel with eye open among occasionally appeared rough delineation of mediaeval subject for carving illuminationheads of virgin saint prophet stephen be not professedly free hand draughtsman drew human figure with correctness skill in numerous repetition on side edge of leaf knight began to notice peculiarity feminine saint have one type of feature there be large nimbus small nimbus about drooping head face be always same that profilehow well knight knew that profile have there be one specimen of familiar countenance might have passed over resemblance a accidental repetition meant more knight thought anew of smith hasty word earlier in day looked at sketch again again on young man entry knight said with palpable agitation stephen who be intended for stephen looked over book with utter unconcern saint angel done in leisure moment be intended a design for stained glass of english church whom do idealize by type of woman always adopt for virgin nobody then thought raced along stephen mind looked up at friend truth be stephen introduction of elfrides lineament have be so unconscious that have not at first understood companion drift hand like tongue easily acquires trick of repetition by rote without calling in mind to assist at have be case here young men who can not write verse about love generally take to portraying in early day of attachment smith have never be weary of outlining elfride lay figure of stephen sketch now initiated adjustment of many thing knight have recognized opportunity of comparing note have come unsought elfride swancourt to whom be engaged said quietly stephen know what mean by speaking like be elfride man stephen yes be thinking why did conceal fact from that time at endelstow be not yes moremore did for best blame if will did for best now say how must be with afterwards a have be before dont know at cant say knight remained fixed in thought once murmured have suspicion afternoon that there might be such meaning in word about taking away dismissed how came to know presently asked in almost peremptory tone went down about church year ago now when be with hewby of course of course well cant understand tone rose dont know what to say hoodwinking like for so long dont see have hoodwinked at yes yes knight arose from seat began pacing up down room face be markedly pale voice perturbed a said did not act a must have acted towards under circumstance feel deeply tell plainly will never forget what behaviour at meeting in family vault when told be going to be married deception dishonesty everywhere world of piece stephen did not much like misconstruction of motif even though be hasty conclusion of friend disturbed by emotion must do otherwise than did with due regard to said stiffly indeed said knight in bitterest tone of reproach must with due regard to have married suppose have hopedlongedthat who turn out to be must ultimately have done be much obliged to for hope talk very mysteriously think have about best reason anybody must have have for not doing that oh what reason be must not ought to have made opportunity ought to do so now in bare justice to stephen cried knight carried beyond that know very well hurt wound more than dream to find never have tried to make reparation to woman of kindso trusting so apt to be run away with by feelingspoor little fool so much worse for why talk like madman took away from did not picking up what throw down can scarcely be called taking away however will not agree too well upon subject so have better part be quite certain misapprehend something most grievously said stephen shaken to bottom of heart what have done tell have lost elfride be such sin be doing yours be what that parted will tell honestly be hers entirely entirely what be reason can hardly say ill tell story without reserve stephen until to day have unhesitatingly held that grew tired of turned to knight did not like to advance statement now even to think thought to fancy otherwise accorded better with hope to knight estrangement have given birth love for friend be not direct cause result of suspension of love for matter must not be allowed to breed discord between knight returned relapsing into manner concealed true feeling a if confidence now be intolerable do see that reticence towards in vault may have be dictated by prudential consideration concluded artificially be strange thing altogether not of much importance suppose at distance of time doe not concern now though dont mind hearing story word from knight uttered with air of renunciation apparent indifference prompted smith to speak onperhaps with little complacencyof old secret engagement to elfride told detail of origin peremptory word action of father to extinguish love knight persevered in tone manner of disinterested outsider have become more than ever imperative to screen emotion from stephen eye young man must otherwise be le frank meeting must be again embittered what be use of untoward candour stephen have now arrived at point in ingenuous narrative where left vicarage because of father manner knight interest increased love seemed so innocent childlike thus far be nice point in casuistry observed to decide whether be culpable not in not telling swancourt that friend be parishioner of be only human nature to hold tongue under circumstance well what be result of dismissal by that agreed to be secretly faithful to insure thought must marry knight suspense agitation rose higher when stephen entered upon phase of subject do mind telling on said steadying manner of speech oh not at then stephen gave in full particular of meeting with elfride at railway station necessity be under of going to london unless ceremony be to be postponed long journey of afternoon evening timidity revulsion of feeling culmination on reaching crossing over to down platform immediate departure again solely in obedience to wish journey night anxious watching for dawn arrival at st launce at lastwere detailed told how village woman named jethway be only person who recognized going coming how dreadfully terrified elfride told how waited in field whilst then reproachful sweetheart went for pony how last kiss ever gave be given mile out of town on way to endelstow thing stephen related with will believed that in doing so established word by word reasonableness of claim to elfride curse curse that womanthat miserable letter parted o god knight began pacing room again uttered at further end what did say said stephen turning round say did say anything oh be merely thinking about story oddness of having fancy for same woman afterwards now ii have forgotten almost of care about except just a friend know eh knight still continued at further end of room somewhat in shadow exactly said stephen inwardly exultant for be really deceived by knight off hand manner yet be deceived le by completeness of knight disguise than by persuasive power lay in fact that knight have never before deceived in anything so supposition that companion have ceased to love elfride be enormous lightening of weight have turned scale against admitting that elfride must love man after said elder under same varnish of careless criticism be none worse for experience worse of course be none worse did ever think wild thoughtless thing for to do indeed never did said stephen persuaded saw harm in until decided to return did be there except to extent of indiscretion directly thought be wrong must go further be have just begun to think wrong too such childish escapade might have be misrepresented by evil disposed person might not might never heard that be nobody who really knew circumstance must have done otherwise than smile if world have known elfride must still have remained only one who thought action sin poor child always persisted in thinking so be frightened more than enough stephen do love now well like always will know said evasively with strategy love suggested have not seen for so long that can hardly be expected to love do love still how will answer without being ashamed what fickle being men be stephen men may love strongest for while woman love longest used to love herin way know yes understand ah used to love in way in fact loved good deal at one time travel have tendency to obliterate early fancy have truly perhaps most extraordinary feature in conversation be circumstance that though interlocutor have at first suspicion of others abiding passion awakened by several little act must allow to see that friend might now be speaking deceitfully a well a stephen resumed knight now that matter be smooth between think must leave wont mind hurrying off to quarter youll stay to sort of supper surely didnt come to dinner must really excuse once then youll drop in to breakfast to morrow will be rather pressed for time early breakfast will interfere with nothing ill come said knight with a much readiness a be possible to graft upon huge stock of reluctance yes early eight oclock say a be under same roof time like eight will be knight left to wear mask to dissemble feeling a have in late miserable conversation be such torture that must support no longer be first time in knight life that have ever be so entirely player of part man have thus deceived be stephen who have docilely looked up to from youth a superior of unblemished integrity went to bed allowed fever of excitement to rage uncontrolled stephenit be only who be rivalonly stephen there be anti climax of absurdity knight wretched conscience stricken a be must not help recognizing stephen be boy to where great grief lay be in perceiving that very innocence of elfride in reading little fault a one so grave be what have fatally misled have elfride with degree of coolness asserted that have done harm poisonous breath of dead mr jethway must have be inoperative why did not make little docile girl tell more if on subject have only exercised imperativeness customary with on others might have be revealed smote heart like switch when remembered how gently have borne scourging speech never answering with single reproach only assuring of unbounded love knight blessed elfride for sweetness forgot fault pictured with vivid fancy fair summer scene with again saw a at first meeting timid at speaking yet in eagerness to be explanatory borne forward almost against will how must wait for in green place without showing of ordinary womanly affectation of indifference how proud be to be seen walking with bearing legibly in eye thought that be greatest genius in world formed resolution after must make pretence of slumber no longer rising dressing sat down waited for day night stephen be restless too not because of

shadow shadow dream be based on one atom of fact elfride knight have become separated engagement be a if have never be rupture must have occurred soon after stephen discovery of fact of union stephen went on to think what so probable a that return of errant affection to be cause stephen opinion in matter be of lover not balanced judgment of unbiassed spectator naturally sanguine spirit built hope upon hope till scarcely doubt remained in mind that lingering tenderness for have in way be perceived by knight have provoked parting to go see elfride be suggestion of impulse be impossible to withstand at rate to run down from st launce to castle poterel distance of le than twenty mile glide like ghost about old haunt making stealthy inquiry about must be fascinating way of passing first

even sanguine clarus judging from tone of worthy mayor of st launce chapter xxxix to loved one side friend rival breakfasted together next morning not word be said on side upon matter discussed

good bye for present ill write know if cant meet now wanted quarter to nine oclock when knight be gone stephen felt yet more impatient of circumstance that day must have to drag away wearily before must set out for spot of earth whereon soft thought of might perhaps be nourished still on sudden admitted to mind possibility that engagement be waiting in town to keep might be postponed without much harm be sooner perceived than attempted looking at watch found wanted forty minute to departure of ten oclock train from paddington left surplus quarter of hour before must be necessary to start for station scribbling hasty note twoone putting off business meeting to knight apologizing for not being able to see in eveningpaying bill leaving heavier luggage to follow by good train jumped into
