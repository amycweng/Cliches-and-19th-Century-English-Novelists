going to door of next room whither daughter have betaken to mr dornell alarm there sat betty in reverie round eye fixed on vacancy musing so deeply that did not perceive mother entrance have heard word be digesting new knowledge mother felt that fall park be dangerous ground for young girl of susceptible age in betty peculiar position while dornell talked reasoned thus called betty to took leave squire must not clearly promise to return make king hintock court permanent abode betty presence there a at former time be sufficient to make agree to pay visit soon way home betty remained

morning about twelve o'clock driving own pair of black bay in curricle phaeton with yellow panel red wheel just a have used to do faithful old tupcombe on horseback behind young man sat beside squire in carriage mr dornell consternation must scarcely be concealed when abruptly entering with companion squire announced a friend phelipson of elm cranlynch dornell passed on to betty in background

imagined to be be disturbing peace of mind of lady of house sue see what mistake have made ' said mr dornell be verily greatly alarmed a soon a must speak word with alone upbraided 'you ought not to have brought here oh thomas how must be so thoughtless lord see dear that what be done can not be undone how foolery jeopardizes happiness with husband until interfered spoke in hearing about phelipson be a patient a willing a lamb looked forward to mr reynard return with real pleasure since visit to fall park have be monstrous close mouthed busy with own thought what mischief will do how will end ' 'own then that man be best suited to only brought to convince ' 'yes yes do admit oh do take back again at once keep here fear be even attracted by already ' 'nonsense sue 't be only little trick to tease 'ee nevertheless motherly eye be not so likely to be deceived a if betty be really only playing at being love struck that day played at with perfection of rosalind must have deceived best professor into belief that be counterfeit squire having obtained victory be quite ready to take back too attractive youth early in afternoon set out on return journey silent figure who rode behind be a interested a dornell in day experiment be staunch tupcombe who with eye on squire young phelipson back thought how well latter must have suited betty how greatly former have changed for worse during last two three year cursed mistress a cause of change after memorable visit to prove point life of dornell couple flowed on quietly enough for space of twelvemonth squire for most part remaining at fall betty passing repassing between now then once twice alarming mother by not driving home from father house till midnight repose of king hintock be broken by arrival of special messenger squire dornell have have access of gout so violent a to be serious wished to see betty again why have not come for so long mr dornell be extremely reluctant to take betty in direction too frequently girl be so anxious to go interest latterly seeming to be so entirely bound up in fall park neighbourhood that there be nothing to be done to let set out accompany squire dornell have be impatiently awaiting arrival found very ill irritable have be habit to take powerful medicine to drive away enemy have failed in effect on occasion presence of daughter a usual calmed much even while a usual too saddened for must never forget that have disposed of herself for life in opposition to wish though have secretly assured that must never have consented have be a old a be now a on former occasion wife wished to speak to alone about girl future time now drawing nigh at reynard be expected to come claim must have done so already have be put off by earnest request of young woman accorded with of parent on score of youth reynard have deferentially submitted to wish in respect understanding between having be that must not visit before be eighteen except by mutual consent of party must not go on much longer there be doubt from tenor of last letter that must soon take possession of whether to be out of sound of delicate discussion betty be accordingly sent downstairs soon saw walking away into shrubbery looking very pretty in sweeping green gown flapping broad brimmed hat overhung with feather on returning to subject mr dornell found husband reluctance to reply in affirmative to reynard letter to be a great a ever behe be three month short of eighteen exclaimed `` ti too soon wo hear of if have to keep off sword in hand will not have yet dear thomas expostulated 'consider if anything must happen to to how much better must be that must be settled in home with ' ' say be too soon ' argued vein of forehead beginning to swell 'if get side o ' candlemas will challenge en will take oath o will be back to king hintock in two three day will not lose sight of day night ' feared to agitate further gave way assuring in obedience to demand that if reynard must write again before got back to fix time for joining betty must put letter in husband hand must do a chose be required discussion privately mr dornell went to call in betty hoping that have not heard father loud tone have certainly not done so time mr dornell followed path along have seen betty wandering went considerable distance without perceiving anything of squire wife then turned round to proceed to other side of house by short cut across grass when to surprise consternation beheld object of search sitting on horizontal bough of cedar beside being young man whose arm be round waist moved little recognized a young phelipson ala then be right so called counterfeit love be real what mr dornell called husband at moment for folly in originally throwing young people together be not necessary to mention decided in moment not to let lover know that have seen accordingly retreated reached front of house by route called at top of voice from window ' for first time since strategic marriage of child susan dornell doubted wisdom of step husband have a be be assisted by destiny to make objection originally trivial valid one saw outline of trouble in future why have dornell interfered why have insisted upon producing man then accounted for betty pleading for postponement whenever subject of husband return be broached accounted for attachment to fall park possibly very meeting that have witnessed have be arranged by letter perhaps girl thought must never have strayed for moment if father have not filled head with idea of repugnance to early union on ground that have be coerced into before knew own mind might have rushed to meet husband with open arm on appointed day betty at length appeared in distance in answer to call came up pale looking innocent of having seen living soul mr dornell groaned in spirit at such duplicity in child of bosom be simple creature for whose development into womanhood have be so tenderly waiting forward minx old enough not only to have lover to conceal existence a adroitly a woman of world bitterly did squire lady regret that stephen reynard have not be allowed to come to claim at time first proposed two sat beside other almost in silence on journey back to king hintock such word a be spoken came mainly from betty formality indicated how much mind heart be occupied with other thing mr dornell be far too astute mother to openly attack betty on matter must be only fanning flame indispensable course seemed to to be that of keeping treacherous girl under lock key till husband came to take off mother hand that must disregard dornell opposition come soon be devout wish seemed therefore fortunate coincidence that on arrival at king hintock letter from reynard be put into mr dornell hand be addressed to husband courteously informed that writer have landed at bristol proposed to come on to king hintock in few day at last to meet carry off darling betty if parent saw objection betty have also received letter of same tenor mother have only to look at face to see how girl received information be a pale a sheet must do best to welcome time dear betty ' mother said gently 'but 'you be woman now added mother severely 'and postponement must come to end father oh be sure will not allow be not ready if must only wait year longer if must only wait few month longer oh wish wish dear father be here will send to instantly ' broke off abruptly falling upon mother neck burst into tear saying ' o mother have mercy upon love man husband ' agonized appeal went too straight to mr dornell heart for to hear unmoved yet thing having come to pas what must do be distracted for moment be on betty side original thought have be to write affirmative reply to reynard allow to come on to king hintock keep husband in ignorance of whole proceeding till must arrive from fall on fine day after recovery find everything settled reynard betty living together in harmony event of day daughter sudden outburst of feeling have overthrown intention betty be sure to do a have threatened communicate instantly with father possibly attempt to fly to moreover reynard letter be addressed to mr dornell conjointly must not in conscience keep from husband ' will send letter on to father instantly replied soothingly 'he will act entirely a chooses know will not be in opposition to wish must ruin rather than thwart only hope may be well enough to bear agitation of news do agree to ' poor betty agreed on condition that must actually witness despatch of letter mother have objection to offer to a soon a horseman have cantered down drive toward highway mr dornell sympathy with betty recalcitration began to die out girl secret affection for young phelipson must not possibly be condoned betty might communicate with might even try to reach ruin lay way stephen reynard must be speedily installed in proper place by betty side sat down penned private letter to reynard threw light upon plan 'it be necessary must now tell ' said 'what have never mentioned before indeed may have signified contrary that father objection to joining have not a yet be overcome a personally wish to delay no longer be indeed a anxious for arrival a can be having good of daughter at heart course be left open to to assist cause without husband knowledge be sorry to say be at present ill at fall park felt duty to forward letter will therefore be like to reply with peremptory command to to go back again for month whence came till time originally stipulated have expir 'd advice be if get such letter to take notice of to come on hither a have proposed letting know day hour after dark if possible at may expect dear betty be with warrant ye that will be in house when arrive ' mr dornell having sent away epistle unsuspected of anybody next took step to prevent daughter leaving court avoiding if possible to excite girl suspicion that be under restraint a if by divination betty have seemed to read husband approach in aspect of mother face 'he be coming ' exclaimed maiden 'not for week mother assured 'he be then for certain yes betty hastily retired to room must not be seen to lock up hand over key to reynard when must appear in hall be plan charming in simplicity till mother found on trying door of girl chamber softly that betty have already locked bolted on inside have given direction to have meal served where be by leaving on dumb waiter outside door thereupon mr dornell noiselessly sat down in boudoir a well a bed chamber be passage room to girl apartment resolved not to vacate post night day till daughter husband must appear to end too arranged to breakfast dine sup on spot be impossible now that betty must escape without knowledge even if have wished there being other door to chamber except one admitting to small inner dressing room inaccessible by second way be plain that young girl have thought of escape idea ran rather in direction of intrenchment be prepared to stand siege scorned flight at rate rendered secure a to how reynard must contrive meeting with coy daughter while in such defensive humour thought mother must be left to own ingenuity to discover betty have looked so wild pale at announcement of husband approaching visit mr dornell somewhat uneasy must not leave to herself peeped through keyhole hour later betty lay on sofa staring listlessly at ceiling 'you be looking ill child cried mother 'you have not taken air lately come with for drive betty made objection soon drove through park towards village daughter still in strained strung up silence have fallen upon left park to return by route on open road passed cottage betty eye fell upon cottage window within saw young girl about own age whom knew by sight sitting in chair propped by pillow girl face be covered with scale glistened in sun be convalescent from smallpox disease whose prevalence at period be terror of at present can hardly form conception idea suddenly energized betty apathetic feature glanced at mother mr dornell have be looking in opposite direction betty said that wished to go back to cottage for moment to speak to girl in whom took interest mr dornell appeared suspicious observing that cottage have back door that betty must not escape without being seen allowed carriage to be stopped betty ran back entered cottage emerging again in about minute resuming seat in carriage a drove on fixed eye upon mother said 'there have done now ' pale face be stormy eye full of waiting tear have done ' said mr dornell priddle be sick of smallpox saw at window went in kissed so might take now will have wo be able to come near ' 'wicked girl cry mother what be to do what bring distemper on usurp sacred prerogative of god because ca palate man have wedded ' alarmed woman gave order to drive home a rapidly a possible on arriving betty who be by time also somewhat frightened at own enormity be put into bath fumigated treated in way must be thought of to ward off dreadful malady that in rash moment have tried to acquire there be now double reason for isolating rebellious daughter wife in own chamber there accordingly remained for rest of day day followed till ill result seemed likely to arise from wilfulness meanwhile first letter from reynard announcing to mr dornell husband jointly that be coming in few day have sped on way to fall park be directed under cover to tupcombe confidential servant with instruction not to put into master hand till have be refreshed by good long sleep tupcombe much regretted commission letter sent in way always disturbing squire guessing that must be infinitely worse in end to withhold news than to reveal chose time be early next morning delivered missive utmost effect that mr dornell have anticipated from message be peremptory order from husband to reynard to hold aloof few month longer what squire really did be to declare that must go confront reynard at bristol have out with there by word of mouth master ' said tupcombe 'you ca can not get out of bed ' 'you leave room tupcombe say ca before have jerry saddled in hour ' long tried tupcombe thought employer demented so utterly helpless be appearance just then went out reluctantly sooner be gone than squire with great difficulty stretched over to cabinet by bedside unlocked took out small bottle contained gout specific against whose use have be repeatedly warned by regular physician whose warning now cast to wind took double dose waited hour seemed to produce effect then poured out treble dose swallowed leant back upon pillow waited miracle anticipated have be worked at last seemed a though second draught have not only operated with own strength have kindled into power latent force of first put away bottle rang up tupcombe le than hour later one of housemaid who of course be quite aware that squire illness be serious be surprised to hear bold decided step descending stair from direction of mr dornell room accompanied by humming of tune knew that doctor have not paid visit that morning that be too heavy to be valet other man servant looking up saw squire dornell fully dressed descending toward in drab caped riding coat boot with swinging easy movement of prime face expressed amazement 'what devil beest looking at ' said squire never see man walk out of house before wench ' resuming humming be of defiant sort proceeded to library rang bell asked if horse be ready directed to be brought round ten minute later rode away in direction of bristol tupcombe behind trembling at what movement might portend rode on through pleasant woodland monotonous straight lane at equal pace distance traversed might have be about fifteen mile when tupcombe must perceive that squire be getting tired a weary a must have be after riding three time distance ten year before however reached bristol without mishap put up at squire accustomed inn dornell almost immediately proceeded on foot to inn reynard have given a address being now about four o'clock reynard have already dined for
