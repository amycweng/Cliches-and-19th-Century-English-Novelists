that modest girl suddenly withdrew into room have private blush between chest of drawer washing stand when came downstairs mother said have be thinking what ought to wear to miller loveday to night ' miller loveday ' said anne 'yes party be to night have be in here morning to tell that have seen son have fixed evening ' 'do think ought to go mother ' said anne slowly looking at smaller feature of

running upstairs running down slamming of door clinking of cup glass till proudest adjoining tenant without friend on own side of partition might have be tempted to wish for entrance to merry dwelling if only to know cause of fluctuation of hilarity to see if guest be really so numerous observation so very amusing a seemed stagnation of life on garland side of party wall began to have very gloomy

great slimy cavern where long arm of mill wheel flung slowly distractedly round splashing water drop caught little light strayed into gloomy place turning into star flash cold mist laden puff of air came into face roar from within made necessary for anne to shout a said 'it be dismal let go on ' bob shut trap roar ceased went on to inner part of mill where air be warm nutty pervaded by fog of flour then ascended stair saw stone lumbering round round yellow corn running down through hopper climbed yet further to top stage where wheat lay in bin where long ray like feeler stretched in from sun through little window got nearly lost among cobweb timber completed course by marking opposite wall with glowing patch of gold in earnestness a exhibitor bob opened bolter be spinning rapidly

pleasure that mind flew to fact that be now inmate of father house obsequious bearing be continued during next week in busy hour of day seldom met regularly encountered other at meal cheerful occasion began to have interest for quite irrespective of dish cup when anne entered took seat be always loudly hailed by miller loveday a whetted knife from bob condescended to accept such familiar greeting often sat down together a if have blind eye in direction of other bob sometimes told serious correct story about sea captain pilot boatswain mate able seaman other curious fauna of marine world be directly addressed to father mr loveday anne being included at clinching point by glance only sometimes opened bottle of sweet cider for then thanked even did not lead to encouraging chat one day when anne be paring apple be left at table with young man have made something for ' said looked over table nothing be there save ordinary remnant o mean that be here be out by bridge at mill head ' arose anne followed with curiosity in eye with firm little mouth pouted up to puzzled shape on reaching mossy mill head found that have fixed in keen damp draught always prevailed over wheel aeolian harp of

for have never seen anything like instrument before interested 'it be very thoughtful of to make ' added came to think of thing ' o know exactly replied a if did not care to be questioned on point have never made one in life till now ' night after during mournful gale of autumn strange mixed music of water wind string met ear swelling sinking with almost supernatural cadence character of instrument be far enough removed from anything have hitherto seen of bob hobby so that marvelled pleasantly at new depth of poetry contrivance revealed a existent in young seaman nature allowed emotion to flow out yet little further in old direction notwithstanding late severe resolve to bar back one breezy night when mill be kept going into small hour wind be exactly in direction of water current music so mingled with dream a to wake seemed to rhythmically set to word think of ' be much impressed sound be almost too touching spoke to bob next morning on subject strange be that must have thought of fixing that harp where water gush gently observed 'it affect almost painfully at night be poetical captain bob be too too sad ' will take away ' said captain bob promptly certainly be too sad thought so myself myself be kept awake by one night 'how came to think of making such peculiar thing ' 'well said bob 'it be hardly worth saying why be not good place for queer noisy machine will take away ' 'on second thought said anne must like to remain little longer because set thinking ' 'of ' asked with earnest frankness anne colour rose fast 'well yes said trying to infuse much plain matter of fact into voice course be led to think of person who invented ' bob seemed unaccountably embarrassed subject be not pursued about hour later came to again with something of uneasy look 'there be little matter did tell just now miss garland said 'about that harp thing mean did make certainly be brother john who asked to do just before went away john be very musical a know said must

perhaps too young then to take pleasure in giving pain ' observed daringly 'does give pleasure ' anne nodded ' like to give pain to people who have given pain to ' said smartly without removing eye from green liquid in hand ' ask pardon for ' ' did say meant though did mean ' bob looked looked at side face till be bewitched into putting down brush 'it be that stupid forgetting of 'ee for time

slowly looking at with intense respect of pupil for master word being spoken in manner so precisely between jest earnest that be in doubt how be to be received 'impressed by new face be wrong

a john at first supposed bob verbal renunciation of anne on quay have be only momentary ebullition of friendship must be cruel to take literally whether a seemed now have passed from hasty resolve to standing purpose persevered in for own pleasure with not care for result on poor anne john waited anxiously for answer answer came silence seemed even more significant than letter of assurance must have be of absolution from further support to claim bob have so clearly renounced thus happened that paternal pressure brotherly indifference own released impulse operated in one delightful direction

doubt of subject went on to ask ever in last week thought of how used to be between ' replied quickly o john must begin again be almost woman now 'well that be more reason why must be ' anne looked

not speak about again for ever so long how long 'now be not fair ' anne retorted going down garden leaving alone about week passed then one afternoon miller walked up to anne indoors weighty topic being expressed in tread ' be so glad honey ' began with knowing smile 'to see that from mill window last week flung nod in direction of garden anne innocently inquired what must be 'jack in garden together continued laying hand gently on shoulder stroking must so please dear little girl if must get to like better than weathercock master bob ' anne shook head not in forcible negation to imply kind of neutrality 'ca come now ' said miller threw back head with little laugh of grievance 'how beset ' expostulated make feel very wicked in not obeying being faithful faithful to must not trust side of subject to word must please so much ' asked 'john be a steady staunch fellow a ever blowed trumpet have always thought might do better with than with bob now have plan for taking into mill letting have comfortable time o't after long knocking about so much depends upon must bide bit till see what pleasure be about poor fellow mind dear want to force only just ask ye ' anne meditatively

there before when mr loveday came back with oil other liniment for wound anne must let nobody dress seemed a if coyness have gone when have done lay in power still sat by at departure said what have never said to in life before 'come again soon ' in short that impulsive act of devotion last of series of same tenor have be added drop finally turned wheel john character deeply impressed determined steadfastness to lode star won admiration more especially a star be began to wonder more more how must have so persistently held out against advance before bob came home to renew girlish memory have by time got considerably weakened must not after please miller try to listen to john by so doing must make worthy man happy only sacrifice being at worst of unworthy self whose future be no longer valuable 'as for bob woman be to be pitied who love ' reflected indignantly persuaded that whoever woman might be be not anne garland after there be something of recklessness something of pleasantry in young girl manner of making example of triumph of pride common sense over memory sentiment attitude have be epitomized in defiant singing at time learnt that bob be not leal true john a be inevitable came again almost immediately drawn thither by sun of first smile on word have accompanied now instead of going off to little pursuit upstairs downstairs across room in corner to place
