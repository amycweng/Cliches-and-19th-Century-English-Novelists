few minute later thought with interested surprise of robert trewe own latter history will best explain that interest only daughter of struggling man of letter have during last year two taken to writing poem in endeavour to find congenial channel in to let flow painfully embayed emotion whose former limpidity sparkle seemed departing in stagnation caused by routine of practical household gloom of bearing child to commonplace father poem subscribed with masculine pseudonym have appeared in various obscure magazine in two case in rather prominent one in second of latter page bore effusion at bottom in smallish print bore at top in large print few verse on same subject by very man robert trewe of have in fact be struck by tragic incident reported in daily paper have used simultaneously a inspiration editor remarking in note upon coincidence that excellence of poem prompted to give together after event ella otherwise john ivy have watched with much attention appearance anywhere in print of verse bearing signature of robert trewe who with man unsusceptibility on question of sex have never once thought of passing off a woman to be sure mr marchmill have satisfied with sort of reason for doing contrary in case that nobody might believe in inspiration if found that sentiment came from pushing tradesman wife from mother of three child by matter of fact small arm manufacturer trewes verse contrasted with of rank file of recent minor poet in being impassioned rather than ingenious luxuriant rather than finished symboliste dcadent be pessimist in so far a character applies to man who look at worst contingency a well a best in human condition being little attracted by excellence of form rhythm apart from content sometimes when feeling outran artistic speed perpetrated sonnet in loosely rhymed elizabethan fashion right minded reviewer said ought not to have done with sad hopeless envy ella marchmill have often often scanned rival poet work so much stronger a always be than own feeble line have imitated inability to touch level must send into fit of despondency month passed away thus till observed from publisher list that trewe have collected fugitive piece into volume be duly issued be much little praised according to chance have sale quite sufficient to pay for printing step onward have suggested to john ivy idea of collecting piece also at rate of making up book of rhyme by adding many in manuscript to few have seen light for have be able to get great number into print ruinous charge be made for cost of publication few review noticed

inquired again about young man well im sure youd be interested in maam if must see only he so shy that dont suppose will mr hooper seemed nothing loth to minister to tenant curiosity about predecessor lived here long yes nearly two year keep on room even when he not here soft air of place suit chest like to be able to come back at time be mostly writing reading doesnt see many people though for matter of that be such good kind young fellow folk must only be too glad to be friendly with if knew dont meet kind hearted people day ah he kind hearted good yes hell oblige in anything if ask mr trewe say to sometimes be rather out of spirit well be mr hooper hell say though dont know how must find out why not take little change ask then in day two hell say that will take trip to paris norway somewhere assure come back better for ah indeed be sensitive nature doubt yes still he odd in thing once when have finished poem of composition late at night walked up down room rehearsing floor being so thinjerry built house know though say myselfhe kept awake up above till wished further get on very well be beginning of series of conversation about rising poet a day went on on one of occasion mr hooper drew ellas attention to what have not noticed before minute scribblings in pencil on wall paper behind curtain at head of bed o let look said mr marchmill unable to conceal rush of tender curiosity a bent pretty face close to wall said mr hooper with manner of woman who knew thing be very beginning first thought of verse have tried to rub most of out can read still belief be that wake up in night know with rhyme in head jot down there on wall lest must forget by morning of very line see here have seen afterwards in print in magazine be newer indeed have not seen that one before must have be done only few day ago o yes ella marchmill flushed without knowing why suddenly wished companion must go away now that information be imparted indescribable consciousness of personal interest rather than literary made anxious to read inscription alone accordingly waited till must do so with sense that great store of emotion must be enjoyed in act perhaps because sea be choppy outside island ellas husband found much pleasanter to go sailing steaming about without wife who be bad sailor than with did not disdain to go thus alone on board steamboat of cheap tripper where there be dancing by moonlight where couple must come suddenly down with lurch into others arm for a blandly told company be too mixed for to take amid such scene thus while thriving manufacturer got great deal of change sea air out of sojourn here life external at least of ella be monotonous enough mainly consisted in passing certain number of hour day in bathing walking up down stretch of shore poetic impulse having again waxed strong be possessed by inner flame left hardly conscious of what be proceeding around have read till knew by heart trewes last little volume of verse spent great deal of time in vainly attempting to rival of till in failure burst into tear personal element in magnetic attraction exercised by circumambient unapproachable master of hers be so much stronger than intellectual abstract that must not understand to be sure be surrounded noon night by customary environment literally whispered of to at moment be man have never seen that moved be instinct to specialize waiting emotion on first fit thing came to hand did not of course suggest to ella in natural way of passion under too practical condition civilization have devised for fruition husband love

then if youd like to be in way promised with secret delight went to bed musing of next morning husband observed ive be thinking of what said ell have gone about good deal left without much to amuse perhaps true to day a there not much sea ill take with on board yacht for first time in experience of such offer ella be not glad accepted for moment time for setting out drew near went to get ready stood reflecting longing to see poet be now distinctly in love with overpowered other consideration dont want to go said to herself cant bear to be away wont go told husband that have changed mind about wishing to sail be indifferent went way for rest of day house be quiet child having gone out upon sand blind waved in sunshine to soft steady stroke of sea beyond wall note of green silesian

eagerness think must though must say he more striking than handsome large eyed thoughtful fellow know with very electric flash in eye when look round quickly such a youd expect poet to be who doesnt get living by how old be several year older than maam about thirty one two think ella be a matter of fact few month over thirty herself did not look nearly so much though so immature in nature be entering on tract of life in emotional woman begin to suspect that last love may be stronger than first love must soon ala enter on still more melancholy tract when at least vainer one of sex shrink from receiving male visitor otherwise than with back to window blind half down reflected on mr hoopers remark said more about age just then telegram be brought up came from husband who have gone down channel a far a budmouth with friend in yacht must not be able to get back till next day after light dinner ella idled about shore with child till dusk thinking of yet uncovered photograph in room

rushing upstairs opening picture frame preferring to reserve inspection till must be alone more romantic tinge be imparted to occasion by silence candle solemn sea star outside than be afforded by garish afternoon sunlight child have be sent to bed ella soon followed though be not yet ten oclock to gratify passionate curiosity now made preparation first getting rid of superfluous garment putting on dressing gown then arranging chair in front of table reading several page of trewes tenderest utterance then fetched portrait frame to light opened back took out likeness set up before be striking countenance to look upon poet wore luxuriant black moustache imperial slouched hat shaded forehead large dark eye described by landlady showed unlimited capacity for misery looked out from beneath well shaped brow a if be reading universe in microcosm of confronters face be not altogether overjoyed at what spectacle portended ella murmured in lowest richest tenderest tone whove so

fetch unhappy new relation chapter iii be with strange feeling that girl mother lately so cheerful passed out of back door into open air of barton laden with hay scent herby breath of cow fine sleet have begun to fall trotted across yard quickly stable door be open light shone from itfrom lantern always hung there philip have lighted a said softly nearing door mr hall pronounced name helena there be answer for moment looking in be taken by surprise two people appeared before for one instead of drabbish woman have expected mr hall saw pale dark eyed ladylike creature whose personality ruled attire rather than be ruled by be in new handsome gown of course old bonnet be standing up agitated hand be held by companionnone else than sally affianced farmer charles darton upon whose fine figure pale stranger eye be fixed a be fixed upon other hand held rein of horse be standing saddled a if just led in at sight of mr hall turned looking at in way quite conscious unconscious without seeming to recollect that word be necessary a solution to scene in moment sally entered also when mr darton dropped companion hand led horse aside came to greet betrothed mr hall ah said smilingwith something like forced composurethis be roundabout way of arriving will say dear mr hall lost way made late saw light here led in horse at oncemy friend john man have gone back to little inn with not to crowd too much sooner have entered than saw that lady have taken temporary shelter hereand found be intruding be daughter in law said mr hall calmly son too be in house have gone to bed unwell sally have stood staring wonderingly at scene until moment hardly recognizing dartons shake of hand spell bound be broken by perceiving two little child seated on heap of hay suddenly went forward spoke to took one on arm other in hand two child said mr darton showing thus that have not be there long enough a yet to understand situation grandchild said mr hall with a much affected ease a before philip hall wife in spite of interruption to first rencounter seemed scarcely so much affected by a to feel one presence in addition to mr dartons however arousing by quick reflection threw sudden critical glance of sad eye upon mr hall apparently finding satisfactory advanced to in meek initiative then sally stranger spoke friendly word to other sally went on with child into house mr hall helena followed mr darton followed looking at helena dress outline listening to voice like man in dream by time others reached house sally have already gone upstairs with tired child rapped against wall for rebekah to come in help to attend to rebekah house being little spit dab cabin leaning against substantial stone work of mr hall taller erection when came bed be made up for little one supper given to on descending stair after seeing done sally went to sitting room young mr hall entered just in advance of having in interim retired with mother in law to take off bonnet otherwise make herself presentable hence be evident that further communication must have passed between mr darton since brief interview in stable mr japheth john now opportunely arrived broke up restraint of company after few orthodox meteorological commentary have passed between mr hall by way of introduction at once sat down to supper present of wine turkey not being produced for consumption to night lest premature display of gift must seem to throw doubt on mr hall capacity a provider drink hearty mr johnsdrink hearty said that matron magnanimously such a be there plenty of perhaps cider wine be not to tastethough there body in quite contrairy maamquite contrairy said dairyman for though inherit malt liquor principle from father be cider drinker on mother side came from part know there to be said forttis more peaceful liquor dont lie about man like hotter drink with care one may live on twelvemonth without knocking down neighbour getting black eye from old acquaintance general conversation thus begun be continued briskly though be in main restricted to mr hall japheth who in truth required little help from anybody there being slight call upon sally tongue have ample leisure to do what heart most desired namely watch intended husband sister in law with view of elucidating strange momentary scene in mother have surprised in stable if scene meant anything meant at least that have met before there have be time for explanation sally must see for manner be still one of suppressed amazement at others presence there dartons eye too fell continually on gown worn by helena a if be added riddle to perplexity though to sally be one feature in case be mystery seemed to feel that fate have impishly changed vi vi in lover jig be about to foot while gown have be expected to enclose sally helena face looked out from bodice that long lost hand met own from sleeve sally must see that helena might know of darton knew nothing of how dress entered into embarrassment at moment young girl must have persuaded that dartons look at sister in law be entirely fruit of clothes query surely at other time more extensive range of speculation sentiment be expressed by lover eye than changed dress must account for sally independence made one of least jealous of woman there be something in relation of two visitor ought to be explained japheth john continued to converse in well known style interspersing talk with private reflection on position of darton sally though sparkle in eye showed to be highly entertaining to be apparently not quite communicable to company at last withdrew for night going off to roadside inn mile back whither darton promised to follow in few minute hour passed then mr darton also rose to leave sally sister in law simultaneously wishing good night a retired upstairs to room on arriving at front door with mr sharp shower of rain began to come down when widow suggested that must return to fire side till storm ceased darton accepted proposal insisted that a be getting late be obviously tired must not sit up on account since must let out of house must quite enjoy smoking pipe by hearth alone mr hall assented darton be left by spread knee to brand lit up tobacco a have said sat gazing into fire at notch of chimney crook hung above occasional drop of rain rolled down chimney with hiss still smoked on not like man whose mind be at rest in long run

be obliged to come no right here said in surprise none cant explain now answered helena kettle be very slow there be pause proverbial dilatoriness of watched pot be never more clearly exemplified helena face be of sort seems to ask for assistance without owner knowledgethe very antipode of sally be reliance expressed dartons eye travelled from kettle to helena face then back to kettle then to face for rather longer time so be not to know anything of mystery have distracted evening said how be that woman who refused because a supposed position be not good enough for taste be found to be wife of man who certainly seems to be worse off than have prior claim said what knew at time yes yes please say more implored error have paid for during last five year heart of darton be subject to sudden overflowings be kind to fault be sorry from soul said involuntarily approaching helena withdrew step two at became conscious of movement quickly took former place here stood without speaking

gentle murmur differing much from previous passionate word went into room must have be moment left went off so quickly weakly be so unexpected that couldnt leave even to call darton be just able to gather from confused discourse followed that during sleep by fire brother whom have never seen have become worse that during helena absence for water end have unexpectedly come two young woman hastened upstairs be again left alone after standing there short time went to front door looked out till softly closing behind advanced stood under large sycamore tree star be flickering coldly

who have be brought up by uncle solicitor have refused darton in marriage year agothe passionate almost angry demeanour of sally at discovering abrupt announcement that helena be widow coming together be conjuncture difficult to cope with in moment made question whether ought to leave house offer assistance for sally manner must unhesitatingly have done latter be still standing under tree when door in front of opened mr hall came out went round to garden gate at side without seeing darton followed intending to speak pausing outside a if in thought proceeded to spot where sun came earliest in spring time where north wind never blew be where row of beehive stood under wall discerning object waited till have accomplished be universal custom thereabout to wake bee by tapping at hive whenever death occurred in household under belief that if be not done bee must pine away perish during ensuing year a soon a interior buzzing responded to tap at first hive mr hall went on to second thus passed down row a soon a came back met what can do in trouble mr hall said onothing thank nothing said in tearful voice now just perceiving have called rebekah husband will do everything necessary told in few word particular of son arrival broken in healthindeed at death very door though did not suspect itand suggested a result of conversation between daughter that wedding must be postponed yes

of circumstance meanwhile mr hall have entered house sally be downstairs in sitting room alone mother explained to that darton have readily assented to postponement doubt have said sally with sad emphasis be not put off for week month year will never marry will chapter iv time passed household on knap became again serene under composing influence of daily routine desultory very desultory correspondence dragged on between sally darton who not quite knowing how to take petulant word on night of brother death have continued passive thus long helena child remained at dairy house almost of necessity darton therefore deemed advisable to stay away one day seven month later on when mr darton be a usual at farm twenty mile from hintock note reached from helena thanked for kind offer about child mother in law have duly communicated stated that must be glad to accept a regarded eldest boy helena have in truth good need to do so for uncle have left penniless application to relative in

dissipated by presence of boy when christmas holiday came be arranged that must spend with mother journey be for reason other performed in two stage a at coming except darton in person took place of bailiff that boy rode on horseback reaching renowned white horse darton inquired if miss young mr hall be there to meet little philip a have agreed to be be answered by appearance of helena alone at door at last moment sally must not come faltered that meeting practically settled point towards long severed person be converging nothing be broached about for time yet sally hall have in fact imparted first decisive motion to event by refusing to accompany helena soon gave second move by writing following note private dear charlesliving here so long intimately with helena have naturally learnt history especially that of refers to be sure must accept a husband at proper time think ought to give opportunity inquire in old note if be sorry showed temper wasnt that night when heard talking to charles be not sorry at for what said thenyours sincerely sally hall thus set in train transfer of dartons heart back to original quarter proceeded by mere lapse of time in following july darton went to friend japheth to ask at last to fulfil bridal office have be in abeyance since previous january twelvemonth with heart man o constancy said dairyman john warmly ive lost most of genteel fair complexion haymaking hot weather ti true ill do business a well a that look better there be scent good hair oil in world yet thank god theyll take off roughest o edge ill compliment better late than never sally hall ill say be not sally said darton hurriedly be young mr hall japheth face a soon a really comprehended became picture of reproachful dismay not sally said why not sally cant believe young mr hall well wellwheres wisdom darton shortly explained particular john must not be reconciled be woman worth having if ever woman be cried now to let go suppose can marry where like said darton hm replied dairyman lifting eyebrow expressively dont become charlesit really if have done thing must have sworn be curst nothern fool to be drawn off scent by red herring doll

went off sorry even unhappy particularly a japheth be about to leave side of county so that word have divided be not likely to be explained away softened down short time after interview darton be united to helena at simple matter of fact wedding little girl joined boy who have already grown to look on dartons house a home for month farmer experienced unprecedented happiness satisfaction there have be flaw in life be a neatly mended a be humanly possible after season stream of event followed le clearly there be shade in revery helena be fragile woman of little staying power physically morally since time that have originally known hereight ten year beforeshe have be severely tried have loved out in short be now occasionally given to moping sometimes spoke regretfully of gentility of early life instead of comparing present state with condition a wife of unlucky hall mused rather on what have be before took first fatal step of clandestinely marrying did not care to please such people a with whom be thrown a thriving farmer wife allowed pretty trifle of agricultural domesticity to glide by a sorry detail have not be for child dartons house must have seemed little brighter than have be before led to occasional unpleasantness until darton sometimes declared to that such endeavour a to rectify early deviation of heart by harking back to old point mostly failed of success perhaps john be right must say must have gone on with sally better go with tide make best of course than stem at risk of capsize kept unmelodious thought to be outwardly considerate kind somewhat barren tract of life have extended to le than year half when ponderings be cut short by loss of woman concerned when be in grave thought better of than when have be alive farm be worse place without than with after woman short of divine must have gone through such experience a hers with first husband without becoming little soured stagnant sympathy sometimes unreasonable manner have covered heart frank well meaning originally hopeful warm left tiny red infant in white wrapping to make life a easy a possible to touching object became at once care a child learnt to walk talk darton learnt to see feasibility in scheme pleased revolving experiment have hitherto made upon life fancied have gained wisdom from mistake caution from miscarriage what scheme be need penetration to discover once more

be woman to brighten must not a helena did despise rural simplicity of farmer fireside moreover have pre eminent qualification for dartons household other woman must make so desirable mother to brother two child dartons one a sallywhile darton now that helena have gone be more promising husband for sally than have ever be when liable to reminder from uncured sentimental wound darton be not

buried first mouthful under look of receptive blandness have chicken in house mr stockdalei quite forgot to mention just now perhaps must like marther sarer to bring up stockdale have advanced far enough in art of being young man to say that did not want chicken unless brought up when be uttered blushed at daring gallantry of speech perhaps shade too strong for serious man minister in three minute chicken appeared to great surprise only in hand of martha sarah stockdale be disappointed perhaps be intended that must be have finished supper be not in least anticipating mr newberry again that night when tapped entered a before stockdales gratified look told that have lost nothing by not appearing when expected happened that cold in head from young man suffered have increased with approach of night before have spoken be seized with violent fit of sneezing must not anyhow repress mr newberry looked full of pity cold be very bad to night mr stockdale stockdale replied that be rather troublesome ive good mindshe added archly looking at cheerless glass of water on table abstemious minister be going to drink yes mr newberry ive good mind that must have something more likely to cure than cold stuff well said stockdale looking down at glass a there be inn here nothing better to be got in village of course will do to replied there be something better not far off though not in house really think must try may be ill yes mr stockdale will held up finger seeing that be about to speak dont ask what be wait will see lizzy went away stockdale waited in pleasant mood presently returned with bonnet cloak on saying be so sorry must help to get have gone to bed will wrap up come way please bring cup with stockdale lonely young fellow who have for week felt great craving for somebody on whom to throw away superfluous interest even tenderness be not sorry to join followed guide through back door across garden to bottom where boundary be wall wall be low beyond stockdale discerned in night shade several grey headstone outline of church roof tower be easy to get up way said stepping upon bank abutted on wall then putting foot on top of stonework descending spring inside where ground be much higher a be manner of graveyard to be stockdale did same followed in dusk across irregular ground till came to tower door when have entered softly closed behind can keep secret said in musical voice like iron chest said fervently then from under cloak produced small lighted lantern minister have not noticed that carried at light showed to be close to singing gallery stair under lay heap of lumber of sort consisting mostly of decayed framework pew panel piece of flooring that from time to time have be removed from original fixing in body of edifice replaced by new perhaps will drag of board aside said holding lantern over head to light better will take lantern while move can manage said young man acting a ordered uncovered to surprise row of little barrel bound with wood hoop barrel being about a large a nave of heavy waggon wheel when be laid open lizzy fixed eye on a if wondered what must say know what be asked finding that did not speak yes barrel said stockdale simply be inland man son of highly respectable parent brought up with single eye to ministry sight suggested nothing beyond fact that such article be there be quite right be barrel said in emphatic tone of candour be not without touch of irony stockdale looked at with eye of sudden misgiving not smuggler liquor said yes said be tub of spirit have accidentally come over in dark from france in moynton vicinity at date people always smiled at sort of sin called in outside world illicit trading little keg of gin brandy be a well known to inhabitant a turnip so stockdales innocent ignorance look of alarm when guessed sinister mystery seemed to strike lizzy first a ludicrous then a very awkward for good impression that wished to produce upon smuggling be carried on here by of people said in gentle apologetic voice have be practice for generation think harm now will roll out one of tub what to do with said minister to draw little from to cure cold answered be so nation strong that drive away that sort of thing in jiffy o be all right about taking may have what like owner of tub say so ought to have have in house then shouldnt have be put to trouble drink none so often forget to keep indoors be allowed to help suppose that may not inform where hiding place be well no not that particularly may take if want so help will to oblige since have right to murmured minister though be not quite satisfied with part in performance rolled one of tub out from corner into middle of tower floor how do wish to get outwith gimlet suppose ill show said interesting companion held up with other hand shoemaker awl hammer must never do thing with gimlet because wood dust get in when buyer pour out brandy must tell that tub have be broached awl make dust hole nearly close up again now tap one of hoop forward stockdale took hammer did so now make hole in part be covered by hoop made hole a directed wont run out said o yes will said take tub between knee squeeze head ill hold cup stockdale obeyed pressure taking effect upon tub seemed to be thin spirit spirted out in stream when cup be full ceased pressing flow immediately stopped now must fill up keg with water said lizzy will cluck like forty hen when be handled show that ti not full tell may take yes smuggler buyer must not know that smuggler have be kind to at expense see said stockdale doubtfully much question honesty of proceeding by direction held tub with hole upwards while went through process of alternately pressing ceasing to press produced bottle of water from took mouthful conveying to keg by putting pretty lip to hole where be sucked in at recovery of cask from pressure when be again full plugged hole knocked hoop down to place buried tub in lumber a before arent smuggler afraid that will tell asked a recrossed churchyard o be not afraid of couldnt do thing have put into very awkward corner said stockdale emphatically must of course a honest person sometimes feel that be duty to informreally must well have never particularly felt a duty besides first husband stopped there be confusion in voice stockdale be so honest unsophisticated that did not at once discern why paused at last did perceive that word be slip that woman must have uttered first husband by accident unless have thought pretty frequently of second felt for confusion allowed time to recover proceed husband said in self corrected tone used to know of doings so did father kept secret can not inform in fact against anybody see hardness of continued like man who looked far into moral of thing be very cruel that must be tossed tantalized between memory conscience do hope mr newberry that will soon see way out of unpleasant position well dont just now murmured by time have passed over wall entered house where brought glass hot water left to own reflection looked after vanishing form asking whether a respectable man minister shining light even though a yet only of halfpenny candle sort be quite justified in doing thing sneeze settled question found that when fiery liquor be lowered by addition of twice thrice quantity of water be one of prettiest cure for cold in head that have ever known particularly at chilly time of year stockdale sat in deep chair about twenty minute sipping meditating till at length took warmer view of thing longed for morrow when must see mr newberry again then felt that though chronologically at short distance must in emotional sense be very long before to morrow came walked restlessly round room eye be attracted by framed glazed sampler in running ornament of fir tree peacock surrounded following pretty bit of sentiment rose leaf smell when rose thrive here work while im alive rose leaf smell when shrunk shed here work when be dead lizzy simpkins fear god honour king aged year ti hers said to heaven how like name before have done thinking that other name from abigail to zenobia must have suited young landlady so well tap tap came again upon door minister started a face appeared yet time looking so disinterested that most ingenious must have refrained from asserting that have come to affect feeling by seductive eye must like fire in room mr stockdale on account of cold minister being still little pricked in conscience for countenancing in watering spirit saw here way to self chastisement thank said firmly be not necessary have never be used to one in life must be giving way to luxury too far then wont insist said disconcerted by vanishing instantly wondering if be vexed by refusal wished that have chosen to have fire even though must have scorched out of bed endangered self discipline for dozen day however consoled with what be in truth rare consolation for budding lover that be under same roof with lizzy guest in fact to take poetical view of term lodger that must certainly see on morrow morrow came stockdale rose early cold quite gone have never in life so longed for breakfast hour a did that day punctually at eight oclock after short walk to reconnoitre premise re entered door of dwelling breakfast passed martha sarah attended nobody came voluntarily a on night before to inquire if there be other want have not mentioned must attempt to gratify be disappointed went out hoping to see at dinner dinner time came sat down to meal finished lingered on for whole hour although two new teacher be at moment waiting at chapel door to speak to by appointment be useless to wait longer slowly went way down lane cheered by thought that after must see in evening perhaps engage again in delightful tub broaching in neighbouring church tower proceeding resolved to render more moral by steadfastly insisting that water must be introduced to fill up though tub must cluck like hen in christendom nothing must disguise fact that be queer business countenance fell when thought how much more mind be interested in matter than in serious duty however compunction vanished with decline of day night came tea supper lizzy newberry sweet temptation at last minister must bear no longer said to quaint little attendant where be mr newberry to day judiciously handing penny a spoke shes busy said martha anything serious happened asked handing penny revealing yet additional penny in background o nonothing at said with breathless confidence nothing ever happens to shes only biding upstairs in bed because ti way sometimes being young man of honour must not question further assuming that lizzy must have bad headache other slight ailment in spite of what girl have said went to bed dissatisfied not even setting eye on old mr simpkins said last night must see to morrow reflected be not to be next day have better fortune worse meeting at foot of stair in morning being favoured by visit two from during dayonce for purpose of making kindly inquiry about comfort a on first evening at time to place bunch of winter violet on table with promise to renew when drooped on occasion there be something in smile showed how conscious be of effect produced though must be said that be rather humorous than designing consciousness savoured more of pride than of vanity a for stockdale clearly perceived that possessed unlimited capacity for backsliding wished that tutelary saint be not denied to dissenter set watch upon tongue eye for space of one hour half after found be useless to struggle further gave up to situation other minister will be here in month said to when sitting over fire then will be off will distract mind more then will go on living by for ever when two year of probation be finished will have furnished house to live in with varnished door brass knocker ill march straight back to ask flat a soon a last plate be on dresser thus titillating fortnight be passed by young stockdale during time thing proceeded much a such matter have done ever since beginning of history saw object of attachment several time one day did not see at next met when least expected to do so missed when hint sign a to where must be at given hour almost amounted to appointment mild coquetry be perhaps fair enough under circumstance of being so closely lodged stockdale put up with a philosophically a be able being in own house must after vexing disappointing of presence easily win back by suddenly surrounding with little attention position a landlady put in power to bestow when have waited indoors day to see on finding that must not be seen have gone off in huff to dreariest dampest walk must discover must restore equilibrium in evening with mr stockdale have fancied must feel draught o night from bedroom window so have be putting up thicker curtain afternoon while be out noticed that sneezed twice again morning mr stockdale depend upon that cold be hanging about yet be sure isi have thought of continually must let make posset for sometimes in coming home found sitting room rearranged chair placed where table have stood table ornamented with few fresh flower leaf must be obtained at season so a to add novelty to room at time must be standing on chair outside house trying to nail up branch of monthly rose winter wind have blown down of course stepped forward to assist when hand got mixed in passing shred nail thus became friend again after disagreement must utter on occasion pretty deprecatory remark on necessity of troubling anew must straightway say that must do hundred time a much for if must so require chapter iihow saw two other men matter being in advancing state stockdale be rather surprised one cloudy evening while sitting in room at hearing speak in low tone of expostulation to one at door be nearly dark shutter be not yet closed candle lighted stockdale be tempted to stretch head towards window saw outside door young man in clothes of whitish colour upon reflection judged wearer to be well built rather handsome miller who lived below miller voice be alternately low firm sometimes reached level of positive entreaty what word be stockdale must in way hear before colloquy have ended minister attention be attracted by second incident opposite lizzys home grew clump of laurel forming thick permanent shade one of laurel bough now quivered against light background of sky in moment head of man peered out remained still seemed to be also much interested in conversation at door be plainly lingering there to watch listen have stockdale stood in other relation to lizzy than of lover might have gone out investigated meaning of being a yet unprivileged ally did nothing more than stand up show against firelight whereupon listener disappeared lizzy miller spoke in lower tone stockdale be made so uneasy by circumstance that a soon a miller be gone said mr newberry be aware that be watched just now conversation heard when said when be talking to miller man be looking from laurel tree a jealously a if must have eaten showed more concern than trifling event seemed to demand added perhaps be talking of thing did not wish to be overheard be talking only on business said lizzy be frank said young man if be only on business why must anybody wish to listen to looked curiously at what else do think must be then wellthe only talk between young woman man be likely to amuse eavesdropper ah yes said smiling in spite of preoccupation well cousin owlett have spoken to about matrimony now then thats true be not speaking of then wish have be speaking of with heart must have be much le serious for o mr newberry must not that must have chimed in with of course wish for other reason be glad mr stockdale that have told of listener be timely warning must see cousin again dont go away till have spoken said minister ill out with at once make more ado let be yes between lizzy please do held out hand in freely allowed own to rest without speaking mean yes by that asked after waiting while may be sweetheart if will why not say at once will wait for until have house can come back to marry because be thinkingthinking of something else said with embarrassment come upon at once must settle one thing at time at rate dear lizzy can assure that miller will not be allowed to speak to except on business have never directly encouraged parried question by saying see party have be in habit of leaving thing on premise sometimes a have not denied make rather forward thingswhat thing tubsthey be called thing here why dont deny dear lizzy can not well be too timid be unfair of to impose so upon get good name into danger by smuggling trick promise that next time want to leave tub here will let roll into street shook head must not venture to offend neighbour so much a said do anything must be so likely to put poor owlett into hand of exciseman stockdale sighed said that thought hers mistaken generosity when extended to assisting who cheated king of due at rate will let make keep distance a lover tell flatly that be not for please not at present said dont wish to offend old neighbour be not only owlett who be concerned be too bad said stockdale impatiently on honour wont encourage a lover lizzy answered earnestly reasonable man will be satisfied with well so be said stockdale countenance clearing chapter iiithe mysterious greatcoat stockdale now began to notice more particularly feature in life of fair landlady have casually observed scarcely ever thought of before be that be markedly irregular in hour of rising for week two must be tolerably punctual reaching ground floor within few minute of half past seven then suddenly must not be visible till twelve at noon perhaps for three four day in succession twice have certain proof that did not leave room till half past three in afternoon second time that extreme lateness came under notice be on day when have particularly wished to consult with about future movement concluded a always have done that have cold headache other ailment unless have kept invisible to avoid meeting talking to must hardly believe former supposition be disproved however by innocently saying day later when be speaking on question of health that have never have moment heaviness headache illness of kind since previous january twelvemonth be glad to hear said thought quite otherwise what do look sickly asked turning up face to show impossibility of gazing on holding such belief for moment not at merely thought so from being sometimes obliged to keep room through best part of day o a for thatit mean nothing murmured with look might have called cold be worst look that liked to see upon be pure sleepiness mr stockdale never be tell when stay in room till past three in afternoon may always be sure that slept soundly till three shouldnt have stayed there be dreadful said stockdale thinking of disastrous effect of such indulgence upon household of minister must become habit of everyday occurrence then said divining good prescient thought only happens when stay awake night dont go to sleep till five six in morning sometimes ah thats matter said stockdale sleeplessness to alarming extent be real illness have spoken to doctor o nothere be need for doing thatit be natural to went away without further remark stockdale might have waited long time to know real cause of sleeplessness have not happened that one dark night be sitting in bedroom jotting down note for sermon occupied perfunctorily for considerable time after other member of household have retired did not get to bed till one oclock before have fallen asleep heard knocking at front door first rather timidly performed then louder nobody answered person knocked again a house still remained undisturbed stockdale got out of bed went to window overlooked door opening asked who be there young woman voice replied that susan wallis be there that have come to ask if mr newberry must give mustard to make plaster with a father be taken very ill on chest minister having bell servant be compelled to act in person will call mr newberry said partly dressing went along passage tapped at lizzys door did not answer thinking of erratic habit in matter of sleep thumped door persistently when discovered by moving ajar under knocking that have only be gently pushed to a there be now sufficient entry for voice knocked no longer said in firm tone mr newberry be wanted room be quite silent not breathing not rustle came from part of stockdale now sent positive shout through open space of door mr newberrystill answer movement of kind within then heard sound from opposite room that of lizzys mother a if have be aroused by uproar though lizzy have not be dressing hastily stockdale softly closed younger woman door went on to other be opened by mr simpkins before must reach be in ordinary clothes have light in hand whats person calling about said in alarm stockdale told girl errand adding seriously can not wake mr newberry be matter said mother can let girl have what want a well a daughter came out of room went downstairs stockdale retired towards own apartment saying however to mr simpkins from landing a if on second thought suppose there be nothing matter with mr newberry must not wake o said old lady hastily nothing at still minister be not satisfied will go in see said must be much more at ease mr simpkins returned up staircase went to daughter room came out again almost instantly there be nothing at matter with lizzy said descended again to attend to applicant who having seen light have remained quiet during interval stockdale went into room lay down a before heard lizzys mother open front door admit girl then murmured discourse of a went to store cupboard for medicament required girl departed door be fastened mr simpkins came upstairs house be again in silence still minister did not fall asleep must not get rid of singular suspicion be more harassing in being if true most unaccountable thing within experience that lizzy newberry be in bedroom when made clamour at door must not possibly convince notwithstanding that have heard come upstairs at usual time go into chamber shut up in usual way yet reason be so much against being elsewhere that be constrained to go back again to unlikely theory of heavy sleep though have heard neither breath movement during shouting knocking loud enough to rouse seven sleeper before coming to positive conclusion fell asleep did not awake till day saw nothing of mr newberry in morning before went out to meet rising sun a liked to do when weather be fine a be by mean unusual took notice of at breakfast time knew that be not far off by hearing in kitchen though saw nothing of person that back apartment being rigorously closed against eye seemed to be talking ordering bustling about among pot skimmer in so ordinary manner that there be reason for wasting more time in fruitless surmise minister suffered from distraction extemporized sermon be not improved thereby already often said roman for corinthian in pulpit gave out hymn in strange cramped metre that hitherto have always be skipped because congregation must not raise tune to fit fully resolved that a soon a few week of stay approached end must cut matter short commit by proposing definite engagement repenting at leisure if necessary with end in view suggested to on evening after mysterious sleep that must take walk together just before dark latter part of proposition being introduced that might return home unseen consented to go away went over stile to shrouded footpath suited for occasion in spite of attempt on side be unable to infuse much spirit into ramble looked rather paler than usual sometimes turned head away lizzy said stockdale reproachfully when have walked in silence long distance yes said yawnedmuch company be to put in way be really wondering whether yawn must possibly have more to do with physical weariness from night before than mental weariness of present moment lizzy apologized owned that be rather tired gave opening for direct question on point modesty must not allow to put to uncomfortably resolved to wait month of february passed with alternation of mud frost rain sleet east wind north westerly gale hollow place in ploughed field showed a pool of water have settled there from higher level have not yet found time to soak away bird began to get lively single thrush came just before sunset evening sang hopefully on large elm tree stood nearest to mr newberrys house cold blast brittle earth have given place to oozing dampness more unpleasant in than frost suggested coming spring unpleasantness be of bearable kind stockdale have be going to bring about practical understanding with lizzy at least dozen time what with mystery of apparent absence on night of neighbour call curious way of lying in bed at unaccountable time felt check within whenever wanted to speak out thus still lived on a indefinitely affianced lover of whom hardly acknowledged others claim to name of chosen one stockdale persuaded that hesitation be owing to postponement of ordained minister arrival consequent delay in own departure did away with necessity for haste in courtship perhaps be only that discretion be reasserting telling that have better get clearer idea of lizzy before arranging for grand contract of life with on part always seemed ready to be urged further on question than have hitherto attempted to go be none le independent to degree must have kept from flagging passion of far more mutable man on evening of first of march went casually into bedroom about dusk noticed lying on chair greatcoat hat breech having recollection of leaving clothes of own in spot went examined a well a must in twilight found that did not belong to paused for moment to consider how might have got there be only man living in house yet be not garment unless have made mistake be not called up martha sarah how did thing come in room said flinging objectionable article to floor martha said that mr newberry have given to to brush that have brought up there thinking must be mr stockdales a there be other gentleman lodging there of course did said stockdale now take down to mi say be clothes have found here know nothing about a door be left open heard conversation downstairs how stupid said mr newberry in tone of confusion why marther sarer did not tell to take em to mr stockdales room thought must be a be so muddy said martha humbly must have left em on clothes horse said young mistress severely came upstairs with garment on arm quickly passed stockdales room threw forcibly into closet at end of passage with incident ended house be silent again there must have be nothing remarkable in finding such clothes in widow house have be clean moth eaten creased mouldy from long lying by that must be splashed with recent mud bothered good deal when young pastor be in aspen stage of attachment open to agitation at merest trifle really substantial incongruity of complexion be disturbing thing however nothing further occurred at time became watchful given to conjecture be unable to forget circumstance one morning on looking from window saw mr newberry brushing tail of long drab greatcoat if mistook not be very same garment a one have adorned chair of room be densely splashed up to hollow of back with neighbouring moynton mud to judge by colour spot being distinctly visible to in sunlight previous day two having be inference be irresistible that wearer have quite recently be walking considerable distance about lane field stockdale opened window looked out mr newberry turned head face became slowly red never have looked prettier more incomprehensible waved hand affectionately said good morning answered with embarrassment having ceased occupation on instant that saw rolled up coat half cleaned stockdale shut window simple explanation of proceeding be doubtless within bound of possibility must not think of one wished that have placed matter beyond conjecture by voluntarily saying something about there then though lizzy have not offered explanation at moment subject be brought forward by at next time of meeting be chatting to concerning other event remarked that happened about time when be dusting old clothes have belonged to poor husband keep clean out of respect to memory said stockdale tentatively air dust sometimes said with most charming innocence in world do dead men come out of graf walk in mud murmured minister in cold sweat at deception that be practising what did say asked lizzy nothing nothing said mournfully mere wordsa phrase will do for sermon next sunday be too plain that lizzy be unaware that have seen actual pedestrian splash upon skirt of tell tale overcoat that imagined to believe have come direct from chest drawer aspect of case be now considerably darker stockdale be so much depressed by that did not challenge explanation threaten to go off a missionary to benighted islander reproach in way whatever simply parted from when have done talking lived on in perplexity till by degree natural manner became sad constrained chapter ivat time of new moon following thursday be changeable damp gloomy night threatened to be windy unpleasant stockdale have gone away to knollsea in morning to be present at commemoration service there on return be met by attractive lizzy in passage whether influenced by tide of cheerfulness have attended day by drive through open air whether from natural
