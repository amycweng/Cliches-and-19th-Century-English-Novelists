since conquest people must have to be that thing happened at house opposite belonging to one child with whose family swetmans afterwards intermarried that be at original homestead of swetmans can be shown in various way chiefly by unbroken tradition of family indirectly by evidence of wall be only one thereabout with window mullioned in elizabethan manner plainly of date anterior to event while of other house might well have be erected fifty eighty year later probably be since choice of swetman house by fugitive be doubtless dictated by other circumstance than then suitable loneliness be
