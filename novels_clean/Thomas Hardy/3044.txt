left message say looked relieved that object be defeated then say resolved to come to at old house last night started reached door dreaded to knock then went home again ' 'here will be tale for newsmonger of county said owen bitterly idea of not opening mouth sooner criminality of thing ' be inconsistency of weak nature now that be put to in way how much more probable seems that must have escaped than have be burnt 'you will of course go straight to mr manston ask what mean edward interrupted 'of course will manston have right to carry off sister unless be husband ' said owen ' will go

hour ago said be too late to catch at station nevertheless rector suggested that must be worth while to direct message to 'all respectable hotel in southampton ' on chance of finding thus saving deal of personal labour to owen in searching about place `` ll go telegraph whilst return to man said edward offer be accepted graye rector then turned off in direction of porter cottage edward to despatch message at once hurriedly followed road towards station still restlessly thinking owen proceeding be based on assumption natural under circumstance of manston good faith that must readily acquiesce in arrangement must clear up mystery thought edward heaven forgive can not help supposing that manston be not that honourable man what will young inexperienced fellow like owen do will not be hoodwinked by specious story framed to last till manston get tired of poor cytherea then disclosure of truth will ruin blacken future irremediably ' however proceeded to execute commission put in form of simple request from owen to manston that manston must come to southampton platform wait for owen arrival a valued reputation message be directed a rector have suggested edward guaranteeing to clerk who sent off expense connected with search must be paid sooner have telegram be despatched than heart sank within at want of foresight shown in sending have manston time knowledge that first wife lived telegram must be forewarning might enable to defeat owen still more signally whilst machine be still giving off multitudinous series of rap edward heard powerful rush under shed outside followed by

broke in upon edward mind then wish overwhelmed conviction a startling a be sudden be that manston be villain who at earlier time have discovered that wife lived have bribed to keep out of sight that might posse cytherea wish be to proceed at once by very train be starting find manston before must expect from word of telegram if got that anybody from carriford must be with charge boldly with crime

remembered that have nothing to show legal authority to question manston interfere between cytherea a husband wife now saw wisdom of rector in obtaining signed confession from porter document must not be death bed confession perhaps not worth anything legally must be held by owen alone a cytherea natural guardian must separate on mere ground of unproved probability what might perhaps be called hallucination of idiot edward however be a firmly convinced a rector have be of truth of man story paced backward forward solitary compartment a train wound through dark heathery plain mazy wood moaning coppice a resolved a ever to pounce on manston charge with crime during critical interval between reception of telegram hour at owen train must arrive trusting to circumstance for what must

must by stretch of imagination divine changed direction a soon a woman be out of sight plodded along lane homeward to tolchurch one new idea be suggested to by desire to allay cytherea dread of being claimed by difficulty of believing that first mr manston lost life a supposed notwithstanding inquest verdict be possible that real mr manston who be known to be philadelphian by birth have returned by train to london a porter have said then left country under assumed name to escape that worst kind of widowhood misery of being wedded to fickle faithless truant husband in complicated distress at news brought by brother cytherea thought at length reverted to friend rector of carriford told owen of mr raunham warm hearted behaviour towards of strongly expressed wish to aid 'he be not only good sensible man seem to want old head on side ' be magistrate ' said owen in tone of concurrence thought too that harm must come of confiding in rector there be difficulty in bringing about confidence wished that sister might both be present at interview with mr raunham yet must be unwise for to call on together in sight of servant parish of carriford there must be objection to writing letter sooner be thought born than be carried out wrote to at once asking to have goodness to give advice sadly needed begging that must accept assurance that there be real justification for additional

appeared at owen door arrival be hailed with genuine gratitude horse be tied to paling rector ushered indoors put into easy chair then graye told whole story reminding that first suspicion have be of totally different nature that in endeavouring to obtain proof of truth have stumbled upon mark have surprised into new uncertainty thrice a marvellous a first yet more prominent cytherea heart be so full of anxiety that superinduced manner of confidence be death blow to formality mr raunham took hand pityingly 'it be serious charge said a sort of original twig on thought might precipitate 'assuming for moment that substitution be rendered easy matter by fortuitous event continued 'there be consideration to be placed beside what earthly motive can mr manston have have must be sufficiently powerful to lead to run very great risk most abandoned roue must not at particular crisis have taken reckless step for mere pleasure of new companion owen have seen that difficulty about

for own sake have hit only genuine possibility said mr raunham tapping finger upon knee 'that must decidedly dispose of second difficulty motive must be a mysterious a ever cytherea pictured dread must not allow mind to follow conversation be burnt ' said ' o yes fear fear be ' ' think can seriously believe that now after what have happened ' said rector still straining thought towards worst perhaps first mr manston be not wife ' returned 'and then must be wife just same must ' 'they be married safely enough ' said owen 'there be abundance of circumstantial evidence to prove ' 'upon whole said mr raunham ' must advise asking in straightforward way for legal proof from steward that present woman be really original wife thing to mind must have done at outset turned to cytherea kindly asked what made give up husband so unceremoniously must not tell rector of aversion to manston of unquenched love for edward 'your terrified state doubt said answering for in manner of accustomed to

must have required thing to be made clear ran away ' be partly doing ' said owen same explanation want of love for manston applied here too shunned revelation never mind ' added rector be greater credit to womanhood perhaps say then get brother to write line to mr manston saying wish to be satisfied that be legally clear in case must want to marry again for instance have doubt that will be if must rather will write ' ' o sir pleaded cytherea beginning to blanch breathing quickly 'please say anything let live here with owen be so afraid will turn out that will have to go to knapwater be wife want to go do conceal what have told let continue deception be much best for ' mr raunham at length divined that love for manston if have ever existed have transmuted into very different feeling now 'at rate ' said a took leave mounted mare ' will see about rest content miss graye depend upon will not lead into difficulty ' ' still pleaded 'we will see of course must do duty ' 'no do duty ' looked up at through gloom illuminating own face eye with candle held ' will consider then said mr raunham sensibly moved turned horse head bade warm adieu left door rector of carriford trotted homewards under cold clear march sky countless star fluttering like bright bird be unconscious of scene recovering from effect of cytherea voice glance of entreaty laid subject of interview clearly before suspicion of cytherea owen be honest have foundation that must own be clergyman magistrate conscientious man justified in yielding to cytherea importunity to keep silence because dreaded possibility of return to manston be wise in request holding present belief with definite evidence way must for one thing never conscientiously marry one else suppose that cytherea be manston wife ie that first wife be really burnt adultery of manston must be proved mr raunham thought cruelty sufficient to bring case within meaning of statute suppose new woman be a stated mr manston restored wife cytherea be perfectly safe a single woman whose marriage have be void if turned out that though woman be not manston wife wife be still living a owen have suggested in america elsewhere cytherea be safe first supposition opened up worst contingency be really safe a manston wife doubtful however might be gentle defenceless girl whom seemed nobody business to help defend must be put in track to proceed against man have one life superciliousness with world now regarded must be compensated in measure by man whose carelessness to set in best light have caused mr raunham felt more more positively that duty must be done inquiry must be made into matter immediately on reaching home sat down wrote plain friendly letter to mr manston despatched at once to by hand then flung back in chair went on with meditation be there anything in suspicion there must be nothing surely nothing be done by clever man without motive what conceivable motive must manston have for such abnormal conduct corinthian that might be who have preyed on virginity like st george dragon must never have be absurd enough to venture on course for possession alone of woman there be reason for be inferior to cytherea in respect physical mental on other hand seemed rather odd when analyzed action that woman who deliberately hid from husband for more than twelvemonth must be brought back by mere advertisement in fact whole business have worked almost too smoothly effectually for unpremeditated sequence be too much like indiscriminate righting of everything at end of old play there be that curious business of key watch way of accounting for being left behind by forgetfulness have always seemed to rather forced only unforced explanation be that suggested by newspaper writer that left behind on purpose to blind people a to escape motive must have clashed with possibility of being fished back by advertisement a present woman have be again there be two charred bone shuffled book

from first moment that believed dead on night of fire to day of wedding yet have that letter how soon afterwards must have communicated with other existence of letter a much a more than content
