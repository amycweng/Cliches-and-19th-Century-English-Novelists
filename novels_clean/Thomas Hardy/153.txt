sty fog have by time become more translucent position of sun must be seen through pulled straw hat over face peered through interstice of plaiting at white brightness vaguely reflecting growing up brought responsibility found event did not rhyme quite a have thought nature logic be too horrid for to care for mercy towards one set of creature be cruelty towards sickened sense of harmony a got older felt to be at centre of time not at point in circumference a have felt when be little be seized with sort of shuddering perceived around there seemed to be something glaring garish rattling noise glare hit upon little cell called life shook warped if must only prevent growing up did not want to be man then like natural boy forgot despondency sprang up during remainder of morning helped aunt in afternoon when there be nothing more to be done went into village here asked man whereabouts christminster lay christminster oh well out by there yonder though ive never bin therenot ive never have business at place man pointed north eastward in very direction where lay field in jude have so disgraced there be something unpleasant about coincidence for moment fearsomeness of fact rather increased curiosity about city farmer have said be never to be seen in field again yet christminster lay across path be public one so stealing out of hamlet descended into same hollow have witnessed punishment in morning never swerving inch from path climbing up long tedious ascent on other side till track joined highway by little clump of tree here ploughed land ended before be bleak open down iii not soul be visible on hedgeless highway on side of white road seemed to ascend diminish till joined sky at very top be crossed at right angle by green ridgewaythe ickneild street original roman road through district ancient track ran east west for many mile down almost to within living memory have be used for driving flock herd to fair market be now neglected overgrown boy have never before strayed so far north a from nestling hamlet in have be deposited by carrier from railway station southward one dark evening few month earlier till now have have suspicion that wide flat low lying country lay so near at hand under very verge of upland world whole northern semicircle between east west to distance of forty fifty mile spread before bluer moister atmosphere evidently than that breathed up here not far from road stood weather beaten old barn of reddish grey brick tile be known a brown house by people of locality be about to pas when perceived ladder against eaves reflection that higher got further must see led jude to stand regard on slope of roof two men be repairing tiling turned into ridgeway drew towards barn when have wistfully watched workman for time took courage ascended ladder till stood beside well lad what may want up here wanted to know where city of christminster be if please christminster be out across there by clump can see itat least can on clear day ah cant now other tiler glad of kind of diversion from monotony of labour have also turned to look towards quarter designated cant often see in weather like said time ive noticed be when sun be going down in blaze of flame look likei dont know what heavenly jerusalem suggested serious urchin aythough must never have thought of cant see christminster to day boy strained eye also yet must see far off city descended from barn abandoning christminster with versatility of age walked along ridge track looking for natural object of interest might lie in bank thereabout when repassed barn to go back to marygreen observed that ladder be still in place that men have finished day work gone away be waning towards evening there be still faint mist have cleared little except in damper tract of subjacent country along river course thought again of christminster wished since have come two three mile from aunt house on purpose that must have seen for once attractive city of have be told even if waited here be hardly likely that air must clear before night yet be loth to leave spot for northern expanse became lost to view on retreating towards village only few hundred yard ascended ladder to have one more look at point men have designated perched on highest rung overlying tile might not be able to come so far a for many day perhaps if prayed wish to see christminster might be forwarded people said that if prayed thing sometimes came to even though sometimes did not have read in tract that man who have begun to build church have money to finish knelt down prayed money came in by next post man tried same experiment money did not come found afterwards that breech knelt in be made by wicked jew be not discouraging turning on ladder jude knelt on third rung where resting against above prayed that mist might rise then seated again waited in course of ten fifteen minute thinning mist dissolved altogether from northern horizon a have already done elsewhere about quarter of hour before time of sunset westward cloud parted sun position being partially uncovered beam streaming out in visible line between two bar of slaty cloud boy immediately looked back in old direction way within limit of stretch of landscape point of light like topaz gleamed air increased in transparency with lapse of minute till topaz point showed to be vane window wet roof slate other shining spot upon spire dome freestone work varied outline be faintly revealed be christminster unquestionably directly seen miraged in peculiar atmosphere spectator gazed on on till window vane lost shine going out almost suddenly like extinguished candle vague city became veiled in mist turning to west saw that sun have disappeared foreground of scene have grown funereally dark near object put on hue shape of chimaera anxiously descended ladder started homewards at run trying not to think of giant herne hunter apollyon lying in wait for christian of captain with bleeding hole in forehead corps round that remutinied night on board bewitched ship knew that have grown out of belief in horror yet be glad when saw church tower light in cottage window even though be not home of birth great aunt did not care much about inside round about old woman shop window with twenty four little pane set in lead work glass of of oxidized with age so that must hardly see poor penny article exhibited within forming part of stock strong man must have carried jude have outer being for long tideless time dream be a gigantic a surroundings be small through solid barrier of cold cretaceous upland to northward be always beholding gorgeous citythe fancied place have likened to new jerusalem though there be perhaps more of painter imagination le of diamond merchant in dream thereof than in of apocalyptic writer city acquired tangibility permanence hold on life mainly from one nucleus of fact that man for whose knowledge purpose have so much reverence be actually living there not only so living among more thoughtful mentally shining one therein in sad wet season though knew must rain at christminster too must hardly believe that rained so drearily there whenever must get away from confines of hamlet for hour two be not often must steal off to brown house on hill strain eye persistently sometimes to be rewarded by sight of dome spire at other time by little smoke in estimate have of mysticism of incense then day came when suddenly occurred to that if ascended to point of view after dark possibly went mile two further must see night light of city must be necessary to come back alone even consideration did not deter for must throw little manliness into mood doubt project be duly executed be not late when arrived at place of outlook only just after dusk black north east sky accompanied by wind from same quarter made occasion dark enough be rewarded what saw be not lamp in row a have half expected individual light be visible only halo glow fog over arching place against black heaven behind making light city seem distant mile so set to wonder on exact point in glow where schoolmaster might behe who never communicated with anybody at marygreen now who be a if dead to here in glow

ordeal of jude giving to phillotson must hardly command rather however a seemed from knowledge of what cousin must feel whom need not have have there at than from self consideration possibly must go

knocked about from pillar to post at hand of virtuous almost beyond endurance have be nearly starved be now dependent entirely upon very small stipend from school of village where parson have got ill spoken of for befriending have often thought of arabellas remark that must have be more severe with sue that recalcitrant spirit must soon have be broken yet such be obstinate illogical disregard of
