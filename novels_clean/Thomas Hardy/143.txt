became apparent soon enough though examined inquired walked hither thither day after day such character a described have anywhere be seen since evening of fair to add to difficulty must gain sound of sailor name a money be short with decided after hesitation to spend sailor money in prosecution of search be equally in vain truth be that certain shyness of revealing conduct prevented michael henchard from following up investigation with loud hue cry pursuit demanded to render effectual be probably for reason that obtained clue though everything be done by did not involve explanation of circumstance under have lost week counted up to month still searched on maintaining by small job of work in interval by time have arrived at seaport there derived intelligence that person answering somewhat to description have emigrated little time before then said must search no longer that must go settle in district have have for time in mind next day started journeying south westward did not

have grown with growth be to mr henchard too fearful thing to contemplate have seemed indeed folly to think of making elizabeth jane wise susan henchards fear of losing dearly loved daughter heart by revelation have little to do with sense of wrong doing on own part simplicitythe original ground of henchards contempt for herhad allowed to live on in conviction that newson have acquired morally real justifiable right to by purchasethough exact bearing legal limit of right be vague may seem strange to sophisticated mind that sane young matron must believe in seriousness of transfer be there not numerous other instance of same belief thing might scarcely be credited be by mean first last peasant woman who have religiously adhered to purchaser a too many rural record show history of susan henchards adventure in interim can be told in two three sentence absolutely helpless have be taken off to canada where have lived several year without great worldly success though worked a hard a

here in solitary confinement in daily routine of business there be little change thus life rolled on till day of public rejoicing be suggested to country at large in celebration of national event have recently taken place for time casterbridge by nature slow made response then one day donald farfrae broached subject to henchard by asking if must have objection to lend rick cloth to few others who contemplated getting up entertainment of sort on day named required shelter for same to might charge admission at rate of so much head have a many cloth a like henchard replied when manager have gone about business henchard be fired with emulation certainly have be very remiss of a mayor thought to call meeting ere to discus what must be done on holiday farfrae have be so cursed quick in movement a to give old fashioned people in authority chance of initiative however be not too late on second thought determined to take upon own shoulder responsibility of organizing amusement if other councilman must leave matter in hand to quite readily agreed majority being fine old crusted character who have decided taste for living without worry so henchard set about preparation for really brilliant thingsuch a must be worthy of venerable town a for farfraes little affair henchard nearly forgot except once now then when on coming into mind said to charge admission at so much headjust like scotchmanwho be going to pay anything head diversion mayor intended to provide be to be entirely free have grown so dependent upon donald that must scarcely resist calling in to consult by sheer self coercion refrained thought farfrae must be suggesting such improvement in damned luminous way that in spite of henchard must sink to position of second fiddle only scrape harmony to manager talent everybody applauded mayor proposed entertainment especially when became known that meant to pay for close to town be elevated green spot surrounded by ancient square earthworkearthworks square not square be a common a blackberry hereabouta spot whereon casterbridge people usually held kind of merry making meeting sheep fair required more space than street must afford on one side sloped to river froom from point view be obtained of country round for many mile pleasant upland be to be scene of henchards exploit advertised about town in long poster of pink colour that game of sort must take place here set to work little battalion of men under own eye erected greasy pole for climbing with smoked ham local cheese at top placed hurdle in row for jumping over across river laid slippery pole with live pig of neighbourhood tied at other end to become property of man who must walk over get there be also provided wheelbarrow for racing donkey for same stage for boxing wrestling drawing blood generally sack for jumping in moreover not forgetting principle henchard provided mammoth tea of everybody who lived in borough be invited to partake without payment table be laid parallel with inner slope of rampart awning be stretched overhead passing to fro mayor beheld unattractive exterior of farfraes erection in west walk rick cloth of different size colour being hung up to arching tree without regard to appearance be easy in mind now for own preparation far transcended morning came sky have be remarkably clear down to within day two be overcast weather threatening wind having unmistakable hint of water in henchard wished have not be quite so sure about continuance of fair season be too late to modify postpone proceeding went on at twelve oclock rain began to fall small steady commencing increasing so insensibly that be difficult to state exactly when dry weather ended wet established in hour slight moisture resolved into monotonous smiting of earth by heaven in torrent to end must be prognosticated number of people have heroically gathered in field by three oclock henchard discerned that project be doomed to end in failure ham at top of pole dripped watered smoke in form of brown liquor pig shivered in wind grain of deal table showed through sticking tablecloth for awning allowed rain to drift under at will to enclose side at hour seemed useless undertaking landscape over river disappeared wind played on tent cord in olian improvisation at length rose to such pitch that whole erection slanted to ground who have taken shelter within having to crawl out on hand knee towards six storm abated drier breeze shook moisture from grass bent seemed possible to carry out programme after awning be set up again band be called out from shelter ordered to begin where table have stood place be cleared for dancing where be folk said henchard after lapse of hour during time only two men woman have stood up to dance shop be shut why dont come be at farfraes affair in west walk answered councilman who stood in field with mayor few suppose where be body o em out of door be there then more fool henchard walked away moodily one two young fellow

closed food to be distributed among poor people of town in short time nothing be left in field few hurdle tent pole henchard returned to house have tea with wife daughter then walked out be now dusk soon saw that tendency of promenaders be towards particular spot in walk eventually proceeded note of stringed band came from enclosure farfrae have erectedthe pavilion a called itand when mayor reached perceived that gigantic tent have be ingeniously constructed without pole rope densest point of avenue of sycamore have be selected where bough made closely interlaced vault overhead to bough canvas have be hung barrel roof be result end towards wind be enclosed other end be open henchard went round saw interior in form be like nave of cathedral with one gable removed scene within be anything devotional reel fling of sort be in progress usually sedate farfrae be in midst of other dancer in costume of wild highlander flinging about spinning to tune for moment henchard must not help laughing then perceived immense admiration for scotchman revealed in woman face when exhibition be over new dance proposed donald have disappeared for time to return in natural garment have unlimited

before among rest of onlooker be elizabeth motherthe former thoughtful yet much interested eye beaming with longing lingering light a if nature have be advised by correggio in creation dancing progressed with unabated spirit henchard walked waited till wife must be disposed to go home did not care to keep in light when went into dark be worse for there heard remark of kind be becoming too frequent mr henchards rejoicing couldnt say good morning to said one man must be headstrong stunpoll to think folk must go up to bleak place to day other answered that people said be not only in such

for life seemed to take pleasure in going anywhere except in husband company hence when business must not permit to waste afternoon remained indoors waiting for time to pas till return face being visible to elizabeth jane from window aloft latter however did not say to herself that farfrae must be thankful for such devotion full of reading cited rosalinds exclamation mistress know down on knee thank heaven fasting for good man love kept eye upon henchard also one day answered inquiry for health by saying that must not endure abel whittle pitying eye upon while worked together in yard be such fool said henchard that can never get out of mind time when be master there ill come wimble for instead of if will allow said motive on going to yard be to get opportunity of observing general

donald did not make appearance then one afternoon green door opened through came first farfrae at heel lucetta donald brought wife forward without hesitation being obvious that have suspicion whatever of antecedent in common between now journeyman hay trusser henchard did not turn eye toward of pair keeping fixed on bond twisted a if alone absorbed feeling of delicacy ever prompted farfrae to avoid anything might seem like triumphing over fallen rival led to keep away from hay barn where henchard daughter be working to go on to corn department meanwhile lucetta never having be informed that henchard have entered husband service rambled straight on to barn where came suddenly upon henchard gave vent to little oh happy busy donald be too far off to hear henchard with withering humility of demeanour touched brim of hat to a whittle rest have done to breathed dead alive good afternoon beg pardon maam said henchard a if have not heard said good afternoon faltered o yes good afternoon maam

small communication will kindly undertake not to speak to in biting undertone used to day if walk through yard at time bear ill will be only too glad that must have employment of dear husband in common fairness treat a wife try to make wretched by covert sneer have committed crime done injury poor fool said henchard with fond savagery holding out note to know better than commit in writing like why if be to show to dear husbandpooh threw letter into fire lucetta took care not to come again among hay corn must rather have died than run risk of encountering henchard at such close quarter second time gulf between be growing wider day farfrae be always considerate to fallen acquaintance be impossible that must not by degree cease to regard ex corn merchant a more than one of other workman henchard saw concealed feeling under cover of stolidity fortifying heart by drinking more freely at three mariner evening often did elizabeth jane in endeavour to prevent taking other liquor carry tea to in little basket at five oclock arriving one day on errand found stepfather be measuring up clover seed rape seed in corn store on top floor ascended to floor have door opening into air under cat head from chain dangled for hoisting sack when elizabeth head rose through trap perceived that upper door be open that stepfather farfrae stood just within in conversation farfrae being nearest dizzy edge henchard little way behind not to interrupt remained on step without raising head higher while waiting thus sawor fancied saw for have terror of feeling stepfather slowly raise hand to level behind farfraes shoulder curious expression taking possession of face young man be quite unconscious of action be so indirect that if farfrae have observed might almost have regarded a idle outstretching of arm must have be possible by comparatively light touch to push farfrae off balance send head over heel into air elizabeth felt quite sick at heart on thinking of what might have meant a soon a turned mechanically took tea to henchard left went away reflecting endeavoured to assure that movement be idle eccentricity more yet on other hand subordinate position in establishment where once have be master might be acting on like irritant poison finally resolved to caution donald xxxiv next morning accordingly rose at five oclock went into street be not yet light dense fog prevailed

what began morning life be in hand then take take said farfrae yeve wished to long enough henchard looked down upon in silence eye met o farfraethats not true said bitterly god be witness that man ever loved a did thee at one time nowthough came here to kill ee can not hurt thee go give in chargedo what willi care nothing for what come of withdrew to back part of loft loosened arm flung in corner upon sack in abandonment of remorse farfrae regarded in silence then went to hatch descended through henchard must fain have recalled tongue failed in task young man step died on ear henchard took full measure of shame reproach scene of first acquaintance with farfrae rushed back upon himthat time when curious mixture of romance thrift in young man composition so commanded heart that farfrae must play upon a on instrument so thoroughly subdued be that remained on sack in crouching attitude unusual for man for such man womanliness sat tragically on figure of so stern piece of virility heard conversation below opening of coach house door putting in of horse took notice here stayed till thin shade thickened to opaque obscurity loft door became oblong of gray lightthe only visible shape around at length arose shook dust from clothes wearily felt way to hatch gropingly descended step till stood in yard thought highly of once murmured now hell hate despise for ever became possessed by overpowering wish to see farfrae again that night by desperate pleading to attempt well nigh impossible task of winning pardon for late mad attack a walked towards farfraes door recalled unheeded doings in yard while have lain above in sort of stupor farfrae remembered have gone to stable put horse into gig while doing so whittle have brought letter farfrae have then said that must not go towards budmouth a have intendedthat be unexpectedly summoned to weatherbury meant to call at mellstock on way thither place lying one two mile out of course must have come prepared for journey when first arrived in yard unsuspecting enmity must have driven off though in changed direction without saying word to one on have occurred between must therefore be useless to call at farfraes house till very late there be help for to wait till return though waiting be almost torture to restless self accusing soul walked about street outskirt of town lingering here there till reached stone bridge

parapet listless attention be awakened by sound of unaccustomed kind from town quarter be confusion of rhythmical noise to street added yet more confusion by encumbering with echo first incurious thought that clangour arose from town band engaged in attempt to round off memorable day in burst of evening harmony be contradicted by certain peculiarity of reverberation inexplicability did not rouse to more than cursory heed sense of degradation be too strong for admission of foreign idea leant against parapet a before xxxix when farfrae descended out of loft breathless from encounter with henchard paused at bottom to recover arrived at yard with intention of putting horse into gig men having holiday driving to village on budmouth road despite fearful struggle decided still to persevere in journey so a to recover before going indoors meeting eye of lucetta wished to consider course in case so serious when be just on point of driving off whittle arrived with note badly addressed bearing word immediate upon outside on opening be surprised to see that be unsigned contained brief request that must go to weatherbury that evening about business be conducting there farfrae knew nothing must make pressing a be bent upon going out yielded to anonymous request particularly a have call to make at mellstock must be included in same tour thereupon told whittle of change of direction in word henchard have overheard set out on way farfrae have not directed man to take message indoors whittle have not be supposed to do so on own responsibility now anonymous letter be well intentioned clumsy contrivance of longways other of farfraes men to get out of way for evening in order that satirical mummery must fall flat if be attempted by giving open information must have brought down upon head vengeance of among comrade who enjoyed boisterous old game therefore plan of sending letter recommended by indirectness for poor lucetta took protective measure believing with majority there be truth in scandal must have to bear a best might be about eight oclock lucetta be sitting in drawing room alone night have set in for more than hour have not have candle lighted for

burst upon view in act of turning out of alley just above lantern horn multitude startled saw mounted image knew what meant crossed way entered street disappeared turned back few step be lost in grave reflection finally wending way homeward by obscure river side path unable to rest there went to stepdaughter lodging be told that elizabeth jane have gone to mr farfraes like one acting in obedience to charm with nameless apprehension followed in same direction in hope of meeting roysterers having vanished disappointed in gave gentlest of pull to door bell then learnt particular of what have occurred together with doctor imperative order farfrae must be brought home how have set out to meet on budmouth road have gone to mellstock weatherbury exclaimed henchard now unspeakably grieved not budmouth way at ala for henchard have lost good name must not believe taking word a frothy utterance of recklessness though lucettas life seemed at moment to depend upon husband return being in great mental agony lest must never know unexaggerated truth of past relation with henchard messenger be despatched towards weatherbury henchard in state of bitter anxiety contrition determined to seek farfrae to end hastened down town ran along eastern road over durnover moor up hill beyond thus onward in moderate darkness of spring night till have reached second almost third hill about three mile distant in yalbury bottom plain at foot of hill listened at first nothing beyond own heart throb be to be heard slow wind making moan among mass of spruce larch of yalbury wood clothed height on hand presently there came sound of light wheel whetting felloe against newly stoned patch of road accompanied by distant glimmer of light knew be farfraes gig descending hill from indescribable personality in noise vehicle having be own till bought by scotchman at sale of effect henchard thereupon retraced step along yalbury plain gig coming up with a driver slackened speed between two plantation be point in highway near road to mellstock branched off from homeward direction by diverging to village a have intended to do farfrae might probably delay return by couple of hour soon appeared that intention be to do so still light swerving towards cuckoo lane by road aforesaid farfraes off gig lamp flashed in henchards face at same time farfrae discerned late antagonist farfraemr farfrae cried breathless henchard holding up hand farfrae allowed horse to turn several step into branch lane before pulled up then drew rein said yes over shoulder a one must towards pronounced enemy come back to casterbridge at once henchard said there something wrong at houserequiring return ive run way here on purpose to tell ye farfrae be silent at silence henchards soul sank within why have not before thought of what be only too obvious who four hour earlier have enticed farfrae into deadly wrestle stood now in darkness of late night time on lonely road inviting to come particular way where assailant might have confederate instead of going purposed way where there might be better opportunity of guarding from attack henchard must almost feel view of thing in course of passage through farfraes mind have to go to mellstock said farfrae coldly a loosened rein to move on implored henchard matter be more serious than business at mellstock isyour wife be ill can tell particular a go along very agitation abruptness of henchard increased farfraes suspicion that be ruse to decoy on to next wood where might be effectually compassed what from policy want of nerve henchard have failed to do earlier in day started horse know what think deprecated henchard running after almost bowed down with despair a perceived image of unscrupulous villainy that assumed in former friend eye be not what think cried hoarsely believe farfrae have come entirely on own wife account be in danger know more want to come man have gone other way in mistake o farfrae dont mistrust mei be wretched man heart be true to still farfrae however did distrust utterly knew wife be with child have left not long ago in perfect health henchards treachery be more credible than story have in time heard bitter irony from henchards lip there might be irony now quickened horse pace have soon risen into high country lying between there mellstock henchards spasmodic run after lending yet more substance to thought of evil purpose gig driver lessened against sky in henchards eye exertion for farfraes good have be in vain over repentant sinner at least there be to be joy in heaven cursed like le scrupulous job a vehement man will do when loses respect last mental prop under poverty to have come after time of emotional darkness of adjoining woodland shade afforded inadequate illustration presently began to walk back again along way by have arrived farfrae must at event have reason for delay upon road by seeing there when took journey homeward later on arriving at casterbridge henchard went again to farfraes house to make inquiry a soon a door opened anxious face confronted from staircase hall landing said in grievous disappointment oit be not manservant finding mistake have long since returned hope have centred upon henchard havent found said doctor yes can not tell ee henchard replied a sank down on chair within entrance cant be home for two hour hm said surgeon returning upstairs how be asked henchard of elizabeth who formed one of group in great danger father anxiety to see husband make fearfully restless poor womani fear have killed henchard regarded sympathetic speaker for few instant a if struck in new light then without further remark went out of door onward to lonely cottage so much for man rivalry thought death be to have oyster farfrae shell about elizabeth jane in midst of gloom seemed to a pin point of light have liked look on face a answered from stair there have be affection in above thing what desired now be affection from anything be good pure be not own yet for first time have faint dream that might get to like a ownif must only continue to love jopp be just going to bed when henchard got home a latter entered door jopp said be rather bad about mr farfraes illness yes said henchard shortly though little dreaming of jopps complicity in night harlequinade raising eye just sufficiently to observe jopps face be lined with anxiety somebody have called for continued jopp when henchard be shutting into own apartment kind of traveller sea captain of sort ohwho must be seemed well be doing manhad grey hair broadish face gave name message do gie attention saying henchard closed door divergence to mellstock delayed farfraes return very nearly two hour of henchards estimate among other urgent reason for presence have be need of authority to send to budmouth for second physician when at length farfrae did come back be in state bordering on distraction at misconception of henchards motif messenger be despatched to budmouth late a have grown night wore on other doctor came in small hour lucetta have be much soothed by donalds arrival seldom never left side when immediately after entry have tried to lisp out to secret so oppressed checked feeble word lest talking must be dangerous assuring there be plenty of time to tell everything up to time knew nothing of skimmington ride dangerous illness miscarriage of mr farfrae be soon rumoured through town apprehensive guess having be given a to cause by leader in exploit compunction fear threw dead silence over particular of orgie while immediately around lucetta must not venture to add to husband distress by alluding to subject what how much farfraes wife ultimately explained to of past entanglement with henchard when be alone in solitude of sad night can not be told that informed of bare fact of peculiar intimacy with corn merchant became plain from farfraes own statement in respect of subsequent conducther motive in coming to casterbridge to unite with henchardher assumed justification in abandoning when discovered reason for fearing though in truth inconsequent passion for man at first sight have most to do with method of reconciling to conscience marriage with second when be in measure committed to first to what extent spoke of thing remained farfraes secret alone besides watchman who called hour weather in casterbridge night there walked figure up down corn street hardly le frequently be henchards whose retiring to rest have proved futility a soon a attempted gave up to go hither thither make inquiry about patient now then called a much on farfraes account a on lucettas on elizabeth janes even more than on eithers shorn one by one of other interest life seemed centring on personality of stepdaughter whose presence recently must not endure to see on occasion of inquiry at lucettas be comfort to last of call be made about four oclock in morning in steely light of dawn lucifer be fading into day across durnover moor sparrow be just alighting into street hen have begun to cackle from outhouse when within few yard of farfraes saw door gently opened servant raise hand to knocker to untie piece of cloth have muffled went across sparrow in way scarcely flying up from road litter so little did believe in human aggression at so early time why do take off said henchard turned in surprise at presence did not answer for instant two recognizing said because may knock a loud a will will never hear more xli henchard went morning having now fully broke lit fire sat abstractedly beside have not sat there long when gentle footstep approached house entered passage finger tapping lightly at door henchards face brightened for knew motion to be elizabeth came into room looking wan sad have heard asked mr farfrae isdead yes

up out of settle in adjoining room must hear moving about in preparation mind ran most strongly on lucetta whose death in such fulness of life amid such cheerful hope of maternity be appallingly unexpected presently fell asleep meanwhile stepfather in outer room have set breakfast in readiness finding that dozed must not call waited on looking into fire keeping kettle boiling with house wifely care a if be honour to have in house in truth great change have come over with regard to be developing dream of future lit by filial presence a though way alone must happiness lie be disturbed by knock at door rose to open rather deprecating call from anybody just then stoutly built man stood on doorstep with alien unfamiliar air about figure bearingan air might have be called colonial by people of cosmopolitan experience be man who have asked way at peter finger henchard nodded looked inquiry good morning good morning said stranger with profuse heartiness be mr henchard be talking to

henchard without answering shook head a if be rather question for newson than for where be buried traveller inquired beside mother said henchard in same stolid tone when did die year ago more replied other without hesitation sailor continued standing henchard never looked up from floor at last newson said journey hither have be for nothing may a well go a came have served right ill trouble no longer henchard heard retreating footstep of newson upon sanded floor mechanical lifting of latch slow opening closing of door be natural to baulked dejected man did not turn head newsons shadow passed window be gone then henchard scarcely believing evidence of sens rose from seat amazed at what have done have be impulse of moment regard have lately acquired for elizabeth new sprung hope of loneliness that must be to daughter of whom must feel a proud a of actual daughter still believed to be have be stimulated by unexpected coming of newson to greedy exclusiveness in relation to so that sudden prospect of loss have caused to speak mad lie like child in pure mockery of consequence have expected question to close in round unmask fabrication in five minute yet such questioning have not come surely must come newsons departure must be momentary must learn by inquiry in town return to curse carry last treasure away hastily put on hat went out in direction that newson have taken newsons back be soon visible up road crossing bull stake henchard followed saw visitor stop at king arm where morning coach have brought waited hour for coach crossed there coach newson have come by be now about to move again newson mounted luggage be put in in few minute vehicle disappeared with have not so much a turned head be act of simple faith in henchards wordsfaith so simple a to be almost sublime young sailor who have taken susan henchard on spur of moment on faith of glance at face more than twenty year before be still living acting under form of grizzled traveller who have taken henchards word on trust so absolute a to shame a stood be elizabeth jane to remain by virtue of hardy invention of moment perhaps not for long said newson might converse with fellow traveller of whom might be casterbridge people trick must be discovered probability threw henchard into defensive attitude instead of considering how best to right wrong acquaint elizabeth father with truth at once bethought of way to keep position have accidentally won towards young woman affection grew more jealously strong with new hazard to claim to be exposed watched distant highway expecting to see newson return on foot enlightened indignant to claim child figure appeared possibly have spoken to nobody on coach buried grief in own heart griefwhat be after to henchard must feel at loss of newsons affection cooled by year must not equal who have be constantly in presence thus jealous soul speciously argued to excuse separation of father child returned to house half expecting that must have vanished there wasjust coming out from inner room mark of sleep upon eyelid exhibiting generally refreshed air o father said smiling have sooner lain down than napped though did not mean to wonder did not dream about poor mr farfrae after thinking of so did not how strange be that often dream of latest event absorbing a may be be glad have be able to sleep said taking hand with anxious proprietorshipan act gave pleasant surprise sat down to breakfast elizabeth janes thought reverted to lucetta sadness added charm to countenance whose beauty have ever lain in meditative soberness father said a soon a recalled to outspread meal be so kind of to get nice breakfast with own hand idly asleep while do day replied have left everybody have left how must live by own hand be very lonely be not ay childto degree that know nothing of be own fault be only one who have be near for week will come more why do say that indeed will if must like to see henchard signified dubiousness though have so lately hoped that elizabeth jane might again live in house a daughter must not ask to do so now newson might return at moment what elizabeth must think of for deception be best to bear apart from when have breakfasted stepdaughter still lingered till moment arrived at henchard be accustomed to go to daily work then arose with assurance of coming again soon went up hill in morning sunlight at moment heart be a warm towards a mine be towards must live with here in humble cottage for asking yet before evening probably will have come then will scorn reflection constantly repeated by henchard to accompanied everywhere through day mood be no longer that of rebellious ironical reckless misadventurer leaden gloom of one who have lost can make life interesting even tolerable there must remain nobody for to be proud of nobody to fortify for elizabeth jane must soon be a stranger worse susan farfrae lucetta elizabethall have gone from one after one by fault by misfortune in place of have interest hobby desire if must have summoned music to aid existence might even now have be borne for with henchard music be of regal power merest trumpet organ tone be enough to move high harmony transubstantiated hard fate have ordained that must be unable to call up divine spirit in need whole land ahead of be a darkness there be nothing to come nothing to wait for yet in natural course of life might possibly have to linger on earth thirty forty yearsscoffed at at best pitied thought of be unendurable to east of casterbridge lay moor meadow through much water flowed wanderer in direction who must stand still for few moment on quiet night might hear singular symphony from water a from lampless orchestra playing in sundry tone from near far part of moor at hole in rotten weir executed recitative where tributary brook fell over stone breastwork trilled cheerily under arch performed metallic cymballing at durnover hole hissed spot at instrumentation rose loudest be place called ten hatch whence during high spring there proceeded very fugue of sound river here be deep strong at time hatch on account be raised lowered by cog winch path led from second bridge over highway so often mentioned to hatch crossing stream at head by narrow plank bridge after night fall human being be seldom found going way path leading only to deep reach of stream called blackwater passage being dangerous henchard however leaving town by east road proceeded to second stone bridge thence struck into path of solitude following course beside stream till dark shape of ten hatch cut sheen thrown upon river by weak lustre still lingered in west in second two stood beside weir hole where water be at deepest looked backwards forward creature appeared in view then took off coat hat stood on brink of stream with hand clasped in front of while eye be bent on water beneath there slowly became visible something floating in circular pool formed by wash of century pool be intending to make death bed at first be indistinct by reason of shadow from bank emerged thence took shape be that of human body lying stiff stark upon surface of stream in circular current imparted by central flow form be brought forward till passed under eye then perceived with sense of horror that be not man somewhat resembling one in respect counterpart actual double be floating a if dead in ten hatch hole sense of supernatural be strong in unhappy man turned away a one might have done in actual presence of appalling miracle covered eye bowed head without looking again into stream took coat hat went slowly away presently found by door of own dwelling to surprise elizabeth jane be standing there came forward spoke called father just a before newson then have not even yet returned thought seemed very sad morning said so have come again to see not that be anything sad everybody everything seem against so know must be suffering how woman divined thing yet have not divined whole extremity said to be miracle still worked do ye think elizabeth be not read man dont know so much a must wish have tried to peruse learn life more try to know more ignorant seem dont quite think there be miracle nowadays said interference in case of desperate intention for instance well perhaps not in direct way perhaps not will come walk with will show ee what mean agreed willingly took over highway by lonely path to ten hatch walked restlessly a if haunting shade unseen of hovered round troubled glance must gladly have talked of lucetta feared to disturb when got near weir stood still asked to go forward look into pool tell what saw went soon returned to nothing said go again said henchard look narrowly proceeded to river brink second time on return after delay told that saw something floating round round there what be must not discern seemed to be bundle of old clothes be like mine asked henchard wellthey be dear mei wonder iffather let go away go look once more then will get home went back must see stoop till head be close to margin of pool started up hastened back to side well said henchard what do say now let go home tell be floating there effigy answered hastily must have thrown into river higher up amongst willow at blackwater to get rid of in alarm at discovery by magistrate must have floated down here ahto be surethe image o where be other why one only that performance of theirs killed kept alive elizabeth jane thought thought of word kept alive a slowly retraced way to town at length guessed meaning fatheri will not leave alone like cried may live with tend upon a used to do mind being poor must have agreed to come morning did not ask may come to cried bitterly elizabeth dont mock if only must come will said how will forgive roughness in former day can not have forgotten talk of more thus assured arranged plan for reunion at length went home then henchard shaved for first time during many day put on clean linen combed hair be a man resuscitated thenceforward next morning fact turned out to be a elizabeth jane have stated effigy be discovered by cowherd that of lucetta little higher up in same stream a little a possible be said of matter figure be privately destroyed despite natural solution of mystery henchard le regarded a intervention that figure must have be floating there elizabeth jane heard say who be reprobate a yet seems that even be in somebody hand xlii emotional conviction that be in somebody hand began to die out of henchards breast a time slowly removed into distance event have given that feeling apparition of newson haunted must surely return yet newson did not arrive lucetta have be borne along churchyard path casterbridge have for last time turned regard upon before proceeding to work a if have never lived elizabeth remained undisturbed in belief of relationship to henchard now shared home perhaps after newson be gone for ever in due time bereaved farfrae have learnt at least proximate cause of lucettas illness death first impulse be naturally enough to wreak vengeance in name of law upon perpetrator of mischief resolved to wait till funeral be over ere moved in matter time having come reflected disastrous a result have be be obviously in way foreseen intended by thoughtless crew who arranged motley procession tempting prospect of putting to blush people who stand at head of affairsthat supreme piquant enjoyment of who writhe under heel of samehad alone animated so far a must see for knew nothing of jopps incitement other consideration be also involved lucetta have confessed everything to before death be not altogether desirable to make much ado about history alike for sake for henchards for own to regard event a untoward accident seemed to farfrae truest consideration for dead one memory a well a best philosophy henchard mutually forbore to meet for elizabeth sake former have fettered pride sufficiently to accept small seed root business of town council headed by
