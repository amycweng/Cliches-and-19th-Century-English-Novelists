elder plan for attainment of position a farmer on extensive scaleeither in england in colony father then told that a have not be put to expense of sending angel up to cambridge have felt duty to set by sum of money year towards purchase lease of land for day that might not feel unduly slighted a far a worldly wealth go continued father will doubt stand far superior to brother in few year considerateness on old mr clares part led angel onward to other dearer subject observed to father that be then six twenty that when must start in farming business must require eye in back of head to see to matterssome one must be necessary to superintend domestic labour of establishment whilst be afield must not be well therefore for to marry father seemed to think idea not unreasonable then angel put question what kind of wife do think must be best for a thrifty hard working farmer truly christian woman who will be help comfort to in going out coming in beyond that really matter little such one can be found indeed earnest minded friend neighbour dr chant ought not primarily to be able to milk cow churn good butter make immense cheese know how to sit hen turkey rear chicken to direct field of labourer in emergency estimate value of sheep calf yes farmer wife yes certainly must be desirable mr clare elder have plainly never thought of point before be going to add said that for pure

in place of lady ecclesiastical accomplishment understands duty of farm life a well a farmer must suit infinitely better father persisted in conviction that knowledge of farmer wife duty came second to pauline view of humanity impulsive angel wishing to honour father feeling to advance cause of heart at same time grew specious said that fate providence have thrown in way woman who possessed

shortcoming for sake of quality feel may do worse than choose angel waxed quite earnest on rather automatic orthodoxy in beloved te never dreaming that might stand in such good stead have be prone to slight when observing practised by other milkmaid because of obvious unreality amid belief essentially naturalistic in sad doubt a to whether son have right to title claimed for unknown young woman mr mr clare began to feel a advantage not to be overlooked that at least be sound in view especially a conjunction of pair must have arisen by act of providence for angel never must have made orthodoxy condition of choice said finally that be better not to act in hurry that must not object to see angel therefore refrained from declaring more particular now felt that single minded sacrificing a
