other time not beautiful according to state of health spirit in simple corporeal presentment be of fair clear complexion rather pale than pink slim in build elastic in movement look expressed tendency

time what people therefore saw of in cursory view be very little in truth mainly something be not woman be shadowy conjectural creature who have little to do with outline presented to sherton eye shape in gloom whose true description must only be approximated by putting together movement now glance then in patient long continued attentiveness nothing watchful loving kindness ever trouble to give there be little delay in setting out from town marty south took advantage of to hasten forward with view of escaping on way lest must feel compelled to spoil tte tte by asking to ride walked fast one third of journey be done evening rapidly darkening before perceived sign of behind then while ascending hill dimly saw vehicle drawing near lowest part of incline head slightly bent towards other drawn together doubt by soul a head of pair of horse well in hand be drawn in by rein walked still faster between there be carriage apparently brougham coming in same direction with lighted lamp when overtook herwhich be not soon on account of pacethe scene be much darker light glared in eye sufficiently to hide detail of equipage occurred to marty that might take hold behind carriage so keep along with to save mortification of being overtaken picked up for pity sake by coming pair accordingly a carriage drew abreast of in climbing long ascent walked close to wheel ray of nearest lamp penetrating very pore have only just dropped behind when carriage stopped to surprise coachman asked over shoulder if must ride what made question more surprising be that came in obedience to order from interior of vehicle marty gladly assented for be weary very weary after working night keeping afoot day mounted beside coachman wondering why good fortune have happened to be rather great man in aspect did not like to inquire of for time at last said who have be so kind a to ask to ride mr charmond replied statuesque companion marty be stirred at name so closely connected with last night experience be carriage whispered yes shes inside marty reflected perceived that mr charmond must have recognized plodding up hill under blaze of lamp recognized probably stubbly poll since have kept

descended from cloud into tempe of parishioner must discern nothing of lady also looked for miss melbury winterborne nose of horse sometimes came quite near back of mr charmonds carriage never attempted to pas till latter conveyance turned towards park gate when sped by here carriage drew up that gate might be opened in momentary silence marty heard gentle oral sound soft a breeze whats that whispered mi yawning why must yawn oh because shes be used to such wonderfully good life find dull here shell soon be off again on account of so rich so powerful yet to yawn girl murmured then thing dont fay with more than with marty now alighted lamp again shone upon a carriage rolled on soft voice said to from interior good night good night maam said marty have not be able to see woman who began so greatly to interest herthe second person of own sex who have operated strongly on mind that day chapter vi meanwhile winterborne grace melbury have also undergone little experience of

telling story to farmer bollen to light pipe flash shone into car showed up distinctly arm flew from waist like lightning yet not so quickly that of em have seen laughed at yet father to amazement instead of being angry be mild a milk seemed quite pleased have forgot havent owned that remembered very well now that mentioned circumstance goodness must have be in short frock said come now miss melbury wont do short frock indeed know better a well a grace thereupon declared that must not argue with old friend valued so highly a valued saying word with easy elusiveness will be polite at cost might possibly be true added that be getting on in girlhood when event took place if be so then be virtually no le than old woman now so far did time seem removed from present do ever look at thing philosophically instead of personally asked cant say do answered giles eye lingering far ahead upon dark spot proved to be brougham think may sometimes with advantage said look at a pitcher drifting

advanced in soil of miss melburys mind a to lead to talk by rote of anything save of knew well have greatest interest in developingthat be to say have not proceeded far with somewhat bald narration when drew near carriage have be preceding for time miss melbury inquired if knew whose carriage be winterborne although have seen have not taken into account on examination said be mr charmonds grace

come to see very evening how doe happen to be riding there dont know be very singular thus people with converging destiny went along road together till winterborne leaving track of carriage turned into little hintock where almost first house be timber merchant pencil of dancing light streamed out of window sufficiently to show white laurestinus flower glance over polished leaf of laurel

on wall ceiling before girl have regarded room many moment presence be discovered father stepmother came out to welcome character of melbury family be of kind evinces shyness in showing strong emotion among other trait frequent in rural household one stand in curiously inverse relation to most of peculiarity distinguishing villager from people of town thus hiding warmer feeling under commonplace talk round grace reception produced extraordinary demonstration that more be felt than be enacted appeared from fact that father in taking in door quite forgot presence of giles without a did also grace said nothing took gig round to yard called out from spar house man who particularly attended to matter when there be conversation to draw off among copse worker inside winterborne then returned to door with intention of entering house family have gone into parlor be still absorbed in fire be a before only light irradiated grace face hand so a to make look wondrously smooth fair beside of two

declared to must not enter join family have forgotten be enough for to day that have brought home still be little surprised that father eagerness to send for grace must have resulted in such anticlimax a walked softly away into lane towards own house looking back when reached turning from must get last glimpse of timber merchant roof hazarded guess a to what grace be saying just at moment murmured with self derision nothing about looked also in other direction saw against sky thatched hip solitary chimney of martys cottage thought of too struggling bravely along under humble shelter

progress without presence over place where candle have be accustomed to stand when have used to read in bed till midnight hour there be still brown spot of smoke did not know that father have taken especial care to keep from being cleaned off having concluded perambulation of now uselessly commodious edifice grace began to feel that have come long journey since morning when father have be up a well a wife to see that room be comfortable fire burning prepared to retire for night sooner however be in bed than momentary sleepiness took off wished have stayed up longer amused by listening to old familiar noise that must hear to be still going on down stair by looking towards window a lay blind have be drawn up a used to have when girl must just discern dim tree top against sky on neighboring hill beneath meeting line of light shade nothing be visible save one solitary point of light blinked a tree twig waved to fro before beam from position seemed to radiate from window of

mind for instance while knowing that grace be attractive quite forgot that mr charmond have also great pretension to beauty in simple estimate attractive woman attracted around so be settled in mind that sudden mingling with villager at unlucky winterbornes be cause of most grievous loss a deemed in direction of hintock house ti thousand pity must repeat to be ruining for conscience sake be one

of life have served purpose at end of whose breathing small homestead occupied by south larger one of giles winterborne dozen others have be in possession of various hintock village family for previous hundred year be now winterbornes must fall in become part of encompassing estate yet short two month earlier martys father aged fifty five year though something of fidgety anxious being must have be looked on a man whose existence be so far removed from hazardous a in parish a bidding fair to be prolonged for quarter of century winterborne walked up down garden next day thinking of contingency sense that path be pacing cabbage plot apple tree dwelling cider cellar wring house stable weathercock be slipping away over head beneath foot a if be painted on magic lantern slide be curious in spite of john south late indisposition have not anticipated danger to inquire concerning health have be to show le sympathy than to remain silent considering material interest possessed in woodman life have accordingly made point of avoiding martys house while be here in garden somebody came to fetch be marty showed distress by unconsciousness of cropped poll father be still so much troubled in mind about tree said know tree mean mr winterborne tall one in front of house that think will blow down kill can come see if can persuade out of notion can hing accompanied to cottage conducted upstairs john south be pillowed up in chair between bed window exactly opposite latter towards face be turned ah neighbor winterborne said wouldnt have minded if life have only be own to

must if be not for treeyes tree ti thats killing there stand threatening life minute that wind do blow hell come down upon squat dead what will ye do when life on property be taken away never mind methats of consequence said giles think of alone looked out of window in direction of woodman gaze tree be tall elm familiar to from childhood stood at distance of two third own height from front of south dwelling whenever wind blew a did now tree rocked naturally enough sight of motion sound of sigh have gradually bred terrifying illusion in woodman mind that must descend kill thus must sit day in spite of persuasion watching sway listening to melancholy gregorian melody air wrung out of fear apparently be rather than organic disease be eating away health of john south a tree waved south waved head making flugel man with abject obedience ah when be quite small tree said be little boy thought one day of chopping off with hook to make clothes line prop with put off doing then again thought must forgot didnt at last got too big now ti enemy will be death o little did think when let that sapling stay that time must come when must torment dash into grave said winterborne marty soothingly thought possible that might hasten into grave though in way than by falling tell what added winterborne ill climb up afternoon shroud off lower bough then wont be so heavy wind wont affect so wont allow ita strange woman come from nobody know whereshe have done mean mr charmond oh doesnt know there such tree on estate besides shrouding be not felling ill risk that much went out when afternoon came returned took billhook from woodman shed with ladder climbed into lower part of tree where began lopping offshrouding a called at hintockthe lowest bough of quivered under attack bent cracked fell into hedge having cut away lowest tier stepped off ladder climbed few step higher attacked at next level thus ascended with progress of work far above top of ladder cutting away perch a went leaving nothing bare stem below work be troublesome for tree be large afternoon wore on turning dark misty about four oclock from time to time giles cast eye across towards bedroom window of south where by flickering fire in chamber must see old man watching sitting motionless with hand upon arm of chair beside sat marty also straining eye towards skyey field of operation curious question suddenly occurred to winterborne stopped chopping be operating on person property to prolong year of lease by whose termination that person must considerably benefit in aspect of case doubted if ought to go on on other hand be working to save man life seemed to empower to adopt arbitrary measure wind have died down to calm while be weighing circumstance saw coming along road through increasing mist figure indistinct a be knew well be grace melbury on way out from house probably for short evening walk before dark arranged for greeting from since must hardly avoid passing immediately beneath tree grace though looked up saw be just at time too full of word of father to give encouragement year long regard that have have for be not kindled by return into flame of sufficient brilliancy to make rebellious thinking that might not see cried miss melbury here be looked up again be near enough to see expression of face nail in sol silver bright with constant walking did not reply dropping glance again went on winterbornes face grew strange mused proceeded automatically with work grace meanwhile have not gone far have reached gate whereon have leaned sadly whispered to herself what will do sudden fog came on curtailed walk passing under tree again on return again addressed grace said when be close to trunk speak to shook head without stopping went on to little distance where stood observing from behind hedge coldness have be kindly meant if be to be done have said to herself must be begun at once while stood out of observation giles seemed to recognize meaning with sudden start worked on climbing higher cutting off more more from intercourse with sublunary world at last have worked so high up elm mist have so thickened that must only just be discerned a dark gray spot on light gray sky must have be altogether out of notice for stroke of billhook flight of bough downward crash upon hedge at interval be not to be done thus after plainness candor be best went back third time did not see now lingeringly gazed up at unconscious figure loath to put end to kind of hope might live on in still giles mr winterborne said be so high amid fog that did not hear mr winterborne cried again time stopped looked down replied silence just now be not accident said in unequal voice father say be best not to think too much of thatengagement understanding between that know of too think that upon whole be right be friend know giles almost relation very well answered a if without surprise in voice barely reached down tree have nothing to say in objectioni can not say anything till ive thought while added with emotion in tone for must have married yousome dayi think give way for see must be unwise made reply sat back upon bough placed elbow in fork rested head upon hand thus remained till fog night have completely enclosed from view grace heaved divided sigh with tense pause between moved onward heart feeling uncomfortably big heavy eye wet have giles instead of remaining still immediately come down from tree to must have continued in filial acquiescent frame of mind have announced to a final if be true a woman have declared that one of sex be never so much inclined to throw in lot with man for good a five minute after have told thing can not be probability be that something might have be done by appearance of winterborne on ground beside grace continued motionless silent in gloomy niflheim fog land involved proceeded on way spot seemed now to be quite deserted light from south window made ray on fog did not reach tree quarter of hour passed be blackness overhead giles have not yet come down then tree seemed to shiver then to heave sigh movement be audible winterborne dropped almost noiselessly to ground have thought matter out having returned ladder billhook to place pursued way homeward must not allow incident to affect outer conduct more than danger to leasehold have done went to bed a usual two simultaneous trouble always make double trouble thus came to pas that giless practical anxiety about house must have be enough to keep awake night at other time be displaced not reinforced by sentimental trouble about grace melbury severance be in truth more like burial of than rupture with did not realize so much at present even when arose in morning felt quite moody stern a yet second note in gamut of such emotion tender regret for loss have not made heard load of oak timber be to be sent away that morning to builder whose work be in town many mile off proud trunk be taken up from silent spot have known through budding shedding of growth for foregoing hundred year chained down like slave to heavy timber carriage with enormous red wheel four of most powerful of melburys horse be harnessed in front to draw horse wore bell that day there be sixteen to team carried on frame above animal shoulder tuned to scale so a to form two octave running from highest note on right off side of leader to lowest on left near side of shaft horse melbury be among last to retain horse bell in neighborhood for living at little hintock where lane yet remained a narrow a before day of turnpike road sound signal be still a useful to neighbor a have ever be in former time much backing be saved in course of year by warning note cast ahead moreover tone of team in district being known to carter of must tell long way off on dark night whether be about to encounter friend stranger fog of previous evening still lingered so heavily over wood that morning must not penetrate tree till long after time load being ponderous one lane crooked air so thick winterborne set out a often did to accompany team a far a corner where must turn into wider road so rumbled on shaking foundation of roadside cottage by weight of progress sixteen bell chiming harmoniously over till have risen out of valley be descending towards more open route spark rising from creaking skid nearly setting fire to dead leaf alongside then occurred one of very incident against bell be endeavor to guard suddenly there beamed into eye quite close to two lamp of carriage shorn of ray by fog approach have be quite unheard by reason of own noise carriage be covered one while behind must be discerned vehicle laden with luggage winterborne went to head of team heard coachman telling carter that must turn back carter declared that be impossible can turn if unhitch string horse said coachman be much easier for to turn than for said winterborne weve five ton of timber on wheel if weve ounce ive carriage with luggage at back winterborne admitted strength of argument even with said can back better than ought to for must hear bell mile off must see light couldnt because of fog well time precious said coachman haughtily be only going to trumpery little village other in neighborhood while be going straight to italy driving way suppose said winterborne sarcastically argument continued in term till voice from interior of carriage inquired what be matter be lady be briefly informed of timber people obstinacy then giles must hear telling footman to direct timber people to turn horse head message be brought winterborne sent bearer back to say that begged lady pardon that must not do a requested that though must not assert to be impossible be impossible by comparison with slight difficulty to party to back light carriage a fate must have incident with grace melbury on previous day made giles le gentle than might otherwise have shown confidence in sex being rudely shaken in fine nothing must move carriage be compelled to back till reached one of siding turnout constructed in bank for purpose then team came on ponderously clanging of sixteen bell a passed discomfited carriage tilted up against bank lent particularly triumphant tone to team progressa tone in point of fact did not at attach to conductor feeling giles walked behind timber just a have got past yet stationary carriage heard soft voice say who be that rude man not melbury sex of speaker be so prominent in voice winterborne felt pang of regret maam younger man in smaller way of business in little hintock winterborne be name thus parted company why mr winterborne said wagoner when be out of hearing be shemrs charmond whod have thought what in world can woman doe nothing be cock watching out here at time o day for oh going to italyyes to be sure heard be going abroad cant endure winter here winterborne be vexed at incident more so that knew mr melbury in adoration of hintock house must be first to blame if became known saying no more accompanied load to end of lane then turned back with intention to call at south to learn result of experiment of preceding evening chanced that few minute before time grace melbury who now rose soon enough to breakfast with father in spite of unwontedness of hour have be commissioned by to make same inquiry at south marty have be standing at door when miss melbury arrived almost before latter have spoken mr charmonds carriage released from obstruction up lane came bowling along two girl turned to regard spectacle mr charmond did not see there be sufficient light for to discern outline between carriage window noticeable feature in tournure be magnificent mass of braided lock how well look morning said grace forgetting mr charmonds slight in generous admiration hair so becomes worn way have never seen more beautiful have miss said marty dryly unconsciously stroking crown grace watched carriage with lingering regret till be out of sight then learned of marty that south be better before have come away winterborne approached house seeing that one of two girl standing on door step be grace suddenly turned back again sought shelter of own home till must have gone away chapter xiv encounter with carriage having sprung upon winterbornes mind image of mr charmond thought by natural channel went from to fact that several cottage other house in two hintocks now own must fall into possession in event of south death marvelled what people must have be thinking about in past to invent such precarious tenure a still more what must have induced ancestor at hintock other village people to exchange old copyhold for life lease having naturally succeeded to property through father have done best to keep in order though be much struck with father negligence in not insuring south life after breakfast still musing on circumstance went upstairs turned over bed drew out flat canvas bag lay between mattress sacking in kept lease have remained there unopened ever since father death be usual hiding place among rural lifeholders for such document winterborne sat down on bed looked over be ordinary lease for three life member of south family fifty year before time have accepted of lord of manor in lieu of certain copyhold other right in consideration of having dilapidated house rebuilt by said lord have come into father possession chiefly through mother who be south pinned to parchment of one of indenture be letter winterborne have never seen before bore remote date handwriting being that of solicitor agent signature landholder be to effect at time before last of stated life must drop mr giles winterborne senior representative must have privilege of adding own son life to life remaining on payment of merely nominal sum concession being in consequence of elder winterbornes consent to demolish one of house relinquish site stood at awkward corner of lane impeded way house have be pulled down year before why giless father have not taken advantage of privilege to insert own son life be impossible to say likelihood be that death alone have hindered in execution of project a surely be elder winterborne having be man who took much pleasure in dealing with house property in small way since one of south still survived there be not much doubt that giles must do what father have left undone a far a own life be concerned possibility cheered much for by house hung many thing melburys doubt of young man fitness to be husband of grace have be based not little on precariousness of holding in little great hintock resolved to attend to business at once fine for renewal being sum that must easily muster scheme however must not be carried out in day meanwhile must run up to south a have intended to do to learn result of experiment with tree marty met at door well marty said be surprised to read in face that case be not so hopeful a have imagined be sorry for labor said be lost say tree seems taller than ever winterborne looked round at taller tree certainly did seem gauntness of now naked stem being more marked than before quite terrified when first saw what have done to morning added declares will come down upon cleave like sword of lord of gideon well can do anything else asked doctor say tree ought to be cut down ohyouve have doctor didnt send for mr charmond before left heard that father be ill told to attend at expense be very good of say ought to be cut down mustnt cut down without knowledge suppose went up stair there old man sat staring at now gaunt tree a if gaze be frozen on to trunk unluckily tree waved afresh by time wind having sprung up blown fog away eye turned with waving heard footstepsa man of lighter type than usual there be doctor fitzpiers again said descended presently tread be heard on naked stair mr fitzpiers entered sick chamber just a doctor be more le wont to do on such occasion pre eminently when room be that of humble cottager looking round towards patient with preoccupied gaze so plainly reveals that have wellnigh forgotten about case whole circumstance since dismissed from mind at last exit from same apartment nodded to winterborne with whom be already little acquainted recalled case to thought went leisurely on to where south sat fitzpiers be on whole finely formed handsome man eye be dark impressive beamed with light either of energy of susceptivityit be difficult to say might have be little of quick glittering practical eye sharp for surface of thing for nothing beneath have not whether apparent depth of vision be real only artistic accident of corporeal moulding nothing deed must reveal face be rather soft than stern charming than grand pale than flushed noseif sketch of feature be de rigueur for person of pretensionswas artistically beautiful enough to have be worth doing in marble by sculptor not over busy be hence devoid of knotty irregularity often mean power while double cyma classical curve of mouth be not without looseness in close nevertheless from readily appreciative mien reflective manner instinct towards profound thing be said to posse presence bespoke philosopher rather than dandy macaronian effect be helped by absence of trinket other triviality from attire though be more finished up to date than be usually case among rural practitioner strict people of highly respectable class knowing little about by report might have said that seemed likely to err rather in possession of too many idea than too few to be dreamy ist of sort too deeply steeped in false kind of ism however may be will be seen that be undoubtedly somewhat rare kind of gentleman doctor to have descended a from cloud upon little hintock be extraordinary case said at last to winterborne after examining south by conversation look touch learning that craze about elm be stronger than ever come down stair ill tell what think accordingly descended doctor continued tree must be cut down wont answer for life ti mr charmonds tree suppose must get permission said giles if so a be gone away must speak to agent ohnever mind whose tree iswhats tree beside life cut down have not honor of knowing mr charmond a yet be disposed to risk that much with ti timber rejoined giles more scrupulous than must have be have not own interest stood so closely involved theyll never fell stick about here without being marked first either by agent then well inaugurate new era forthwith how long have complained of tree asked doctor of marty week week sir shape of seems to haunt like evil spirit say that be exactly own age that have got human sense sprouted up when be born on purpose

go on added hell never look anywhere else out of window scarcely have curtain drawn down with then hang mr charmond said mr fitzpiers best plan will be to wait till evening when be dark early in morning before be awake so that doesnt see fall for must terrify worse than ever keep blind down till come then ill assure show that trouble be over doctor then departed waited till evening when be dusk curtain drawn winterborne directed couple of woodman to bring crosscut saw tall threatening tree be soon nearly off at base must not fell completely then on account of possible crash next morning before south be awake went lowered cautiously in direction away from cottage be business difficult to do quite silently be done at last elm of same birth year a woodman lay stretched upon ground weakest idler that passed must now set foot on mark formerly made in upper fork by shoe of adventurous climber only once inaccessible nest must be examined microscopically on swaying extremity where bird alone have perched by stander sat down a soon a be broad daylight doctor came winterborne entered house with marty said that father be wrapped up ready a usual to be put into chair ascended stair soon seated began at once to complain of tree danger to life winterbornes house property in consequence doctor signalled to giles who went drew back printed cotton curtain ti gone see said mr fitzpiers a soon a old man saw vacant patch of sky in place of branched column so familiar to gaze sprang up speechless eye rose from hollow till white showed round fell back bluish whiteness overspread greatly alarmed put on bed a soon a came little out of fit gasped oh be gonewherewhere whole system seemed paralyzed by amazement be thunder struck at result of experiment did must nothing

satisfied at having fitzpiers a sort of guest that must have sat on for length of time grace on whom fitzpierss eye only too frequently alighted seemed to think incumbent upon to make show of going father thereupon accompanied to vehicle a doctor have helped out of appeared to think that have excellent reason for helping in performed attention lingeringly enough what be almost in tear about just

start from hintock to winter abroad in fitzpiers only change from last autumn habit lay in abandonment of night studyhis lamp never shone from new dwelling a from old if suspected one met be by such adroit contrivance even melburys vigilance must not encounter together simple call at house by doctor have nothing irregular about that have paid two three such call be certain what have passed at interview be known only to party that felice charmond be under one influence melbury soon have opportunity of perceiving winter have come on owl began to be noisy in morning evening flock of wood pigeon made prominent again one day in february about six month after marriage of fitzpiers melbury be returning from great hintock on foot through lane when saw before surgeon also walking melbury

watched fly upon dress at last said well sir what excuse for disobedience make none then go way let go mine snatched away hand touched pony with whip left standing there holding reversed glove melburys first impulse be to reveal presence to fitzpiers upbraid bitterly moment thought be sufficient to show futility of such simple proceeding there be not after so much in what have witnessed a

though with noticeable firmness letter contained in fact martys declaration that be original owner of mr charmonds supplementary lock enclosed sample from native stock have grown considerably by time be long contemplated apple of discord much hand trembled a handed document up to be impossible on account of gloom for fitzpiers to read then while have curiosity to do so put in pocket imagination having already centred on hintock house in pocket letter remained unopened forgotten while that marty be hopefully picturing excellent weaning effect upon be not long in reaching precinct of manor house drew rein under group of dark oak commanding view of front reflected while entry must not be altogether unnatural in circumstance of possible indisposition upon whole thought best to avoid riding up to door by silently approaching must retreat unobserved in event of not being alone thereupon dismounted hitched darling to stray bough hanging little below general browsing line of tree proceeded to door on foot in mean time melbury have returned from shottsford forum great court quadrangle of timber merchant house divided from shady lane by ivy covered wall be entered by two white gate one standing near extremity of wall so happened that at moment when fitzpiers be riding out at lower gate on way to manor house melbury be approaching upper gate to enter fitzpiers being in front of melbury be seen by latter surgeon never turning head did not observe father in law ambling slowly silently along under tree though horse too be gray one how be grace said wife a soon a entered melbury looked gloomy be not at all well said dont like look of at couldnt bear notion of biding away in strange place longer begged to let get home at last agreed to not till after much persuading be then sorry that rode over instead of driving have hired nice comfortable carriagethe easiest going must getand shell be here in couple of hour le rode on ahead to tell to get room ready see husband have come back yes said mr melbury expressed concern that husband have hired carriage way from shottsford what will cost said dont care what cost exclaimed testily be determined to get home why went away cant think act in way be not at likely to mend matter a far a can see grace have not told father of interview with mr charmond disclosure have be whispered in startled ear since edgar be come continued might have waited in till got home to ask how be if only for compliment saw go out where be gone mr melbury did not know positively told husband that there be not much doubt about place of first visit after absence have in fact seen fitzpiers take direction of manor house melbury said more be exasperating to just at moment when there be reason for fitzpiers to stay indoors at rate to ride along shottsford road to meet ailing wife must be doing despite to by going elsewhere old man went out of door again horse being hardly unsaddled a yet told upjohn to retighten girth when again mounted rode off at heel of surgeon by time melbury reached park be prepared to go length in combating rank reckless errantry of daughter husband must fetch home edgar fitzpiers to night by mean rough fair in view there must come of interference nothing worse than what existed at present yet to bad there be worse have entered by bridle gate admitted to park on side cantered over soft turf almost in track of fitzpierss horse till reached clump of tree under precursor have halted whitish object be indistinctly visible here in gloom of bough found to be darling a left by fitzpiers dn why did not ride up to house in honest way said melbury profited by fitzpierss example dismounting tied horse under adjoining tree went on to house on foot a other have done be no longer disposed to stick at trifle in investigation did not hesitate to gently open front door without ringing large square hall with oak floor staircase wainscot be lighted by dim lamp hanging from beam not soul be visible went into corridor listened at door knew to be that of drawing room there be sound on turning handle found room empty fire burning low in grate be sole light of apartment beam flashed mockingly on somewhat showy versaillese furniture gilding here in style a unlike of structural part of building a be possible to be probably introduced by felice to counteract fine old english gloom of place disappointed in hope of confronting son in law here went on to dining room be without light fire pervaded by cold atmosphere signified that have not dined there day by time melburys mood have little mollified everything here be so pacific so unaggressive in repose that be no longer incited to provoke collision with fitzpiers with anybody comparative stateliness of apartment influenced to emotion rather than to belief where be outwardly so good proper there must not be quite delinquency within have suspected occurred to too that even if suspicion be justified abrupt if not unwarrantable entry into house might end in confounding inhabitant at expense of daughter dignity own ill result must be pretty sure to hit grace hardest in long run must after adopt more rational course plead with fitzpiers privately a have pleaded with mr charmond accordingly retreated a silently a have come passing door of drawing room anew fancied that heard noise within be not crackling of fire melbury gently reopened door to distance of few inch saw at opposite window two figure in act of stepping outa man womanin whom recognized lady of house son in law in moment have disappeared amid gloom of lawn returned into hall let out by carriage entrance door coming round to lawn front in time to see two figure parting at railing divided precinct of house from open park mr charmond turned to hasten back immediately that fitzpiers have left side be speedily absorbed into duskiness of tree melbury waited till mr charmond have re entered drawing room then followed after fitzpiers thinking that must allow latter to mount ride ahead little way before overtaking giving piece of mind son in law might possibly see second horse near own must do harm might prepare for what be to expect event however be different from plan on plunging into thick shade of clump of oak must not perceive horse blossom anywhere feeling way carefully along by by discerned fitzpierss mare darling still standing a before under adjoining tree for moment melbury thought that own horse being young strong have broken away from fastening on listening intently must hear ambling comfortably along little way ahead creaking of saddle showed that have rider walking on a far a small gate in corner of park met laborer who in reply to melburys inquiry if have seen person on gray horse said that have only met dr fitzpiers be just what melbury have begun to suspect fitzpiers have mounted mare did not belong to in mistake for ownan oversight easily explicable in man ever unwitting in horse flesh by darkness of spot near similarity of animal in appearance though melburys be readily enough seen to be grayer horse by day hastened back did what seemed best in circumstancesgot upon old darling rode rapidly after fitzpiers melbury have just entered wood be winding along cart way led through channelled deep in leaf mould with large rut be formed by timber wagon in fetching spoil of plantation when at once descried in front at point where road took turning round large chestnut tree form of own horse blossom at melbury quickened darling pace thinking to come up with fitzpiers nearer view revealed that horse have rider at melburys approach galloped friskily away under tree in homeward direction thinking something be wrong timber merchant dismounted a soon a reached chestnut after feeling about for minute two discovered fitzpiers lying on ground herehelp cried latter a soon a felt touch have be thrown off there not much harm done think since melbury must not now very well read younger man lecture have intended a friendliness must be hypocrisy instinct be to speak not single word to son in law raised fitzpiers into sitting posture found that be little stunned stupefied a have said not otherwise hurt how fall have come about be readily conjecturable fitzpiers imagining there be only old darling under have be taken unawares by younger horse sprightliness melbury be traveller of old fashioned sort having just come from shottsford forum still have in pocket pilgrim flask of rum always carried on journey exceeding dozen mile though seldom drank much of poured down surgeon throat with such effect that quickly revived melbury got on leg question be what to do with must not walk more than few step other horse have gone away with great exertion melbury contrived to get astride darling mounting behind holding fitzpiers round waist with one arm darling being broad straight backed high in withers be well able to carry double at rate a far a hintock at gentle pace chapter xxxv mare paced along with firm cautious tread through copse where winterborne have worked into heavier soil where oak grew past great willy largest oak in wood thence towards nellcombe bottom intensely dark now with overgrowth popularly supposed to be haunted by spirit of fratricide exorcised from hintock house by time fitzpiers be quite recovered a to physical strength have eaten nothing since making hasty breakfast in london that morning anxiety about felice having hurried away from home before dining a consequence old rum administered by father in law flew to young man head loosened tongue without ever having recognized who be that have lent kindly hand began to speak in desultory sentence melbury still supporting ive come way from london to day said fitzpiers ah thats place to meet equal live

miserable little hole like hintock indeed muttered melbury fitzpiers increasingly energized by alcohol here reared up suddenly from bowed posture have hitherto held thrusting shoulder so violently against melburys breast a to make difficult for old man to keep hold on rein people dont appreciate here surgeon exclaimed lowering voice added softly slowly except oneexcept onea passionate soul a warm a be clever a beautiful a be warm a rich a be beautiful say old fellow claw of yours clutch rather tightrather like eagle know ate out liver of proprethe man on mount caucasus people dont appreciate say except ah god be unlucky man must have be mine must have taken name unfortunately can not be so stooped to mate beneath now rue position be becoming very trying one for melbury corporeally mentally be obliged to steady fitzpiers with left arm began to hate contact hardly knew what to do be useless to remonstrate with fitzpiers in intellectual confusion from rum from fall remained silent hold upon companion however being stern rather than compassionate hurt little farmerthough be much obliged to for kindness people dont appreciate say between ourselves be losing

come to pas that must not refuse while with fortune dont covet for must have chance of satisfying honorable ambitiona chance have never have yet now never never will have probably melbury heart throbbing against others backbone brain on fire with indignation ventured to mutter huskily why horse ambled on step before fitzpiers replied because be tied bound to by law a tightly a be to by armnot that complain of armi thank for helping well where be not nearly home yethome say be home when might have be at other house over there in stupefied way flung hand in direction of park be just

little two month there be chance for now in world make recklessreckless unless indeed anything must happen to other one be amiable enough if anything must happen to herand hear be illwell if must must be freeand fame happiness must be insured be last word that fitzpiers uttered in seat in front of timber merchant unable longer to master melbury skin of face compressed whipped away spare arm from fitzpierss waist seized by collar heartless villainafter that have done for ye cried with quivering lip money of hers youve have roof weve provided to shelter ye be to george melbury that dare to talk like exclamation be accompanied by powerful swing from shoulder flung young man head long into road fitzpiers fell with heavy thud upon stump of undergrowth have be cut during winter preceding darling continued walk for few pace farther stopped god forgive melbury murmured repenting of what have done tried too sorely now perhaps ive murdered turned round in saddle looked towards spot on fitzpiers have fallen to great surprise beheld surgeon rise to foot with bound a if unhurt walk away rapidly under tree melbury listened till rustle of fitzpierss footstep died away might have be crime for mercy of providence in providing leaf for fall said to then mind reverted to word of fitzpiers indignation so mounted within that almost wished fall have put end to young man there then have not ridden far when discerned own gray mare standing under bush leaving darling for moment melbury went forward easily caught younger animal now disheartened at freak then made pair of fast to tree

little horny scroll have once be leaf must not find stood still listening looking round breeze be oozing through network of bough a through strainer trunk larger branch stood against light of sky in form of writhing men gigantic candelabra pike halberd lance besides fancy chose to make of giving up search melbury came back to horse walked slowly homeward leading one in hand happened that on self same evening boy have be returning from great to little hintock about time of fitzpierss melburys passage home along route horse collar have be left at harness mender to be repaired be required for use at five oclock next morning in consequence boy have to fetch overnight put head through collar accompanied walk by whistling one tune knew a antidote to fear boy suddenly became aware of horse trotting rather friskily along track behind not knowing whether to expect friend foe prudence suggested that must cease whistling retreat among tree till horse rider have gone by course to be still more inclined when found how noiselessly approached saw that horse looked pale remembered what have read about death in revelation therefore deposited collar by tree hid behind horseman came on youth whose eye be a keen a telescope to great relief recognized doctor a melbury surmised fitzpiers have in darkness taken blossom for darling have not discovered mistake when came up opposite boy though be somewhat surprised at liveliness of usually placid mare only other pair of eye on spot whose vision be keen a young carter be of horse with strongly conservative objection to unusual animal show blossom on eying collar under treequite invisible to fitzpiersexercised none of patience of older horse shied sufficiently to unseat so second rate equestrian a surgeon fell did not move lying a

resist ex lawyer clerk entered inn here sat down to rum melbury paid for a matter of course beaucock leaning back in settle with legal gravity must hardly allow to be conscious of spirit before though nevertheless disappeared with mysterious quickness how much of exaggerated information on then new divorce law beaucock imparted to listener be result of ignorance how much of dupery be never ascertained related plausible story of ease with grace must become free woman that father be irradiated with project though scarcely wetted lip melbury never knew how came out of inn when where mounted gig to pursue way homeward home found brain having way seemed to ring sonorously a gong in intensity of stir before have seen grace be accidentally met by winterborne who found face shining a if have like law giver conversed with angel relinquished horse took winterborne by arm to heap of rendlewoodas barked oak be here calledwhich lay under privet hedge giles said when have sat down upon

have learned of new legal remedy subdued tremulousness about mouth be response winterborne made melbury added boy will have yetif want feeling have gathered volume a said articulate sound of old idea drowned sight in mist be sureabout new law asked winterborne so disquieted by gigantic exultation loomed alternately with fearful doubt that evaded full acceptance of melburys last statement melbury said that have manner of doubt for since talk with beaucock have come into mind that have seen time ago in weekly paper allusion to legal change having interest in desperate remedy at moment have passed over im not going to let matter rest doubtful for single day continued be going to london beaucock will go with will get best advice a soon a possibly can beaucock be thorough lawyernothing

going fellow maintained abeyant mood not from want of reciprocity from taciturn hesitancy taught by life a knew continued timber merchant temporary crease two of anxiety supplementing already established in forehead by time care grace be not at well nothing constitutional know have be in low nervous state ever since night of fright dont doubt that will be right sooni wonder how be evening rose with word a if have too long forgotten personality in excitement of previsioned career have sat till evening be beginning to dye garden brown now went towards melburys house giles few step in rear of old friend who be stimulated by enthusiasm of moment to outstep ordinary walking of winterborne felt shy of entering grace presence a reconstituted loverwhich be how father manner must be sure to present himbefore definite information a to future state be forthcoming seemed too nearly like act of who rush in where angel fear to tread chill to counterbalance glowing promise of day be prompt enough in coming sooner have followed timber merchant in at door than heard grammer inform that mr fitzpiers be still more unwell than have be in morning old dr jones being in neighborhood have called in have instantly directed to get to bed be not however to consider illness seriousa feverish nervous attack result of recent event be what be suffering from must doubtless be well in few day winterborne therefore did not remain hope of seeing that evening be disappointed even aggravation of morning condition did not greatly depress melbury knew said that daughter constitution be sound enough be only domestic trouble be pulling down once free must be blooming again melbury diagnosed rightly a parent usually do set out for london next morning jones having paid visit assured that might leave home without uneasiness especially on errand of sort must sooner put end to suspense timber merchant have be away only day two when be told in hintock that mr fitzpierss have be found in wood later on in afternoon hat be brought to melbury by piece of ill fortune into grace presence have doubtless lain in wood ever since fall from horse looked so clean uninjuredthe summer weather leafy shelter having much favored preservationthat grace must not believe have remained so long concealed very little of fact be enough to set fevered fancy at work at juncture thought still in neighborhood feared sudden appearance nervous malady developed consequence so grave dr jones began to look serious household be alarmed be beginning of june cuckoo at time of summer scarcely ceased cry for more than two three hour during night bird note so familiar to ear from infancy be now absolute torture to poor girl on friday following wednesday of melburys departure day after discovery of fitzpierss hat cuckoo began at two oclock in morning with sudden cry from one of melburys apple tree not three yard from window of grace room oh be coming cried in terror sprang clean from bed out upon floor start fright continued till noon when doctor have arrived have seen have talked with mr melbury sat down meditated that ever present terror be indispensable to remove from mind at hazard thought how might be done without saying word to anybody in house to disquieted winterborne waiting in lane below dr jones went home wrote to mr melbury at london address have obtained from wife gist of communication be that mr fitzpiers must be assured a soon a possible that step be being taken to sever bond be becoming torture to that must soon be free be even then virtually so if can say at once may be mean of averting much harm said write to not to on saturday drove over to hintock assured with mysterious pacification that in day two might expect to receive assuring news so turned out when sunday morning came there be letter for grace from father arrived at seven oclock usual time at toddling postman passed by hintock at eight grace awoke having slept hour two for wonder mr melbury brought up letter can open said oh yes yes said grace with feeble impatience tore envelope unfolded sheet read when creeping blush tinctured white neck cheek father have exercised bold discretion informed that need have further concern about fitzpierss return that must shortly be free woman therefore if must desire to wed old loverwhich trusted be case since be own deep wishshe must be in position to do so in melbury have not written beyond belief very much stretched fact in adding that legal formality for dissolving union be practically settled truth be that on arrival of doctor letter poor melbury have be much agitated must with difficulty be prevented by beaucock from returning to bedside what be use of rushing back to hintock beaucock have asked only thing must do good be breaking of bond though have not a yet have interview with eminent solicitor be about to consult be on point of seeing case be clear enough thus simple melbury urged by parental alarm at danger by representation of companion by doctor letter have yielded sat down to tell roundly that be virtually free youd better write also to gentleman suggested beaucock who scenting notoriety germ of large practice in case wished to commit melbury to irretrievably to effect knew that nothing must be so potent a awakening passion of grace for winterborne so that father might not have heart to withdraw from attempt to make love legitimate when discovered that there be difficulty in way nervous impatient melbury be much pleased with idea of starting at once a called to put long delayed reparative scheme in train have become passion with now added to letter addressed to daughter passage hinting that ought to begin to encourage winterborne lest must lose altogether wrote to giles that path be virtually open for at last life be short declared there be slip betwixt cup lip interest in must be reawakened at once that might be ready when good time came for uniting chapter xxxviii at warm word winterborne be not le dazed than be moved in heart novelty of avowal rendered what carried with inapprehensible by in entirety only few short month ago completely estranged from familybeholding grace going to fro in distance clothed with alienating radiance of obvious superiority wife of then popular fashionable fitzpiers hopelessly outside social boundary down to so recent time that flower then folded be hardly faded yethe be now asked by jealously guarding father of hers to take courageto get ready for day when must be able to claim old time came back to in dim procession how have be snubbed how melbury have despised christmas party how sweet coy grace have looked down upon household arrangement poor creedles contrivance well must not believe surely adamantine barrier of marriage

professional man must ever be wife of such a since date of rejection have almost grown to see reasonableness of treatment have said to again again that father be right that poor ceorl giles must never have be able to make such dainty girl happy yet now that have stood in position farther removed from own than at first be asked to prepare to woo be full of doubt nevertheless be not in to show backwardness to act so promptly a melbury desired to act seemed indeed scarcely wise because of uncertainty of event giles knew nothing of legal procedure did know for to step up to grace a lover before bond bound be actually dissolved be simply extravagant dream of father overstrained mind pitied melbury for almost childish enthusiasm saw that aging man must have suffered acutely to be weakened to unreasoning desire winterborne be far too magnanimous to harbor cynical conjecture that timber merchant in intense affection for grace be courting now because young lady when disunited must be left in anomalous position to escape bad husband be better than none felt quite sure that old friend be simply on tenterhook of anxiety to repair almost irreparable error of dividing two whom nature have striven to join together in earlier day in ardor to do be oblivious of formality cautious supervision of past year have overleaped at last hence winterborne perceived that in new beginning necessary care not to compromise grace by too early advance must be exercised by perhaps winterborne be not quite so ardent a heretofore there be such thing a stationary love men be loving more loving le giles recognized decline in sense of dearness if flame did indeed burn lower now than when have fetched from sherton at last return from school marvel be small have be laboring ever since rejection

god in alternation sometimes leafy smeared with green lichen a have seen among sappy bough of plantation sometimes cider stained with apple pip in hair of arm a have met on return from cider making in white hart vale with vat press beside in secret heart almost approximated to father enthusiasm in wishing to show giles once for how still regarded question whether future must indeed bring together for life be standing wonder with knew that must not with propriety do so just yet reverently believing in father sound judgment knowledge a good girl be wont to do remembered what have written about giving hint to winterborne lest there must be risk in delay feeling be not averse to step so far a must be done without danger at early stage of proceeding from being frail phantom of former equable self returned in bound to condition of passable philosophy bloomed again in face in course of few day be well enough to go about a usual one day mr melbury proposed that for change must be driven in gig to sherton market whither melburys man be going on other errand grace have business whatever in sherton crossed mind that winterborne must probably be there made thought of such drive interesting on way saw nothing of when horse be walking slowly through obstruction of sheep street discerned young man on pavement thought of time when have be standing under apple tree on return from school of tender opportunity then missed through fastidiousness heart rose in throat abjured such fastidiousness now did forget last occasion on have beheld in town making cider in court yard of earl of wessex

sat down not soul be in building save regarded stained window with head sideways tentatively asked if remembered last time be in town alone remembered perfectly remarked be proud miss then a dainty a be high perhaps be now grace slowly shook head affliction have taken out of answered impressively perhaps be too far other way now a there be something lurking in that must not explain added so quickly a not to allow time to think of have father written to at yes said winterborne glanced ponderingly up at not about yes mouth be lined with charactery told that have be bidden to take hint a to future have be bidden to give unexpected discovery sent scarlet pulsation through grace for moment however be only giles who stood there of whom have fear self possession returned said be to sound with view towhat will understand if care to continued winterborne in low voice having be put on track by herself be not disposed to abandon in hurry have be child together there be between familiarity a to personal affair only such acquaintanceship can give know giles answered speaking in very practical tone that be very well be in very anomalous position at present can not say anything to point about such thing a no said with stray air a regarded subject be looking at with curious consciousness of discovery have not be imagining that renewed intercourse must show to thus for first time realized unexpectedness in after must not have be unexpected before be not girl grace melbury whom used to know of course might easily have prefigured a much have never occurred to be woman who have be married have moved on without having lost girlish modesty have lost girlish shyness inevitable change though known to have not be heeded struck into momentary fixity truth be that have never come into close comradeship with since engagement to fitzpiers with brief exception of evening encounter on rubdown hill when met with cider apparatus that interview have be of too cursory kind for insight winterborne have advanced too must criticise time have be when to criticise single trait in grace melbury must have lain a far beyond power a to criticise deity thing be sure be new woman in many way whom have come out to see creature of more idea more dignity above more assurance than original grace have be capable of must not at first decide whether be pleased displeased at upon whole novelty attracted be so sweet sensitive that feared silence betokened something in brain of nature of enemy to what be thinking of make line come in forehead asked did not mean to offend by speaking of time being premature a yet touched by genuine loving kindness have lain at foundation of word much moved winterborne turned face aside a took by hand be grieved that have criticised be very good dear grace said in low voice be better much better than used to be how must not very well tell how said with evasive smile be prettier be not what really have meant then remained still holding right hand in own right so that faced in opposite way a did not let go ventured upon tender remonstrance think have gone a far a ought to go at presentand far enough to satisfy poor father that be same a ever see giles

butought to allow youoh be too quicksurely eye filled with tear of bewildered alarmed emotion winterborne be too straightforward to influence further against better judgment yesi suppose be said

in false position towards grace in belief of coming success news be in sum that fitzpierss conduct have not be sufficiently cruel to grace to enable to snap bond be apparently doomed to be wife till end of chapter winterborne quite forgot superficial difference with poor girl under warm rush of deep distracting love for almost tragical information engendered to renounce foreverthat be then end of for after there be longer question about suitability room for tiff on petty taste curtain have fallen again between must not be cruelty of late revived hope be now terrible how must have be so simple a to suppose thing must be done be at moment that hearing one coming behind turned saw hastening on between thicket perceived in instant that did not know blighting news giles why didnt come across to asked with arch reproach didnt see sitting there ever so long oh yes said in unprepared extemporized tone for unexpected presence caught without slightest plan of behavior in conjuncture manner made think that have be too chiding in speech mild scarlet wave passed over a resolved to soften have have letter from father hastened to continue think may come home evening andin view of hopesit will grieve if there be little difference between giles there be none said sadly regarding from face downward a pondered how to lay cruel truth bare stilli fear have not quite forgiven about being uncomfortable at inn have grace im sure speak in quite unhappy way returned coming up close to with most winning of many pretty air appertained to dont think will ever be happy giles did not reply for instant when sun shine on north front of sherton abbeythats when happiness will come to said staring a be into earth butthen mean that there be something more than offending in not liking three tun if

father be coming home said gladly winterborne though fighting valiantly against whilethough must have protected grace good repute a apple of eyewas man a desdemona said men be not god in face of agonizing seductiveness shown by in unenlightened school girl simplicity about law ordinance betrayed man weakness since be sosince have come to grace deeming free to do be virtually asking to

tear in spite of oh why doe not father come home explain sobbed let know clearly what be be too trying to ask toand then to leave so long in so vague state know what to do perhaps do wrong winterborne felt like very cain over above previous sorrow how have sinned against in not telling what knew turned aside feeling of cruelty mounted higher higher how must have dreamed of kissing must hardly refrain from tear surely nothing more pitiable have ever be known than condition of poor young thing now a heretofore victim of father well meant blundering policy even in hour of melburys greatest assurance winterborne have harbored suspicion that law new old must undo grace marriage without appearance in public though be not sufficiently sure of what might have be enacted to destroy by own word pleasing idea that mere dash of pen on father testimony be going to be sufficient have never suspected sad fact that position be irremediable poor grace perhaps feeling that have indulged in too much fluster for mere kiss calmed at finding how grave be be glad be friend again anyhow said smiling through tear giles if have only shown boldness before married that show now must have carried off for own first instead of second if do marry hope will never think badly of for encouraging little father be so impatient know a year infirmity increase that will wish to see little advanced when come that be only excuse to winterborne be sadder than be sweet how must so trust father conjecture did not know how to tell truth shame yet felt that must be done may have be wrong began almost fearfully

loved will go to grave together great hintock church stood at upper part of village must be reached without passing through street in dusk of late september day went thither by secret way walking mostly in silence side by side busied with own thought grace have trouble exceeding martysthat haunting sense of having put out light of life by own hasty doings have tried to persuade that might have died of illness even if have not taken possession of house sometimes succeeded in attempt sometimes did not stood by grave together though sun have gone down must see over woodland for mile down to vale in have be accustomed to descend year with portable mill press to make cider about time perhaps grace first grief discovery that if have lived must never have claimed have power in softening second on martys part there be same consideration never must have be a anticipation of gratified affection have be in existence while be with there be none to be disappointed now that have gone grace be abased when by degree found that have never understood giles a marty have done marty south alone of woman in hintock world have approximated to winterbornes level of intelligent intercourse with

even father though came nearest knowingthe tongue of tree fruit flower must indulge in mournful fancy like to marty hard core to griefwhich martys have notremained have be sure that giless death resulted entirely from exposure must have driven well nigh to insanity there be always that bare possibility that exposure have only precipitated what be inevitable longed to believe that have not done even there be only one man whose opinion on circumstance must be at disposed to trust husband be that man yet to ask must be necessary to detail true condition in winterborne have lived during three four critical day followed flight in withdrawing original defiant announcement on point there seemed weakness did not care to show never doubted that fitzpiers must believe if made clean confession of actual situation to volunteer correction must seem like signalling for truce that in present frame of mind be what did not feel need of will probably not appear surprising statement after what have be already declared of fitzpiers that man whom grace fidelity must not keep faithful be stung into passionate throb of interest concerning by avowal of contrary declared to that have never known dangerously full compass if be capable of such reprisal melancholy a may be to admit fact own humiliation regret engendered smouldering admiration of passed month two of great misery at exbury place to have retiredquite a much misery indeed a grace must have known of must have be inclined to inflict upon living creature how much soever might have wronged then sudden hope dawned upon wondered if affirmation be true asked whether be not act of woman whose natural purity innocence have blinded to contingency of such announcement wide experience of sex have taught that in many case woman who ventured on hazardous matter did so because lacked imagination sensuous enough to feel full force in light grace bold avowal might merely have denoted desperation of one who be child to reality of obliquity fitzpierss mental suffering suspense led at last to take melancholy journey to neighborhood of little hintock here hovered for hour around scene of purest emotional experience

musingly after there be confidence between themsuch confidence a there have never be before marty be shy indeed of speaking about letter motif in writing thanked warmly for promise of cider press must travel with in autumn season a have done said must be quite strong enough with old creedle a assistant ah there be one nearer to than said fitzpiers referring to winterborne one who lived where lived be with when died then marty suspecting that did not know true circumstance from fact that mr fitzpiers be living apart told of giless generosity to grace in giving up house to at risk possibly sacrifice of own life when surgeon heard almost envied giles chivalrous character expressed wish to marty that visit to must be kept secret went home thoughtful feeling that in more that one sense journey to hintock have not be in vain must have given much to win grace forgiveness then whatever dared hope for in kind from future there be nothing to be done yet while giles winterbornes memory be green to wait be imperative little time might melt frozen thought lead to look on with toleration if not with love chapter xlv week month of mourning for winterborne have be passed by grace in soothing monotony of memorial act to marty have devoted twice week pair went in dusk to great hintock like two mourner in cymbeline sweetened sad grave with flower tear sometimes grace thought that be
