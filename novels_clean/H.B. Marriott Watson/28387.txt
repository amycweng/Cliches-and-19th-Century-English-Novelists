to hell if want to shook off hand roughly may tell said in a cool tone a must assume that be going straight on deck to captain to retail conversation have therefore probably about ten minute left for reflection hope will bring consolation holgate got up without undue haste threw open large port through streamed clamour of water guess have misunderstood said quietly be often make mistake lifted lip in grin must see horrid tier of teeth seemed to have grown together like concrete in one huge fang be in power dr phillimore to blow brain out here now noise of sea must cover report fingered pistol now perceived in hand outside yonder be grave tell tale dead rise up never from sea by thunder port open be half in mind threw weapon carelessly upon bunk laughed look be how value be mighty

one way will will have value out of way if only to pay back self respect be safe from pistol shark go do what will will wait for lay for chummie stood listening to remarkable tirade be offered in voice by mean angry even something contemptuous without word left went a have promised at once to captain whom found in cabin with volume of de quincey well doctor said laying down book anything amiss face be portentous yes sir answered motioned to chair waited suppose be aware sir that have on board prince frederic of hochburg sister began indeed be nothing of sort said sharply what on earth be nonsense if have not have such important information to lay before might have be abashed a be proceeded well sir be fact mr morland be prince have known day must have held tongue for imperative necessity mr pye know mr holgate be most astounding began paced nervously about cabin say mr holgate because come about pursued have just made most shameless barefaced proposal amount to plot to wreck ship make off with prince property be supposed to amount to great deal captain day sat down heavily upon soul dr phillimore said will begin to ask whether be who be mad be exactly sort of question asked few minute ago replied have be able to answer only on supposition that third officer be amazing scoundrel there be pause of moment during studied face at last went to bell very well said more calmly can settle one way suppose when steward appeared ask mr holgate to come to at once sat down again fidgeted with book opened endeavoured to read glanced at in perplexed fashion a if distrusted eyesight so remained without word until knock announced one at door next moment holgate large placid respectful be in cabin mr holgate said captain day in most particular voice have just heard most remarkable statement by dr phillimore perhaps will be good enough to repeat dr phillimore glanced askew at did so bluntly man said have proposed to within last ten minute must join plot to cast away ship seize property of of mr morland day looked at third officer hear mr holgate said what have to say broad smile passed over holgate fat face yes sir said coolly be just a dr phillimore say whole thing be mere spoof must be glad if must explain said day icily well doctor not exactly correct said holgate still smiling have vast impudence to smile at for what proposed be to seize property of prince frederic of hochburg think be ah said day letting exclamation escape softly through lip cast nervous glance at see sir doctor have got cock bull tale into head went on holgate easily about mr morland being prince frederic lady know whom so suggested that being so must take care of prince million for get tidy sum round daresay be very funny joke indeed thought must have seen through along suppose did doctor rather serious started up captain day said man lie proposal be serious enough know mr morland be prince frederic must advise to ask mr pye so be said day with gesture of helplessness thus pye be summoned to strange conclave day took up book again pray sit down mr holgate said politely be not criminal dock yet seemed to augur badly for case little clerk on entering fixed glass on nose more firmly with two finger cast inquisitive look at mr pye said captain in impeccable distant voice be informed that mr morland be not mr morland one else have be referred to be so pye glanced at mr morland be name of gentleman for whom firm be acting said suavely not one else said day not according to knowledge said clerk not according to instruction sir burst out indignantly know fact be certain if not can prove point readily enough point be said day drily whether mr holgate be guilty of extraordinary charge have preferred well sir be material that acquainted with identity of mr morland in mr pye presence replied hotly feeling ground moving from under day looked at pye be true sir said clerk dr phillimore stated in presence that have discovered that mr morland be think said prince frederic of hochburg day be silent think be pretty much mare nest said presently really know why must have be bothered with be furious with pye idea a conceived of legal discretion very well sir said somewhat sullenly turned to go when door of cabin opened there entered sir john barraclough with customary insouciance seems sir john said day in ironic tone that not only have honour of distinguished baronet a first officer also prince a cargo there be a have gathered little love between captain first officer barraclough laughed oh have just tumbled to said wonder how be bound to leak out time never saw man more astonished than day leapt to foot good god said seem to be only one who doe know what be going on in ship be part of jest barraclough in turn showed surprise be holgate spoke be true sir john ca be true cried opening mouth so that horrid tooth demonstrated barraclough looked at pye who be mum suppose gentleman be responsible for news said sir have said nothing retorted pye ca pretend to judge other profession than own said captain stormily be inclined to think might have be taken into confidence think where place heaven man what be in ship think mr morland perhaps have better answer that question suggested barraclough with little sneer day moved paper with hand trembled will do then said shortly good evening gentleman have desire to detain longer said silence dr phillimore command ship cried angrily at least be supposed to can settle difference with mr holgate elsewhere shrugged shoulder left cabin very angry man in vanity fool have refused to consider charge yet when looked at business more deliberately from little distance must not deny day have excuse holgate story be remarkably natural captain must judge of third officer incredulity by own must be therefore willing to accept story of spoof then have not seen holgate face have not heard holgate even be staggered by turn thing have taken though infuriated by treatment did good to see holgate face smiling at a went down gangway oh doctor doctor be scotchman whispered at must have turned on savagely held in passed on be silent have always found value of caution chapter v wounded man well whole affair have be considerable farce in have played most humiliating part indeed for interposition of barraclough must have come out of butt of shaft a be be sensitive in regard to position more than once be tempted to see a must have appeared to others after have not gone through scene with holgate be not witness to astounding perfidy be angry with one with with captain above with little pye in universal surprise came of discovery of mr morland identity shame so to speak be covered felt mark of ridicule from holgate cynical smile to captain open neglect of turned on lawyer clerk in fury gave home truth about solicitor way to however listened unabashed doctor said do suppose man in position be own master be welcome to know what will about own affair have professional secret to guard what must be thought of have come aboard blabbing of firm client fore aft must have be betrayal of confidence there be of course something in argument did not allay irritation merely directed elsewhere so that began upon third mate heard quietly mr holgate can answer for replied seems to if may say so without offence doctor that be misinterpreting somewhat elaborate joke mr holgate explanation be reasonable enough besides only other explanation be monstrous inconceivable agree with said shortly so say no more cast shrewd glance at made comment now be quite conceivable that holgate must have made derisive object in ship on contrary did nothing of sort charge have made against did not leak out at mess table day holgate pye be aware of so far a know went further somewhat astonished until have light thrown upon later in meantime wondered insensibly significant silence began to modify attitude have known in fulness of disposition must probably have spoken a be have other plan to follow one of seemed to include reconciliation with quizzical smile disappeared shook head at solemnly at table doctor said that scotchman head be not scotchman retorted impatiently well breathed heavily will admit be very bad joke be on point of replying that be not joke at when recovered temper after be trying to temper to sit opposite to man whom know to be prime ruffian however impotent aspiration may be since have unveiled plot even though credence be given still holgate be harmless a have already said be man of precaution held tongue think have taken only for man of impulse must confess see joke answered now come to insist on shed cold light of reason on more do said with laugh joke be very well behind footlights shrugged shoulder think what fool look said coldly friendliness increased dear fellow said bending over to give word have held tongue thought of did know 'd take so seriously profession must have be stage answered nodded low comedian wish have make good salary believe instead of beggarly oh have prince boodle said lightly laughed so have will be hanged if apologise said have suffered enough from mistake quite right doctor said gravely must not apologise to bishop let alone third officer with apparent advance to understanding parted did not set eye on again until abrupt event brought about conference in cabin if personal appearance on matter did not get out at least tale of prince identity passed swiftly from mouth to mouth whole ship company be agog with interest interest increased during next two day sir john barraclough expressed to opinion of day behaviour very roundly for captain have icily withdrawn into spoke a little a possible to first officer man fool to take way phillimore said doe suppose be doing happened to know of course be not secret too be pye excuse for silence be obviously adequate a baronet evidence of friendliness be thus betrayed in confidence to ventured on question be not really inquisitive oh well see have known prince off on time yachted together before lost money gave chance be good sort with bluff british indifference terminated conversation think that mysterious aloofness of passenger served to keep interest warm have mr morland party descended be on show so to say before company be probable that bloom of surprise must have worn off with contact kept to hurricane deck morning afternoon prince sister took prolonged walk together at time be joined by patient who however in better weather be enjoying reclined in chair took sun on occasion mr morland sister ceased

carefully welcome doctor welcome said cheerfully always welcome so long a command ship fly flag will see there be reigning prince about be only prince here may take word for thanked coolly giving prisoner direction for care of legrand climbed to deck a left lower deck with suave compliment of holgate in ear have two thing in mind to ponder in first place there be mystery behind chief mutineer what ailed that have made attack on weak garrison have deviation of yacht cruise be adequate reason for leaving strong room untouched again when have offered term have not known that must not accept why have conducted with such easy insolence a to prevent from accepting have be disposed to do so problem frankly baffled other thought be more consolatory be convinced that legrand be not much injured guessed that be shamming that have winked at to convey real case seemed obvious heart rose at thought for have be downcast heaven know be something to feel that have ally forward in heart of enemy even if be at present under hatch have faith somehow in legrand silent forcible man entered stateroom with cheerfulness oddly enough note with be received bore relation to cheerfulness for be
