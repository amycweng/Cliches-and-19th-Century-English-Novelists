to enjoy very greatly nh middy of slave squadron west african story by harry collingwood chapter one sound through darkness phew ejaculated mr perry first lieutenant of britannic majesty corvette psyche a removed hat mopped perspiration from streaming forehead with enormous spotted pocket handkerchief believe be getting hotter instead of cooler although by law be supposed to govern pestiferous climate ought to be close upon coolest hour of twenty four just step aft to skylight mr fortescue see what time be will ye must surely be nearing two bell ay ay sir dutifully answered moving aft to skylight raised canvas cover have be placed over to mask light of low turned lamp be kept burning night in fore cabin glanced at clock screwed to coaming on one side of tell tale compass balanced barometer hung in gimbal be suspended on other side clock marked time a two minute to five be within two minute of two bell in morning watch dropping canvas screen back into place be about to announce time to superior officer when thought caught through faint creak of ship timber light rustling of canvas aloft slight far off sound like squeak of sheave on rusty pin therefore instead of proclaiming time aloud stepped quietly to side of first luff asked almost in whisper did hear anything just then sir hear anything reiterated mr perry unconsciously lowering usually stentorian voice in response to suggestion of secrecy conveyed by whisper ca say that did what d 'ye mean mr fortescue mean sir replied that thought caught moment ago sound like of ah did hear that then sir a voice uttering word of command apparently in spanish language came floating to faint clear across invisible water upon psyche lay rolling almost imperceptibly ay did answered mr perry modulating voice still further mistake about eh there be craft of sort out there le than mile distant must say did catch word sounded to like foreign lingo sir replied did not quite catch a say appeared to be foreign believe be spanish what about striking two bell sir only wanted two minute on account mr fortescue hastily interrupted companion on contrary have kindness to slip for'ard caution watch not to sing out make slightest noise on account to come quietly aft if happen to have anything to report when have done kindly go down call captain harrison ay ay sir answered kicking off shoe lest sound of upon deck must reach stranger through still breathless atmosphere proceeded upon twofold errand be time to tell reader where psyche be upon dark stifling night what be doing there why precaution above referred to be deemed necessary a have already be mentioned psyche be british man o ' war be sloop armed with fourteen long pounder carried crew have originally consisted of one hundred thirty men have now be reduced by sickness casualty to one hundred four told be unit in somewhat scanty slave squadron great britain have stationed on west african coast for suppression of infamous slave trade when story open namely about middle of year have be upon station nearly two year during whole of period richard fortescue hailing from neighbourhood of good town of plymouth have be on board now held responsible position of senior midshipman being at above date just turned seventeen year of age psyche be fine stout roomy comfortable craft of class about a unsuitable for work upon be now engaged a must well be for be converted merchant ship built for purpose of carrying biggest possible cargo must be packed into certain prescribed limit consequently a might be expected phenomenally slow to commission vessel to chase capture nimble craft be usually employed to transport unhappy black across atlantic be simply ghastly farce caused unfortunate crew to be laughing stock of entire coast yet considering thing have not done so very badly for realising early in commission that need never hope for success from speed of ship have invoked aid of strategy by dint of long practice have brought trapping of slaver almost up to level of high art consequently psyche despite disability arising from astonishing lack of speed have acquired certain reputation among slave dealing fraternity be a intensely detested by a ship on station at moment when reader first find member of crew psyche be lying near mouth of benin river two mile off shore about twice distance from river mouth at point have arrived at midnight having made way thither in consequence of information received led to believe that large ship be at moment in river taking on board full cargo of black have drifted down to position then occupied under impulse of last of land breeze have died out left becalmed two mile short of precise spot for be aiming still be near enough for practical purpose believed that be for thought that if thoroughly smart look out be maintained have grown to be adept at sort of thing must be impossible for slaver to attempt to slip out of river without becoming cognisant of fact now to return to story having first stolen forward warned watch that craft of sort be within hearing distance of that be therefore carefully to avoid cry out making other sound might betray presence returned aft in same cautious manner be on point of descending companion ladder to call captain when ting ting came soft chiming of ship bell mellowed by distance from somewhere in offing evidencing so seemed to fact that stranger have not a yet discovered proximity skipper accustomed to being disturbed at hour of night awoke at first touch of knuckle upon cabin door yes called what be there be strange craft not far from sir answered mr perry considered that must be apprised of fact know nothing about except that be there for night be so intensely dark that have be unable to catch faintest glimpse of have just heard strike two bell aboard have not struck own bell sir thinking yes of course quite right interrupted skipper a landed with soft thud on floor of state room tell mr perry that will be on deck in brace of shake followed close at heel up companion ladder having paused only long enough to slip into nether garment came groping blindly out on deck phew muttered a emerged from companion be a dark a inside of cow where be mr perry here be sir close alongside answered first luff stretching out hand lightly touching skipper arm yes continued certainly be dark unusually so so dark that be in hope of keeping presence secret from fellow out yonder until will have decided what be to be done mr fortescue tell that have not seen anything of thus far remarked captain whereabout be how far off do reckon somewhere away in direction indicated lieutenant with flourish of arm a to distance well be rather difficult to judge sound travel far on such night a must say that craft be not more than mile distant three quarter at utmost um commented captain meditatively suppose be not by chance craft be after have slipped out of river in darkness eh must scarcely think so sir answered perry man must literally have to be able to find way about blindfolded to attempt to run out of river on night a be inclined to think that be inward bound craft becalmed like caught sound of order spoken on board when first became aware of presence mr fortescue here be of opinion that word used be spanish although distance be too great to enable to distinguish just what be said ay responded skipper two out of three slaver doing business on coast be spaniard portuguese now question be what be to do with regard to unknown friend out yonder be be not craft that be on look out for if be must take by hook by crook before sea breeze set in give chance to run away from mean jaunt in boat on other hand if be not craft that be after be still in probability slaver in case will doubtless pay for overhaul again mean boat trip therefore mr perry be good enough to have hand called boat got into water a silently a possible if men be quick may be able to get away perhaps alongside before dawn break will take charge of little pleasure party can stay here keep house during absence ay ay sir answered perry in tone clearly betrayed disappointment at arrangement come to by skipper will put matter in hand yes do returned skipper meanwhile will go dress will be turn next time perry chuckled a turned away to go below again ay grumbled lieutenant to audibly enough for to hear same old yarn turn next time perry ' will make third time running have be left behind to keep house ' there be not going to be fourth will see to that be time that child stood up for right now mr fortescue have goodness if please to pas word for hand to arm man boat to be quiet about too show light ay ay sir briskly responded a turned to hurry away will see that lamb bleat too loudly suppose may take for granted that will make one of pleasure party ' interrupted lieutenant with laugh a put disappointment ill humour away from oh yes suppose so at event there will be harm in making preparation captain be pretty certain to take still on bare foot hurried forward found boatswain that mr futtock inquired a made out burly form ay ay mr fortescue be right enough be answer presoom sir be boat job eh heard that bell did mr futtock yes heard distinctly seeing that caulk ' in watch on deck retorted yes be boat affair so be good enough to have hand called at once if please kindly make personal business to see that nobody raise voice let anything fall otherwise creates row enough to wake dead be going to be little surprise visit understand ay ay mr fortescue understands answered futtock a moved toward open hatchway will see that swab make noise man raise voice above whisper wo go be just one word more mr futtock hastily interposed a boatswain stepped over coaming to descend hatchway may do favour if will kindly ask armourer to pick out nice sharp cutlas if please can bring on deck with when come up to request boatswain readily enough assented matter being thus far satisfactorily arranged descended to cockroach haunted den wherein mids ate slept to find little tom copplestone who shared watch who be special favourite of mine because of gentle genial disposition also perhaps because hailed from same county a having overheard conversation between mr perry have already come below roused occupant of place who by smoky ray of flaring oil lamp did best to make atmosphere quite unendurable be hastily arraying murder ejaculated a entered pokey little place got first whiff of close reeking smoke laden atmosphere put out that abominable lamp light candle two somebody for pity sake how dickens fellow can manage to breathe down here ca understand boy to messenger outside pas word for cupid to bring along cocoa from galley there be need remarked nugent master mate a struggled ineffectively to find left sleeve of jacket word have already be passed passed when master cock robin there pointing to copplestone came roused out a to candle be afraid have rat appear to have eaten last two have in locker however ah here come cocoa put pot down there cupid never mind if doe soil beautiful damask table cloth be going to have washed next time go into sierra leone just see if can find biscuit two butter will ye black angel here avast there a black be about to retire produce best china breakfast set before go swab pour out cocoa black herculean krooboy picked up when first arrived on coast promptly christened cupid by master mate who possibly because of sundry disappointment have developed somewhat sardonic turn of humour grinned appreciatively at nugent sorry jest respecting best china breakfast set proceeded to rout out heterogeneous assortment of delf tin cup basin plate constituted table equipage of midshipman berth poured out generous allowance of cocoa for of then departed with empty bread barge in quest of supply of ship biscuit by time cupid returned with have gulped down cocoa be ready to go on deck therefore helped to couple of biscuit breaking into piece of convenient size by simple process of dashing against elbow crammed into jacket pocket then rushed up ladder to deck leaving companion to follow after have snatched hasty bite two of food for there be now no knowing when might get breakfast upon arrival on deck found hand already mustering under supervision of first lieutenant moment later encountered boatswain who handed over to good serviceable ship cutlas worth dozen of ridiculous little dirk be considered suitable weapon for midshipman promptly girded about waist at moment be bustle animation throughout ship yet so sedulously have be trained to act in perfect silence be certain stealthy footfall of men hurrying to station whispered word of command be quite inaudible at distance of twenty yard from ship within minute two however even faint sound have subsided crew be mustered first lieutenant assisted by quartermaster who carried carefully masked lantern be carefully yet rapidly inspecting man weapon equipment scrutinising flint in lock of pistol otherwise satisfying of efficiency of hurried preparation while inspection be still in progress captain came on deck with sword girded to side brace of pistol thrust into belt stood quietly looking on until inspection be completed mr perry have reported that everything be in order then skipper announced that must personally lead attack in own gig manned by eight oarsman coxswain midshipman while first cutter manned by sixteen oarsman coxswain midshipman jack keene be to be commanded by mr purchase second lieutenant second cutter with twelve oarsman coxswain nugent master mate be to be under command of boatswain thus attacking party be to consist of forty five person told be a many suppose a skipper felt justified in taking out of ship under circumstance then ensued busy five minute during boat be being noiselessly lowered manned oar muffled possible precaution observed to enable to take unseen doubtless vigilant enemy unawares be just then regarded a of especial importance for at time of be now writing traffic in slave be regarded a piracy rendered perpetrator liable to capital punishment in consequence of almost slaver went heavily armed crew knowing that halter be already about neck resisted capture by mean ingenuity must devise whenever have chance often fought with desperate valour a hurried aft to attend to lowering of gig hung from davit over stern hand be suddenly laid upon arm turning found confronted by cupid krooboy servant who did for in midshipman berth eye be aglow with excitement carried short handled hatchet with head somewhat bigger heavier than of ship tomahawk in hand be naked save for pair of dungaree trouser leg of be rolled up above knee mr fortescue sar fit for go in dem boat wid sar whispered eagerly yes quite believe cupid replied know perfectly well that can not give permission to join gig crew if captain have be anxious to have pleasure of company feel sure that must have mentioned fact besides if must happen to be killed what must become of poor midshipman suppressed chuckle gleam of white teeth through darkness betrayed cupid appreciation of compliment subtly conveyed in suggestion that budding admiral inhabiting midshipman berth aboard hm psyche must suffer must unhappily be slain in impending conflict hastened to reassure fear sar whispered dem slaber lib for kill cupid too much plenty black for see in de dark ' if dey see dey kill savvey please mr fortescue sar lib for fight too much plenty long time look here cupid replied be use for to ask for permission to go in gig for can not give meaningly if be to stow away in eye of gig be just possible that captain might not notice until have got too far from ship to turn back only let see doing be dat right sar answered black with sigh of extreme content if look for dem cupid see um turned ostentatiously walked away forward boat having be gently carefully lowered into water without splash so much a single tell tale squeak from tackle block pin bush of be habitually overhauled at frequent interval kept well lubricated with mixture of melted tallow plumbago crew took place man carefully depositing drawn cutlas on bottom board between foot shoved off with muffled oar three boat pulling abreast with about ship length between so that if perchance must happen to be seen must present a small target a possible to aim at pulled slowly with utmost caution for twofold reason that have not yet caught sight of quarry only knew in general sort of way that be somewhere to seaward of because be anxious to avoid premature discovery from splash of oar be of course perfectly right proper that must observe precaution have indicated for if must contrive to creep up alongside stranger without being detected must undoubtedly mean prevention of much loss of life personally have very little hope of being able to do so for night be so breathlessly still that if sort of look out at be being kept aboard stranger slaver usually slept with one eye open must surely have caught hint of proximity careful a have be to maintain a complete silence a possible while making preparation besides a ill luck must have water be in unusually brilliant phosphorescent condition just then slightest disturbance of caused silvery glow must be seen mile away be a silent a might dip of oar passage of boat through water set up such blaze a must not fail to betray must man happen to glance in direction at length when have pulled about mile a nearly a must judge detected slight suspicion of softening in velvety blackness of sky in eastern quarter brightened even a looked solitary star low down in sky seemed to flicker faintly more faintly for dozen second then disappear dawn be coming sir whispered to skipper by whose side be sitting in minute two ought to ah there be do see sir pointed in direction of faint ghostlike blotch have suddenly appeared at spot three point on port bow where away demanded skipper instinctively raising hand to shade eye have scarcely lifted to height of shoulder when too caught sight of object ay exclaimed see big craft be too barque apparently surely that can not be craft that be after yet look very like if so must have slipped out of river with last of land breeze last night lain becalmed night where be now what be other boat about have not seen parkinson to coxswain show lantern for moment to other boat take care to shield with ah never mind there be light give way men put alongside under mizen chain lad side care while captain have be speaking faint ghostly glimmer that have detected have resolved into spectral semblance of large ship clothed from truck down with canvas upon rapidly growing light of advancing dawn be falling thus rendering just barely visible against dark background of sky in tropic day come go with rush even while skipper have be speaking object have first revealed to minute earlier a mere wan ghostly suggestion have assumed solidity definiteness of form now stood out against sky behind a full rigged ship of seven hundred fifty ton burthen hull painted bright green coppered to water line be lying stern on to sat deep in water from latter fact one inferred that have cargo of slave on board have doubtless a skipper conjectured come out of river with last of land breeze during previous night have remained becalmed near hoped quite unaware of proximity night be now within cable length of boat lying a be dead stern on to in gig be unable to see how many gun carried be however advantage to since however many gun might mount on broadside must bring none of to bear upon saw however that carried two stern chaser long nine apparently now in hope of dashing alongside before two gun must be cast loose brought to bear upon captain stood up in stern sheet of gig waved arm to other boat a signal to to give way for with coming of daylight must not possibly hope to remain undiscovered above second two longer indeed boat crew have scarcely bent back in response to signal when there arose sudden startled outcry on board ship followed by volley of hurried command hasty trampling of foot upon deck be so close to when discovered surprise be so complete that crew have time to do anything effective in way of defence in little over couple of minute have swept up alongside clambered in over lofty bulwark driven crew below be in full possession of dona isabella of havana mounting twelve gun with crew of forty six spaniard portuguese half caste constituting a ruffianly lot a have ever met with have cargo of seven hundred forty negro on board be far away finest prize have thus far fallen to lot of psyche so valuable indeed be that captain harrison decided not to trust entirely to prize crew to escort to sierra leone in corvette two hour later having meanwhile made necessary disposition two craft trimmed sail with first of sea breeze hauled up for sierra leone where arrived week later after uneventful passage chapter two in fernan vaz river while be awaiting formal condemnation of dona isabella by mixed commission trial of crew upon charge of piracy captain harrison skipper busily employed a be wont in hunting up information relative to movement present prospective of slaver upon coast be not quite so difficult to do a might at first be imagined for sierra leone being headquarters so to speak of british slave squadron person actually engaged in slave trade found that paid well to maintain agent there for sole purpose of picking up possible item of information relative to movement doings of squadron for not unfrequently happened that to behind scene apparently trivial seemingly quite worthless bit of information imprudent word dropped by unwary officer respecting one of vessel enabled acute one to calculate so closely that often succeeded in making dash into river shipping cargo of slave getting clear away to sea again only few hour before cruiser put in appearance on spot in same way own officer by frequenting in disguise haunt of slaver agent very often succeeded in catching hint carefully followed up led to most important capture being made be indeed through hint so acquired that have be put upon track of dona isabella now own skipper captain harrison be particularly keen upon sort of work be exceptionally well qualified to achieve success in for in first place be west indian by birth being son of trinidad sugar planter consequently spoke creole spanish a fluently a did mother tongue also physical characteristic be such a to be of greatest assistance to in such enterprise for be tall lean muscular of swarthy complexion with thick black curly hair large black flashing eye suggesting that carried touch of tar brush although a matter of fact have not drop of negro blood in be man of dauntless courage knowing not meaning of fear absolutely revelling in situation of most extreme peril yet gifted with quite a much discretion a be needful for man entrusted with heavy responsibility involving life of many of fellow men never sought danger for danger sake alone never embarked in enterprise reason assured be hopelessly impracticable on other hand never hesitated to undertake most perilous task if believed must see way to successful accomplishment be habit to assume variety of disguise in must haunt third fourth rate tavern of freetown especially patronised by slave dealing fraternity mingling freely with gentry must boldly express own view adopted of course for occasion upon various matter affecting trade discus with most promising scheme for baffling effort of british cruiser have noticed very early in career a officer of slave squadron that be always british who constituted bete noire of slaver french feared very little american not at little incursion into enemy territory captain harrison conducted with consummate boldness skill with considerable measure of success for be quite favourite amusement of to devise suggest scheme of particularly alluring character when adopted by enemy of course triumphantly circumvented without difficulty there be only one fault to find with propensity on part of skipper in humble judgment constituted serious one be captain harrison personality be distinctly striking one be kind of man who once seen be not easily forgotten greatly dreaded that day sooner later reckless frequenter of low class freetown tavern must be identified a one same with captain of hm psyche who be of course frequently to be seen about street in uniform of british naval captain indeed once took liberty of delicately hinting at possibility skipper laughed at idea have appeared most implicit faith in disguise included amongst other thing huge false moustache of most ferocious appearance enormous pair of gold earring have be at sierra leone little over fortnight business there be just completed when skipper came aboard on certain afternoon in state of highest good humour occasioned a soon transpired by fact that have succeeded in obtaining full particular of exceptionally grand coup have be planned by number of slaver in conjunction be perfectly confident of pulling off triumphantly appeared from story that intelligence have just be received of successful conclusion of great slave hunting raid into interior by certain king olomba who have recently returned in triumph to town of olomba on left bank of fernan vaz river bringing with nearly three thousand negro of whom over two thousand be male in prime condition information having reached slaver agent at sierra leone through mysterious channel by news often travel in africa effort of quite exceptional magnitude be to be made to get at least two thousand male out of country at one fell swoop present being regarded a almost uniquely favourable opportunity for accomplishment of object for reason that psyche be just then only ship must by possibility interfere with scheme in event of happening to put in inopportune appearance on part of coast at critical moment a have knack of doing in most unaccountable manner be to be decoyed away from spot by simple process of dispatching to sea certain notorious schooner well known to be in trade for occasion only be to have slave slave fitting adjunct on board after chase of two three hundred mile to southward be to permit to be caught only to be released again of course after exhaustive overhaul be admirable scheme beautifully simple must scarcely fail to achieve complete success for fact that captain harrison have contrived to obtain full particular of therefore knew exactly how to frustrate plan plot be a simple a of slaver must proceed in psyche to scene of operation when decoy schooner made appearance must be permitted to go on way unmolested while boat expedition must be dispatched up river to town of olomba where vessel actually engaged in shipping two thousand black must be captured flagrante delicto naturally be thrown into high state of jubilation at receipt of intelligence for promised slice of good luck of such magnitude a very seldom fell to lot of single cruiser to convey two thousand negro across atlantic at once must necessitate employment of at least three large ship value of might be roughly calculated at upon very lowest estimate ten thousand pound thirty thousand pound in besides there must be head money upon two thousand negro amounting altogether to quite nice little sum in prize money for cruise of probably le than month duration oh how chuckled a pictured to ourselves effect news of so magnificent coup must create upon mind of rest of slave squadron psyche from phenomenal lack of speed general unsuitability for service upon be employed have with crew become butt laughing stock of stupid scurrilous jester on coast many time have be made to writhe under lash of more than ordinarily envenomed gibe now laugh be to be on side be going to demonstrate to willow jeering wit superiority of brain over clean pair of heel of course be in perfect fever of impatience to get to sea make best of way to scene of action lest haply must arrive too late find bird flown skipper retained coolness must permit nothing to be done must by possibility suggest to slaver idea that faintest hint of audacious scheme have be allowed to get abroad insisted that have plenty of time to spare actually remained in harbour three whole day after information have reached then on morning of fourth day weighed stood out to sea beating off land against sea breeze until ran into calm belt between sea breeze trade wind here remained motionless for more than hour until trade wind gradually ate way inshore reached when ran right out to sea until have sunk land astern of then hauled up to southward on taut bowline under easy canvas made leisurely way toward mouth of fernan vaz river off arrived five day later making land from masthead about hour before sunset night whole of next day night following remained hove to under topsail jib spanker dodging to fro athwart mouth of river with man on main royal yard during hour of daylight to give timely notice of appearance of craft be to play part of decoy while with approach of nightfall made sail beat in to within distance of three mile of coast running off into offing again hour before daylight at length when have hung upon tenterhook of suspense for close upon forty hour be beginning to fear that captain in resolve to cut matter a fine a possible have overdone thing allowed quarry to escape be gladdened by hail from aloft of sail large schooner just comin ' out o ' river sir ay ay answered first lieutenant whose watch happened to be just keep eye on lad let know how steer when be clear of bar be heading to southward at time be about three mile south of river entrance sixteen mile off land by pretending therefore not to see for next quarter of hour so keeping psyche still heading to southward must afford stranger excellent opportunity to secure sufficient offing to make good escape then must heave about make sail in chase drive off coast work in a close to river mouth a dared venture when ship be to be brought to anchor boat manned armed dispatched into river meanwhile a previously arranged captain harrison be aroused informed of fact that decoy schooner what be assumed to be such have made appearance be now fairly at sea steering little to northward of west under heavy press of sail close upon heel of returning messenger worthy skipper appeared sprang upon gun carriage peered intently shoreward under shade of hand only upper canvas of stranger be visible from deck impatiently hailed look out aloft to give detailed description of vessel fellow in cross tree happened however to be poor sort of unintelligent fellow must say very little about craft beyond stating fact that be schooner painted black that sat deep in water showed immense spread of canvas appeared to be very fast have sort of doubt that yonder schooner be craft whose duty be to draw off coast leave way clear for other fellow to get out to sea said must like to have somewhat better description of than sodger ' up aloft there seems able to give glanced round deck eye fell upon ah mr fortescue exclaimed will doubtless be able to do what want just slip down into cabin will find glass hanging above head of bunk throw strap of over shoulder shin up alongside that fellow in cross tree take good look at stranger report to peculiarity that may detect in will ye ay ay sir replied touching hat five minute later be sitting in main topmast cross tree with long barrel of telescope steadied against topmast head eye glued to eye piece from elevation commanded complete if distant view of low land about river entrance with fringe of mangrove tree running away inland sand hummock sparsely clothed with coarse reedy grass trailing plant endless line of surf beaten african beach also through skipper powerful lens obtained most excellent view of strange schooner from truck to water line including such detail a must have discerned with naked eye at distance of about mile saw for example a look out have already reported be large schooner estimated to be one hundred eighty ton burthen at least verified statement that hull be painted black from rail to top of copper that showed enormous spread of canvas that sat very low in water noticed few other peculiarity a well saw that bowsprit be painted black while jib boom be scraped varnished that foremast fore topmast fore topgallant royal mast be varnished while mast head be painted black that whole of mainmast from cap down be painted white be peculiarity ought to have be sufficient to identify a far a one must see so be for moment reported skipper hailed thank mr fortescue will do may come down hold on minute be stranger far enough out of river to enable to get clear away think ye be fully mile from mouth of river sir answered ah will do then thank may both come down answered skipper a swung down through cross tree to topmast rigging heard give order to wear ship make sail five minute later psyche be heading to northward close hauled on port tack under plain sail to royal doing nearly seven knot laying course that with nice steering must just enable to fetch river mouth handsomely without breaking tack schooner meanwhile be romping along at pace of at least twelve knot per hour on starboard tack throwing spray over weather bow to height of lower yard shaping course must enable to pas at distance of fully eight mile dead to windward allowed to go on way unmolested be just noon when having arrived off mouth of river made flying moor of letting go first then second bower anchor in ten fathom at distance of about one half mile from shore at spot from river mouth perhaps mile of river be in plain view town of king olomba be understood be situated at distance of about thirty two mile from anchorage a captain be anxious that journey must be made at easy pace so that men might arrive comparatively fresh in fit condition for rather stiff bit of work lay at end of eight hour be to be allowed for passage of boat to destination a be highly undesirable that expedition must be unduly exposed in boat to pestiferous effect of miasmatic night fog gather upon most of west african river after sunset have already be arranged that attacking party must not start until following morning at hour must enable to reach scene of operation in time to make reconnaissance arrange plan of attack by remainder of day be therefore employed in getting boat ready stocking with three day ration of provision water overhauling boat gun slinging ready for lowering filling ammunition box sharpening cutlass fixing new flint to pistol where necessary generally completing preparation also sent down royal topgallant yard housed topgallant mast in order must by chance come on to blow heavily from westward during absence ship might ride more easily at anchor also made preparation in view of foregoing contingency for backing bower with two stream anchor otherwise made possible preparation for safety of ship during absence for expedition in be about to engage be one of very considerable importance task have set ourselves to perform be so formidable that in order to insure success must be necessary to employ practically entire ship company leaving vessel in charge of second lieutenant only enough hand to keep look out perform such task a for example letting go of stream anchor in case of necessity paying out of additional amount of cable keeping of ship reasonably clean so on on following morning having washed deck partaken of breakfast hand be mustered inspected boat lowered gun secured in bow of launch pinnace first second cutter ammunition box passed down mast stepped sail cast loose yard hooked on in short everything made ready for start then went down over side took place in boat to be severally appointed captain going a usual in own gig while mr perry first luff be in command of launch mr hoskins third lieutenant commanding pinnace mr marline master having charge of first cutter while mr tompson gunner commanded second cutter skipper took a generally did in own boat other three mids be left on board psyche to keep mr purchase company for rest nugent master mate went with first lieutenant while peter futtock boatswain accompanied third lieutenant in pinnace mustered ninety told be none too many for work that have undertaken to do be to capture three if not four large ship capture demolish shore battery slaver very frequently erected for defence of stronghold also most likely fight king olomba whole flotilla of war canoe task be indeed formidable one more so that attacking party must be at least at beginning of fight huddled closely together in boat while antagonist must have advantage of roomy deck to move about on steady gun platform from to pour in fire to say nothing of tremendous superiority in point of number thought nothing of however be going to have change from monotony of shipboard life must be certain to see new sight of more le interesting character there be excitement exhilaration of stiff fight awaiting at end of journey finally there be prospect of pocketful of prize money a wind up to whole affair what more must reasonable individual desire like most african river fernan vaz have bar sea break upon only when wind blow fresh from north west owing to fact that a far up a town of olomba river flow parallel to line of coast being separated from open atlantic by low sandy peninsula varying from one to three mile in breadth terminating in spit ordinarily shelter bar from roller leaving narrow channel of unbroken water wide enough to enable couple of craft of moderate tonnage to pas other comfortably well be for that be case for a approached river mouth saw that ground swell be rapidly increasing in weight that surf be breaking upon beach with such violence that if happened to be also breaking upon bar must be quite useless for to attempt to enter river indeed so formidable did appearance of surf at length become that captain ordered rest of boat to heave to while in gig went ahead to reconnoitre inspect condition of bar be bit of work for gig be peculiarly well adapted for be beautifully modelled boat double ended with long flat floor splendid sailer boat must claw off lee shore in almost weather skipper having have fitted with good deep false keel wind be blowing moderately fresh breeze from westward at time thus rest of boat having hove to did not take very long to run in far enough to get sight of bar be rather trying experience for nerve of for surf be pounding on beach ahead of in constant succession of towering wall of water reared to height of fully thirty foot ere curled over broke in thunder so deafening that presently found impossible to make voice heard above continuous roar skipper standing up in stern sheet soon detected smooth narrow strip of unbroken water directed coxswain to shift helm for sprang up on thwart waved small white flag a signal to other boat to fill away follow a soon a have reached very middle of channel rounded to lowered sail remaining where be to act a guide to other boat keeping position with aid of couple of oar thrown over to enable to stem out flowing current now began to feel allowed other boat to pas in over bar reach smooth water before then hoisting sail again followed in presently resumed position at head of line change from scene of wind flecked blue sea stately march of swell thunderous roar creaming froth of breaker outside to oil mud laden strong smelling river with tiny swirling eddy here there mangrove lined bank silence through roar of surf came to over intervening sand spit mellowed subdued by distance be so marked that although be by mean first experience of kind of thing found rubbing eye a though be by mean certain that be awake noticed others doing same sharp word from skipper however cautioning hand to maintain smart look out soon brought to realisation of surroundings for river here be narrow being not more than mile wide with number of small islet dotted about one of might prove to be hiding place of formidable foe when at length have passed without interference have reached point where river began to widen out somewhat be better off rather worse for here stream be encumbered with extensive sandbank to avoid be compelled to approach margin of river so closely that well arranged ambush might have practically annihilated before must have effected landing through thick viscid mud almost impenetrable growth of mangrove divided water of river from solid ground of shore fortunately for slaver appeared unaccountably to have overlooked admirable opportunity thus afforded for frustrating attack possibly a thought be that have fully relied upon power of decoy schooner to draw away from coast thus leave way free for to escape passage of part of river occupied until noon be rather trying to nerve of hand for not only be constantly exposed to attack by slaver there be native also to be reckoned with a knew have most objectionable habit of using poisoned arrow slightest wound from be invariably followed by death after eight to twelve hour of dreadful suffering shortly after noon emerged from natural entanglement into long reach of river where stream expanded to width of three half mile with narrow deep water channel running about midway between bank here be quite free from possibility of ambush of kind with sigh of intense relief captain gave word to pipe to dinner about four o'clock in afternoon arrived at point where river again narrowed to width of about mile two mile farther on again widened out changed direction trending away almost due east about at right angle to former course according to information in skipper possession indicated that be nearing destination drawing from pocket sketch chart have already consulted several time during passage up river again studied intently for several minute carefully comparing configuration delineated upon with actual surroundings then apparently satisfied with result refolded paper returned to pocket directed coxswain to bear away couple of point toward projecting point afterwards discovered to be western extremity of islet on far side of river a approached spot for be heading became apparent that there be two islet instead of one between river bank quarter of hour later gig with rest of flotilla following glided in between two islet lowering sail made signal for other boat to anchor boat be now completely concealed from possible observation for soon saw that islet between be anchored consisted merely of mud bank thickly overgrown with mangrove absolutely uninhabitable even by native for there did not appear to be inch of ground upon of islet sufficiently solid to support even reed hut while mangrove be tall enough grew densely enough to hide boat from possible observation from mainland only question now troubled be whether presence of boat in river have already be observed if slaver have placed absolute confidence in success of plan to draw away from coast by mean of decoy schooner might not have troubled to keep look out if be a cautious a such gentry usually be have left nothing to chance must be scarcely possible for approach of boat to have passed undetected be question to captain be now going to seek answer chapter three at camma lagoon distant about mile from hiding place there be according to captain rough sketch map small peninsula enclosing little bay creek at inner extremity of be situated king olomba town be here that be led to believe must find slaver busily engaged in shipping human cargo truly a seen from boat ingenuity of man must scarcely have devised more perfect spot whereat to conduct infamous traffic for configuration of land be such that boat entering river merely on exploring expedition without having first obtained like special information must never have suspected existence of creek of town lay concealed within must have be possible to detect presence of slave craft in creek for peninsula masked be thickly overgrown with lofty tree must effectually conceal upper spar of ship must doubtless be struck housed while be lying in creek skipper having explained to officer in command of other boat what intended to do given instruction how to act in event of certain contingency arising gig crew manned oar pulled away in direction of peninsula reached in course of few minute now real trouble began for object be not only to reach peninsula also to land upon walk across until spot must be found from unseen ourselves must obtain clear view of creek everything in upon approaching shore of peninsula discovered that in common with a much of river bank a have yet seen consisted first of of wide belt of soft fathomless mud overgrown with mangrove tree mud being of consistency to attempt to walk upon must mean being swallowed up suffocated in for sixteen foot oar must be thrust perpendicularly into with scarcely effort although when one of men incautiously tried experiment be only with utmost difficulty that be able to withdraw oar so tenaciously did mud cling to yet be not sufficiently liquid to allow of gig being forced through even if thickly clustering mangrove root must have permitted of such proceeding only alternative left to therefore be to endeavour to reach solid ground by clambering over slippery mangrove root with possibility at moment one of might lose footing fall into mud be swallowed up by however need must under certain circumstance skipper therefore scrambled out of boat taking cupid with to search out way carry small coil of light line in case must be wanted proceeded cautiously to claw way like so many parrot over among gnarled twisted root of mangrove tree krooboy leading way leaping swinging with marvellous agility from tree to tree while followed slowly in wake a often a not being obliged to make slip rope of line to enable to cross exceptionally wide awkward gap in manner after about hour arduous toil with perspiration pouring out of until clothes be saturated with while be driven nearly frantic by attack of mosquito stinging fly beset by thousand must by mean be driven away contrived at length to reach soil firm enough to support weight five minute later solid ground even now trouble be only half over for after have crossed peninsula still found impossible to discover spot from interior of creek must be seen without laying out upon root of mangrove tree bordered inner a well a outer shore of peninsula wearisome business of crawling climbing have therefore to be gone over again with result that sun be close upon setting before have reached spot from clear view of entire creek must be obtained then have unspeakable mortification of discovering that expedition must result in failure for save few canoe creek be innocent of craft of description there be slaver in moreover so called town of king olomba consisted only of about fifty miserable native hut in very last stage of sordidness dilapidation there be sign that slave barracoon have ever existed near place captain stared across water a though found quite impossible to believe eye then drew sketch map from pocket once more studied attentively muttering to while finally sat down upon knot of twisted root with back against trunk of tree spreading sketch wide open on knee beckoned to place beside just come here look at map mr fortescue said spoke with air in tone of man who be so utterly dazed with disappointment that begin to doubt evidence of own sens just give opinion will ye can not understand business at map although only free hand sketch seems to to be perfectly accurate there see be mouth of river just a found there be little islet that passed immediately after getting inside there be dry mud bank there see river widens out in precise accordance with experience here narrow again at bend there be where boat be lying concealed laying finger upon particular part of sketch be creek that be now looking at there be town of olomba seems to to be absolutely correct doe not appear so to certainly sir answered sketch answer in particular to what have seen since entering river answer to so perfectly indeed that might have be copied from carefully plotted survey exactly assented skipper yet be nothing of kind for with own eye saw drawn from memory by man whom happened to meet in one of third rate hotel in freetown be frequented by master mate of palm oil trader like happened to hear mention that have be in out of fernan vaz at least dozen time in search for cargo along coast so waited until people with whom be talking have left then entered into conversation with finally inducing to furnish with sketch be from sir that also obtained information upon strength of determined upon expedition asked oh answered skipper have that from quite different source in very different kind of house people who told about king olomba raid plan laid by slaver for carrying off prisoner be slaver told of scheme because believed to be master of slaver waiting for information from senegal river cream of joke be that fellow must have told captain of psyche that scheme have be carefully planned with express object of putting psyche upon false scent so getting out of way while negro be being shipped yet there seems to have be something wrong somewhere sir ventured to suggest be not with map appears to be marvellously accurate for mere free hand sketch there be attempt at deception apparent there creek that be looking at be undoubtedly one shown on map there be king town precisely in position indicated on sketch assumption therefore be that man who drew map for be dealing quite honestly with misleading information consequently must appears to have come from others a indeed be case seeing that led to believe that must find at least three four large ship in creek whereas there be none be perfectly true concurred skipper yet quite understood informant to say that be person who have formulated scheme suppose sir said giving voice to idea have be gradually shaping in brain be not possible that people who be so singularly frank with happened to recognise a captain harrison of hm psyche gave that bit of information with deliberate purpose of misleading putting upon false scent in order that while be searching for here may have opportunity to carry out scheme elsewhere story may in main be perfectly true if by chance must have happened to recognise must not be very difficult for to substitute name of fernan vaz for of other river to mention king olomba instead of other king n o o said skipper dubiously must not yet can not see why if have recognised must have gone to trouble of spinning elaborate yarn merely to deceive must have be just a easy for to have knifed for there be seven of while be quite alone quite see do not sir interrupted with smile do see quite clearly two very excellent reason why did not resort to rough ready method of knife in first place fellow attach ridiculously high value to own skin never seem to imperil when alternative will serve purpose equally well although be seven to one if really recognised must know perfectly well that while ultimate result of fight must probably be in favour must certainly not perish alone suppose none of be particularly anxious to accompany into great beyond apart from that must know quite well that be captain of british man o ' war to go missing there must be such stir among rookery that soon there must be rookery left oh sir glad a might be to put quietly out of way if have chance depend upon last thing that must dream of must be to attempt anything of sort in sierra leone well well well perhaps be right young gentleman perhaps be right seem to have quite gift for reasoning thing out replied skipper a pocketed map hove up into standing position be high time that must get under way for sun be setting will have work cut out to find road back to boat do think will be able to find gig cupid yes fit sar answered krooboy mu ' make plenty haste for dem darkness come too much plenty soon ' if slip fall into dem mud lib for die one time ay ay answered skipper with involuntary shudder at hideous fate thus tersely sketched by cupid know that lad without telling so heave ahead a smartly a like therewith started upon return journey with speed striding leaping slipping scrambling from root to root cupid leading way following skipper bringing up rear until at length stood upon solid ground once more by time not only have sun set dusk be gathering about like curtain while star after star came twinkling out from rapidly darkening blue overhead foliage of tree hemmed in on side be changing even a stood watched while recovering breath from olive to deepest black now too be beset even more pertinaciously than before by myriad of mosquito sand fly gnat other winged biting creature with islet swarmed to say nothing of ant indeed almost seemed a though individual insect upon particular patch of soil vegetation have scented out having found be quite determined that must never escape alive when presently again began to move seemed impossible to take single step without tripping over land crab hole treading upon one of creature hearing feeling crackle writhe underfoot ugh be horrible unpleasantness be sharply accentuated by darkness fell upon like pall for now star began to be obscured by great black cloud came sweeping in from seaward while increasing roar swish in bough overhead seemed to indicate that wind be freshening progress be difficult enough under such condition while be traversing solid ground have special need to pick footstep how must be wondered when came to re crossing belt of mangrove mud lay between gig then to add still further to difficulty dank heavy pestilential fog rise from tropical african river at began to gather about in few minute from being bathed in perspiration from exertion be chilled to bone with teeth chattering to extent that must scarcely articulate intelligible word plenty too much fever here come remarked cupid while teeth clattered together like castanets sar lib for carry dem quinine powder dat dem doctor sarve out dis morning certainly cupid jibbered skipper m m many thanks for hint m m m mister fortes ugh t t take p p pow ow der at once did so handed one to krooboy who simply put paper into mouth swallowed whole having done cupid announced a well a chattering teeth must permit that in view of fog intense darkness must be simply suicidal for to attempt passage of mangrove without light that therefore proposed to make way alone to gig not only to reassure crew a to safety also to procure lantern enjoined skipper to remain exactly where be until must return after absence seemed to be age in duration be really not quite three quarter of hour reappeared accompanied by coxswain of boat two other seaman who brought along with couple of lighted lantern thus reinforced assisted got under way again eventually after most fatiguing dangerous journey reached boat shoved off into stream gig be of course provided with boat compass knew exact bearing of spot where other boat lay hidden already knew also how complicated confusing be set of current in river how hopeless must consequently be attempt to find friend in thick fog therefore did not make attempt pushing off into stream until be clear of mosquito other winged plague have be tormenting hand for so many hour let go anchor in one half fathom of water proceeded to take meal prior to turning in for night never in life before think have spent so absolutely uncomfortable night what with rat cockroach flea other vermin with ship be overrun to say nothing of complication of stench poisoned atmosphere midshipman berth aboard psyche be by mean ideal place to sleep in be luxury compared with state of affair in gig for aboard psyche at least slept dry while in boat be fully exposed to encroachment of vile malodorous disease laden fog hemmed in pressed down upon like saturated blanket penetrating everywhere soaking clothing until be wet to skin chilling to very marrow despite greatcoat so that be too miserable to sleep while so completely enveloped that even with help of dozen lantern must not see boat length in direction a foul water went swirling away past great bubble came rising up from mud below from time to time bursting a reached surface giving off little puff of noxious vile smelling gas be heavy with disease germ yet singularly enough when at morning dawned fog dispersed not one of aboard gig betrayed slightest trace of fever although among other boat mustered nearly dozen case first business after once more joining force be to pull into creek call upon majesty king olomba upon interviewing potentate through medium of cupid who acted a interpreter at once became evident that worthy skipper have be made victim of elaborate hoax even more elaborate indeed than at moment expected for king not only vigorously disclaimed propensity toward slave hunting slave dealing went length of strenuously denying that river be ever used at by slaver also several time endeavoured to divert conversation into channel by pointedly hinting at readiness to accept cask of rum a present to hint skipper of course turned deaf ear then having got out of old boy information that must extract when came to analyse amounted to just nothing carefully searched bush in neighbourhood of town to see if must discover anything in nature of barracoon found trace whatever of such thing having drawn creek blank skipper next determined to search spot known a camma lagoon twelve mile farther up river sea breeze having by time set in stepped mast made sail upon boat creeping up river close to northern bank in order to dodge current a much a possible upon reaching lagoon found to be in reality sort of bay in north bank of river five half mile long by about three three quarter mile wide with island in centre of occupying so large extent of area that at one spot creek behind be barely wide enough to allow passage of vessel of moderate tonnage eastern extremity of creek however widened out until presented sheet of water two mile long by about mile half in width with depth of water ranging from two to three fathom furthermore island adjacent bank of river be thickly wooded affording perfect concealment behind dozen slaver might lurk undetected altogether wore a seen from river aspect of exceedingly promising spot therefore lowered boat sail unshipped mast keeping bright look out round pulled warily into lagoon at eastern extremity for first mile of passage detected nothing whatever of suspicious character upon rounding eastern extremity of island entering widest part of lagoon sighted two large canoe paddling furiously up creek about mile ahead of captain at once brought telescope to bear upon craft with aid discovered that canoe be manned by about forty black paddler while after end of craft be occupied by ten dozen men in european dress most of whom appeared to be armed with musket men have appearance of being portuguese spaniard presence in such spot must mean one thing namely that there be barracoon somewhere near at hand skipper accordingly gave order to chase two canoe to boat crew responded with cheer laid down to oar with will that almost lifted boat out of water have scarcely traversed distance of dozen boat ' length when upon opening up little indentation in shore of mainland saw before substantial wharf long enough to accommodate two fair sized craft at once with wide open space at back of upon stood eight ten building one of be unmistakably barracoon of enormous size with cheer course of boat be at once diverted toward wharf have arrived within le than hundred yard of when deathlike silence have hitherto prevailed ashore be pierced by shrill whistle in response to whole face of bush bordering open space at once began to spit flame while air around hummed whined to passage of perfect storm of bullet slug among must be detected hum of round shot apparently nine pounder gig weathered storm unscathed upon glancing back saw that other boat have be le fortunate there being gap two here there where moment before man have sat while certain of oar be at moment slipping through rowlock to trail in water by lanyard second later here there too must be seen man hastily binding up wounded limb head own that of shipmate skipper sprang to foot in stern sheet of gig drew sword hurrah lad shouted give way get alongside that wharf a quickly a can then let man run hardest for shelter of building carrying musket ammunition with one hand remain in boat a boat keeper who must crouch down under shelter of wharf face mr fortescue stick close alongside please will probably want to carry message for ay ay sir answered next moment voice of coxswain pealed out oar rowed of followed by clatter of long ash stave a be laid in on thwart gig still leading other boat swept up alongside low wharf hooked on with yell of fierce delight eye blazing with excitement cupid krooboy bounded up on wharf extended one great black paw to assist skipper while in other grasped favourite weapon axe edge of have carefully ground honed until one must have shaved with in addition to wore ship cutlas girded about waist moreover have cleared for action by stripping off jacket shirt usually wore stowing carefully away in stern sheet of boat so that garb consisted simply of pair of dungaree trouser rolled up above knee braced tight to waist by broad belt from hung cutlas in second gig be empty save for boat keeper crew be racing for shelter afforded by barracoon where a understood captain intended to announce arrangement for clearing enemy out of bush when have accomplished about distance between edge of wharf barracoon there came sudden splutter of fire from window of other building be so arranged a to enfilade whole of open space in moment once more found in midst of storm of flying bullet skipper who be pace ahead of stumbled staggered pace two fell headlong upon face where lay still while sword flew from grasp with ringing clatter at same moment two cutter dashed up alongside wharf crew came swarming up out of to be met by murderous discharge from enemy lurking in bush came to halt beside skipper looked round couple of yard away stood cupid who seemed have just caught sight of captain a fell have pulled up short cupid shouted come back here sir lend hand to get captain back into gig fellow came stooping over skipper body raised tenderly in arm right mistah fortescue sar said trouble take dem captain back to de gig by find mistah hutchinson surgeon no good sar gone dead look dere pointed to ghastly great hole in side of skipper head just above left ear where piece of langrage of description have crashed way through poor fellow skull into brain be horrid sight turned quite sick for moment accustomed though be by time to see men suffering from sort of injury very well said take captain mean back to gig anyway leave until have turned over to mr hutchinson who by way be in launch see be just coming alongside will find mr hutchinson send to away hurried toward spot where saw launch approaching for double purpose of reporting to mr perry news of captain fall dispatching surgeon to see if life still remained in body first luff be terribly shocked at news have to tell from distance have seen skipper fall have hoped that be wound at most be not moment for unavailing regret fall of captain at once placed perry in command made responsible for fate of expedition therefore gave order for gun be mounted in bow of launch pinnace first second cutter to be cast loose landed men not engaged in work being placed under command of third lieutenant with instruction to load musket keep up constant fire upon window of various building then a soon a gun be landed two of be loaded with double charge of grape for purpose of clearing bush of hidden foe while remaining two be double shotted then run close up to barricaded door of building be thus blown in one after other a door be blown in building to belonged be stormed enemy however contriving to effect exit by rear a lad poured in at front in ten minute whole of building be ours without further casualty on side after set on fire waiting until be well alight retired in good order to boat in hauled off far enough to enable to effectively cover burning building with musketry fire thus defeat attempt to extinguish flame hour later entire settlement be reduced to heap of smouldering ash whereupon pulled away round to main stream once more by way of back of island in search of further possible barracoons found none loss in affair considering importance be comparatively slight amounting a did to two killed of whom one be skipper seven wounded be sorrowful party a left lagoon behind found once more in main stream on way back to ship for captain harrison be beloved by everybody fore aft felt that must better have spared one else than chapter four wreck of psyche journey down river be very different affair from of upward passage for whereas in latter have be compelled to force way against adverse current now have that current favouring thus came about although sun have passed meridian when boat emerged from camma lagoon after destroying slave factory therein yet wanted hour to sunset when gig still leading rest of flotilla entered last reach of river once more caught sight sound of breaker beyond bar mr perry late first lieutenant who now by death of captain harrison have automatically become acting captain of psyche have turned over command of launch to master mate for return passage be in gig with a drew nearer to river mouth noticed that rose in stern sheet of boat glanced somewhat anxiously to seaward for full minute more stood gazing under sharp of hand out across sandbank a seemed to glide rapidly past summit momentarily growing lower a gig swept along toward point where dwindling spit plunged beneath surface of water a gazed expression of puzzlement anxiety on face rapidly intensified by time too action attitude have attracted attention of in boat astern glancing back at saw that nugent in launch hoskins third lieutenant in pinnace have followed example naturally did same wondering meanwhile what be at be looking so intently when mr perry suddenly turned upon demanded almost angrily say mr fortescue have become of ship d see anything of ship sir echoed dazedly for with question have come to in flash that ought by time to be able to see at least spar of psyche swaying rhythmically athwart sky out over low sandbank if still lay at anchor where have left ship sir confess ca see anywhere surely mr purchase can not have shifted berth for reason continued a absurdity of suggestion came home to of course have have enough hand left with to make sail upon ship even if be obliged to slip cable at moment hail of gig ahoy came from nugent aboard launch glancing back at saw pointing at object have suddenly appeared on ridge of spit away on port quarter be man white man seaman if one might judge from costume be waving large coloured handkerchief something of kind with evident object of attracting attention while still stood at gaze wondering what apparition must possibly mean man appeared beside down helm run boat in on bank ordered new skipper must see what mean flatten in fore aft stand by to let run halyard ordered coxswain easing helm down a spoke stepped upon stern thwart with object of getting somewhat more extended view over sandbank there be nothing to be seen stay why be spray from surf flying so much higher in one particular spot than elsewhere that spot appeared to be about abreast of part of bank where two men be standing stood moment two longer seeking explanation of phenomenon then fell headlong over man who be sitting upon aftermost thwart gathering in slack of mainsail a yard came down for at moment gig grounded on bank shot quarter of length high dry with way that have on a picked up rubbing barked elbow ruefully to accompaniment of suppressed snigger from boat crew mr perry with brief make way there lad sprang upon thwart striding rapidly from thwart to thwart rushed along length of boat placed one foot lightly on gunwale close to stem head leaped out on to sand with close at heel together raced for crest of spit even before have reached terrible truth lay plain before for there about quarter of mile to southward of on seaward side of spit lay psyche hard fast aground dismasted on beam end with surf pounding at spar rigging worked up into raft floating in swirl alongside beach while on shore opposite where lay little company have be left aboard to take care of laboured to save such flotsam jetsam a surf flung up within reach for full minute new skipper thus by cruel stroke of malicious fortune robbed of command have be for few brief hour stood gazing with stern set feature at melancholy scene then turned to said very quietly mr fortescue be good enough to go down to mr hoskins request with compliment to take boat back up river until be abreast spot where wreck lie there beach after leaving boat keeper to watch boat will take men over to other side of spit to assist in salving such matter a may come ashore having delivered message will please join yonder pointed to where little group of men be toiling on beach ay ay sir answered touching hat turned hurried down to river bank alongside other boat be now lying with lowered sail evidently awaiting order meanwhile mr perry strode off over ridge in direction of wreck quickly found mr hoskins delivered message with result that entire flotilla pushed off again headed up stream one of men having landed upon narrow spit ascended to ridge in order that might notify boat crew when must have arrived at spot on seaward side of lay wreck while burning with curiosity to learn how disaster have be brought about hurried after skipper a walked while ran managed to overtake at precise moment when mr purchase who have be left by captain harrison in charge of ship met at little distance from spot where party of salvor be at work mr purchase said skipper a two men met halted deeply regret to inform that captain harrison be dead killed morning with one other while gallantly leading to attack of strongly defended slave barracoon have body in boat yonder be intention to have buried at sea to night that perceive be no longer possible now sir perhaps will be good enough to explain to how psyche come to be where see ah sir answered mr purchase removing hat mopping forehead in great perturbation of spirit wish must tell know that of know so far a have be able to ascertain be that be cut adrift cable sir cut through a clean a whistle allowed to drive ashore cut adrift reiterated captain incredulously cut adrift really dear purchase must excuse if say that utterly fail to understand how mischief must possibly be cut adrift from where be anchored by whom surely intend to insinuate that one of ship company no certainly not interrupted purchase nothing of kind let tell whole yarn perry then will be a wise a can give opinion of affair admit be most extraordinary nothing in least remarkable occurred for hour after boat left ship yesterday morning stood aft watched through starboard stern port until have safely crossed bar disappeared behind sand spit then set hand to work upon various small job after went round ship satisfied that everything be perfectly safe snug on deck below then feeling tolerably certain that must not return until to day at earliest consequently must be necessary for to be up about during greater part of coming night went below turned in standing to get a much sleep a possible leaving boatswain mate in charge of deck together with midshipman keene parkinson day passed quite uneventfully everything went perfectly smoothly ship rode easily to anchor there have be nothing to report about two bell in first dog watch noticed that sky be beginning to look bit windy away down in western quarter nothing to speak of understand to cause uneasiness made take look at barometer saw that have dropped trifle since eight bell at same time wind be distinctly freshening swell gathering weight of course meant more wind within next few hour therefore kept sharp eye on barometer when at four bell found still dropping decided to let go two stream anchor a precautionary measure while have light enough to see what be doing did at same time paying out extra fifty fathom on cable after felt that be perfectly safe in face of anything short of hurricane new skipper nodded approval said nothing purchase proceeded with story well a probably noticed shortly after sunset wind breezed up quite strongly be not in least uneasy for barometer have ceased to drop before eight bell although sky be overcast night very dark there be nothing threatening in look of weather be only occasionally that really tautened out cable still made up mind to remain on deck night having have good spell of sleep during day a night wore on wind held fresh steady felt that after really need not have let go stream for bower alone must have held quite easily against six time a much wind sea a have may therefore perhaps be able to picture to yourself amazement consternation when few minute before six bell in middle watch became aware that ship be adrift fast driving down toward breaker how did discover that ship be adrift did feel cable parting demanded skipper answered purchase never felt anything of kind suddenly noticed that be falling off canting broadside on to wind sea so knew at once that something be wrong that in fact have in incomprehensible way struck adrift therefore sang out to thompson boatswain mate to pipe hand to make sail intending to run into river if possible by time that have got mizzen fore topmast staysail upon be loosing main topmast staysail be in first line of breaker moment later struck heavily then big comber came roaring in broke over lifted up swept shoreward good twenty fathom struck again with such violence time that three mast went over side together after that have very bad half hour for roller came in swept clean over carrying away everything be movable smashing bulwark flat hammering poor old barkie so furiously upon sand momentarily expected to go to piece under foot to add to difficulty be so intensely dark that must not see where be true water round be ablaze with phosphorescence enabled to discern land of sort lay about couple of cable length to leeward of be quite indistinguishable water between be leaping spouting so furiously that did not feel justified in making attempt to get men ashore especially a be then being swept so heavily that have work cut out to hold on for life about hour later however tide turned began to ebb then matter improved bit be not until daybreak that be able to do anything really useful then hand of got to work built raft of sort after got up good supply of provision water sail to serve a tent light line in short everything likely to be useful managed to get ashore without very much difficulty before left ship have cable hauled in through hawse pipe examined most carefully be unmistakably cut through clean cut sir evidently done with sharp knife at about level of water edge most extraordinary commented perry presume nobody saw anything immediately before went adrift afterwards boat anything of kind mean to account for affair answered purchase nothing yet be not only wide awake on alert myself took care that anchor watch must be so also for felt responsibility of having such ship a psyche to take care of with only twenty hand told to help of course agreed skipper did succeed in getting everybody ashore safely yes thank god answered purchase fervently be safe sound very little worse for adventure thus far ah that at least be good news remarked perry well continued there be one very melancholy duty demanding immediate attention mr purchase namely interment of captain harrison other poor fellow who fell during attack upon barracoon to day will see about matter personally by choosing suitable spot getting graf dug for will soon have darkness upon meanwhile will be good enough to get tent rigged such other preparation made a may be possible for comfort of hand especially wounded during coming night for have have very trying day be imperative that must secure good night rest mr fortescue come with if please now during progress of foregoing conversation boat party have not be idle for a soon a fact of wreck have become known to mr hoskins third lieutenant seeing how matter stood have grappled with situation by causing gun ammunition store of kind to be landed from boat craft to be hauled up high dry upon beach on river side of sand spit then leading men over ridge to where others be at work upon salving of wreckage from surf have detailed party to pick out from among pile of heterogeneous article such thing a be most needed to meet more immediate want carry drag up slope to spot henderson surgeon have already selected a most suitable spot for camp be toward party mr perry now directed step when have joined skipper picking out dozen of most handy men gave instruction to provide with tool of sort suitable for purpose of digging couple of graf in loose yielding sand above level of high water mark while be doing under supervision companion wandered away by in search of suitable site for graf a matter of fact there be very little in nature of choice entire spit at least portion of occupied consisting of loose sand sparsely covered along ridge far few yard on side of with kind of creeper with thick tough hairy stem large broad leaf upper surface of bristled with hairy spicule about quarter of inch long plant be evident bound otherwise loose drift into sufficiently firm condition to resist perpetual scouring action of wind be in portion of spit therefore that mr perry gave order for two graf to be dug presently little gang of twelve be busily engaged in scooping out two hole twenty foot apart to serve a graf be obliged to work with such tool a came to hand consisted of splintered piece of plank boat balers wooden bucket have come ashore under such circumstance task of excavation be distinctly difficult more so that sand ran back into hole almost a fast a be scooped up thrown out at length by dint of strenuous labour depth of three foot be reached just a sun rim touched western horizon flung trail of blood athwart tumble of water lay between then exigency of occasion admitting of further delay task be suspended hand knocked off work body having meanwhile be enclosed in rough coffin very hastily put together by carpenter mate fell in gig crew shouldered late captain coffin while six of mate acted a bearer to other dead man with mr perry leading way reading burial service from prayer book appeared always carried about with marched slowly solemnly bare headed up slope of sand spit to spot have be selected for last resting place of dead arrived there two coffin be at once deposited in respective graf when new captain standing between two hole somewhat hurriedly completed ritual for light be fading fast whereupon after bestowing final parting glance at rough uncouth box concealed beloved chief body turned slowly reluctantly away to retrace step back to apology for camp be to shelter for night leaving fresh party of worker to fill in graf in arm of british fighting service do men unduly dwell upon loss of fallen comrade for be quite justly held that man who yield up life in service of country have done glorious thing whether fall in pitched battle deciding fate of empire in such obscure scarcely chronicled event a attack upon slave factory be where such be possible laid in last resting place with honourable observance circumstance permit memory be cherished in heart of comrade whether fame pas with echo of last volley fired over grave outlives brass of tablet record name deed there be room for grief wherefore when got back to camp have made best possible arrangement for coming night there be little reference in conversation to tragic event of past twenty four hour mr perry took up rein of government matter proceeded precisely a must have done have captain harrison be still alive among camp be naturally exceedingly primitive affair living sleeping quarter consisting simply of sail cut from yard stretched over such support a must be contrived by inserting lower end of spar plank in sand lashing upper end together structure dignified with name of tent exigency of situation did not permit of observance of such nice distinction of rank in matter of accommodation a exist under ordinary condition therefore came about that of midshipman berth be lodged for night in same tent a ward room officer consequently heard much of conversation passed between particularly at dinner meal consisting of boiled salt beef pork with few sweet potato duff made of flour damaged by sea water with few currant raisin dotted about here there in be served upon psyche mizzen royal stretched upon bare sand in centre of tent partook of squatted round sail cross legged on sand finding way to mouth by light of four ship lantern symmetrically arranged one at corner of sail naturally enough mr purchase now ranking a first lieutenant vice mr perry acting captain having told tale of happening have resulted in becoming castaway be anxious to hear full particular of what have befallen boat expedition mr perry proceeded to relate to a sat round table when have finished there be silence for moment then purchase looked up said think very strange that experience throughout must have accorded so ill with information captain harrison acquired at so much trouble personal risk hitherto have always happened that such information a have be able to pick up have proved to be accurate in particular yes agreed mr perry have have be thinking good deal about to day opinion have arrived at be that harrison played game once too often with result waved right hand comprehensively about indicating tent makeshift dinner condition generally what mean be continued in reply to purchase glance of inquiry poor old psyche a know be phenomenally slow ship yet success since came on coast have be greater more brilliant than of other vessel belonging to squadron why because have trick of always turning up on right spot at right moment now seems to that peculiarity of hers can scarcely have escaped notice of slave trading fraternity because be so very marked imagine that must often have wondered by what mean gained information when at thing have become so unmistakable a to provoke conjecture discussion must not take long to arrive at very shrewd suspicion of truth when once matter have reached stage discovery must not possibly be very long delayed captain harrison be undoubtedly well known figure in sierra leone be of so striking personality that must not be otherwise be of opinion that at length disguise be penetrated be recognised in one of flash place in freetown be especially patronised by individual of shady doubtful character scheme be devised for undoing have succeeded only too well in word believe that whole of information upon acted when arranging most unfortunate expedition be carefully fabricated for express purpose of bringing about destruction of ship be confided to by one who have recognised a captain believe purchase that be cut adrift last night either by individual who spun yarn by emissary emissary of who have lurking place somewhere in neighbourhood if truth must be got at believe must be found that schooner saw come out of river on day before yesterday captain be led to believe be decoy intended to draw off coast be actually chock full of slave by jove ejaculated purchase what very extraordinary idea think so at cut in hoskins before mr perry must reply may seem so to purchase because have just be presented to fresh unexpectedly a be when arrived at king olomba town yesterday morning found slave barracoon there must confess be visited by such suspicion a of captain perry have just be speaking although in case did not take quite such concrete connected form to mind there be only one thing against theory sir continued turning to skipper be existence of factory on lagoon yes agreed captain admit that to be somewhat difficult to account for yet perhaps not so very difficult because if fellow who gave captain harrison information upon acted happened to have grudge against owner of factory must naturally be more than glad if while groping about in search of imaginary slaver barracoon must stumble upon real thing destroy however be mere idle conjecture may be either well founded opposite there be one indisputable fact about business be unless mr purchase be altogether mistaken for moment believe that psyche be last night cut adrift from anchor wrecked by somebody who must have lurking place in immediate neighbourhood intend to have hunt for somebody to morrow chapter five battle of sand spit a evening progressed became evident to that new captain have developed very preoccupied mood fell into long fit of abstraction often answered very much at random such remark a happened to be addressed to appeared to be turning over puzzling matter in mind at length that matter came to surface found expression in speech mr purchase said have be trying to put two two together in other word have be endeavouring to find explanation of puzzle business of wreck of psyche present can understand quite clearly that poor captain harrison be deliberately deceived misled by certain person in sierra leone in order that ship might be cast away why here particularly for if theory be correct that supposed decoy schooner actually sailed out of river with full cargo of black ivory there must certainly be barracoon somewhere close at hand from drew supply people who planned destruction of sloop must scarcely have be so short sighted a to have overlooked fact that happening must leave here stranded in close proximity to slave factory presumably must be most anxious must remain undiscovered by be point can not understand have come to conclusion that theory with regard to schooner must be altogether wrong there must be something else in wind that in short wreck of sloop be only part instead of whole of plan what about barracoon destroyed to day sir asked purchase might not that be place from fellow draw supply of slave might of course admitted skipper same believe be for people who supplied captain harrison with false information must surely know enough of method to be certain that failing to find anything in nature of slave factory at king olomba town must not leave river again until have thoroughly explored if knew river at must also know that factory on camma lagoon must scarcely be overlooked by in own mind feel convinced that factory destroyed to day be not one in fellow be interested there be one somewhere in river will not leave until have discovered destroyed that only brings back to point from started once more raise question why did cast away within few mile of other factory be persuaded exists be that place be so strongly fortified that be confident of inability to take be there something else at back of of have not yet got inkling purchase shook head hopelessly upon word sir answered be quite impossible for to say when come to put matter like that becomes a inexplicable a chinese puzzle what be own opinion have be able to form one at answered skipper matter be puzzling enough to convince that must be folly on part to assume that casting away of ship be beginning ending of adventure therefore will neglect precaution mr purchase lest find landed in even worse predicament than present one first most important precaution must be to maintain strict watch throughout night need not be very strong watch must be vigilant one therefore watch will be kept under supervision of officer who will be responsible for vigilance of men under moreover hand must see that musket pistol be loaded ready for instant action for must not be very difficult matter to surprise camp of ours sometime during small hour just come outside with let take look round result of above conversation look round be arrangement that night be to be divided into five watch of two hour beginning at eight o'clock in evening ending at six o'clock in morning watch to consist of twelve men fully armed who be to act a sentry half of being detailed to watch river in neighbourhood of boat while other half kept watch ward over land approach to encampment being stretched across narrow isthmus in open order from water edge on river side to on sea side watch be commanded by officer with midshipman under general order be to fire single shot at first sign of anything of alarming character then retire upon camp if attack must threaten to cut off outpost from main body first watch be taken by captain with for subordinate be given command of party of six guarding shore approach to camp while skipper took party mounting guard near boat a be opinion that if danger threatened be most likely to come by way of river instruction be to march men out to distance of not more than two cable length from camp there take such cover a might be possible at first sight did not appear that there be least bit of cover of description available for spit peninsula on be encamped be just bare sand for distance of fully mile from spot whereon camp be pitched then there began growth of scrubby bush gradually became more dense a one proceeded in southerly direction solved difficulty by causing man to scoop little pit for in loose sand in be easy for to crouch perfectly concealed particularly a there be moon light from star be not strong enough to reveal object at distance much beyond quarter of mile first second third watch passed uneventfully fourth watch be little more than half through when about quarter after three o'clock in morning whole camp be roused from slumber by sound of musket shot one from party guarding boat river approach quickly followed by three in rapid succession from contingent occupied sand pit stretched across neck of peninsula then three four more shot from river party spurted out began to dawn upon that matter threatened to be serious of course none of have thought of discarding of clothing night second shot therefore have scarcely pealed out upon night air before in camp be upon foot with weapon in hand drawn up in regular array ready for next move in game with skipper in command where be mr fortescue mr copplestone demanded captain looking about a soon a first momentary bustle be over here be sir answered stepping forward mechanically touching hat here be sir answered tom copplestone suddenly appearing from nowhere in particular mr fortescue ordered captain take to heel run out to mr nugent a fast a can ascertain from reason for firing from party ask whether requires assistance then return to with reply a quickly a possible mr copplestone will run down to boat with similar message to mr marline away went a fast a must lay leg to ground copplestone down hill toward river beach along sand spit making upward gradually toward ridge a ran running in fine heavy sand be however horribly exhausting work especially to one whose only mode of taking exercise be to stump lee side of quarter deck during watch be soon so completely blown with best will in world to hurry be brought to walking pace before have made twenty fathom from starting point two more shot rang out from party by boat moment later one of boat gun began to speak looked out over river striving to discover what disturbance be about thought must dimly make out several dark blur on faintly shimmering surface of water conjectured must be canoe must not be sure meanwhile business be not with be with nugent party from whom a struggled along two more musket shot cracked out almost simultaneously then down by river side second shot roared from boat gun time before ringing report of piece died away distinctly heard crash followed by loud shriek much splashing out somewhere on surface of river few second later panting gasping for breath staggered up to figure have made out standing upright motionless on crest of spit found to be nugent with drawn sword tucked under right arm while with hand held night glass to eye who go there demanded sharply wheeling round seizing sword a heard noise of panting behind friend answered sk captain desire to know why be firing out here whether require assistance oh be that fortescue right just take night glass will sweep face of spit carefully at about two hundred yard distance from here then tell if can see anything answered nugent if come to why be others firing down by boat ca say for certain answered a took proffered night glass raised to eye believe suspicious canoe boat have hove in sight be just giving hint to keep distance ah just so returned nugent now be firing because although ca be absolutely certain in darkness think that there be body of men out there who must be not altogether disinclined to rush camp if gave opportunity so be just potting at what fancy to be whenever get clear enough sight of just a hint that be awake a to assistance n think need at least not at present must do so later on will blow blast on whistle of mine produced from pocket whistle possessing particularly shrill piercing note with have be wont to summon cupid to midshipman berth aboard psyche when individual presence have be needed with especial urgency well d 'ye see anything demanded after have be peering through glass for full minute more be really not at certain whether do not answered still working away with glass thought moment two ago caught sight of something in motion for instant be so abominably dark a say that stay moment what be dark mass out there stretching across ridge remember having noticed anything there before nightfall dark mass reiterated nugent what dark mass d mean there be nothing out there so far a by jingo there be though sir can see now wi ' naked eye exclaimed seaman who be crouching in sand pit yard so distant from where nugent be standing there ye see mr nugent stretchin ' athwart back of spit why can make out quite distinctly give glass demanded nugent snatching instrument from applying to eye for eight ten second peered intently through tube then exclaimed excitedly ah now have yes by jove fortescue be right there be something out there look like like ay be too body of black creeping along toward on stomach why there must be hundred of 'em by look of reach right across spit yes will certainly want help plenty of to keep fellow at arm length thought be only twenty thirty when first made out yes cut away to skipper fortescue a hard a can pelt tell what have seen say that will be obliged if will kindly send a many men a can spare disturbance down by boat seems to have ceased so ought to be able to send pretty strong reinforcement right said will tell then comeback with men away went back through heavy sand at racing pace delivered message captain listened patiently to breathless somewhat disconnected story then turned to mr purchase who be standing close at hand said mr purchase have goodness to take entire port watch go out to mr nugent assistance allow men to fire away ammunition recklessly for have very little of let man pull trigger until be quite certain of hitting mark ay ay sir answered purchase port watch follow away following trudged into darkness be making to join skipper happened unfortunately to see called back mr fortescue said mr copplestone will please remain with may want one of to run message for presently so remained at once ranged up alongside copplestone for be anxious to hear news from marline down by boat well tommy said what be old marline blazing away at whatever be managed to hit for smash yes answered copplestone be more case of luck than of good shooting for be a dark a wolf mouth of men however have eye keen enough to see that there be whole flotilla of boat canoe something of sort hovering in river manoeuvring in such fashion a to lead to suspicion that have design upon boat so dosed with few charge of grape caused to sheer off one time a cupid be wont to remark what be row with nugent lot of nigger creeping along spit on stomach toward answered got idea of rushing camp for sake of plunder in expect now that mr purchase port watch have gone out to back up think need not hillo that sound like business though mistake ejaculation be caused by sudden cracking off of six eight musket one after other closely followed by heavy if slightly irregular volley next instant air seemed to become positively vibrant with perfect pandemonium of shriek howl yell shout a of men engaged in close desperate conflict skipper pricked up ear clapped hand to sword hilt then turned to where tommy be standing close beside mr copplestone said take twenty men first can pick go with to support mr marline for fancy will need little help presently rest of be going out to support mr purchase mr nugent ay ay sir answered tommy picked out first twenty men must lay hand on taarched off to join mr marline picnic a expressed rest of went off at double to take part in scrimmage be proceeding in neighbourhood of sand pit very pretty scrimmage be if one might judge from tremendous medley of sound reached from direction firing be now very irregular intermittent there be plenty of yelling shrieking mingled a drew nearer to scene of fray with sound of gasping a of men engaged in tremendous struggle quick ejaculation running fire of forecastle imprecation occasional sharp order of officer to rally here lad dull sickening thud a of heavy blow crashing through yielding bone here there groan cry for water be evident that fight have resolved into desperate hand to hand struggle seemed to that lad be being hard put to to hold own worst feature of whole affair to mind be that darkness be so intense that be almost impossible to distinguish friend from foe reached scene of struggle so much sooner than have expected that be impossible to avoid conclusion that people be being steadily forced back in direction of camp afterwards found to be correct appearance of skipper with reinforcement soon put face upon matter be evident that foe consisting of hundred of negro savage have be under impression that be fighting entire strength of british when came up at once discovered mistake with knowledge that for aught must tell there might be further reinforcement waiting to take hand in game somewhat damped courage not by mean at once however indeed be not for perhaps two three minute after appearance upon scene that first actual check upon advance occurred for appeared to number seven eight to one of moreover be picked warrior in very prime of life brave fierce determined fellow one of well armed with spear shield war club in case most formidable kind of battle axe spread out right left cut in wherever can find room ordered skipper a plunged stumbling gasping into midst of fray there be difficulty in obeying order for narrow a sand spit be be yet too wide for mr purchase port watch to draw close cordon across there be gap of fathom more in width between of men gap be rapidly widening a poor wretch went down transfixed by broad bladed spear be clove to shoulder by terrific blow of axe have brain dashed out by war club a contingent arrived man chose enemy there be difficulty in doing pulled trigger upon generally bringing down for be too close to miss after became literally hand to hand fight using discharged musket a club while others flung away trusted to cutlass one two at least for saw close alongside depended entirely upon weapon with nature have provided first dealing enemy knock out blow with clenched fist then dispatching with one of own weapon a for still have brace of pistol cutlas with have provided when setting out upon ill starred boat expedition up river made play a best must with bowling over savage with of pistol then whipping out cutlas for time did pretty well on side of not only holding ground actually beginning to force enemy back at length huge savage loomed up before with war club raised to strike only chance seemed to be to get in cut thrust before blow must fall accordingly lunged out at great brawny chest fellow be keen eyed active a cat sprang to one side avoiding thrust at same instant brought down club upon blade with force shattered latter like glass made arm tingle to extent for moment at least be powerless in right arm then quick a thought swung up huge club again with evident determination to brain disarmed defenceless did on y thing be possible be to spring at great throat grip with left hand pressing thumb hard upon wind pipe be like child in hand shook off with scarcely effort a went reeling backward saw club come sweeping down straight for top of head at precise instant something seemed to flash dully before eye in momentary gleam of starlight sharp tchick came to ear few spot of what felt like hot rain spattered in face great savage knee doubling beneath reeled backward with horrible groan crashed to sand with cupid axe quivering in brain while club flying from relaxed grasp caught on left forearm have instinctively flung up to defend snapping bone like carrot then whirling over catching blow upon head that stretched senseless before fell have become conscious that through distracting noise of fight raged around must hear sound of renewed firing spluttering out from direction of boat when sens returned to day be apparently three four hour old for shadow of certain object upon eye happened to fall a first opened be if anything trifle shorter than object be sure indication that sun stood high in heaven be lying with number of other people in large tent like structure ward room officer have used on preceding evening hutchinson ship surgeon be busily engaged in attending to hurt of seaman who lay not far from be first general impression that gained of surroundings with recovery of consciousness next be that left arm be throbbing burning with dull aching pain from wrist to shoulder be firmly bound up strapped tightly to body that head also ached most abominably be likewise swathed in bandage be parched with thirst be increased by sound of man drinking eagerly at great distance from turning head painfully in direction of sound saw jack keene fellow mid administering drink out of tin pannikin to man whom presently recognised a nugent master mate who poor fellow seemed to be pretty near last gasp jack called feebly might bring drink presently when have finished with nugent will how be feeling nugent not very badly hurt hope saw nugent lip move a though attempting to answer sound came from while keene glancing towards shook head laid finger upon lip a sign took must not attempt to engage poor fellow in conversation right fortescue said in low voice will attend to in brace of shake laid nugent head very gently back upon jacket have be folded to serve a pillow then refilling pannikin from bucket stood close at hand came to feeling bad old chap asked a raised head placed pannikin to lip emptied pannikin before attempting to reply then said not so bad might easily be jolly sight worse bring drink jack there be good boy be like nectar ah glad enjoyed be reply will have to wait spell for next drink hutchinson order to be that water be to be administered to fellow very sparingly a be drawn from river be probably none too wholesome what be hurt broken arm cracked skull so far a know answered what be matter with poor nugent added in whisper look a though be about to slip cable jack nodded yes poor chap whispered chance of weathering ripped open by one of broad bladed spear ca possibly recover well must go look after other patient be acting surgeon mate know be mate ejaculated why surely mean to say that murdoch have be bowled over too do not so bad a answered jack be away with rest in boat skipper gone to pay return visit to fellow who beat up quarter last night now really must be off know go to sleep if can will do good in world go to sleep yes be excellent advice did not seem able to follow just then throbbing aching of arm racking pain of sore head be altogether against to say nothing of continuous groaning moaning of injured men round about occasional sharp ejaculation of agony extorted from unfortunate individual who happened at moment to be under surgeon hand so instead looked about endeavoured to form idea of extent of casualty during past night judging from what saw must have be pretty heavy for counted twenty three wounded including realised that there might be others elsewhere for tent in lay be full there did not seem to be room enough for patient in without undue crowding even supposing that comprised sum total of wounded there must have be large proportion of dead in so desperate affair a of past night estimated that in so obstinately contested fight a in have sustained injury against such tremendous odds a be opposed to there must have be at least half a many dead a wounded must make casualty up to thirty five very heavy percentage out of crew owing to various cause be already before fresh misfortune growing short handed when to came to be added casualty sustained on preceding day in attack upon barracoon seemed to that new captain must have little more than mere handful of men available for service on fresh expedition upon have embarked for did not suppose that have gone off taking with sound man leaving camp wounded entirely unprotected exposed to renewed attack by savage after about hour absence jack came back to again gave draught of water so greatly refreshed that excitement uneasiness under have be labouring since first visit gradually subsided ache pain grew rather more tolerable thought grew first more placid then gradually more disconnected wandering away from present into past to more agreeable theme memory of past incident became confused finally slept must have slept three four hour for when awoke be undoubtedly afternoon hutchinson have completed gruesome labour be sitting not very far away entering note in notebook few of le seriously wounded be sitting up partaking of soup broth of kind out of basin pannikin anything of kind came most handy sight of people refreshing reminded that be beginning to feel need of food called out to doctor to ask if might have something to eat drink at once rose up came to felt pulse looked at tongue prescribed small quantity of broth jack keene presently brought found delicious may here mention that several day later became aware that same broth origin of puzzled at moment though not enough to prevent from taking have be prepared from kind of tortoise existence of in large number on spit hutchinson have accidentally discovered that very morning in pursuit of have sent out two of most slightly wounded with sack instruction to catch bring in a many of creature a must readily find while be taking worthy medico stepped to where nugent be lying bent over poor fellow feeling pulse watching white pain drawn face then rising softly went into dark corner of tent where appeared medicine chest be stowed away quickly prepared draught brought held to lip of patient tenderly raising head of latter to enable to drink then having replaced sufferer head upon makeshift pillow bent over murmured few word in dying man ear what be know not did catch nugent response effect of brief colloquy be that hutchinson drew from pocket small copy of new testament after glancing here there at opened page finally began to read in clear voice very impressively fifteenth chapter of first epistle to corinthian reading through to end a proceeded saw poor nugent slowly painfully draw up hand have lain clenched upon sand beside until be folded upon breast in attitude of prayer when at length hutchinson with steady voice with tear trickling down cheek reached passage thanks be to god giveth victory nugent lip began to move a though be silently repeating word chapter ended hutchinson remained silent for few moment regarding patient who evidently believed be praying suddenly nugent eye opened wide stared up in surprise at canvas roof over head a though beheld wonderful sight colour flowed back into cheek lip gradually face became illumined with smile of ecstatic joy yes murmured thanks be to god giveth victory victory victory a spoke voice rose until final word be shout of inexpressible triumph then colour ebbed away again from cheek lip film seemed to gather over still open eye death rattle sounded in patient throat gasped once a if for breath then look of perfect ineffable peace settled upon waxen feature nugent gallant soul have gone forth to join rank of great captain of salvation chapter six find new quarter be about hour after nugent death that young parkinson who have be engaged somewhere outside tent came in said to hutchinson launch under sail with only about dozen hand in have just hove in sight from somewhere up river none of other boat seem to be in company a be flying ensign at peak launch may be mentioned be rigged a fore aft schooner suppose be right be to be hoped so fervently responded medico goodness know want anything further in nature of disaster have have quite enough of sort of thing already must distinguish feature of of people in boat sir answered lad have glass with be there such thing knocking about anywhere here in tent wonder yes answered hutchinson will find mr nugent somewhere about be picked up brought in by fatigue party morning might take if can find see if can distinguish officer in boat glass ought to be somewhere over there parkinson went to spot indicated proceeded to rummage among heterogeneous article have be recovered from scene of previous night fight soon routed out instrument of be in search with went to opening of tent from launch be by time visible applying telescope to eye focussed upon fast approaching boat stared intently through tube yes said at length can make out mr purchase in stern sheet with rawlings coxswain alongside of there be cupid ugly mug acting a figure head to boat beggar be grinning like cheshire cat can see double row of ivory distinctly so expect there be nothing much matter presently from where be lying launch slid into view coming down stream at great pace under whole canvas driven along by breeze laid over gunwale to be edging in toward side of river a watched movement crew suddenly sprang to foot apparently in obedience to order foresail mainsail be simultaneously brailed up at same moment that staysail be hauled down then helm be put up swerved inward toward beach upon grounded minute later then mr purchase rose to foot sprang up on thwart striding from one to other finally sprang out upon beach up followed by cupid made way toward tent couple of minute later stood in entrance waiting for eye to accustom to comparative darkness of interior well doc exclaimed cheerily how have thing be going with to day quite a well a must reasonably have expected taking thing into consideration answered hutchinson poor nugent have passed away went about hour ago rest of wounded be doing excellently how have thing gone with where be others left behind busily preparing quarter for contingent answered purchase have have pretty lively time of can tell since left here morning searched bank of river for dozen mile more exploring creek in search of gentry who attacked from river last night who undoubtedly put savage up to shore attack upon camp eventually found snugly tucked away in big lagoon about twelve mile from here entrance of be so artfully concealed that might have passed within hundred fathom never suspected existence splendid place be for carrying on slave traffic large open lagoon with average of about fifteen foot of water everywhere fine spacious wharf with water enough for ship to lie alongside two spanking big barracoons regular village of well built house in fact finest most complete slave factory have ever seen well arranged defence too battery of four nine pounder house loop holed for musketry garrison of about hundred of most villainous looking portuguese spaniard half breed one need wish to meet be evidently on look out for have be watching day expect opened brisk fire upon moment that hove in sight luckily for shooting be simply disgraceful managed to effect landing with only two three hurt then came tug of war beggar barricaded inside house blazed away at at short range then of course people began to drop perry must take refusal landed boat gun dragged forward blew in door one after other stormed house carried in succession at sword point after that be plain sailing very grim work doc can tell people have got blood up went for dago like so many tiger lasted about quarter of hour after have blown door down believe that more than dozen of other side escaped of course too suffered heavily there be lot of fresh case waiting for be working like trojan now have come to fetch contingent away out of there be fine big airy house that murdoch have turned into hospital where wounded will be in clover comparatively speaking so if mind will get to work at once shift quarter before nightfall sooner said than done a have surmised party of twenty unwounded men under boatswain have be left behind by skipper to look after camp when have gone away early in morning men be now called in to convey most seriously wounded down to launch while le seriously hurt helped other in way whole of occupant of camp be got down to launch placed on board in about twenty minute then hutchinson caused medicine chest to be taken down to boat together with such other matter a thought might be useful lastly poor nugent body be taken down reverently covered over with ship ensign have be saved laid on rough impromptu platform on thwart amidships other poor fellow who have fallen in fight have be buried before setting out of boat expedition now learned final look round camp be then taken by purchase hutchinson few more article be thought worth preserving from possible midnight raider be brought down then got under way stood up river keeping in slack water a much a possible in order to cheat current be within hour of sunset when purchase who have be standing up in stern sheet of boat intently studying shore of right bank of river for ten minute gave order to douse canvas stand by to ship oar a did so waved hand to coxswain who put down helm sheered boat in toward what looked like unbroken belt of mangrove stretching for mile along bank a launch with plenty of way on surged forward opening gradually revealed presently slid into creek channel two hundred foot wide margin of be heavily fringed with mangrove at once found winding along narrow passage of oil turbid water in stagnant atmosphere of roasting heat be redolent of odour of foetid mud decaying vegetation channel proved to be about mile long curved round gradually from north easterly to south easterly direction ending in fine spacious lagoon about eight mile long by from three to four mile wide at widest point arrived in once more felt breeze sail be again set boat heading about south east close hauled on port tack toward what eventually proved to be island of very fair size fringed with inevitable mangrove heavily timbered a to interior with magnificent tree of several description among distinguished several very fine specimen of bombax handsomely weathering island with few fathom to spare standing on until must weather small low lying island to windward of on next tack then hove about stood for northern shore of lagoon by time five mile distant finally shooting in between mainland island nearly two mile long upon stood slave factory that lad have captured earlier in day whole surface of island except narrow belt along southern shore have be completely cleared of vegetation upon cleared space have be erected two enormous barracoons a purchase have said regular village of well constructed stone built house raised on massive pier of masonry with broad gallery verandah round evidently intended for occupation of slave dealer dependant fine timber wharf extended along entire northern side of island with massive bollard sunk into soil at regular interval for ship to make fast to dozen trunk buoy occupied middle of fairway whole settlement be completely screened from prying eye by heavy belt of standing timber have be left undisturbed on southern shore of island have thought that factory on camma lagoon represented last word in construction of slave dealing establishment concern be quite twice a extensive more elaborately complete in respect by time that invalid be landed be close upon sunset under purchase guidance be conducted up to largest house in place where in one of room murdoch be still hard at work attending to batch of patient be result of day work new arrival however be shepherded into room where fairly comfortable bed be arranged along two side into bed worst case be at once put turned over to murdoch care while hutchinson promptly pulled off coat took up murdoch work in what might be termed operating room however be not considered bad case be accordingly placed in smaller room ward along with about dozen others in like condition with while arrangement be proceeding fatigue party have be busy at work in secluded spot chosen by skipper at distance from house before wounded have be comfortably disposed of for night dead nugent included be laid to rest with such honourable observance a exigency of moment must permit casualty in last affair be of course by mean on british side have suffered pretty severely in three affair in have be involved since departure of boat expedition from ship total amounting to eleven killed twenty six wounded loss on part of enemy have be very considerably greater dead in last fight alone numbering nineteen killed while thirty three wounded have be hurriedly bestowed in one of house to be attended to by surgeon a soon a own people have be patched up thus hutchinson murdoch be kept busy whole of night while copplestone keene parkinson three uninjured midshipman be impressed a ward attendant to keep watch over own wounded administer medicine drink nourishment from time to time be most fortunate circumstance for hand that last factory have be discovered captured for be thus provided with cool comfortable living quarter instead of being compelled to camp out on exposed beach opposite wreck to circumstance alone may be attributed saving of several of more severely wounded to say nothing of fact that now occupied position must be effectually defended from such attack a to have be exposed on spit during previous night moreover relieved captain of very heavy load of anxiety since for fortunate circumstance of capture must have have alternative to have continued in occupation of makeshift camp on spit being impossible for to undertake boat voyage to sierra leone with so many wounded on hand be true that might have sent away launch with officer dozen hand to sierra leone to summon assistance ambition be not to be so easily satisfied have done splendid service in capturing two factory destroying one of second must also of course be destroyed when abandoned loss of psyche be very serious matter must be atoned for in shape soon allowed to be understood that be in particular hurry to quit present quarter where wounded be making admirable progress sound be comfortably housed while provision of kind be plentiful water be good excellent a be in be by mean with two such perfectly equipped factory a have found upon river be certain that slave traffic on fernan vaz must have assumed quite formidable proportion be skipper idea that before wounded must be lit to be moved one more slaver must certainly enter river when must be own fault if did not capture most careful disposition be accordingly made with object in view gig in charge of officer be daily dispatched to entrance of lagoon in order that herself concealed crew might maintain watch upon river report passage of vessel upward bound for camma lagoon while so far a own quarter be concerned everything be allowed to remain a nearly a possible a be before fell into hand in order must slaver arrive at factory there must be nothing about place to give alarm until must be too late for to effect escape a final precaution sort of crow nest arrangement be rigged up in lofty silk cotton tree have be left standing in screening belt of timber along southern shore of island in order that look out might be maintained upon approach channel during hour of daylight timely notice given to of approach of slaver to factory of be in occupation full week elapsed from date of desperate fight on sand spit with occurrence of moment save thanks to skill indefatigable exertion of hutchinson murdoch wounded be doing remarkably well two three of indeed having so far recovered that be actually able to perform such light duty a of hospital ward attendant while unwounded have be kept perpetually busy at scene of wreck salving such matter a be washed ashore transferring everything of value to quarter meanwhile ship have parted amidships be fast going to piece so that labour in direction be coming to end in course of week two there must be nothing more than rib showing here there above water few trifle of wreckage scattered along beach to tell to stranger story of disaster enemy wounded also who be sharing with attention of surgeon mate be doing well upon whole although there have be dozen death among there be few more whose hurt be of exceptionally severe character with whom issue still remained doubtful chanced that among last there be negro who seemed gradually to be sinking despite utmost effort of hutchinson to save individual named m'pandala have latterly evinced disposition to be friendly communicative to cupid krooboy who have be told off for hospital duty in house occupied by enemy wounded at length be on tenth day of occupation of island be by time well enough to be out about again although still unable to do much on account of disabled arm negro made certain communication to cupid latter deemed duty to pas on to without loss of time accordingly on evening of day after cupid have be relieved be on day duty sought out began mr fortescue sar know dem m'pandala in dere pointing with chin toward house in wounded man be lodged cupid answered can not truthfully say that enjoy honour of gentleman acquaintance who what be cupid grinned one eboe man answered employed by dem portugee to cook for look after dem

language understand bein ' well educate right said in case have better come with at once to captain will tell yarn sooner hears better did tell where cauffle be coming from way say answered cupid dat

bring dem across to de island in dem big flat bottom punt dat lay moored up by de top end ob de wharf found captain in store with mr futtock boatswain overhauling various article salved from wreck a soon a have seen that desired be ready to leave building got hold of repeated yarn that cupid have spun to krooboy confirming elaborating statement from time to time a went on answering such question a skipper put to when at length have brought yarn to end captain stood for minute wrapped in deep thought then said be very valuable piece of information that have managed to pick up cupid if must prove to be well founded will not forget that owe to be too late now mr fortescue to do anything in matter to night for will be dark in le than hour first thing to morrow morning cupid here have better take dinghy pull across to mainland endeavour to find road by cauffle will come there ought not to be very much difficulty in doing must think having found will be well for pair of to proceed along road on look out for suitable spot at to ambush party after rest must be easy there be however matter need consideration how be to ascertain precise moment at to expect arrival of slave dealer because will be hardly desirable to take party out day after day keep in bush day waiting for cauffle to come along be doing excellently well here two three day spent in bush must very possibly mean party being down with fever here cupid bursting with pride importance at finding a be member of council over captain be presiding struck in jus ' leabe dat to sar suppose gib leabe to go take ration for say free day go off by into de bush to meet dem cauffle dhen when hab met dem soon find out when dem expec ' to arribe here come back tell skipper regarded black doubtfully objected if fall in with man trader be a likely a not to shoot if not at least to seize chain on to cauffle then how must let know when to expect beggar fear ob dat sar answered cupid with grin will take care dat dem know cupid be anywhere near dem dem will neber suspec presence sar will be dere de same will take partikler care to hear eberyt'ing dat dem say so dat may know exactly when to expec dem when hab learned dat piece of information will hurry back so a to let know a early a possible don t'ink dat dere be much fault to find wid dat plan sar answered skipper smiling at black eagerness excitement provided of course that be quite confident of ability to carry through trust sar will carry through right sar answered cupid in huge delight at being specially entrusted by skipper with mission hab to gib leabe to go will undertake to carry out de enterprise to entire satisfaction very well said skipper now struggling manfully to suppress inclination to laugh outright at man high flown phraseology let be so then mr fortescue leave with to arrange matter turned away on following morning cupid having called at daylight snatched hasty breakfast of cocoa biscuit then wended way to wharf where krooboy in light marching order with three day ration proposed to supplement on way if necessary tied up in gaudy bandana handkerchief awaited in dinghy scrambling down into boat with circumspection for broken arm although knitting together again nicely be still rather painful at time very liable to break again in same place if treated roughly took place in stern sheet whereupon cupid giving little cockle shell powerful thrust off from wharf wall threw out two tiny oar by boat be usually propelled proceeded with long powerful stroke to row across to mainland at point bare half mile distant a went black informed that with view of ascertaining few additional item of information of have thought during night have looked into ward wherein friend m'pandala have be lodged have discovered a indeed more than half feared that eboe have quietly slipped mooring during night passed on into own particular happy hunting ground added cheerfully that after really did not greatly matter must probably be able to obtain required information in other way arrived at other side of inlet became necessary for to search shore for spot at bush road debouched eventually found with difficulty for like everything else connected with factory have be very carefully arranged with object of screening from casual observation once discovered difficulty in respect be at end for found that ran down into tiny indentation in shore just sufficiently spacious to accommodate two of large flat punt at time with firm ground sloping gently down into water affording admirable facility for rapid embarkation of large number of people hauling dinghy stem up on piece of firm sloping ground making fast painter to convenient tree a further precaution cupid set out along firm well beaten path six foot in width have be cleared through dense impenetrable bush hemmed in on hand tormented while by dense cloud of mosquito other stinging biting insect hovered about in cloud positively declined to be driven away walked thus about mile half when came out upon open space ten acre in extent through path ran cleared space have evidently be caused by bush fire at very distant date for few charred trunk portion of trunk of tree still reared here there undergrowth have be burned away down to bare earth be now springing up again fresh green in little irregular patch over open area spot must serve admirably for ambuscade for while be sufficiently open to permit of straight shooting there be cover enough to conceal hundred men more at need what made place especially suitable for purpose be fact that away over in one corner of clearing there grew thick dense belt of wild cactus newly sprung up fresh tough vigorous leaf being thickly studded with long strong sharp spike growing so closely together that nothing living must dare to face attempt to force passage through at event if must be foolhardy enough to try once must not attempt second time immediately occurred to cupid promptly corroborated view that if party must find make way in behind belt of cactus must be at once in natural fort from must be impossible to dislodge after further careful investigation passage be found through bush by lad must easily gain access to interior of cactus fort hold against comer there be therefore need to search place be admirably adapted to requirement once satisfied of bade cupid proceed on way in quest of approaching cauffle while leisurely wended way back to dinghy with single oar thrown out over stern sculled back to factory chapter seven la belle estelle first act upon return be of course to report result of reconnaissance to captain who after hearing what have to say came to conclusion that must personally inspect spot have selected a scene of proposed ambuscade accordingly ordering second cutter to be manned pushed off taking mr hoskins with towing dinghy be to be left on other side for convenience of cupid upon individual return when at length reached place skipper be so pleased with that at once determined to set strong party to work upon partly to keep hand employed there being by time very little to do at factory partly that necessary preparation might be completed at earliest possible moment accordingly gave hoskins who be to have charge of working party most elaborate instruction a to how to proceed what to do work be put in hand same day when hoskins party returned to quarter night former reported that whole of work absolutely necessary to insure success of ambuscade have be done that only about hour work on following day be required to complete whole of what skipper have ordered next day accordingly party crossed to mainland to complete preparation of ambuscade returning in good time for dinner with report that be now done that spot be ready for occupation at moment notice a happened be just a well that have acted with such promptitude expedition for men be still engaged upon mid day meal when cupid be seen returning in dinghy fellow have evidently travelled fast far for be smothered in dust so done up that must scarcely drag one leg after there be nothing put one out of walking condition more quickly than being pent up for long period on board ship despite fatigue be puffed up with pride importance for have accomplished mission upon have be despatched in very satisfactory manner too report be to effect that have travelled at good pace through preceding day at while still plodding forward keeping eye wide open meanwhile on look out for suitable camping spot have suddenly detected in air smell of burning wood dry leaf proceeding cautiously little further have become aware of low confused murmuring a of voice of many people together with brisk crackling sound at once recognised a of camp fire minute two later having meanwhile taken cover sighted camp proved to be a have of course expected that of slave trader unhappy victim caravan cauffle have just camped for night member be busily engaged in preparing evening meal cupid be therefore able to approach camp closely enough to catch great deal of conversation of slave trader a well a to make pretty accurate guess at number that of victim later on be able to ascertain exact number of former totalled eighty two while slave estimated to number from thousand to fifteen hundred maintaining concealment steadily working way ever closer to camp fire krooboy ultimately wriggled into position so close to spot where chief of band have seated that be able without difficulty to catch word spoken by although knowledge of spanish portuguese language be exceedingly limited yet by listening patiently to everything be said during somewhat dilatory progress of meal afterwards while leader smoked chatted prior to turning in for night be able to gather that remaining distance of journey be to be divided into three march last of be to bring party to shore of lagoon pretty early in afternoon of day following that of cupid return to then having learned krooboy have waited until leader of expedition have bestowed for night occupant of camp generally be settling to rest after hot toilsome march of past day when cautiously left place of concealment mingling with unhappy captive have contrived to communicate to several of joyful news that in due time upon arrival at certain spot already fixed upon cauffle must be ambuscaded dealer escort attacked captured after slave must be released supplied with food water to enable to return to home did said not only to comfort encourage also to put on guard against falling into panic at critical moment getting hurt skipper listened very carefully to story cross examined narrator upon several point then dismissed to get food rest same afternoon captain accompanied a before by lieutenant hoskins again visited place of ambush presumably made final arrangement for capture of cauffle what be did not know for be left behind with tompson gunner in charge of factory with instruction to overhaul stock of arm ammunition see that everything of kind be made perfectly ready for next day work when next day arrived hand be mustered for inspection prior to choosing of ambuscading party learned to disgust be to be left behind with other invalid to look after factory hutchinson having reported be not yet fit for duty although like full dozen others who have be hurt in one of recent fight be able to be up about to attend to matter not requiring use of arm slave trader be known to be a general rule determined fellow be certain that in present case with rich haul in possession must fight desperately in defence of booty skipper therefore determined to take only sound men with concluding that lame duck must be more of hindrance than help to with envious eye watched departure of skipper party in three boat namely launch first second cutter then walked moodily away from wharf to perform duty inspection of sick ward place wore unnaturally quiet deserted look a crossed great open space between wharf building have converted into hospital for there be nobody about excepting round dozen so of convalescent well enough to sit out on gallery under shade of verandah solitary watcher perched aloft in crow nest have rigged among topmost branch of one of most lofty tree on island in order to maintain watch upon lagoon give timely notice of approach of slaver sauntering quietly along for heat be already intense entered hospital building proceeded with usual daily inspection of ward found be to day in murdoch charge hutchinson having be detailed to accompany skipper party invalid be doing excellently thanks doubt in great measure to fine airy room in have be bestowed indeed be so far advanced toward recovery that murdoch have given three four of permission to leave bed go into open air for hour two be now assisting other to dress completed round of building also of in wounded prisoner be lodged be just leaving latter when caught sight of one of convalescent hurrying toward at great rate in full glare of sunshine in direct defiance of medico standing order that none of be on account to leave shadow of verandah man have very excellent excuse for breach of rule for moment that saw first took off hat waved to attract attention then flourished in direction of look out tree glancing toward caught sight of fluttering fragment of scarlet bunting be prearranged signal that slaver have entered lagoon be approaching factory moment later look out having descended tree came hurrying along to make report well edward exclaimed a man came bustling up to saluted see have made signal that slaver be approaching what sort of craft be how far off be very tidy smart looking brig sir measurin close upon three hundred ton by look of be headin ' straight for eastern end of here island clewin up furlin ' a come be under topsail to'ga'nts'ls when shinned down out of crow nest yonder reckon will reach anchorage in about twenty minute so reported man very good answered now go back to look out put piece of red bunting out of sight a quickly a possible for if slaver fellow must happen to catch sight of may suspect something be on guard wo do for with only few convalescent to help sole chance of capturing lie in use of stratagem then a man turned away hurried back to post crossed open space between wharf building giving convalescent instruction to arm at once to stand by to show when called upon entered own quarter hastily shifted from uniform into somewhat soiled suit of white pith hat have doubtless once be property of one of former inhabitant of place have appropriated in view of such contingency a present otherwise made such preparation a be possible for suitable reception of expected visitor have only just barely completed preparation when strange brig under topsail fore topmast staysail came sweeping round eastern extremity of island bracing sharp up a did so making short leg athwart anchorage toward mainland then tacking very smartly even under such short canvas a be showing headed well up for line of buoy have be laid down a mooring splendidly handled presently came up head to wind settling away topsail yard to cap a did so while crew clewed up topsail hauled down staysail glided with way still have on up to weathermost buoy to hawser be promptly run out made fast then a about dozen hand climbed into fore main rigging made leisurely way aloft for purpose of rolling up topsail light handsome gig be dropped into water from starboard quarter davit presumably hauled alongside gangway must not see a be presenting port broadside to by way noticed be garnished with five grinning twelve pounder be most beautiful vessel lying long low upon water hull painted black from rail to copper relieved only by single narrow white stripe running along sheer strake from white figure head to rather elaborate white scroll work decorated quarter be grandly sparred with very heavy lower mast long masthead painted white very taunt topmast topgallant royal mast stayed to hair with slight rake aft accurately parallel enormously long yard french ensign floated lazily from end of standing gaff a stood under shade of verandah admiring sea beauty gig came foaming round under stern propelled by four oarsman with white clad figure in stern sheet headed toward wharf alongside flight of step in presently ranged hooked on then white clad figure in stern sheet rose leisurely climbing step to level of wharf revealed a of man somewhat over middle height broadly built with hair beard moustache of raven black skin tanned almost to colour of of mulatto by long exposure to sea breeze tropical sun age roughly estimated a somewhere about forty with swaggering sea roll came striding across wide arid space between wharf side building puffing at big black cigar a walked glancing about curiously a though must not quite understand utter quietude deserted aspect of place apparently however be not sufficiently marked to arouse suspicion for betrayed hesitation a made straight for house under broad verandah of stood in full view watching approach a came within speaking distance slightly raised broad brimmed pugaree bound panama hat for moment exclaiming in execrable spanish good morning senor what have happened that see nobody about where be senor morillo must have speech with raising hat in reply answered in same language deeply regret to inform senor that morillo be indisposed down with slight attack of fever in fact a for rest be away in bush on other side whither have gone to help bring in cauffle be due to arrive afternoon will not step in out of sun thanks answered stranger ascending gallery step be sorry to hear of friend morillo indisposition slight attack of fever think said be too ill think to talk business if not will perhaps have extreme kindness to tell captain lenoir of la belle estelle have arrived must like to see assuredly will senor answered politely pray step inside here out of heat be seated while convey message to senor morillo so saying flung open door of inner room stood aside for to enter quite unsuspectingly stalked in through open door removed hat laid upon table flung into basket chair withdrawing enormous silk pocket handkerchief from pocket proceeded to mop streaming perspiration from forehead at same moment whipped loaded pistol from pocket aimed straight at left eye a stared at in amazement said be dead man captain lenoir if move so much a muscle be prisoner senor a saw by expression of eye that have in mind to suddenly spring upon disarm not movement pray to attempt what be thinking of must be fatal for upon slightest motion will pull trigger blow brain out will a surely a that be sitting there then slightly raising voice called collins bring party into room forget to bring along length of ratline that told to have ready ay ay sir answered collins reply be followed by shuffling sound of several pair of foot owner of came shambling into room next moment with naked cutlass in hand while one of carried in addition length of three four fathom of ratline meanwhile have never for smallest fraction of second withdrawn gaze from captain lenoir eye allowed barrel of pistol to waver hair breadth from larboard optic for knew that if did must be upon like lightning although dared not move limb be not afraid to use tongue angrily demanding what meant by perpetrating such outrage upon one of senor morillo best customer vowing that must not be satisfied until have seen flogged within inch of life for insolence then when explained to actual state of affair while collins man securely lashed hand together behind back temper completely got better of raved shrieked curse at until be perforce compelled to gag lest cry must reach men in boat give alarm however very soon secured silenced then having marched out at back of house secured in remote hut by gave collins fresh instruction after sauntered across open space of blistering sunshine to edge of wharf looked down into boat four men have already made fast painter to ring in wharf wall be now lolling over gunwale staring down into deep clear water at fish playing about beneath chatting disjointedly a sucked at pipe be thirsty work sitting there grilling in sun be not lad said in french come up to house drink senor morillo health in jug of sangaree then captain lenoir want to carry down fruit vegetable senor morillo have given for ship use bien come monsieur answered with one accord next moment be slouching toward house pace two in wake traversed good three quarter of distance from wharf to house then halted suddenly smote forehead violently a though have just remembered something dolt be exclaimed in french have almost forgotten indeed have completely forgotten something mate name have message for looked man nearest straight in eye ah ejaculated monsieur doubtless mean monsieur favart chief mate of course cut in favart be name thanks go on to house walk straight in will find friend awaiting a for flung out hand with expression of disgust turned back a though to return to wharf edge a soon a quartette have fairly entered house be assured by certain subdued sound that have fallen into trap have be set for turned on heel again presently found four prisoner in process of being secured be sorry lad said to in french have be compelled to resort to subterfuge to make prisoner of see be invalid here not strong enough to take ship by force therefore since be imperative that must have have be compelled to use guile however will keep word with in matter of something to quench parched throat if choose to be sensible make foolish attempt at escape will have reason to complain of harsh treatment ah monsieur anglais if have known answered one of frenchman with rather rueful smile however continued shrugging shoulder although have contrived to get hold of captain have not yet got ship before can get will be obliged to use great deal more guile than sufficed for capture for monsieur favart be sharp one assure not to be so very easily deceived can well believe answered lightly same be very much obliged to for hint will do best to profit by whereupon a turned on heel to quit house garrulous frenchman three shipmate fell upon figuratively nail heaping reproach upon unhappy man head for having warned against chief mate astuteness did not wait to hear how matter ended leaving house briskly a though be bearer of important message hurried across to wharf dropping into dinghy cast off painter sculled across to la belle estelle alongside coolly went making fast painter ascended gangway ladder stepped in on deck before anybody condescended to take notice of there be twenty men thereabout busying about deck in very leisurely manner taking off hatch hauling taut running rigging so on under supervision of very smart keen looking man dressed like skipper of ship in white man took to be monsieur favart chief mate so stepping up to where stood at break of monkey poop raised hat politely said have pleasure to address monsieur favart chief mate of vessel certainly monsieur answered bringing piercing black eye to bear upon who may be friend that find necessary to ask question thought have be here often enough to enable dweller upon yonder island to at least know jules favart by sight seem to remember ever having seen before have not monsieur answered be quite new recruit only joined just in time to witness destruction of pestilent british man o ' war wreck of doubtless observed a entered river did answered guessed of course that be wreck of psyche so affair came off right eh well did very well see how must possibly fail for have hand in devising arranging of chopped trimmed away at plan until flatter that be a perfect a human ingenuity must make take that did not come aboard here to discus matter with indeed answered business with have reference to quite affair bring message to from captain lenoir who be at present discussing with senor morillo matter of expected arrival of cauffle afternoon find in something of difficulty over matter arrival in nick of time prof most opportune for must know that when psyche be cut adrift came ashore crew be compelled to camp on beach yonder senor morillo considered that opportunity to give english thorough drubbing be far too good to be let slip therefore attacked in dead of night punished severely regret to say that side also suffered very heavily with result that good many of best men be at moment on sick list unfit for duty put in very awkward position for cauffle be arriving be big one rather difficult to handle so learn therefore in order to avoid possibility of trouble senor morillo have arranged with captain lenoir that latter will land crew to lend hand in keeping slave in order when arrive instruction from captain be to request that will at once land bringing hand except idler with understand answered favart very well when be cauffle expected to arrive may heave in sight at moment answered therefore be advisable that must lose time in obeying captain lenoir instruction trust be not man to lose time answered favart with boisterous laugh lenoir know may rely upon suppose ought to go fully armed captain lenoir said nothing about answered think there will be need for to arm yourselves anyhow if weapon be needed have plenty ashore very well so much better observed favart for have just occurred to that skipper have key of arm chest in pocket must not get at weapon even though must require ever so urgently all right may tell captain to expect at once perhaps must prefer to remain go with see that be one of lame duck did get hurt in fight with english yes said broken arm be getting better fast however dare say can scull dinghy back a sculled off unless will be charitable enough to give tow of course will with utmost pleasure answered favart away bustled forward shouting order for hand to lay aft get couple of boat into water be very great relief to to be rid of fellow for few minute for truth to tell interview be beginning to get upon nerve bit must see that french seaman estimate of chief officer be just that favart be indeed sharp one true have managed to hoodwink thus far be in constant dread of saying doing something might awaken suspicion in case fat must at once be in fire for have placed absolutely in power judged to be man who must take terrible revenge must prematurely discover that something be wrong moreover if suspicion must once be aroused verified not only did stand to lose ship be quite determined to capture with twenty stout seaman at back be fully capable of recapturing factory releasing prisoner when must find in very pretty mess thus far however everything seemed to be going admirably told that have to do be to keep nerve say do anything to excite suspicion indeed be consideration caused to hang about aboard la belle estelle rather than hurry away ashore again a soon a have delivered message there be great deal of fuss bustle on board brig while frenchman be clearing away lowering boat then with vast amount of jabber went down side took place shoved off with dinghy in tow now came critical moment when everything must be won lost for personally have done be possible rest depended entirely upon intelligence of little party of seaman to whom have entrusted carrying out of plan have explained that plan to directed what to do precisely when to do be also decoying enemy into trap prepared for foresaw clearly that if men acted prematurely thus gave alarm on other hand allowed psychological moment to pas before put in appearance whole affair be likely enough to end in ghastly tragedy while reflected thus boat traversed space of water between brig wharf ranged up alongside landing step then with more excited jabber shouting frenchman tumbled over gunwale up step to top of wharf where stood in bunch waiting for further order a last of ascended step with bringing up rear glanced across water toward spot where expected cauffle to appear pretended that caught sight of cloud of dust rising beyond tree a matter of fact there really be effect of sunlight might very easily have be mistaken for dust cloud be appearance gave inspiration to act a now did look exclaimed excitedly to favart pointing at same moment across water do see that cloud of dust yonder be undoubtedly cauffle coming along road must hurry with arrangement will be too late way monsieur favart if please come along lad led at rapid rate across open space into compound belonging to smallest barracoon straight across into barracoon panted making great show of hurry excitement frenchman streamed through gate like flock of sheep a last man entered gate to dropped bar into place blew piercing blast on whistle carried then replacing whistle in pocket drew forth pistol placed back against gate at first sound of whistle frenchman halted abruptly instinctively guessing that be signal of sort while favart turned in track flung fierce glance of inquiry at something in expression of face must have given alarm think for after prolonged stare suddenly came striding toward halt monsieur cried sharply levelling pistol at step fire look behind did so beheld eighteen english sailor armed with musket cutlass pistol file out of open door of barracoon draw up a if on parade what doe mean monsieur demanded favart glaring at murderously simply that men be prisoner monsieur answered nay move beg a frenchman seemed to be preparing for rush man who move will be shot dead without further warning be useless to dream of resistance for men be fully armed while be not therefore to save unnecessary bloodshed beg that will at once surrender see force of argument be sure monsieur favart do answered grimly of course surrender since there be nothing between being shot down oh if have only suspected when be aboard brig well what do want to do have goodness to march men into barracoon monsieur said be for hour so until can make other arrangement for disposal assure have not remotest intention of detaining there favart turned said word to men whole party then wheeled shambled away across compound into open door of barracoon be immediately shut locked upon chapter eight stroke of luck having captured frenchman next item on programme be to so arrange matter that might be at once transferred to other more comfortable quarter thus leaving barracoon free for reception if necessary of unfortunate slave now close at hand without running risk of getting better of little band of invalid be not very difficult matter for there be plenty of slave iron about place having procured necessary number of set have frenchman out of barracoon four at time ironed then marched out of compound to large empty shed must answer purpose of prison most admirably in le than hour have entire party secured in charge of armed guard of two men now remained to be done be to obtain possession of brig to accomplish chose soundest eight of party who have assisted in capturing frenchman leading to wharf step ordered down into french captain gig be of course still lying alongside wharf then stepping into stern sheet pushed off headed for brig boarded few minute later without let hindrance small number of hand still remaining on board having apparently gone below turned in moment that saw chief mate clear of ship at event when ascended gangway ladder not soul be to be seen lad therefore quickly clapped on hatch beginning with fore scuttle brig be ours then having made sure that half dozen so of prisoner down in forecastle must not get loose again went up hauled down french flag hoisting again to gaff end beneath english ensign found in flag locker thought that sight of brig with two ensign thus arranged must be agreeable sight afford pleasant surprise to people when returned from capturing cauffle have just gone five bell in afternoon watch when skipper party hove in sight at spot where bush path led down to creek where boat be moored brig of course at once attracted attention looking through ship telescope at made out captain perry standing alone on little projecting point staring hard at a though scarcely knew what to make of therefore ordered four hand into gig rowing across to where stood explained matter story took quite quarter of hour to tell for continually interrupted to ask question when have finished be good enough to express most unqualified approval of what have done winding up by saying may a well tell now mr fortescue what indeed have quite made up mind to before performance of exceedingly meritorious piece of work that be intention to give acting order a third lieutenant mr purchase mr hoskins moving up step a well a in consequence of lamented death of captain harrison of course thanked a in duty bound then informed that ambuscade have be completely successful entire cauffle having be captured with exchange of le than score of shot that although three of slave trader have be killed five wounded not one of own men have be hurt added that unhappy black be so completely worn out with long march down to coast that must only be rank cruelty to release at once that have therefore decided to house in barracoons give week complete rest before starting back on long homeward march now mr fortescue concluded since english ensign aboard prize have done work have goodness to haul down keep french flag flying if please quite expect that will have two three more ship here to help in conveyance of huge cauffle of slave across atlantic wish to be alarmed put on guard must come upon unexpectedly by seeing vessel riding at anchor with signal flying that have be captured by english be of course sound common sense lost not moment in returning to brig making required alteration in arrangement of flag that being done occurred to that must be wise thing to clear remainder of french crew out of vessel also did afterwards assisting in transporting miserable slave across channel to island helping to arrange for comfort well being during night be without exception what slave dealer must doubtless have called prime lot numbering fifteen hundred eighty four of whom le than two hundred be woman be worn to skin bone with fatigue hardship have be called upon to endure on march from own country down to coast be so dead beaten with fatigue that appeared to have sunk into such state of apathy even prospect of immediate rest plenty of good food speedy restoration to liberty seemed insufficient to lift out of after have be made to bathe thoroughly cleanse from dust other impurity of march prior to being housed in barracoons seemed to pluck up little spirit salt water bath be wonderful tonic later on in evening when plentiful meal be served out to so far recovered spirit a to begin to jabber among be close upon sunset before last batch have be ferried across to island lodged in barracoons then in accordance with order from skipper took working party on board brig casting off from buoy to have be moored warped in alongside wharf made fast there next two day be entirely devoid of incident be kept busy in attending to unfortunate captive black supervising bathing of in batch inducing to take moderate amount of exercise in barracoon compound feeding up nursing sick of whom however there be luckily singularly small percentage on morning of third day before gig have started upon daily cruise of surveillance of river look out whose turn be for duty in crow nest have scarcely ascended to lofty perch in tree when hurried down again with intelligence three craft ship barque large brigantine be in offing making for mouth of river whereupon mr purchase volunteered to go aloft taking with a aide de camp to keep eye upon stranger to transmit intelligence of movement from time to time skipper promptly accepted offer besides arranged system by be to write mr purchase message carry from crow nest to ground deliver over to one of two midshipman in waiting who must at once scamper off with while ascended jacob ladder again for further information to be transmitted by second midshipman if meanwhile first have not have time to return system acted admirably for kept captain fully informed of course of event at same time left quite free to attend to such preparation for reception of three craft a might deem necessary preparation be beautifully simple consisting merely in arming of man capable of taking part in what must probably prove to be fairly stubborn fight manning boat with fighting contingent then remaining concealed until approaching craft have come up to anchorage made fast to buoy a fully expected that must when boat be to make simultaneous dash at three craft carry by boarding while invalid be left to look after prisoner see that did not break out create diversion in favour of friend meanwhile land breeze be fast dying away in offing while sea breeze have not yet set in consequently when approaching craft arrived within about two mile of river mouth entered streak of glassy calm lay there rolling heavily with sun bleached canvas napping threadbare against mast rigging thus affording excellent opportunity to get breakfast at leisure fortify generally against stress of coming struggle have just comfortably finished meal captain perry have completed final disposition when look out who have temporarily taken mr purchase place in crow nest came down with intelligence that sea breeze be setting in might be expected to reach becalmed craft within next ten minute whereupon first lieutenant returned to post of observation to watch progress of approaching slaver report upon from time to time upon regaining perch saw that brigantine be outermost craft of three have just caught sea breeze having squared away before be coming along almost a fast a breeze then barque ship caught within minute of other presently three of be racing straight for mouth of river be still long way off owing to many twist turn in course of river must have nearly twenty mile to travel before must reach anchorage when time later having safely negotiated bar entered river arrived at point where must have to shift helm to enter n'chongo chine lagoon where be patiently awaiting saw that only two of barque brigantine be coming way while ship continued on up river presumably bound to camma lagoon where poor captain harrison have lost life in attack upon factory be distinct relief to for although wounded be doing remarkably well number of men actually in fighting trim be so small that to tackle three vessel simultaneously must have be exceedingly formidable job whereas felt that capture of two of be well within power moreover must be comparatively easy to take ship upon return down river must doubtless happen immediately upon discovery of destruction of factory to be evidently bound despite zigzag course that two approaching craft must have to steer sea breeze afforded leading wind way to south east end of island occupied consequently after leaving river entering lagoon came along at very rapid rate brigantine seeming to be rather faster craft of two meanwhile skipper being kept fully informed of progress of approaching vessel have caused prize la belle estelle to be warped far enough off from wharf wall to allow of boat being placed in ambush between wharf where now lay with officer crew already in waiting for moment when word must be given for to dash forth from hiding place at length brigantine with barque le than cable length astern of of flying spanish colour at gaff end arrived within mile of spot where must be necessary for to luff up in order to fetch anchorage whereupon purchase descended from look out having made final report to skipper went several way first to take command of pinnace in impending attack to place at head of convalescent duty being to assist a might be required to see that prisoner did not seize opportunity to become troublesome prisoner be confined in outbuilding at rear of settlement be there that little band of armed convalescent be assembled consequently be obliged to station where must keep eye upon be in touch with yet be quite determined that even though must keep one eye upon own especial command building over be mounting guard must also witness attack upon approaching slaver ultimately after two three unsuccessful attempt succeeded in finding spot from must accomplish object at same time sit comfortably in shadow of building few minute later from behind belt of tree scrub extended along whole southern shore of islet beheld end of brigantine flying jib boom slide into view with flying jib recently hauled down napping loosely in wind then followed rest of spar with standing jib also hauled down couple of men out on boom busily engaged in stowing then fore topmast staysail beautifully cut drawing like whole team of horse swept into view followed by fore part of very handsome hull bearing foremast with topsail still set topgallantsail royal clewed up in process of being furled course hanging from foreyard in graceful festoon finally came remaining length of hull with towering mainmast supporting mainsail a handsomely cut setting a flat a of yacht be most beautiful vessel sitting very low in water therefore perhaps looking even longer than actually be be broadside on to so must not see what amount of beam showed consequently be little difficult to estimate size judging from general appearance put down at about two hundred twenty ton be painted brilliant grass green from rail to copper showed four port of side out of peered muzzle of certain brass cannon decided be probably long nine vessel reached across narrow channel went in stay quite close to tree clad northern shore of lagoon thus at once exhibiting own exceedingly willow draught of water skipper intimate knowledge of locality just a barque in turn hove in sight last vessel have nothing at remarkable in appearance except perhaps that canvas be exceptionally well cut be by mean beauty to eye presented characteristic of ordinary merchantman being painted black with broad white band round upon be depicted ten painted port appearance of honesty be deceptive for despite general motherliness of aspect be almost a speedy ship a brigantine although have by time shortened down to two topsail fore topmast staysail also with aid of telescope be able to discern above blatant pretence of painted port six closed port of side have doubt concealed a many cannon brigantine tacking a smartly handily a little boat came round headed well up for weathermost buoy to made fast few minute later with barque close upon heel until latter have also made fast to buoy one astern of brigantine dead silence reigned over settlement broken only by shout of people on board two new arrival a went noisily about work of clewing up hauling down furling canvas moment that barque be fast to buoy men who have bent cable to buoy have returned on board there arose sudden rattle splash of oar concealed boat swept out from hiding place between brig wharf made dash for two craft half of going for brigantine while other half struck out for barque surprise admirably managed by skipper be complete for greater part of crew of two vessel be aloft furling canvas at moment when boat appeared although appearance served a signal for men aloft to swing off yard descend to deck by way of backstay yet before have time to arm prepare for effective resistance lad be alongside swarming in over low rail of two craft very brief scuffle sufficed to place in possession of upon inspection proved to be undoubted slaver for be not only fitted with slave deck have full supply of water meal on board in fact be ready for immediate reception of human cargo for interference must have shipped gone to sea again in very few hour barque be named don miguel of three hundred forty seven ton measurement hailing from havana with crew of fifty six told mounted twelve twelve pounder with ample supply of ammunition for in magazine brigantine rejoiced in name el caiman be trifle bigger than have estimated to be paper showing tonnage to be two hundred thirty carried crew of forty mounted eight beautiful brass long nine on broadside a well a long eighteen pivoted on forecastle hailed from santiago de cuba be quite new ship whereas don miguel be nearly twenty year old leaked like basket when heavily pressed by canvas a of soon discovered none of people be hurt in scrimmage resulted in capture of two craft a soon therefore a crew have be taken out of securely confined captain perry made ready to sally forth capture ship have gone up river might be expected to return immediately upon discovering destruction of factory on camma lagoon be regarded a just possible that finding up river factory destroyed captain might make way to anchorage in hope of securing cargo from factory on other hand be also possible that might get inkling of presence somewhere in river go straight to sea again preferring to try luck on other part of coast there be just sufficient time for lad to get meal in comfort before moment arrived for to shove off make way to mouth of lagoon in order to intercept prevent escape of returning ship skipper therefore gave order to pipe hand to dinner while meal be in progress made disposition for forthcoming expedition a before be left in charge of convalescent to take care of sick see that prisoner now of course considerably augmented in number by most recent capture did not get into mischief although be not permitted to participate in fun be in mood to lose altogether therefore waited patiently until little flotilla of boat have started service on account be no longer required then having first gone round of place satisfied that everything be perfectly safe slung telescope over shoulder made way aloft to crow nest wherein comfortably settled levelling glass over big branch served admirably a rest for prepared to watch progress of boat a hoped witness capture of ship crow nest be rigged among topmost branch of highest tree on islet view obtainable from be very extensive embracing arc of horizon of nearly one hundred eighty degree included on far right mouth of river twenty mile distant few mile of offing beyond while stretching away to left of point toward southward eastward must be traced entire course of river a far a native town of olomba thence onward to camma lagoon while near middle distance be occupied by water of n'chongo chine lagoon with in present instance boat flotilla carrying on under heavy press of canvas to fetch passage giving access to river watched for time observing with interest gallant manner in captain gig under spread of canvas be manifestly too much for in roaring sea breeze be now blowing struggled along contrived to still retain lead of bigger more powerful boat then began to search river for sign of returning ship for calculated that by time must have arrived at destination discovered destruction of factory so be question what skipper of must do upon making discovery that be not in camma lagoon be pretty evident for almost whole expanse of sheet of water be in full view from look out must scarcely have failed to see have be there therefore carefully inspected course of river more toward olomba presently caught glimpse of upper canvas sliding along past belt of mangrove bush bordered river be beating down against sea breeze with strong current under lee bow hawsing up to windward be making very rapid progress then allowed glance to return to boat wondered whether in must see ship came to conclusion that must not being by time too far over toward other side of lagoon consequently too close in to mangrove to be able to see over now most ardently wished that have thought of arranging to display signal warning of approach of ship for must be piece of information very useful for to posse under existing circumstance have not so there be use in worrying about even a came to conclusion gig still leading disappeared within narrow channel giving access to river be quickly followed by other boat until whole have vanished now must guess what be happening in channel watch movement of ship by time that last of boat have disappeared be free to again direct attention to larger craft have worked down river a far a entrance of creek giving access to olomba when next hove about soon saw by length of time that be holding on same tack that be making long leg down main channel of river still have ten mile of river to traverse before must reach spot at have be arranged that boat must lie in ambush for fast a be travelling estimated that must take at least hour to cover distance therefore drew out watch noted time then set patiently to await course of event keenly watching movement meanwhile noticed that thanks to exquisite cut of canvas be looking well up into wind thought possible that with advantage might perhaps reach spot where boat be awaiting without breaking tack must be advantage for people for must throw so close to place of ambush that must cause attack almost to take form of surprise so did a afterward learned for when at length skipper be compelled to put helm down go about in order to avoid grounding on mud of eastern bank of river ship be in very mouth of creek wherein boat be lurking while ship be in stay hand of crew be busily engaged in tending tack sheet brace people dashed alongside took almost without striking blow chapter nine leave fernan vaz of course nothing of be perceptible from look out in crow nest only thing of suggestive character came to notice be that when looking through telescope saw ship hove in stay observed that operation of swinging after yard seemed to be only partially performed while head sail remained aback for unconscionable length of time from concluded that at precise moment event be happening on board when five minute later saw yard trimmed presently observed come about again bear away for lagoon instead of holding luff down river be able to make pretty accurate guess a to what have happened remained aloft however until slid through narrow channel leading from river into lagoon when saw that have boat towing astern of in string whereupon descended for knew to betoken fact that be now in possession of people came along very fast a drew nearer saw that be exceedingly handsome vessel by far most handsome indeed that have ever seen be frigate built seven hundred forty ton measurement three mast accurately parallel raking slightly aft stayed to hair while snow white canvas be more beautifully cut than of many yacht be painted black over hull mast yard royal yard hoisted close up under truck like of man o war if be anything like a good a looked have secured prize be indeed worth having skipper have instructed that might possibly bring prize directly alongside wharf be to make necessary preparation to assist in operation accordingly turned out contingent mustered on wharf at next berth ahead of occupied by la belle estelle with ample supply of hawser heaving line at bollard by time be quite ready ship be in sight luffing round point hauling up for anchorage instead of making board across to mainland a others have done skipper kept helm down until be shiver when everything be let go at same instant square canvas shrivelled up to yard fore aft canvas be brailed in hauled down then a strong party of men sprang aloft laid out upon yard beautiful craft came sliding along with way still have on straight for wharf skipper have calculated distance to nicety for momentum be sufficient to bring handsomely up to berth not enough to impose undue strain upon hawser in checking bringing alongside part of work being done by gang while men who have captured be still aloft busily furling canvas a soon a be securely moored gangway plank rigged went aboard have good look at latest acquisition there must be no doubt a to fact that be slaver for slave deck be already fitted carried requisite including meal water for transport of very large cargo of slave be in fact largest slaver ever saw have accommodation to have almost said comfortably carry at least eight hundred slave be spanish named dona josefa hailed from havana be oak built coppered copper fastened be brand new ship worth dozen psyche cabin accommodation aft be most spacious elegantly fitted that have ever seen be armed with eighteen twenty four pounder carried crew of ninety eight told be in short most formidable ship for fact of having taken by surprise a did might have bade defiance to slave squadron for year paid for twenty time over naturally skipper be in high feather at so brilliant series of success a have met with for have not be altogether without anxious moment a to what might be result of inevitable court martial awaited for loss of psyche flattered that authority must not possibly be hard upon officer who brought in four such rich prize a ours now there began to be general talk about leaving river reporting ourselves at sierra leone for not only have ship in plenty to accommodate hand among who be most experienced felt that after having made clean sweep a have be exceedingly unlikely that there must be more chance to capture slave ship in fernan vaz for time to come still must not be possible for to go quite at once for even now there remained several matter to be attended to most important being disposal of black whom have captured from slave trader although have come long distance down from interior there be doubt that must be able to find way back to home whereas if carried to sierra leone chance be that must never see home relative again therefore although strictly speaking be duty to take to sierra leone with skipper decided to strain point if necessary give poor wretch opportunity to decide for alternative must be adopted accordingly question be put to through cupid with result that decided unanimously to return by way that came rather than trust to tender mercy of sea none of have seen few have heard of before begged few day longer in to rest recuperate before be despatched on long journey skipper cheerfully accorded although be now anxiety to get away after negro have be given full week in to recover health strength be mustered early on certain morning given good breakfast allowed to load up with a much meal a chose to take furnished with few boarding pike cutlass from prize wherewith to defend on way transported across harbour fairly started upon journey then having already completed own preparation for departure prisoner be apportioned out among four prize put down in hold on top of ballast made perfectly secure officer men then proceeded to take up quarter on board vessel to have severally be appointed by skipper captain naturally took command of josefa with mr purchase a first lieutenant mr hoskins be given command of don miguel with copplestone parkinson from old midshipman berth to bear company keep from becoming too completely satisfied with life mr marline master be placed in charge of la belle estelle with boatswain mate to assist lastly skipper be good enough to show confidence in by giving brigantine to navigate to sierra leone common destination with gunner mate jack keene a deck officer a there be not very much room in anchorage for manoeuvring got under way in succession josefa taking lead followed by don miguel after went la belle estelle while el caiman with canvas set strained at cable secured to buoy a though be afraid of being left behind have duty to perform before cast off from buoy at brigantine be straining therefore while other vessel got under way boat crew stood on wharf quietly watched go then a soon a brig be fairly clear of anchorage went with two of boat crew to leewardmost building of settlement set light to little pile of combustible have be carefully arranged in room finally thrusting blazing torch into thatch upon quitting building in same way proceeded to building in turn until entire settlement barracoons be roaring furnace of flame then bidding crew get down into boat stand by to shove off in hurry proceeded to certain spot set fire to end of slow match be protruding from box sunk into ground near wharf face after picked up heel scampered off best leg foremost for boat into sprang without much consideration for dignity gave word to shove off boat crew who be fully aware of reason for haste lost time in obeying order next instant be foaming away toward brigantine from deck of hoarse voice of tasker gunner mate now reached bawling order for for'ard to stand by to slip before be half way across intervening stretch of water dull boom resounded astern of length of fifty foot of wharf face suddenly leapt outward fell with heavy splash into water followed about minute later by second boom splash then third fourth fifth so on until entire wharf be completely destroyed whole place ghastly fire swept ruin then too turned back upon what short time before have be one of most extensive important conveniently situated slave factory on whole of west coast made sail to rejoin companion overtook about mile outside bar when have signalled commodore that mission of destruction be fulfilled hoisted general signal setting course of north west by west for cape palmas when have be acknowledged hoisted to try rate of sailing of course be same thing a giving word for race weather being moderate at time at once proceeded to pile upon respective command rag of canvas that must find yard boom stay for race proved exceedingly interesting exciting event for vessel be fast wind being off land water be smooth for first three four hour of race during time there be scarcely pin to choose between josefa brigantine first one then other contriving to get lead by length two while brig barque also made neck neck race of very gradually dropped astern until by time that have run land out of sight josefa brigantine be leading by nearly mile lead very gradually increased by time however breeze have freshened up considerably sea have got up whereupon josefa displayed so marked superiority that have to take in three royal mizzen topgallantsail to avoid running away from rest of contrary to expectation el caiman be exceedingly beamy willow vessel behaved so well under new condition that also must spare barque brig royal still keep ahead of weather remained fine made very quick pleasant passage to sierra leone where arrival under such unusual condition report of doings adventure created quite sensation also happened to arrive at most opportune moment for there be three british men o ' war in harbour at time be therefore able to undergo at once on spot trial by court martial for loss of psyche instead of being obliged to return to england for ordeal trial took place on fourth day after arrival a matter of course of who have be away in boat at time of wreck be acquitted exonerated from blame poor purchase who have be left in charge of ship be not so fortunate court finding that in first place have be negligent in that have not maintained sufficiently careful look out to preserve ship from being maliciously cut adrift that in second place have let go two stream anchor prematurely before actual necessity for precaution arose for act must have have stream anchor available to let go when discovered that ship be adrift might thus have checked shoreward drift long enough to permit of other measure being taken for safety of ship even if stream have not brought up altogether for act of negligence prisoner be sentenced to be reprimanded to lose two year seniority to be dismissed ship fortunately for purchase sentence be not quite so severe a sounded for osprey one of men o ' war in harbour happened to have vacancy for lieutenant commodore after hearing purchase story of disaster from own lip unhesitatingly gave appointment fact of three ship being in port also suggested to possibility of getting through examination forthwith therefore ventured to speak to captain perry about who very kindly explained desire to commodore commodore in turn caused few inquiry to be made when be ascertained that among three ship there be sufficient midshipman desirous of passing to justify arrangement of examination within next fortnight have satisfaction of finding full blown lieutenant meanwhile mixed commission have condemned four of prize a indeed must not avoid doing crew be sentenced to long term of imprisonment with hard labour in chain upon road then there arose question of replacing psyche on station at earnest representation of captain perry commodore be induced to take upon responsibility of purchasing josefa into service rechristening eros commissioning under command of captain perry who at once arranged for whole of officer crew of psyche to accompany then arising out of loss of psyche matter be brought to fore be destined to exercise very important influence upon fortune matter have reference to dearth of willow draught vessel in slave squadron vessel capable of following slaver in over bar of african river fighting upon equal term at moment in question have not ship in squadron drawing le than fourteen foot of water consequently when slaver entered willow river river with willow bar course of procedure a have led up to loss of psyche be imperative be very strongly felt that time have arrived for improvement in condition result be that el caiman also be purchased into service rechristened dolphin placed under command with crew of sixty told of whom however jack keene midshipman tasker gunner mate who in new ship held rank of gunner be only individual with whom have already be shipmate rest be motley crowd indeed collected out of gutter slum of freetown dolphin be arranged be to act in first instance a tender to eros later might perhaps be detached for certain special work be just then beginning to attract attention of authority there be however still matter be at moment forcing upon attention of commodore be doings of two craft be pursuing nefarious business of slaver with measure of audacity be only equalled by impunity with worked be said to be sister ship undoubtedly built from same model most probably launched from same stock made to resemble other so absolutely in respect down to most insignificant detail that be impossible to distinguish one from other excepting at close quarter one be american named virginia hailing from new orleans manned by yankee crew while other preciosa sailed under spanish flag be manned by spaniard be phenomenally fast vessel simply laughed at effort of ship of squadron to overtake have be caught in calm on three four occasion boarded by mean of boat when by curious freak of fortune if boarding party happened to be british always proved to be american that have boarded while if boarder happened to be american be spaniard that found meddling with thus a there be treaty existing between spain united state of america on one hand england united state on other conferring mutual right of search capture vessel have thus far escaped now with two such speedy craft a eros dolphin be confidently hoped that spaniard at least must soon be brought to book when there being possibility of further confusion be believed that american who in consequence of repeated disappointment have manifested disposition to leave craft severely alone might be induced to renew interest speedily capture virginia a soon a captain perry learned that special mission be to put stop to operation of notorious vessel made business to institute exhaustive inquiry in direction with object of acquiring fullest possible information relative to movement although have be unable to learn anything very definite have finally come to conclusion at least one of one must not be certain be now well on way to other side of atlantic so reasoned that if proceeded with despatch to west indie maintained careful watch upon mouth of old bahama channel must be almost certain to fall in with one other of upon next eastward trip accordingly on certain day eros dolphin sailed in company from sierra leone having made good offing caught trade wind blowing fresh to in dolphin showed rag of canvas must set while eros kept company by furling royal letting run topgallant halliard from time to time when manifested disposition to creep away from did run across in quickest time on record up to date making sombrero in fortnight almost to hour from moment of leaving sierra leone without starting tack sheet halliard so far a dolphin be concerned during entire passage now with sombrero in sight anegada only about one hundred mile ahead felt that be practically on cruising ground eros therefore shortened sail to three topsail jib signalling to dolphin to do like in proportion to close requested to proceed on board for fresh order be glad enough to obey instruction particularly one relative to shortening sail for past fortnight of carrying on have be distinctly anxious time for moreover be pleasant change to find on comparatively spacious deck of eros once more surrounded by familiar face of former shipmate there be scant time however for interchange of greeting for captain perry be in perfect fever of anxiety to complete arrangement be sooner through gangway than hustled off to handsome delightfully cool cabin under poop where over large scale chart of west indie explained to in much detail course of action that have planned for two craft in brief consisted in adoption of measure enabled while remaining within signalling distance of other day to keep effective watch upon stretch of sea forty mile wide over felt certain vessel of be in search must sooner later pas while at sunset be to close remain in touch night of course be excellent plan so far a went be open to objection that craft for be on look out might slip past unobserved during night that however be something must not be helped moreover there be moon coming must help according to captain perry calculation one other of two craft be almost certain to turn up ere that waxing moon have materially waned turn up did shortly after midnight on fifth night following arrival upon cruising ground moon be by time approaching second quarter be well above horizon by sunset be affording enough light to enable to distinguish rig chief characteristic of vessel eight mile away to very great gratification be look out aboard dolphin who first sighted being at time hull down in south western quarter reaching athwart hawse on starboard tack thus a eros ourselves be hove to also on starboard tack rapidly neared at first only thing that must clearly distinguish be that be full rigged ship a be virginia preciosa even so there be certain detail connected with rig while not being exactly peculiar corresponded with similar detail referred to in description of two notorious slaver a ascertained by captain perry therefore made lantern signal to eros under shelter of mainsail so that stranger to leeward might not see light take alarm calling attention to fact that there be suspicious sail in sight to south west signal be simply acknowledged without comment saw that almost immediately afterwards eros swung main yard boarded fore main tack hauled to wind with object of course of preventing strange sail from working out to windward of few minute later got signal from commodore instructing to remain hove to for present later to act a circumstance might require stranger be under plain sail to topgallantsails be slipping through water like witch have very little fear of outsailing eros for fast a ship have be when first fell into hand skipper have improved speed on wind nearly knot merely by careful readjustment of ballast now fully justified faith in by handsomely holding own perhaps rather more must scarcely judge for since remained to others rapidly drew away from waited with what patience must muster until stranger have worked out to position five mile ahead of two point on lee bow then determined to wait no longer for felt that if perchance anything be to happen aboard eros if for example be to carry away even spring spar trade wind be piping up strongly unknown friend might very easily give slip therefore gave order to swing foreyard make sail piling on brigantine everything must show even to royal flying jib be well that did so for hour later strangely enough fear with regard to eros be realised extra heavy puff of wind snapping consort fore topgallant mast short off at cap causing to luff sharply into wind with big flying jib dragging in water under forefoot that stranger be not anxious to make closer acquaintance at once became apparent for sooner did people perceive accident have befallen eros be within minute of occurrence than put down helm tacked endeavoured to slip away out to windward clear of dolphin however be doing exceptionally well just then combination of wind sea seemed to exactly suit felt that although have perhaps unduly delayed taking action must more than hold own with stranger provided that blew harder therefore held on grimly presently receiving signal from eros to take up chase must resume a soon a have repaired damage shortly afterward stranger reached out across bow of eros beyond cannon shot although skipper fired two blank charge shotted gun to bring to took notice fact made more determined than ever if possible to get within speaking distance of eros meanwhile having cleared away wreckage have stowed mizen topgallantsail brailed up spanker filled away again when passed three quarter of hour later about mile to windward have already sent down stump of topgallant mast have prepared topgallant rigging for reception of new spar moment that arrived in wake of stranger tacked stood directly after have not be on new tack more than ten minute when found to great gratification that dolphin despite exceeding willowness of hull be quite a weatherly vessel a chase be now nearly four mile ahead of be not until have be in direct pursuit of for full hour be able to assure that be undoubtedly gaining on yes be gaining on be so slowly that be not until sunrise next morning that be within gun shot of now in response to first shot let fly royal topgallant halliard flowed jib sheet backed main yard to allow to come up with a still carrying on rapidly approached handsome craft be busily engaged with aid of glass in discovering one after other various point of resemblance between vessel have be described to must have kicked with vexation when in answer to hoisting of ensign saw star stripe of united state flutter out over taffrail go soaring aloft to gaff end almost at same instant now being out of dazzle of sun be able to read legibly inscribed on stern word virginia new orleans with usual perverse luck have attended effort of british have dropped upon wrong ship of pair virginia be american have power to interfere with nevertheless having gone so far in matter a to bring to be determined to board get sight of paper spanish vessel might hoist american colour if happened to find in tight corner believed that might thereby escape while a for name ah that certainly be difficulty not to be easily got over ship must scarcely change name painted on stern a easily a chameleon change colour without affording indication that change have be made still slaver be up to sort of extraordinary dodge well must at least inspect virginia paper satisfy that be in order chapter ten virginia of new orleans having arrived within pistol shot of chase hove to to windward of lowered boat proceeded to board a swept round under stern in order to reach lee gangway took good look at name on counter yes there be nothing of pretence fraud about so far a must see word be not only painted upon wood be actually cut deep into a well furthermore paint have appearance of having be applied at same time a on rest of hull upon arrival alongside be somewhat surprised to observe that crew have not taken trouble to throw open gangway put over side ladder have therefore to watch opportunity scramble aboard by way of main chain virginia be very fine craft indeed measuring quite eight hundred ton carrying fine lofty full poop by rail of stood typical yankee eyeing with even greater malevolence than yankee of day be wont to exhibit toward britisher be tall lean cadaverous with long straight colourless hair reaching almost to shoulder scanty goatee beard adorning otherwise clean shaven face outer garment consisting of blue swallow tail coat with brass button white kerseymere waistcoat trouser former also trimmed with brass button seemed to have be made for man many size

be chewing vigorously when scrambled in over rail leaped down on deck a did so raised hat courteously bade good morning instead of returning greeting ejected copious stream of tobacco juice in direction so dexterously that have difficulty in avoiding then remarked waal noble britisher what tarnation mischief do yew mean by firin ' brass popgun of yourn at eh what right have yew to shoot at ship flyin ' galorious star stripe d 'ye see handsome barker of mine pointing to fine display of eighteen pounder six of side mounted in ship main deck battery waal be in more 'n half mind to give ye dose from in answer to shot yew may thank mate here mr silas jenkins for persuadin ' outer notion what d 'ye want anyway now that yew be here be hanged to ye have taken liberty to board ship for purpose of getting sight of paper answered information be that there be two sister ship vessel spanish craft named preciosa be doing roaring trade in carrying slave across atlantic be part of duty to lay hand on preciosa if can vessel answer to description in particular save that of name flag fly therefore having fallen in with felt must not be doing duty unless boarded inspected paper waal will be jiggered exclaimed skipper turning to mate hear that silas will bet yew ten dollar critter call sailor yet ca tell difference between virginia preciosa without lookin ' at paper will tell ye stranger where difference be between two vessel one on have v r g n n e w o r l e n s cut cut mind painted on starn fly that galorious flag be floatin ' up thar pointing to american ensign fluttering

able to remember little lesson in sailormanship that free born american citizen have be obliged to give ye laughed thank for nothing said now will trouble for sight of paper that be speaking of will be darned if yew will though stranger snapped sirree not much think why yew be even more ignorant than thought yew be must teach little bit of yewr business why yew goldarned britisher d 'ye know that yew have got no right at to stop from pursooin v'yage to demand sight o paper supposin ' be to report outrage to goverbeent what d suppose must happen why men o ' war must just up sink stinkin ' that comed across ah indeed retorted sarcastically very well now will have look at paper after may take step deem fit supposin ' refuse began skipper mate seeing imagine must take denial seized irate superior by arm leading right aft conversed with in low tone for nearly five minute at end of time came forward to break of poop skipper descending poop ladder remarked ungraciously waal since nothin ' le than seein paper will satisfy ye ye 'd better come into cabin will show to yew whereupon followed in through passage gave access to fine airy poop cabin plainly comfortably fitted up seated uninvited upon cushioned locker while companion went alone into state room returning minute two later with large tin box content of laid upon table thar be exclaimed pushing toward look at a long a yew like guess yew wo find nothin wrong with did inspected with utmost care ultimately came to conclusion that be genuine that ship be undoubtedly virginia american waal exclaimed yankee skipper when at length refolded handed paper back to be ye satisfied stranger intimated be then git out o ' here ye darned galoot a quick a know how snarled thank lucky star that freshen yewr way wi ' rope end then suddenly changing tune a followed out on deck saw glance round remarked purty ship ai roomy for size guess can stow away of seven hundred nigger down below not lose more 'n twenty per cent of 'em on ordinary average passage preciosa be very spit of here craft built in same yard be from same line there ai pin to choose atween now if yew be only lucky enough to fall in with stranger guess 'd be prize worth havin eh must agreed what be more friend mean to have sooner later yew say jeered waal guess yew will have to fight for afore git yew will have to find afore yew can fight for wo yew sonny

keep bright look out for brigantine waal so long stranger be bound for congo if yew be anyways anxious to know foregoing remark be made a followed to waist watched progress over rail from main chain into boat last item of information be yelled after when have put about twenty fathom of blue water between boat ship a flourished hand by way of reply to jeer turned away heard harsh nasal accent uplifted in order to crew to swing main yard haul aft jib sheet sway away t'gallan ' r'yal yard profoundly disappointed at non success bitterly mortified at insult to have be subjected by boarding yankee moodily returned to dolphin upon mounting to deck ordered gig to be hoisted helm to be put up in order that might return to eros royal of be now just rising above horizon to westward three quarter of hour later be again hove to be once more in gig on way to report to captain perry result of pursuit to say that commodore be also deeply disappointed be only stating bare truth yet be not more than half way through narrative before saw that scheme be taking shape in back of mind questioned very closely indeed upon certain point one of question having reference to point of possibility of effecting change in name of ship displayed upon stern being evident that suspicion have arisen in mind that two ship might after be one same craft sailing under different flag a circumstance might require to speak truth same suspicion have once twice crossed own mind have be completely dissipated by visit to virginia be quite convinced there must be possible tampering with name on stern while paper be undoubtedly genuine crew be a undoubtedly genuine yankee a be paper yet despite fact that suspicion have arisen in captain perry mind caused to recur in own be therefore very glad when finally said thank mr fortescue appear to have executed mission very effectively to have done everything must have done have be there of course must have preferred to have be there well have doubt result must have be precisely same now having found virginia be minded to send after to keep eye upon also to drop friendly hint to yankee cruiser that may happen to fall in with for although can not touch can ought to be exceedingly grateful for hint will ensure against making further mistake yes will follow up inch of way go into congo with unless there be very strong reason against come out again with follow right across atlantic to destination wherever may be while be doing that confident that be keeping virginia under observation will look out for preciosa endeavour to nab go have yarn with mr hoskins while prepare written instruction skipper be much longer than have anticipated over job of drafting written instruction to hoskins therefore have opportunity to discus situation at length ventured to voice suspicion that for inexplicable reason so persistently suggested to that virginia preciosa might possibly be one same vessel despite weighty evidence against supposition first lieutenant laughed at notion pronounced in highest degree fantastic said think need worry about fortescue same will have to keep weather eye lifting on expedition upon captain be about to despatch for from account of judge skipper of virginia to be exceptionally vindictive individual with very strong animus against britisher a call such men be apt to be dangerous when provoked a will pretty certainly be when discovers that be following watching therefore be on guard against may play one of ghastly trick that slaver be apt to play upon slave hunter when latter chance to fall into hand in opinion be rather too young inexperienced to be sent alone upon such job nevertheless said one must acquire one experience in way before one can posse suppose there be way in young officer can learn so quickly a by being placed in position of responsibility after there be danger in forthcoming expedition so far a can see be to follow keep eye upon certain ship do what can to promote capture will keep warning in mind never fear now suppose must say good bye for here come parkinson captain steward doubtless to say that instruction be ready be even a have anticipated parkinson be bearer of message summoning to skipper cabin where written instruction having first be read over to in order might be afforded opportunity to seek explanation of doubtful point be placed in hand be dismissed skipper final order to being to carry on if possible overtake virginia thereafter keeping in sight at cost until remainder of instruction have be carried out ten minute later be once more on deck of dolphin giving order to make sail signal to part company having be hoisted aboard eros moment that boat left side having braced up on same course a steered by virginia when last seen crowded upon brigantine square inch of canvas that spar must bear sent hand aloft to royal yard to take look round see whether must discover sign of chase a have more than suspected have completely vanished first task be now to find again to do two thing be necessary first being that must follow precisely same course that have done second that must sail fast enough to overtake therefore ordered boatswain at once to get up preventer backstay fore aft to enable spar to carry heavy press of sail then went to cabin where with chart of atlantic spread open before upon cabin table jack keene discussed knotty question of course must be steered to enable once more to bring virginia within range of own horizon point that have to consider be whether yankee friend must must not anticipate pursuit if did must probably resort to expedient to dodge if did not there be little doubt that must make best of way to port of destination if spoke truth be congo now be well within limit of north east trade wind wind at moment blowing a nearly a might be due north east piping up strong enough to make think twice before setting topgallantsail be therefore perfectly ideal weather for so powerful craft a virginia might dare not only to show three of topgallantsails also perhaps main royal therefore ultimately came to conclusion that weather being what be friend yankee must shape straight course for cape palmas with intention of then availing of alternate sea land breeze to slip along coast a far a congo being plan very largely followed by slaver on eastward passage that must only be likely to deviate from plan in event of actually discovering that be pursued consequently determined to do same issued necessary order to effect be not very long in getting preventers rigged after not only set royal flying jib also shifted gaff topsail hauling down number jib headed affair setting number in place sail nearly twice a big a other with lofty tapering head laced to yard very nearly a long a topmast then with lee rail awash in fact dipping deeply sometimes on lee roll lee scupper breast deep in water dolphin began to show what really must do in matter of sailing when called upon reeling off steady eleven knot hour after hour upon taut bowline smother of froth under bow boiling up at time to level of lee cat head foresail wet with spray to height of reef band be grand sailing exhilarating a draught of wine maddening in feeling of recklessness that begot same did not believe that be doing more than perhaps just holding own with virginia be not under such condition a that be likely to overhaul chance must come when a gradually neared equator wind grew more shy fitful nevertheless kept look out in fore topmast cross tree throughout hour of daylight to make sure that must not overtake unexpectedly carried on through night next day next with breeze still holding strong yet there be sign of chase meanwhile carpenter informed be straining ship to piece opening seam to extent that pump have to be tended for hour at time twice in watch while boatswain be kept in perpetual state of anxiety lest rigging must give way under strain at length on afternoon of fourth day after parting from eros wind began to moderate somewhat rapidly with result that by sunset lee scupper be dry although still have flying kite aloft that night watch below be able to bring mattress on deck sleep on forecastle luxury have hitherto be impossible during headlong race across atlantic now began to feel sanguine that before many hour be over must see masthead of virginia creeping above horizon somewhere ahead of for felt convinced that in moderate weather be then experiencing have heel of when next morning dawned with trade wind breathing more than gentle zephyr look out upon going aloft reported that horizon be still bare however be not to say that chase might not be within dozen mile of for atmosphere be exceedingly hazy heavy with damp heat be very oppressive relaxing to extent indeed that mere act of breathing seemed to demand quite effort after taking usual morning bath under head pump made way below to state room to dress found keene sitting in main cabin on one of sofa locker attired only in shirt trouser perspiring freely in general state of limpness be pitiable to behold morning skipper gasped say be heat awful worse even than on coast think have become of wind say suppose have made mistake in reckoning run down on to line unbeknownst have if have said severely mistake be yours master jack for a be very well aware have be entrusting navigation of ship to by way be only true in certain sense for while have given young man to understand for own benefit advantage intended to make perform duty of master hold responsible for navigation have taken care to maintain strict check upon calculation assure that be making mistake of fact be of course quite aware wherefore reply to retort be simply to change subject with celerity say old chap remarked look awfully cool comfy be under head pump a usual suppose upon word if be not for possibility not to say extreme probability of being snapped up by shark must like to go overboard in bowline be towed for hour talking of shark have noticed how often have seen beggar following since have be in ship suppose timber have become saturated a be with odour of slave have carried so hillo have happened to barometer glanced at instrument together with tell tale compass swung from skylight transom saw that mercury have sunk in tube to extent of nearly inch since last setting of vernier a be custom in slave squadron at time to set instrument at o'clock be o'clock pm meant that mercury have fallen to extent during night what be about to happen have observed nothing portentous in aspect of weather while on deck unless indeed softening away of trade wind hazy condition of atmosphere might be regarded a portent yet must hardly be for have observed same phenomenon before yet nothing particular have come of decided to have talk with tasker gunner mate get view on matter be man of very considerable experience having be sailor before be born therefore at once entered cabin proceeded to dress after returned to deck where tasker be officer of watch found sitting aft on stern grating replacing sock shoe have removed from foot at four bell in order to take leading part in matutinal ceremony of washing deck have already seen little earlier that morning exchanged greeting with therefore at once without circumlocution plunged into subject by asking what do think of look of weather mr tasker be there anything unusual about in opinion tasker rose to foot cast prolonged glance at sky before replying then said slowly ca say a see anything much out of common about so far mr fortescue wind dropped bit more than quite usual certainly know a there be very mich in then there be here thickness o ' hatmosphere well that may may not mean somethin ' see anything alarmin ' about just yet why d 'ye ask question sir be glass droppin ' at have dropped nearly inch since be set last night answered phew nearly inch since eight bell last night ejaculated old salt with air of concern that mean sir that have fallen that little lot since midnight for looked at then when mr keene relieved have dropped nothin then then what be going to happen demanded be going to have hurricane must say yes mr fortescue most decidedly answered tasker yet continued again carefully scanning sky must confess see nothin very alarmin ' up there at present s'pose mercury bag have sprung leak by chance have here sudden drop reminds of yarn shipmate of mine once told about scare have when be in sloop pyramus in indian ocean outward bound to china station scare started with sudden fall of barometer just a might be in here present case went on droppin ' until skipper began to think be booked for biggest blow a ever come away out o ' 'eavens started by sendin down royal t'gallan ' yard housin ' t'gallan mast then a mercury still went on droppin ' shortened sail to close reefed fore main taups'ls sent t'gallan mast down on deck housed topmast while work be goin ' on mercury kept fallin ' until sank out o ' sight altogether skipper have actually given order to furl taups'ls send yard mast down when cabin steward happened to make discovery that mercury bag have busted mercury from barometer be rollin ' in little ball over cabin floor mate told that time in got that there pyramus ataunto again day royal upon be never a'terwards beaten must not avoid good hearty laugh at quaint story of phenomenal fall of mercury in barometer for be easy to conjure up picture of rapidly growing alarm dismay of captain a watched steady speedy shrinkage of metallic column of feverish anxiety haste with must proceed with preparation to meet swoop of supposedly approaching typhoon a also of disgust at discovery that alarm anxiety have be brought about by unsuspected leakage of leather bag story served a hint to what have happened once might happen again forthwith retired to cabin carefully examined own instrument to discover whether haply accident have occurred in case bag into base of glass tube be plunged be perfectly sound intact meanwhile during brief colloquy with tasker further fall of full tenth have occurred lost time in returning to deck scare be quite genuine time mr tasker said there be leakage in mercury bag to account for heavy drop moreover drop have increased by full tenth therefore although present aspect of weather may not be precisely alarming will proceed to snug down at once if please in view of fact that crew carry be not precisely what might be called efficient will probably take unconscionably long time over work ay ay sir answered tasker expect mercury ai droppin exactly for nothin ' therefore a say 'd better be makin ' ready for what be in store for then facing forward gave order clew up royal t'garns l furl then get yard down on deck hurry scallywag more work doe now more time for play will have a'ter breakfast snugging down process occupied until nearly four bell of forenoon watch when at length be completed felt that be prepared to face anything royal topgallant mast yard being down on deck fore main topmast jib boom housed great mainsail snugly stowed heavy boom securely supported in strong crutch ship under fore main storm staysail only chapter eleven end of dolphin by time that have be accomplished wind have fallen away to dead calm only sound audible be creaking groaning of ship timber loud rattle of cabin door below upon hook wash of sea alongside under counter constant irritating jerk jerk of tiller chain violent rustle slatting of staysail a dolphin rolled channel under in long oily swell be now running so far a aspect of sky be concerned there be more sign of threatened storm than there have be when first went on deck that morning except maybe haze have thickened somewhat rendering horizon still more circumscribed heat have increased to extent that a keene have remarked one must gladly have gone overboard to escape for shark several of be cruising round while three monster persistently hung under counter in shadow of ship hull hungrily ogling of who chanced to lean over taffrail to get glimpse of yet when for want of something better to do jack keene got shark hook baiting with highly flavoured piece of pork out of harness cask sought to inveigle one of monster into swallowing disdained to even so much a look at merely glancing upward at when deftly dropped bait upon one of broad shovel nose a though to say no hearties rancid pork for thank when by exercising little patience may with luck get chance to learn what one of joker taste like enervating effect of heat seemed to be a strongly revealed in a be in sun still flamed in heaven when shortly before noon jack brought sextant on deck with object of measuring meridian altitude above horizon be only able to obtain very approximate wholly useless result for when came to try found that sun appeared in instrument merely a shapeless glare of light while horizon be wholly indistinguishable then by imperceptible degree sun like horizon became obliterated atmosphere stealthily darkened a though continuous succession of curtain of grey gauze be being interposed between sky meanwhile barometer be still persistently declining although not quite so rapidly a during early hour of morning be about six bell in afternoon watch when with sudden darkening of sky came upon like gloom of night began to rain regular tropical deluge sluicing down upon in sheet a though bottom of cloud have dropped out within le than minute deck be more than ankle deep in warm fresh water scupper be running full downpour lasted for perhaps minute half then ceased a abruptly a though tap have be turned off heard shower passing away to northward of leaving with streaming deck dripping canvas rigging although rain have come gone again in space of couple of minute darkness intensified rather than otherwise presently heard muttering of distant thunder away down in southern quarter followed after while by further dash of rain lasting for few second only then in moment without further warning blackness overhead be riven by most appallingly vivid flash of lightning have ever seen accompanied not followed by crash of thunder temporarily deafened hand of caused ship to quiver tremble from stem to stern then while be standing agape ear deafened by thunder eye blinded by glare of lightning fierce gust of hot wind swept over filling two staysail with report like of cannon laying ship over to sheer strake tasker who be again officer of watch at once sprang to wheel assisted helmsman to put hard up almost before ship have begun to gather way first fierceness of gust have passed leaving little more than fresh breeze therefore went aft shouted to for be a deaf a be to bring vessel up to course again when began to move through water at speed of five knot first terrible flash of lightning crash of thunder be however only beginning of most awful electric storm that have ever be fate to witness sky now black a night being rent in dozen different direction at once by fierce baleful flash green blue crimson sun bright while bombarding of thunder be absolutely terrifying even to who be by time growing quite accustomed to tropical storm with there came frequent short sharp intermittent burst of rain that swept across deck stinging exposed skin like shot enshrouding everything beyond couple of fathom away in impenetrable obscurity now too there came at irregular quickly recurring interval savage gust of wind smote ship a though have be child toy heeling down until lee rail be awash holding thus for two three minute at time then easing up for short space easing up interval however steadily growing more abbreviated while gust invariably followed rapidly grew in intensity fury until after passage of one have pinned down for three four minute with lee sheer pole buried in smother thought that time have arrived to heave to gave order to do so be too soon for sea be rapidly rising quarter of hour later probably must not have accomplished feat without having have deck swept gale now rapidly increased in intensity gust of wind ever growing stronger more furious succeeding other more rapidly until at length interval between became so brief a to be practically imperceptible strength of wind now being equal to of heavy gale momentarily growing stronger a gust after gust swooped down upon blinding drenching shower occasionally swept be no longer composed of fresh water only for there be strong mingling of salt water in be none other than top of wave torn off by terrific blast of wind hurled along horizontally in form of vast sheet of spray sea meanwhile be rising with astounding rapidity taking into consideration fact that a just stated height of comber be greatly reduced by enormous volume of water be scooped up from ocean surface by fury of wind moreover sea be short steep irregular much more nearly resembling breaker on coast in willow water than long regular majestically moving sea of open ocean dolphin therefore despite beautiful model reduction of tophamper be beginning to make exceedingly bad weather of frequently burying to foremast careening so heavily that during of lee roll be impossible to maintain one footing on deck except by holding on to something at length about four bell in first watch lightning have hitherto almost continuously illuminated atmosphere suddenly ceased altogether night grew intensely dark only object remaining visible being faintly phosphorescent head of sea flashing into view gleaming ghostly for moment before be torn into spray by violence of wind whirled away through air to leeward then with almost equal suddenness there came positively startling lull in strength of wind ship have for hour be laying over to so steeply movement about deck be only to be achieved with great circumspection by patiently awaiting arrival of one opportunity suddenly rose almost to even keel seized chance thus afforded to claw way to skylight glance through at barometer illuminated by wildly swaying lamp steward have lighted when darkness fell to intense disappointment mercury have steadily be shrinking day exhibited further drop since index have be set at eight o'clock evening have not yet seen worst of shouted to tasker who although be now watch below have elected to remain on deck bear company glass be still going down be very sorry to hear mr fortescue answered like look of thing at ship have be most terrible uneasy for several hour now be afraid will find that be be strainin ' badly might not be amiss to sound well if a fear find that be be takin ' water in through seam 'd advise further speech be cut short by terrific blast of wind swooped down upon like howling screaming fiend without moment warning so violent be that tasker be swept off foot dashed to deck where brought up against cabin companion with crash that knocked sens out of while gunner mate disappeared in direction of lee scupper yelling screaming of wind be absolutely appalling volume of sound being such that nothing else must be heard above in midst of din became vaguely conscious that ship be going over until lay upon beam end with deck almost perpendicular water up to level of hatchway for few second lay where be on upturned side of companion listening to water pouring into cabin with lee roll of ship endeavouring to pull together scattered faculty then dimly realising that something must be done to relieve ship if must not have founder beneath scrambled to foot seizing rope end came lashing about dragged up to weather rail clinging to slowly painfully worked way forward shouting for carpenter a did so at length arrived at fore rigging came upon small group of men who have somehow contrived to climb up to windward out upon ship upturned side where be now desperately hacking away with knife at lanyard of weather fore rigging be right lad exclaimed whipping out own knife lending hand must cut away mast get ship upright again will go down under where be carpenter let bring along axe will do more good in one minute than can in ten be afraid sir a chip have gone overboard with more when ship be hove down will see if can get into fo cbe'le lay hand upon axe answered one of men do so by mean returned be quick about must go will know better than where to find axe even moment be precious just now be indeed for be easy to tell by feel of ship that be becoming waterlogged gallon of water now poured into seriously decreased chance of saving be bad news to learn that carpenter with more men have be lost overboard when ship be thrown upon beam end yet when came to recall suddenness of event surprising thing be that of have survived reminded of tasker set wondering whether have be a fortunate a whether last awful lurch have be a fatal to a have be to others among meanwhile continued to hack away with knife at lanyard presently after what appeared to have be terribly protracted interval be probably not more than couple of minute last lanyard parted with twang next instant with crash heard even through terrific hubbub of gale foremast snapped close off by deck plunged with attached into boil to leeward then breathlessly waited hoping that thus relieved ship must recover for moment almost seemed that must do so just at critical moment gale swooped down heavier than ever at same instant extra heavy sea struck down lay again a though too tired to struggle further be good men cried wo rise lay aft cut away mainmast also be only chance therewith crawled along ship side escaping being washed off blown overboard only by series of miracle a seemed to until arrived at main chain where have something to cling to where channel piece partially sheltered here at once got to work with energy upon weather main lanyard man with axe presently joining in few minute mainmast also went over side now inboard with men a smart a like cried if be going to rise at may do so quite suddenly in case run risk of being hove overboard if remain here scrambled in on deck steadying by such of running rigging a must lay hold of have scarcely done so when hull partially recovered upright position not quite so suddenly a have expected yet with quick righting movement left deck knee deep in water sprang to companion strove to close burst open door so prevent further influx of water to cabin heavy washing sound came up from below told that effort be already too late to be of service for cabin seemed to be flooded to almost height of companion ladder sluggish motion of ship told eloquently enough that be perilously near to foundering condition therefore rallied men bade get to work at pump forthwith be then that discovered to horror that of complement of sixty have lost no fewer than fourteen including messmate poor jack keene tasker gunner mate of whom must have gone overboard when vessel be thrown down on beam end be most deplorable affair be especially grieved at loss of light hearted chum be not moment for indulgence in useless lamentation busied in doing what might be possible to provide for safety of ship first of got strong gang to work at pump in two relay taking spell of ten minute pumping followed by equal length of time for rest when have fairly started saw water gushing in clear stream from spout of pump set rest to work cutting away rigging still held wreckage of mast attached to hull leaving fore fore topmast stay untouched intention being that drift of hull must bring wreckage under bow where being held fast by stay must form sort of floating anchor to ship must ride head to wind sea thus might hope that must no longer ship water in such quantity a to threaten safety after nearly hour hard labour succeeded during appeared to that men be making little impression upon amount of water in hold a have hoped when once have brought hull head to wind no longer shipped water in very alarming quantity after watching carefully for minute came to conclusion that might safely venture to open after hatchway supplement effort of at pump by baling with bucket before starting pump have taken precaution of having well sounded with result that have discovered depth of water in ship interior to be three foot ten inch a nearly a must be ascertained violent motion of hull have rendered anything like really accurate sounding impossibility same cause now precluded from ascertaining with certainty whether leak be gaining upon pump vice versa one thing be perfectly certain be that if pump be gaining upon leak at be slowly if must prove to be case must mean that there be something matter more serious than mere straining of ship possibly butt hood end have be started be by time close upon midnight there be time when almost succeeded in persuading that be not blowing quite so hard a have be although difference if difference there be be certainly not very strongly marked sea however still continued to rise be now running higher than have ever before seen yet poor sorely battered dolphin rode reasonably well thing considered although there be time when water in interior happening to become concentrated in fore part of just a must be rising to sea pinned down by head to dangerous extent causing sea to come in green unbroken like miniature mountain over bow when threatened to occur became necessary to watch narrowly if danger seemed to be imminent hurriedly replaced after hatch otherwise must very quickly have be swamped when pumping gang have be at work for about hour complained of exhaustion accordingly relieved to extent of setting to work with bucket putting two fresh gang at pump yet although men worked pretty energetically soon became evident that be not gaining anything upon leak a time passed on became exceedingly doubtful whether leak be not rather gaining upon moreover a sea continued to rise vessel movement became more laboured again began to take water aboard in such dangerous quantity at length be reluctantly compelled to abandon baling operation close hatch to prevent heavy sea from reaching interior in fashion seemingly endless night at length wore away lowering dawn came disclosing to true seriousness of condition there be aweary hollow eyed haggard looking little band sodden to very bone of with long hour of exposure to pitiless buffeting of rain sea flesh salt encrusted eye bloodshot hand raw bleeding with severe protracted work at pump adrift in mid ocean upon mastless sorely battered badly leaking hulk with ballast shifted heavy list tossed helplessly upon furiously raging sea seemed instinct with relentless determination to overwhelm toiling fighting doggedly against untiring element in hope that perchance if strength held out might keep now crazy straining complaining fabric beneath afloat long enough to afford chance of saving life yet hope be after slender one for with coming of daylight be able to see that plight be very considerably worse than have dreamed to be during hour of darkness for then have believed that loss of mast springing of somewhat serious leak represented sum total of misfortune while now saw to unspeakable dismay with solitary exception of longboat whole of boat be so badly damaged a to be altogether beyond ability to repair of two of indeed nothing save stem stern remained dangling forlornly from davit tackle that bad though be be not worst for be no longer possible for to blind to fact that leak be gaining upon inexorably that even though must continue to toil with unabated energy must not keep ship afloat longer than few hour more at utmost then what be to do longboat fine boat though be when stocked with even meagre supply of provision water must not accommodate more than twenty five men gravely doubted whether must live ten minute in such sea a be then running with number in still with exception of such raft a might be able to put together be that have hour of daylight sufficed to show that time must be lost in making preparation to quit slowly foundering ship must not do for to leave pump for moment one gang must at cost be kept hard at work pumping out a much a possible of water be pouring in through open seam otherwise leak must gain upon so rapidly that ship must settle from under long before be ready to face catastrophe therefore at once set about formulating of plan carrying into effect first of while one gang kept pump brake clanking clear water spouting out upon streaming deck got gang to work at launching gun overboard a roll of ship permitted be glad to see eased poor labouring craft quite perceptibly done hand except at pump went to breakfast meal consisting of hot coffee sweetened with molasses ship biscuit more le sodden with salt water for with coming of daylight preparation of breakfast unwelcome discovery have be made that salt water have got at provision gone far toward spoiling then a soon a first gang have finished breakfast relieved at pump who in turn took breakfast next proceeded to clear away longboat prepare for launching by providing with proper supply of oar thole pin rudder tiller mast sail then carefully stowing stock of water provision when be done be still blowing too hard although worst of gale seemed to be over sea be altogether too rough to allow of attempting to launch therefore next got to work upon raft first of lashing spare spar together a sort of foundation then upon top of lashing hen coop grating few plank that carpenter have stowed away down below finally length of bulwark that cut away for purpose raft when completed be fairly roomy affair affording space enough to stow away thirty people together with good supply of provision water now proceeded to get up from below stow cook meanwhile industriously boiling a much beef pork a must crowd into copper then knocked off piped to dinner while be getting probably last meal of must ever partake aboard poor old dolphin heart be gladdened by sudden burst of sunshine breaking through cloud hour later sky to windward be clear sun be shining brilliantly pouring welcome warmth upon chilled body saturated clothing while gale have broken be fast moderating having already declined to strength of double reefed topsail breeze sea too be no longer raging like boiling cauldron yet even so be still too heavy to justify in attempting to launch either longboat raft now at very moment when be most necessary that crew must preserve orderly obedient disposition suddenly broke into open mutiny flatly refusing to work longer at pump declaring that ship be good for at least hour that before have passed must be safely away from that there be sense in wanting to keep ship afloat longer than there be absolute need for that time have now arrived when must begin to think of saving own personal belonging when attempted to remonstrate with point out folly of behaviour became virulently abusive declared that if wanted pump kept going might keep going although have already done considerably more than fair share of back breaking labour therewith abandoned pump betook forward to forecastle from there shortly afterward came floating to horrified ear loud peal of maudlin laughter mingled with snatch of ribald song coarse jest whereby came to know too late that while getting up provision from below of must have broken into spirit room possessed of very considerable supply of rum upon be now fast drinking into condition of reckless indifference to awful danger threatened anything thought be better than therefore having first gone down below brought up chronometer sextant chart of atlantic stowed whole carefully in stern sheet of longboat loaded pistol girded sword to side went forward to fore scuttle putting head into shouted in a cheery tone a must summon now then lad tumble up on deck hand of have still great deal to do very little time to do in therefore let see about getting longboat into water raft over side there will be time enough to rest when be safe away from wreck ri schipper don worry bawled great hulking dutchman in reply dere be blendy of dime yet ve be nod going do move undil ve have vinished dhis grog then american time took up tale shouting go 'way little man go 'way wha ' d'you mean anyway by comin here disturbin ' gen'lemen when be busy come in have drink with youngster just to show that be not stuck up guess be equal in dandy little barkie yes sirree be free born be ' just a good a other blamed britisher don ' forget so if won ' come in ' have drink take ugly lookin ' mug out o ' daylight d 'ye hear to emphasise polite request man seized heavy sea boot from forecastle deck hove at with so poor aim that instead of hitting dashed into face of englishman who happened at moment to be drinking out of pannikin blow dashed pannikin out of man hand splashed fiery spirit over face into eye next instant with low fierce growl of concentrated ferocity sprang to foot struck free born beurican smashing blow under chin sent sprawling have time to waste in fighting lad cried for felt that ship be fast settling under foot voice be completely drowned in babel of angry yell instantly arose for appeared that men be after own fashion rival for leadership in forecastle man have own partisan one of whom instantly took up quarrel of own favourite in moment whole of be at others throat like so many quarrelsome dog let drunken mutinous brute fight out among muttered disgustedly a turned walked away will get sobering up before very long will astonish be greatly mistaken a walked aft must tell by feel of ship that race be nearly run although did not at moment dream how very near to end be paused abreast of longboat to satisfy that be quite ready for launching out through wide gap that have made in bulwark when cutting away to provide material for construction of raft gripe saw have be cast off boat be supported solely by chock upon stood upright on main hatchway suddenly stooping down small spot of bright light in deep shadow under boat caught eye looking closer saw that careless rascal have omitted to put in plug that bright spot of light be caused by sun shining down through unplugged hole in boat bottom with muttered objurgation of fellow carelessness climbed into boat stooping down sought for plug be seeking for perhaps two three minute before found a be about to abandon search hunt for suitable cork out of to cut eye fell upon missing plug at once inserted proceeded to drive tightly home have just completed job to satisfaction when felt ship lurch heavily there be sudden violent rush wash of water sprang to foot barely in time to see boat caught up on crest of sea came sweeping green solid through gap in starboard bulwark carried clear clean out through corresponding gap in port side longboat have launched before must collect sens lift hand found adrift alone twenty fathom to leeward of doomed ship driving farther away from moment chapter twelve alone in longboat to seize one of long heavy ash oar formed part of boat equipment fling blade over stern jerk oar into sculling notch with idea of sculling boat back to wreck be with work of second two although contrived with labour to get boat head round toward dolphin to keep pointed in direction soon discovered a might have have sense to know to scull big heavy boat like longboat to windward against strong wind so heavy sea be task altogether beyond power of single man however strong might be for sea swept down upon boat sent surging away good half dozen fathom to leeward finding attempt useless at once hauled oar inboard again proceeded to ship rudder task at length accomplished with difficulty owing to violent motion of boat then shipped tiller next proceeded to loose boat canvas with idea of beating back to ship here again found seriously hampered delayed by circumstance that when equipping boat men have only half done work boat be rigged a fore aft schooner setting main trysail fore trysail staysail secured to head of stem while mast have be stepped shroud set up hand taut found upon casting loose sail that have omitted to obey instruction to close reef since wind be still blowing altogether too hard for boat to carry anything more than close reefed canvas lost quite ten minute in reefing setting mainsail staysail dared not attempt to set foresail also for did not believe that boat must carry when at length have got canvas set boat fairly under way found to consternation have driven good half mile to leeward of ship by time quarrel suppose being over men have left forecastle finding have gone adrift in longboat be making frantic sign to to return soon discovered that even now with boat under canvas to beat back to ship be impossibility for boat have not be built for sailing to windward in strong breeze be ordinary type of ship longboat constructed to carry heavy load in proportion to dimension with long flat floor bluff bow with only three inch of exposed keel while might possibly with skilful management have be made to work to windward in very moderate weather now with so strong wind so heavy sea to battle with drove to leeward almost a rapidly a forged ahead did dare to press with more canvas for be already showing more than be at prudent stronger puff careening to gunwale taxing seamanship to utmost to prevent from filling under such circumstance with boat demanding utmost vigilance to keep afloat will be readily understood be only able at interval to cast momentary glance toward ship to see how be faring even then be not always possible for to catch glimpse of because of mountainous sea interposed between at length however when have be adrift about hour got chance to take fairly long look to windward at moment when longboat be hove up on crest of unusually lofty wave ship be nowhere to be seen did again catch sight of even of raft only conclusion at must arrive be that have gone down taken hand with in such mountainous sea a be then running horizon of person in boat be naturally very restricted knew that although have failed to catch glimpse of wreck raft latter at least might be afloat plain duty be to remain in neighbourhood so long a there be chance of falling in with therefore watched opportunity seizing favourable moment wore boat round on other tack again bringing to wind went back a nearly over ground have already traversed a be possible although kept sharp look out wore round half hour saw nothing no not even so much a fragment of floating wreckage to indicate what have actually happened did ever hear of of late crew being picked up be about four bell two o'clock in afternoon watch when last saw wreck beat about remaining a near spot a must until sunset then having failed to fall in with sight wreck raft came to conclusion have seen last of mutinous crew that time have arrived when be quite justified in abandoning further effort to find might look after own safety weather by time have improved very considerably wind have be slowly steadily moderating sea although still tremendously high be not now breaking dangerously sky also have cleared be without cloud there be therefore prospect of fine night with further steady improvement of weather boat be no longer dangerously pressed by amount of canvas that be carrying felt that need be under immediate apprehension regarding future moreover clothes have by time dried upon body felt quite warm comfortable be hungry thirsty for so called dinner have snatched aboard dolphin have be very hasty meagre meal therefore hove boat to by lashing tiller hard down hauling staysail sheet to windward then finding that rode quite comfortably be taking care of herself proceeded to rummage among stock of provision soon have hearty meal set out before on after thwart by time have finished supper night have fallen star be shining with brilliance that only display in tropic be beginning to feel need of sleep therefore took final look round satisfied that be right that nothing be in sight then heartily commending to care of maker stretched out on bottom board be almost instantly asleep to say that slept soundly that night must scarcely be speaking truth for although have pretty well satisfied before lay down that weather be improving that therefore have little cause for immediate apprehension sailor quickly acquires trick of maintaining certain alertness even in midst of slumber since know that weather be most formidable treacherous enemy against have always to be on guard faculty of alertness be of course especially active when a in own case have only to depend upon consequently never completely lost consciousness throughout night rush of wind hiss of sea occasional sprinkling of spray be mechanically noted whenever heel of boat appreciably exceeded normal angle at once became momentarily awake yet notwithstanding when on following morning first ray of newly risen sun smote upon closed eyelid informing of arrival of new day at once arose refreshed vigorous ready to face emergency that day might bring first act be to kneel down return thanks for preservation through night seek protection guidance of god throughout day after leaned over boat gunwale freely laved head face hand in clear salt water then set about preparing for most appetising breakfast that resource must permit while be doing discussing meal carefully reviewed entire situation with view to arrival at immediate decision a to future proceeding chart have with showed position of dolphin at moment when last observation be taken from information be able to deduce approximate position of spot where vessel have foundered spot found be in round figure one thousand mile from sierra leone fourteen hundred mile from island of barbadoes whereas sierra leone be almost dead to windward barbadoes be a directly dead to leeward little calculation convinced that while must take about thirty six day to beat to windward shorter distance might cover longer running pleasantly before wind in about twenty four day allowing in case for boat being hove to throughout night to enable to obtain necessary rest fortunately have with not only chart of north atlantic also chronometer sextant nautical almanac boat compass be therefore equipped with requisite for efficient navigation of boat have fear of losing way must consequently without hesitation choose considered to be most desirable course did not need very profound reflection to convince that be to make best of way back to barbadoes accordingly put up helm kept away before wind shook out reef went sliding away to westward easily comfortably at speed of six knot per hour weather have by time reverted to quite normal condition trade wind be blowing steadily sea have gone down have nothing worse than somewhat heavy swell to contend with therefore felt that unless must be so unfortunate a to fall in with gale there be reason at why must not reach destination safely without very much discomfort only trouble be running a boat now be with wind so far over starboard quarter dared not release hold upon tiller for instant lest must broach to possibly capsize whenever therefore became necessary for to quit helm for purpose of taking astronomical observation otherwise have to heave to occasionally to shorten sail while doing so kept pretty actively employed off on day thus about nine o'clock in morning have to heave to leave boat to take care of while secured observation of sun for determination of longitude same procedure have to be adopted again at noon when took sun altitude for determination of latitude preparation of meal involved further repetition of manoeuvre thus have time to feel lonely at least during hour of daylight after surrounded hemmed in by gloom mystery of darkness with companionship save that of multitudinous star to mind never betray immeasurable distance so clearly a when one be in mid ocean with sough moan of night wind soft seething hiss of sea whispering in one ear feeling of loneliness becomes almost obsession sense of pervading mystery persistently obtrudes one quickly fall into condition of readiness to believe most incredible of countless weird story that sailor love to relate to other especially when condition of credulity be helped a sometimes be by sudden irruption of strange unaccountable sound succession of sound upon peaceful quietude serenity of night sound be occasionally of weirdest most hair raising quality while startled listener may possibly have heard asserted time again by superior person that emanate from sea bird from fish be perfectly satisfied that sea bird fish have ever be known to emit such sound in daytime strain of superstition within awakes whisper sort of uncanny suggestion sea bird fish theory being rejected with scorn moreover harrowingly mysterious sound seem never to make audible save when accompanying circumstance be such a to conduce to most startling thrilling effect thus although have now be knocking about at sea for more than three year have met with many queer experience have never thus far heard sound must not reasonably account for attribute to known source yet on particular night second night alone in longboat be sitting comfortably enough in stern sheet steering by star for have lantern wherewith to illuminate compass thinking of nothing in particular when suddenly most unearthly cry came pealing out of darkness on starboard beam seemingly not dozen yard away be twice repeated felt hair of scalp bristle violent shudder thrilled through a dreadful cry smote upon ear for seemed to be utterance of human being in very last extremity of physical mental anguish protest of lost soul being wrenched violently out of sinful human tenement cry of such utter unimaginable despair a finite mind of man be unable to find cause for yet despite agony of horror that froze blood instinctively thrust helm hard down flattened in sheet fore aft for thought came to that perchance few fathom out there veiled from sight in soft velvet blackness of night poor wretch victim like to fury of late gale clinging desperately to fragment of wreckage might have caught glimpse of longboat sail sliding blackly along against star have emitted terrible cry a last despairing appeal for help succour accordingly a boat swept round came to wind careening gunwale to a felt full strength of night breeze in dew sodden canvas sprang to foot clapping hand funnel wise to mouth sent forth hail ahoy there where be keep up courage for help be at hand where be say let know where to look for will soon be alongside shout again for can see sign of ahoy there ahoy ahoy sound of own voice coming immediately after terrible thrice repeated cry seemed somehow comforting reassuring now awaited reply to hail with feeling in there be more of curiosity than horror reply came once more lifted up voice in tone of appeal encouragement then since failed to evoke response put boat helm down tacked conviction being strong within must hit off to inch exact spot from dreadful sound have come so firmly convinced indeed be

broken by first ray of morrow sun awakened suddenly while be yet quite dark when a seemed to have only be asleep very few minute awakening be not that of person who gradually pass from sleep to wakefulness because have enjoyed sufficiency of rest be abrupt instant transition from complete oblivion to state of wide awake startled consciousness that caused to leap to foot gaze wildly about a eye snapped open to star lit heaven a did so became aware of rapidly growing sound of leaping splashing gurgling water humming a of wind sweeping through tightly strained cordage close to leeward there be need for to pause consider be origin of sound recognised instantly a given forth by sailing ship sweeping at high speed through water sprang forward clear of mainmast to where stowed foresail permitted clear uninterrupted view to leeward next instant three dreadful cry in quick succession exactly reproducing tone for tone terrifying sound have so startled unnerved only few hour earlier

have evidently be startled out of sound sleep by sudden outcry commotion under bow into midst of whom unceremoniously tumbled excited jabber instantly arose among new shipmate at once apprised that be aboard vessel manned by frenchman single quick glance aloft sufficed to inform that be barque rigged probably of about three hundred fifty ton measurement excited astonished watch crowded round regarding curiously methought with look not wholly devoid of suspicion be one beginning to deluge with question when authoritative voice from poop broke in with demand to be informed what disturbance on forecastle be about whereupon individual among crowd who surrounded who might have be indeed proved to be boatswain took by arm bluntly suggested that have better accompany aft to monsieur chief mate explain uninvited presence aboard barque be of course only thing to be done accordingly turned walked aft with arm still firmly grasped by individual who have made suggestion who seemed to regard a prisoner until reached poop ladder up be somewhat unceremoniously hustled to find in presence of broad sturdily built man of about middle height who stood at head of ladder with foot wide apart

see feature detail of dress a stepped back somewhat to one side to make way for light fell full upon feeble a be sufficed to show uniform ah exclaimed sharply british naval officer if be not very greatly mistaken pray monsieur where did come from be there more of came in over bow minute ago out of boat thanks to blind look out that people seem to keep ran down cut in two there be more of be only occupant of boat answered only occupant of boat exclaimed in astonishment amaze monsieur be permissible to inquire how british officer come to be adrift quite alone in boat in middle of atlantic whereupon told briefly story of loss of dolphin very imprudently adding information that be unit of slave squadron be commander ah commented incisively when have finished exceedingly interesting story captain tourville will be pleased that have picked up when hears news to morrow meanwhile by lucky chance happen to have unoccupied state room into will put for remainder of night thoreau to man who have conducted aft take gentleman below to cabin then turn out steward tell to put bedding into spare state room to be silent about lest disturb captain now monsieur permit to bid good night trust will rest well man thoreau who seemed to be individual of exceedingly glum taciturn disposition thereupon signed to to follow led way down poop ladder through open door in front of poop gave access to narrow passage eight foot long at end of be open door giving access to ship main cabin be fairly roomy comfortable apartment plainly tastefully fitted up with mahogany table running lengthwise down middle through centre of mizenmast passed down to depth below row of seat upholstered in red utrecht velvet with swinging back be secured on side of table to deck between side of cabin ran narrow strip of carpet side end of cabin be formed of bulkhead fore bulkhead being occupied by sort of sideboard on side of entrance door while against after bulkhead stood very handsome pianoforte open with quantity of music in stand beside there be door to right of piano conjectured led to captain state room right abaft side bulkhead like rest of woodwork of cabin be painted in white enamel be pierced by two door close together have doubt gave access to state room surmise a to arrangement be proved true few minute later by steward ugly shock headed taciturn individual who still more than half asleep presently came stumbling into cabin with bundle of bedding having with silent care opened aftermost door on port side flung into dark state room then motioned to enter appeared that intended to make up own bed well be very great hardship must have liked light to enable to see what be about turned to ask surly friend for one have already turned back upon be in full retreat to forecastle to finish interrupted night rest therefore opened out bundle found that consisted of straw mattress flock pillow pair of blanket of at once proceeded to arrange in bunk a best must by dim light entered open door from main cabin then most thankfully removed clothes for first time since springing up of gale tumbled into bunk at once fell fast asleep chapter thirteen in power of madman sound of water being freely sluiced along deck overhead of vigorous use of holystone scrubbing brush immediately following thereupon awoke on following morning opened eye to find ray of newly risen sun flashing off heaving surface of ocean through open scuttle of state room occupied although must not have be asleep more than three four hour at most awoke wonderfully refreshed memory of what have happened to during night instantly returning at once sprang out of berth determined to avail forthwith of renewed opportunity of starting day by taking salt water bath under head pump took few second to make way out on deck where found watch under supervision of second mate a presumed busily engaged in operation of washing deck while fresh invigorating trade wind sweeping in over port cat head hummed drummed with exhilarating note through taut weather rigging into hollow of straining canvas overhead weather be brilliantly fine clear deep azure of sky merely flecked here there with few solemnly drifting puff ball of trade cloud ocean of deepest blue sweeping in long regular sparkling snow capped surge diagonally athwart bow from beneath flying fish continually sprang into air went flashing away on hand like handful of bright silver dollar new from mint merely to breathe such exhilarating atmosphere to feel buoyant life like lift plunge of straining hurrying ship be joy unspeakable felt in positively hilarious spirit a danced up poop ladder to greet officer of watch prefer modest request for minute use of head pump individual whom assumed to be officer of watch be young fellow apparently not very much older than attired in somewhat dandified style of semi uniform bare footed with trouser rolled up above knee be who be sluicing water about poop so freely while dozen of crew vigorously plied holystone scrubber under direction first quick glance round deck sufficed to show that holystoning process be confined to poop only cleansing of main deck seemed to be accomplished sufficiently by application of scrubber only exuberant buoyancy of spirit suffered sudden distinct check a glanced at face of about without exception seemed to belong to lowest most depraved class of seaman sullen brutal reckless resembling more than anything else in air expression assemblage of wild beast whose natural ferocity have not be eradicated be held in check subdued daunted by constant exercise of ferocity even greater than own aspect of young man whom conceived to be officer of watch be even more repellent than of subordinate be in distinctly subdued tone bade good morning preferred request to be allowed to take bath under head pump did not respond to salutation carefully placing upon deck bucket have just emptied stood intently regarding with foot wide apart hand upon hip remained silent for so long time that men about suspended operation regarding with dull curiosity while felt patience rapidly oozing away temper rising at gratuitous insolence of demeanour be on point of making rather pungent remark when suddenly seemed to bethink said in accent be apparently intended to convey suggestion of attempt at civility so be british naval officer monsieur leroy told about when relieved be want bath do very well go take one by mean hark ye monsieur englishman word in ear take advice after have have bath get back to cabin stay there until captain have be informed of presence in ship for if be to come on deck unexpectedly see chance be that must blow brain out without thinking twice about be not quite angel in matter of temper may tell that be not too well disposed toward englishman in general english naval officer in particular now be off get bath scuttle back to cabin a quickly a may be be much obliged to for warning monsieur said will act upon do care to increase obligation to by stating why captain have prejudice will call against british naval officer well replied new acquaintance whose name subsequently learned be gaston marcel for one thing ship be own property be employed in slave trade captain tourville have already suffered much loss damage through meddlesome interference of pestilent cruiser believe have other more private reason for hatred of nation comrade so be after having suffered shipwreck have be run down narrowly escaped with life only to fall into hand of frenchman slaver at now most slaver be little if anything better than pirate be outlaw whose crime be punishable with death trusting for safety for most part to speed of ship fighting with desperation of cornered rat when there be other way of escape giving asking quarter in many case guilty of most unspeakable atrocity toward hapless individual serving in slave squadron who be unfortunate enough to fall into hand be especially true in case of who carried on nefarious traffic under french flag for be almost without exception west indian creole most of whom bore dash of negro blood in vein therefore adding inherited ferocity of west african savage to natural depravity of to whose unbridled passion owed being if a be more than likely have fallen into power of one of fiend plight be like to be desperate indeed came to conclusion must not do better than act upon advice of second mate abide issue of event with a much equanimity a must muster accordingly a soon a have taken bath returned to state room have be assigned to by mate there remained perdu awaiting moment when somewhat formidable individual captain must be pleased to send for approach to state room be will be remembered through main cabin a passed through latter ugly shock headed steward more ugly more shock headed now in garish light of day than have be when presented fresh from hammock on night before be down on hand knee busily engaged in scrubbing cabin floor while strip of carpet table cloth be rolled up placed upon table beautifully polished surface of be partially protected by large square of green baize bade fellow good morning took more notice of than if have never spoken so passed on entered sleeping apartment closing door behind then proceeded to dress leisurely perform toilet a well a mean at disposal must permit when be remembered that have change of linen owned only clothes happened to be wearing when be washed off wreck will be readily understood that when have done be possible to render presentable result still left much to be desired steward finished washing swabbing of cabin deck then retired returning about hour later by time plank be dry to relay strip of carpet replace table cloth arrange table for breakfast producing somewhat to surprise very elegant table equipage of what seen through slat formed upper panel of cabin door appeared to be solid silver quite valuable china have barely finished task when seven bell struck on deck prompt upon last stroke door in after bulkhead be thrown open man issued from passing rapidly through cabin with just momentary pause to glance at tell tale barometer swinging in skylight made way out on deck caught glimpse of through slat in top panel of door a passed judged to be about thirty year of age be rather tall standing about five foot ten inch in morocco slipper very dark so much so that strongly suspected presence of negro blood in vein with thick crop of jet black hair luxuriantly bushy beard heavy thick moustache very carefully trimmed so exceedingly glossy that thought probable that gloss be due to artificial mean man be decidedly good looking in frenchified fashion be sea dandy of first water a be evidenced by massive gold earring in ear jewelled stud in immaculate front of shirt of pleated cambric nattily cut suit of white drill diamond on little finger of right hand flash of caught a raised hand to shield eye from dazzle of sun when glancing at barometer heard voice rather rich full baritone addressing second mate must not distinguish what be said at distance among multitudinous noise of straining ship few minute later door opposite own on other side of cabin opened monsieur leroy chief mate of ship to whose slackness of discipline be chiefly indebted for being run down during previous night emerged followed chief out on deck recognised in part by figure in part by fact that be evidently occupant of one of state room adjoining main cabin must only be assigned to officer of rank consideration a now gained momentary glimpse of appeared to be about thirty seven year of age broadly built feature almost hidden by thickly growing beard whisker moustache adorned out of gleamed flashed pair of resolute good natured eye a black a bushy eyebrow that overshadowed be dressed in coat pair of trouser of fine dark blue cloth like captain wore waistcoat shirt thus exposed however unlike of superior be made of coarse linen woven with narrow blue stripe in also like captain wore stocking on slippered foot while be speculating what captain behaviour toward must probably be steward unceremoniously flung open cabin door in surly tone curtly informed that captain desired to see at once upon poop stood aside to permit to pas directing hand toward passage leading out on deck then busied in putting few finishing touch to arrangement of table when in obedience to summons stepped out on deck washing down have be completed plank be already practically dry running gear have be carefully coiled down brasswork polished mop swab scrubbing brush stowed away crew be mustered on forecastle partaking of breakfast glanced curiously at a emerged on to quarter deck one of said something excited burst of sardonic laughter from rest disregarding sprang lightly up poop ladder found in presence of group consisting of captain two mate countenance of latter expressed much annoyance perturbation particularly that of leroy chief mate look of savage ferocity on captain face be positively fiendish enough to strike terror into heart of even boldest who might find in power of such individual hope of considerate even of ordinarily merciful treatment from one of so vindictively ferocious character a man seemed to be at once sunk to zero yet be not minded that frenchman must enjoy satisfaction of saying that have frightened therefore assumed boldness of demeanour be very far from feeling bowed with ease grace must muster then addressing captain said good morning captain tourville be afraid that hard necessity of misfortune compel to claim from that succour hospitality shipwrecked seaman have right to ask stop shouted tourville a with clenched fist stood seeming about to spring upon admit such right especially of englishman english have ever be most implacable enemy because forsooth choose to earn living by following vocation of of disapprove must need do utmost to ruin by heaven have very nearly succeeded too who be that must presume to thrust opinion down throat of other people if own countryman choose to be led by nose be willing to submit to dictation well good be nothing to be own affair not mine what right have to dictate to other nation to say will do will not do tell that be nothing short of monstrous be ashamed of france that have submitted to be thus dictated to if country be so weak a to tolerate interference from foreign power be not claim to judge for what be right wrong to be governed by own conscience be slaver care not who know will continue to be slaver a long a please despite disapproval of few english fanatic let beware who dare to interfere with especially englishman who have done utmost to ruin monsieur be one of by own confession belong to english man o ' war engaged in suppression of trade by be striving to make living do suppose that because happen to have suffered shipwreck be entitled to claim from succour hospitality ultimate restoration to own people in order that others like may do utmost to ruin tell admit claim be enemy implacable enemy will be treated a such fact of shipwreck be merely accident have placed in power will die will revenge upon few of countless injury have suffered at hand of accursed countryman shame upon monsieur cried be coward enough to revenge upon mere lad like will not ask what crew will think of what will think of in calmer moment when come to reflect silence boy thundered silence english dog how dare speak then suddenly interrupting turned to chief mate exclaimed leroy have insolent young puppy confined below in iron until can make up mind how to dispose of chief mate approached took by arm come with monsieur john bulldogue said not unkindly a led away allow to be more anxious a to fate than can help tell candidly that can not form slightest idea what fate will eventually be many men knowing skipper a well a do must no doubt say that will be thrown to shark before be hour older may be yes certainly may be for be first who have ever dared to assume defiant attitude toward be inordinately vain man a well a man of unbridled temper somehow be inclined to think that defiance people must say must seal fate will be more likely to tell in favour than against yes although have misfortune to be englishman really think may venture to encourage to hope for best now here be here come moulineux with iron must obey order see that be put on make a comfortable a can will send down breakfast presently monsieur may rely upon goodwill admire courage see whether in friend in enemy have proved that posse if find in power to do anything to help will place in now found confined be small apartment be apparently used upon occasion a auxiliary store room for there be number of barrel case of various size in a well a what have appearance of being spare sail a place be constructed in depth of ship considerably below level of water line there be window to give light to only light reached being a much a must find way down through partially open hatchway ten foot above be therefore able to observe surroundings only very indistinctly even after have be time in place eye have become accustomed to gloom of mate be a good a word in matter of breakfast man bringing down to most excellent substantial meal after have be incarcerated for nearly hour discussed food with relish for be hungry then sat impatiently awaiting moment when fate must be made known to hour after hour passed without word sign from man who held destiny in hollow of hand be not until late in afternoon that carpenter appeared removing iron requested to follow conducted up steep ladder leading to main deck into main cabin where captain tourville be sitting alone there be silence for full minute after carpenter have ushered into cabin closed door behind tourville remained seated at end of table with one hand clenched on cloth before while with other plucked quickly impatiently at thick beard then combed through with finger glowering moodily at meanwhile in absent minded fashion a though scarcely realised presence at length pulled together with effort pointing to locker said be seated monsieur have kindness to tell who what be how come to be on board ship have only heard chief mate story a yet whereupon proceeded to give required information a briefly a possible not omitting to mention fact of being officer of slave squadron for have already stated to chief mate from what have transpired earlier in day knew that in turn have communicated information to captain that what told did not appear greatly to increase state of irritation seemed proof enough that have already learned material fact congratulated upon having shown be not to be frightened into suppression of portion of history matter how damaging effect might be expected to be upon interest when have told everything remained silent for quite two three minute drumming table meditatively with finger at length looked up from table at have be moodily glowering said monsieur fortescue thank for evident frankness with have told story in return feel that be entitled to explanation of what must doubtless have deemed very extraordinary conduct of morning be unnecessary for to enter into detail may inform have suffered irreparable loss injury at hand of english have chosen to regard method by earn living a unlawful on le than four occasion have brought to verge of ruin at moment when be upon point of realising handsome competence have persecuted relentlessly confiscated property slain two brother in action must have hanged ignominiously have not be fortunate enough to effect escape from be englishman who well be story into need not enter with let suffice to say that injury have suffered at hand of countryman have be such that mere name of englishman excites to very frenzy of anger hate in be really not responsible for action now question be what be to be done with tell candidly that life be not safe for moment while remain on board ship even a sit there memory of have suffered at hand of countryman so strongly move that find exceedingly difficult to refrain from blowing brain out monsieur interrupted pardon for suggesting thing be not surrendering to very childish weakness be possible that man in very prime of life apparently in perfect bodily mental health can be so utterly devoid of self control because have suffered injury real imagined from sacre interrupted starting savagely to foot there be question monsieur a to reality of injury have suffered at hand of hateful countryman very well monsieur cut in speaking very quietly for argument sake will admit if like that injury be real deep still doe not seem to absurdly illogical that because certain person have injured must yield to insane craving to wreak revenge upon somebody else who have have hand in infliction of injury quite possibly can not tell answered tourville may be that be mad on one particular point admit soundness of argument monsieur contend that personally have not injured may be perfectly true admit that belong to slave squadron be at hand of same squadron have suffered much of injury of complain now be impossible for to discriminate between individual in squadron who have injured who have not therefore contend that be perfectly justified in wreaking vengeance upon of who chance to fall into power in case if must blow out brain will at least have rid myself of one potential enemy therefore to immeasurable surprise man calmly drew pistol from belt levelled across table straight at head sprang to foot with idea of flinging upon disarming for must no longer doubt fellow be stark staring mad upon one particular point before must get at weapon exploded ball passing so close to head that felt stir hair buried in panelling of cabin behind with savage snarl raised hand must have dashed heavy pistol butt in face by time be upon seizing throat with one hand while wrenched weapon from grasp with other bore to deck planted right knee square in middle of chest pinning securely down treacherous murderous scoundrel cried how will deal with be a dangerous a wild beast if be to beat brain out with butt of pistol must only be treating a deserve will do too a sure a be lying there at mercy unless will swear by hold sacred that will never again attempt life that will set ashore free at first port at touch will swear will die swear monsieur gasped release throat let rise swear to by blessed virgin will declare truce in favour that will leave ship a soon a suitable opportunity offer relaxed grasp upon throat permitted to regain foot whereupon looked at for moment with expression of surprise not altogether unmingled methought with fear then bowing profoundly said leave monsieur beg of will send for again little later passed out of cabin made way up on to poop where found monsieur leroy chief mate in charge of watch nodded to a ascended poop ladder when joined in fore aft promenade of weather side of deck jerked head knowingly toward skylight remarked in tantrum again ah quite a expected be rather unfortunate for monsieur that happen to be englishman for mere mention of word to have same effect a exhibiting red rag to bull drive perfectly frantic with rage so appears remarked dryly what be cause of have idea no answered mate doubt whether anybody know perhaps doe not even know of course have heard speak of loss have sustained through interference of ship of slave squadron who elect to make living by following vocation civilised nation have agreed to declare unlawful must be prepared to be interfered with for own part have particular fault to find with who have undertaken to suppress slave trade go into business with eye open know penalty attaching to if be foolish unskilful enough to permit to be caught must not grumble if penalty be exacted from like life enjoy be full of excitement adventure when succeed in outwitting gentleman profit be handsome enough to amply repay for risk trouble be like playing game of skill for heavy wager contend man who be not sportsman enough to bear loss philosophically must engage in game be not precisely what ail skipper take ill luck grievously to heart be true insists that have other grievance against english a well whatever may be seem to have partially turned brain partially objected why man be a mad a march hare absolutely loses control of when allows temper to master becomes more like savage beast than man ay be true doe agreed leroy hark ye monsieur let give friendly hint have escaped unharmed thus far therefore believe may consider reasonably safe in case of further outbreak on captain part take especial care that give reason to suppose that be afraid of be surest road to safety with upon word believe be right said at event be road took with just now for pinned down to cabin deck threatened to beat brain out yet here be alive to speak of good ejaculated mate if did that be right believe that if there be one thing admires more than be absolute fearlessness show that care snap of finger for will forgive anything even fact that be englishman walked poop with monsieur leroy for full hour chatting with learning many thing very well worth knowing while be chatting with kept eye about carefully noting particular peculiarity of barque with view to future contingency among other thing learned that be named la mouette that be of three hundred sixty four ton register that mounted fourteen twenty eight pound carronades on main deck four six pounder on poop that carried complement of one hundred seventy men that be then bound into river kwara for cargo of slave to be conveyed to martinique cuba a circumstance might decide at end of about hour be once more summoned to cabin where found tourville sitting at table man have now completely regained self control be perfectly calm waved courteously to seat on cabin sofa took monsieur fortescue said will not mock by pretending to excuse apologise for recent outbreak of violence for be due to weakness be wholly unable to conquer may quite possibly get better of again if must must ask to kindly be patient forbearing with to keep out of way until fit have passed what particularly wish to say to now be that be from moment perfectly safe so long a may be necessary for to honour ship with presence since will naturally desire to rejoin own ship a speedily a possible propose to tranship into first vessel bearing british flag may chance to fall in with provided of course that be not ship of war must happen to fall in with british man o ' war course of action will be guided by circumstance will not feel justified in trusting to captain magnanimity to let go free after delivering safe on board must weather be fine enough to allow of such proceeding without risk to will give boat in may make own way on board meanwhile beg that will regard a guest free to come go in cabin a please to take meal at table have also made arrangement for greater comfort in state room leroy assigned to when came aboard last night trust that plan of mine will be agreeable to replied that be not only perfectly agreeable to regarded a exceedingly generous taking circumstance of case into consideration that regretted violent antipathy to englishman a feared that in consequence of presence must never be otherwise than exceedingly disagreeable to that during enforced sojourn aboard la mouette must strive to render nationality a little obtrusive a possible that trusted might very soon be fortunate enough to fall in with craft of sort into must transfer to replied that fervently hoped so too for sake then directing attention to case of book attached to after bulkhead on opposite side to occupied by piano rose bowed retired to own cabin a for went out on deck resumed conversation with leroy telling what have passed begging to keep sharp look out for vessel for since captain tourville made attempt to disguise uneasiness at presence on board ship be quite determined to tranship into first craft that might happen to fall in with provided of course that did not happen to be of questionable character for have inclination to jump out of frying pan into fire by going aboard slaver mate fully agreed with a to wisdom of leaving ship a soon a possible indeed soon discovered that even after what have passed between tourville be still very far from satisfied that there might not be further trouble ahead if such must unfortunately come said must maintain bold front show that be not to be so easily frightened when fit be upon very strongly reminds of wild beast hesitates to attack so long a one face boldly spring instant that one back be turned considered very excellent advice singularly applicable to circumstance determined to act upon at eight bell be summoned below to supper found cabin brilliantly lit table picture of dainty elegance in matter of equipage of choice fare captain tourville be evidently ascetic in matter of eating drinking meal to immediately sat down be quite a good a many have partaken of ashore in so called first class hotel tourville seemed at first to be in imminent danger of relapsing into one of black mood for be distrait inclined to be silent be determined not to permit if must help therefore persisted in talking to trying with subject after subject until discovered to be enthusiast upon art of painting music in of also dabbled in amateurish way a soon a spoke of brow cleared threw off gloom spoke fluently with evident knowledge of subject with result that meal have begun so inauspiciously ended quite pleasantly nay more than a soon a cloth be drawn extraordinary man opened piano sitting down to played piece after piece sang several song finally invited to sing result being on whole evening passed with far le constraint than have anticipated next morning while tourville be engaged in taking sight for longitude working out suddenly complained of feeling ill sent for leroy gave certain instruction then took to bed by noon became evident that be in for smart attack of malarial fever to appeared be very subject when turned in night mate volunteered information that feared skipper be going to be very ill tourville condition on following morning amply justified leroy foreboding grew steadily worse became delirious at length grew so violent that about mid day mate considered necessary to remain with constantly lest in madness must rise from bed fling through stern window into sea one result of be that offered to take leroy watch from eight o'clock to midnight offer be gratefully accepted a be running down before fair wind there be nothing for to do beyond maintaining good look out thus found unnecessary to give crew order to interfere with in way for next three day tourville condition be such that constant presence of one in cabin night day to watch over guard against possibility of doing injury became absolute necessity leroy chief mate thoreau boatswain shared duty between volunteered to assume nursing duty in place of leroy offer be declined chief mate rather drily remarking that presence of englishman by captain bedside be scarcely likely to accelerate patient recovery while of raving be of such character that be better for concerned must not hear added if must be complaisant enough to keep watch for must esteem very great favour of course must do le than accede to suggestion with good grace chapter fourteen hbms gadfly have be on duty a leroy deputy for two whole day when fell to turn to keep middle watch be to say watch extends from midnight to four o'clock in morning when upon being called by marcel second mate went on deck to relieve informed that wind have be steadily dropping through first watch expressed fear that be about to lose altogether did not in least surprise for be now at about lowest parallel on border at least of if not actually within belt of practically perpetual calm exists about line be source of so much delay vexation hard work to mariner that wind have dropped very considerably since have turned in be evident to even before reached deck for upon turning out of bunk to dress after being called have immediately noticed that ship be almost upon even keel while inert sloppy sound of water alongside that reached ear through open port of cabin told that be sailing slowly night be intensely dark for moon be one day old have only barely revealed a thin line of faint pearl in evening sky for about hour before followed sun beneath horizon there be not star to be seen in whole of visible firmament there be feeling of hot muggy dampness in air that made shrewdly suspect presence overhead of pall of rain charged vapour must account for opacity of darkness hemmed in pressed down upon from above a marcel curtly bade good night went below upon being relieved after giving course to be steered expressing foreboding concerning weather walked aft glanced into binnacle inquired of helmsman whether ship still held steerage way to replied that did be about man whom have relieved at eight bell having informed that log when last hove have recorded speed of barely two half knot also volunteered opinion that be booked for heavy downpour of rain before long significantly glancing at same time at oilskin sou'wester have brought aft with a time dragged slowly along heat seemed steadily to grow more oppressive difficulty of obtaining full breath greater perspiration be streaming from pore of body felt almost too languid to drag one foot after other a moved about deck that sick man also be affected unfavourably be evident for shout came up through after skylight with positively startling distinctness a delirium grew more acute at length just after two bell have struck how dreadfully clamourous stroke sounded in heavy stagnant air helmsman reported that ship be no longer under command presently swung broadside on to swell rolling heavily with loud splashing gurgling sound in scupper with swirling washing of water under counter frequent vicious kick of now useless rudder accompanied by violent clankings of wheel chain loud creaking groanings of timber heavy flapping rustling of invisible canvas aloft with fierce jerk of chain sheet in short full chorus of multitudinous sound emanate from rolling ship in stark calm helmsman no longer needed lashed wheel gathering up oilskin slouched away forward muttering that be going to get light for pipe let go although knew perfectly well that have intention of returning uncalled for after where be use of keeping man standing there doing nothing therefore contented by calling upon hand forward from time to time to keep bright look out flung into basket chair belonging to skipper sitting thus gradually fell into somewhat sombre reverie in course of reviewed event have befallen during short period have elapsed since dolphin eros have parted company went over again in memory circumstance connected with loss of brigantine hour have spent alone in longboat destruction somewhat dramatic appearance among crew of la mouette reception by mad captain then fell to conjecturing what future might have in store for when be suddenly aroused to consciousness of immediate surroundings by sort of impression be no more than that have heard sound of ship bell struck four time ting ting ting ting far away yonder in heart of thick darkness so faint such mere ghost of sound did seem to be felt almost convinced be purely imaginary effect resulting from train of thought in have be indulging yet rose to foot walking over to skylight peered through at cabin clock to ascertain what time might actually be be on stroke of two o'clock therefore if a have assured sound be imaginary be at least singular coincidence that must have reached just at precise moment walked to fore end of poop upon rail guarding ship bell be mounted sharply struck four bell after again called to crew forward to maintain sharp look out now thought if sound originated outside own imagination of fellow for'ard will certainly have heard will mention call elicited nothing more than stereotyped ay ay sir faint momentary shuffling of foot meant doubt to convey to impression that look out be on alert then deep silence a before so far a report of suspicious sound be concerned stood for quite two minute listening intently for further sound out of darkness none came to must detect light other evidence of craft in neighbourhood at length fully confirmed in conviction that imagination have be playing trick with returned to chair in have be sitting there finished out watch merely leaving seat to strike six finally eight bell placed chair in position that while still sitting in must keep eye on clock a hand crept round face marking first three then four o'clock strained listening power to utmost in hope that elusive bell stroke might again come stealing across sea to without result when four o'clock came round after striking eight bell with perhaps little more vigour than usual called marcel resigned deck to went below yet although have felt drowsy enough on deck although tourville raving have ceased seemed to have fallen asleep when flung off clothes stretched on top of bedding in bunk expecting to instantly drop off to sleep found to annoyance have never be le inclined to slumber than be just then fact be that in spite of ghostly tinklings be still worrying be be not imaginary if be well there be end of if be not imaginary if a now perversely began to think be actual sound then followed of necessity that there must be craft of sort not very far from if be case what asked be likely to be must be one of three thing trader slaver craft belonging to slave squadron chance therefore be about even that on morrow might be able to effect escape from la mouette always provided of course that stroke of bell have be real for if craft on board have be struck happened to be trader odds be in favour of being british same might be said presuming to be man o ' war on other hand might of course be slaver in case be fully resolved to endure ill have rather than fly to others might conceivably be worse thinking thus worrying a to best course to be pursued in certain eventuality lay there restlessly tossing first to one side then to other until at length sitting up in bunk putting face to open port in quest of breath of fresh air fancy took that darkness be no longer quite so opaque a have be nay be sure of for by putting face right up against circular opening be enabled to catch occasional transient gleam of faint shifting light that knew be glancing of coming dawn upon back of oily swell that came creeping up to ship while by directing glance higher found that be able to make out indistinctly something of outline of great black cloud mass overhung in latitude dawn come a quickly a daylight vanishes day come go with rush thus within five minute of time when first glanced out through port there be enough light abroad to reveal louring overcast thunder threatening inky oil smooth sluggishly undulating sea long low schooner with tremendously taunt mast raking over stern not inch of canvas set lying broadside on to at distance of two mile to eastward when caught first glimpse of be very little more than black blur standing out against background of scarcely le black sky even a sat looking at light grew outline sharpened became clear distinct heart gave great bound of delight a conviction forced upon that knew yes that long low hull with abnormal length of counter bold sheer forward high dominating bow with excessive rake of stem peculiar steeve of bowsprit be familiar to have seen noted before while in sierra leone harbour be convinced that craft be none other than british man o ' war schooner gadfly armed with eight pound carronades long pound pivot gun on forecastle with crew of eighty men under command of lieutenant peter than whom there be not more dashing enterprising officer on coast have just arrived at above conclusion when heard one of barque crew hailing poop must not distinguish what be said presumed that have reference to schooner for immediately upon hail heard creaking of basket chair on poop a though marcel be just hoisting out of presently reply came floating down through skylight ay ay see then heard soft shuffling of footstep overhead guessed that be getting hold of telescope wherewith to examine schooner ten minute later perhaps heard second mate leave poop enter cabin concluded that have come down to report schooner to leroy to surprise instead of doing that came straight to cabin door knocked softly at once guessed that wished to question about stranger be part of policy to let know have already seen made up mind about therefore feigned to be sound asleep did not reply then knocked second time more sharply whereupon started up responded in drowsy tone of voice hillo who be what be matter monsieur fortescue marcel responded murmuring through slat in upper panel of door want on deck quick oh indeed replied still affecting drowsiness what for be there anything wrong please come up at once monsieur returned with note of impatience in voice when come on deck will understand why want very well grumbled will be up in brace of shake whereupon disturber departed conversation with brief a have be quietly a have be conducted have evidently aroused leroy for a emerged from cabin stepped out of proceeded to poop together chief mate expressing surprise that marcel must have called instead of of course have very shrewd idea a to reason be cue to feign ignorance did so by time leroy reached poop sun must have risen although there be sign of to be seen through dense canopy of cloud completely obscured heaven for light have strengthened so much atmosphere be so clear that detail of distant schooner be plainly distinguishable even to unassisted eye marcel be again examining through glass be therefore only natural that leroy own glance must turn toward a soon a head rose above level of rail neither of said anything however until marcel took glass from eye when seeing leroy said what d 'ye think of monsieur have taken upon to turn out monsieur fortescue to see whether can tell anything about ejaculated what dickens must know about that be slaver anybody can tell with eye a matter of fact gadfly have be slaver in time having be captured have be purchased into service skipper be sensible fellow evidently doe believe in threshing canvas threadbare in calm so have furled permit said leroy taking telescope from marcel placing to eye looked long anxiously at distant schooner at length with ah spoke volume passed glass over to understood at once from expressive ah leroy knew have recognised vessel that pretence of ignorance must no longer serve good purpose therefore determined to abandon to make virtue of necessity by frankly admitting knowledge for if leroy recognised schooner a be certain have must be fully aware of fact that a officer of slave squadron must necessarily know too after regarding attentively through lens therefore for more than minute passed glass back to chief mate with quiet remark yes believe recognise now come to see distinctly if be not mistaken be british man o ' war schooner gadfly presence yonder affords captain tourville opportunity to fulfil promise of transhipping promised must such case a occur must give boat in to transfer that small dinghy of yours will be just thing y e returned leroy meditatively promised that did remember telling so unfortunately for never said word upon matter to be far too sick just now to be worried about anything else be very much afraid therefore monsieur fortescue that will be obliged to let opportunity pas for see must not possibly take upon to release give even dinghy without first receiving definite instruction from captain oh come say leroy surely mean to insinuate that doubt word do remonstrated hope pretend pretend insinuate anything leroy retorted somewhat impatiently merely state fact have received from captain tourville such instruction a mention without such instruction dare not comply with wish have have jeered marcel will have to curb impatience monsieur englishman be evident that be not yet to lose pleasure of society to replied nothing turned remonstratingly to chief mate urging to at least do favour to go down see if captain chanced to be awake if so to put matter to must not listen to suggestion insisting that even if captain tourville happened to be awake be far too ill to be troubled over such matter suddenly came to that despite past apparent friendliness be for unknown reason anxious must not be released seeing therefore utter uselessness of further argument desisted turned away bitterly disappointed not of course that with leroy refusal hope of deliverance be to be abandoned by mean so long a gadfly remained in sight there be always chance for if knew anything of lieutenant peter be not man to let go without giving overhaul then chance must certainly come be duty of ship of slave squadron to stop examine paper of ship encountered in water be certain that peter must not be likely to make exception in favour while if leroy resisted a of course must well must simply mean that la mouette must be captured meanwhile leroy marcel be eagerly consulting together presently second mate left poop went forward quietly called hand then a soon a crew be on deck be ordered to clear for action gun be cast loose magazine opened powder shot be passed up on deck arm chest be brought up cutlass pistol be served out brace of latter to man pistol musket be loaded pike cast adrift distributed in short preparation be made for fight except that gun be not then loaded second mate have be moving spirit in preparation leroy meanwhile remaining on poop intently watching schooner through telescope by time that preparation for battle be complete be close upon seven bell order be given for crew to get breakfast for meal to be also served in cabin few minute later steward came along with pot of cocoa in one hand covered dish in other leroy coming aft to where stood moodily pondering thrust hand under arm said with apparent good nature now sulk mon cher come down have breakfast unless be greatly mistaken gadfly be about to send boat then may perhaps be able to return in build too much upon chance for a soon a come within range will open fire upon with round grape if can not sink before get alongside why will deserve to be hanged be thank monsieur answered have appetite for breakfast just now with permission will remain on deck rather than go into suffocating cabin merely to watch marcel eat eh bien a please returned with shrug of shoulder will not ask to keep look out for because can do quite well from window of captain cabin looking round think can do mischief up here be sure will not come down very well then revoir now to be left on deck practically alone be bit of luck have not dared to hope for fact have be coupled with what leroy have said about boat gave idea upon immediately acted be still lying broadside on to gadfly have not least doubt on board constant watch be being kept upon barque glancing round hurriedly therefore observing that hand on forecastle be busy with breakfast slipped over side into mizzen chain where must stand without being seen from inboard removing jacket so that white shirt sleeve might show up clearly against barque black side forthwith began to semaphore with arm waving up down for about minute to attract attention then without knowing whether not have be successful proceeded to signal following message la mouette slaver armed with fourteen pound carronades four pounder carry one hundred seventy men attack with long thirty two boat too risky then donning jacket again returned inboard just in time to see marcel head appear above level of poop hillo exclaimed be wondering what have become of have be doing over side considering whether must attempt to swim across to gadfly yes answered boldly seizing at once upon suggestion thus given have thought better of continued there be too many shark about look there pointed to dorsal fin be sculling lazily along dozen fathom away man looked at suspiciously for several second then walked to side looked over into chain of course there be nothing to be seen then muttering to returned to cabin presumably to finish breakfast have scarcely disappeared be looking round for telescope when flash of flame cloud of white smoke suddenly burst from schooner forecastle presently pound shot dashed into water within dozen fathom of rudder good shot not quite enough elevation muttered delighted at indication that message have be noted be being acted upon then came sullen boom of gun across water went to skylight quite unnecessarily reported schooner have opened fire sacre e e heard leroy exclaim between teeth one thing be afraid of have thought better of sending boat then marcel answered something what be must not catch then pair of came racing up on deck have scarcely arrived when shot came from schooner crashing through bulwark just forward of fore rigging dismounting gun playing havoc with men who crowded that part of deck five be killed outright nine wounded by one shot splinter that created leroy at once called crew to quarter ordered to return schooner fire latter be too far off for carronades pounder to reach spirit began to rise for if schooner must only continue a have begun must soon compel la mouette to strike there be prospect of happening for gadfly have now got range to nicety shot after shot hulled playing very mischief with dismounting gun strewing deck with killed wounded cutting up rigging most unfortunately never touching spar leroy stamped fore aft deck cursing like madman shaking fist at schooner glowering savagely at whistling for wind give breeze shouted give breeze will run down blow schooner out of water presently prayer be answered not quite a desired for while watched cloud broke away to eastward presently saw dark line stealing along water toward schooner ten minute later hand aboard be busily engaged in making sail by time that wind reached be ready for then a filled sail put up helm squared away for running down before wind yawing from time to time to give shot be fatal mistake must have continued to play game of long bowl in case must have done a pleased with by keeping away however running down to gave leroy just chance wanted waited until be well within range of carronades then double shotting watching opportunity gave whole of starboard broadside down came foremast main topmast at same moment shot came from schooner badly wounding main topmast above cap breeze reaching almost immediately afterward spar went over side dragging down mizzen topmast fore topgallant mast with result of be that while schooner broached to rode by wreck of foremast a to sea anchor la mouette fell broad off refused to come to wind again consequently distance between two vessel rapidly widened until be out of range firing ceased thus ended fight presume that two craft soon passed out of sight of other did not again meet during voyage at least for there be more firing from la mouette while remained aboard what transpired during rest of voyage be destined to know very little about for scarcely have firing ceased when captain tourville thin weak emaciated crept up on poop have pistol in hand sooner did gaze fall on than levelled weapon at fired point blank fortunately for man hand be so unsteady that ball flew wide report brought mate dozen men to with rush to see what be matter take that young scoundrel exclaimed tourville pointing at with finger trembled with rage a much a with weakness put hand foot in iron heave down on ballast leave there until give further instruction chapter fifteen in hand of savage order be promptly obeyed in few minute found heavily ironed in pitchy darkness of lower hold squatted disconsolately upon bed of shingle constituted ballast of vessel what situation for young fellow of le than twenty year of age to be in ship of have be placed in command lost foundered in mid ocean only too probably hand lost with fate must never be known must be concluded that one of mysterious disaster so frequently befall seaman have overtaken must be given up a lost there must be end of so far a fellow men be concerned for hope might once have entertained of escaping from accursed ship have none now that tourville must not be satisfied with anything short of taking life be convinced very soon began to feel did not care how soon sated vengeance for confined below in heat darkness of stifling hold with resting place hard shingle for aching body breathing atmosphere poisonous with odour of bilge water with only three flinty ship biscuit alive with weevil half pint of putrid water per day upon to sustain life beset by ferocious rat who disputed with possession of scanty fare soon became so miserably ill that death quickly lost terror felt must welcome a release from suffering how long remained in state of wretchedness can not tell for soon lost count of time indeed at last sank into state of semi delirium think from subsequent calculation must have be about ten twelve day after date of incarceration be aroused once more to complete consciousness of surroundings by observing that change have occurred in motion of ship no longer pitched rolled a doe vessel in open sea slid along a must tell by gurgling sound of water along bend upon perfectly even keel except for slight list inclination due to pressure of wind upon sail conjectured that must have arrived at end of voyage entered kwara river conjecture be shortly afterward confirmed by sound on deck of shouted order bustle confusion attendant upon operation of shortening sail soon followed by splash of anchor from bow rumble of stout hempen cable through hawse pipe then ensued period of quiet of several hour duration broken at length by appearance of carpenter seaman who having removed iron gruffly ordered to follow up on deck felt altogether too wretchedly ill too utterly indifferent respecting fate to ask men question contrived by almost superhuman exertion to climb up perpendicular ladder led to deck when presently emerged from foetid atmosphere of hold into free air dazzling sunshine of what proved to be early morning be so overcome by sudden transition swooned away must have remained in state of complete unconsciousness for several hour for when at length again opened eye looked about sun be nearly overhead be lying unbound in bottom of long craft that slowly returning sens at length enabled to recognise a native dug out canoe be about forty foot long by four foot beam about two foot deep be manned by thirty a ferocious looking savage a one need ever wish to see be stark naked save for kind of breech clout round loin squatted in pair along bottom of canoe plying short broad bladed paddle with seemed to be urging craft at pretty good pace through water big brawny most repulsive looking savage who be probably captain of craft sat perched up in stern steering with somewhat longer broader bladed paddle urging crew to maintain exertion by continually giving utterance to most hair raising shriek yell be fresh air suppose that revived even a after long sojourn in noisome hold of slaver have prostrated by sudden emergence into presently became conscious that be feeling distinctly better than have done for time past for minute two lay passively where be in bottom of canoe blinking up at pallid zenith near sun blazed with blinding brilliancy then one saying nay slowly painfully raised into sitting posture looked about be in typical african river about three quarter of mile wide with low bush clad bank bordered by inevitable mangrove while beyond towered virgin tropical forest dense impenetrable full of mystery turbid current be against a must be seen at glance therefore knew at once that be paddling up stream whither be bound of what tribe nation be negro who manned canoe how have come to be among have tourville with greater refinement of cruelty than even gave credit for handed over to tender mercy of savage to work bloodthirsty will upon instead of murdering out of hand if so what be to be ultimate fate shuddered a put question to myself for have be on coast quite long enough to have heard many gruesome blood curdling story of horror perpetrated by african savage upon unhappy white men who have be unfortunate enough to fall into hand be not going to allow to be frightened discouraged by dwelling upon story of kind be feeling so far better that desire to live have returned to even experienced slight sensation of hunger there be doubt at a to fact be parched with thirst therefore turned to savage who be flourishing steering paddle first pointing to open mouth went through motion of raising vessel to drinking man evidently understood for shouted few to quite unintelligible word whereupon one of paddler about centre of canoe laid in paddle for few moment did something dexterous with spear brownish grey object size of man head minute later lip be glued to luscious cocoa nut extremity of have be deftly struck off with blade of spear disclosing white lined hollow of cup within brimming with full pint more of delicious milk swallowed to last drop then breaking off strip of husk using a spoon proceeded to scrape out hungrily devour soft creamy fruit lined shell thus made most satisfying enjoyable meal have passed lip for many day shortly afterward strength of ebb current increasing so greatly that be able to make scarcely headway against steersman headed canoe in toward western bank of river presently entered narrow creek up passed for distance of about quarter of mile until reached practicable landing place when canoe be secured to stout mangrove root hand stepped out of steersman taking precaution to draw attention to spear bow arrow with party be armed a hint suppose of what might expect must be foolish enough to attempt to escape pushed way through thick bush for distance of about hundred yard then reached small open space where bivouacked party of ten disappearing into bush while rest remained to kindle fire evidently to look after make sure did not give slip at length after lapse of about hour party who have vanished into bush returned singly by two three bringing in monkey two others few brace of parrot one man big lizard like iguana fine deer until of ten have contributed something to common larder when fire be made up plentiful supply of food cooked hand set to with will apparently animated by determination to show others how much solid food be capable of putting out of sight at sitting very civilly offered choice of dainty accepted tolerably substantial venison steak broiled over fire by being suspended close over glowing ember upon end of stick off contrived to make fairly hearty meal after following example of others stretched out in long grass under shadow of big bush quickly fell into deep sleep be aroused from slumber hour later by savage companion who intimated to by sign that moment have arrived for to take departure accordingly wended way back to canoe taking surplus stock of food with embarking soon found ourselves once more afloat on placid bosom of broad river downward opposing current of have by time greatly slackened under influence of flood tide be evidently making fast keeping well out toward centre of stream paddling steadily now made rapid progress in northerly direction river gradually widening shoaling a went until by time of sunset found progressing up comparatively narrow deep water channel with wide expanse of willow water on side of dotted here there with dry patch of mud sand upon crocodile lay basking in case in group of a many a six eight together while occasionally great head of hippopotamus appeared for moment only to vanish again with little eddying swirl of mud charged water a creature dived while sun still hovered degree two above tree top on western bank of stream moon now nearly full sailed gloriously into view above clump of vegetation shrouded eastern bank gradual transition from ruddy golden light of dying sun to flooding silver of brilliant moon with ever changing effect accompanied transition presented spectacle of enchanting beauty such a have never up to time beheld even at sea beyond low muttered word two grunt apparently expressive of deep satisfaction at appearance of unclouded moon savage took notice of magical loveliness of scene while sat entranced practically oblivious of everything else merely paddled harder conversing in low tone among of course did not understand single word of what be said yet so much did gather from glance that flung about emphasis accent of speech that shrewdly suspected of anticipating possibility of attack from shore suspicion be strengthened little later on by fact that a approached certain bend in river timoneer edged canoe in toward eastern bank until be completely plunged in deep shadow of vegetation that grew right down to water edge a though be desirous of escaping observation at least there be other reason must think of for such manoeuvre for by time current be running up quite strongly under ordinary circumstance must have be to advantage to have remained in mid channel where full strength of must be felt if be object be only partially successful for presently arrived abreast of bay may have be wide entrance of creek many of branched off main stream on hand where forest receded so far that for distance of fully mile be compelled to traverse space of water completely flooded by brilliant ray of moon before have accomplished passage quick ejaculation of mingled annoyance dismay from steersman caused to glance toward western bank from opening in dozen canoe be darting out with evident determination to intercept if possible fortunately for however have already passed spot from pursuing canoe be emerging spot now bearing well upon port quarter on other hand pursuer must presently obtain important advantage over since must soon reach deep channel where upward current be now running strongly feared that when arrived in channel must turn bow of craft up stream avail of advantage afforded by strong current to endeavour to pas ahead of cut off retreat in eagerness of pursuit seemed to lose sight of advantage for continued to head straight for while impelled by full strength of thirty paddle now plied with desperate energy by freely perspiring crew gradually drew out threw pursuer still further on quarter yet be steadily nearing did not see how must scrape clear without something in nature of fight time be heading straight for low heavily timbered point marked turn in course of stream must see that people be straining nerve to get round point before being overtaken at length with mighty stirring up of mud by deep plunging paddle in willow water shaved close round point almost immediately afterwards darted into narrow creek so completely overgrown with vegetation that bough of mangrove other tree united over head forming sort of tunnel interior of be so opaquely dark that be scarcely possible to see one hand before one face yet helmsman seemed to know place perfectly for stood boldly on urging crew to continue exertion at length after have traversed full hundred yard more of creek sighted spot ahead where doubtless in consequence of wind fall similar phenomenon dense bush have be levelled leaving room for patch of clear moonlight ten yard in circumference to fall full upon channel of creek revealing object even smallest within boundary with clearness distinctness be positively startling arrived here canoe be sheered in alongside spot where mangrove grew thickly twenty of crew laying in paddle hastily seized bow arrow springing ashore swiftly vanished into adjacent deep shadow while canoe with remainder of on board pushed across patch of moonlight into darkness beyond where be forced beneath overhanging mass of foliage in such manner a to lie perfectly concealed hardly have be accomplished when heard from river exclamation of pursuer startled at sudden at first inexplicable disappearance did not long remain inexplicable sharp eye soon detected entrance of creek suspected that be concealed therein for after few minute spent in animated discussion by occupant pursuing canoe be heard cautiously approaching be evident that knowledge of creek be not nearly so complete a of own steersman for whereas have contrived despite pitchy darkness to navigate crooked channel without running foul of anything must hear continual swishing of foliage bumping of canoe a encountered overhanging branch collided with mangrove root on one side other be thus able to follow progress of approach with utmost precision moment that leading canoe craft manned by twenty most villainous looking savage emerged from darkness into patch of brilliant moonlight be greeted with murderous discharge of arrow at short range put greater part of crew hors de combat be closely followed by canoe of about same size occupant of be treated to similarly warm reception warning shout from one of survivor of second discharge be raised in time to save behind from pushing forward to meet similar fate now quick twanging of bowstring loud shout from ashore afloat told that fierce battle be raging people from advantage of position have very much best of at length pursuer be beaten off compelled to retreat precipitately with loss of nearly two third of number two canoe with wounded occupant be left in hand while party escaped absolutely unscathed wounded of enemy numbering eleven must have met with short shrift at hand of captor for interposition of man whom have termed timoneer who seemed to be petty chief individual carefully examined prisoner found that three of be so severely wounded a to afford little hope of recovery three therefore despatched with most callous sang froid by driving broad bladed spear into throat after be flung over side remaining eight who appeared to be only temporarily disabled be trussed up hand foot with thin tough pliant creeper cut from adjacent jungle bestowed without much consideration for comfort in bottom of canoe captured canoe be then sunk by mean of few large stone placed in to take down then heeled until water flowed in over gunwale when quickly vanished beneath turbid foetid water of creek done people made preparation for continuation of journey leader whose knowledge of river seemed intimate enough to entitle to certificate a branch pilot have inclination to incur risk of leaving creek again at point where have entered thus very possibly falling into cleverly arranged ambuscade on contrary proceeded to push boldly on up creek for distance of several mile much to astonishment for waterway generally be so narrow a scarcely to afford room for two canoe to pas abreast be momentarily expecting that creek like so many others of african river must abruptly end in mud bank overgrown with mangrove contrary to anticipation however when dozen time more bank closed in upon in manner a to suggest that further progress be about to be stayed must suddenly emerge into comparatively wide channel push merrily on for mile more ere encountered next difficulty in manner must have traversed distance of nearly twenty mile when to amazement also of most of canoe crew think suddenly emerged from tunnel like channel that have be navigating for something like five hour found once more in what be undoubtedly main stream of river so far away from spot at have diverged from that be nowhere to be seen moon have by time risen so high in sky a to be almost directly overhead there be therefore little shadow on bank of river to shroud from observation nevertheless continued to cling closely to eastern bank for several mile further tide having now turned being against until at current becoming too strong for leader found practicable landing place hand except unfortunate prisoner of war scrambled ashore hastily lighting fire disposed to sleep around now will probably be thought by many be submitting to uncertain fate with far greater philosophy than wisdom be by mean case fact be that have sooner awakened to consciousness be prisoner in hand of african savage than made up mind must not too soon effect escape from for although have just spoken of fate a uncertain felt that in reality there be very little uncertainty about be so rarely that white man fell into hand of negro savage that when one have misfortune to do so generally made utmost of that utmost be usually something in prolonged agonising torture figured largely must obviously be worse than useless to attempt to escape until opportunity occurred of at least fair prospect of success for to attempt fail meant extinguishment at once of further hope up to present have not have ghost of opportunity captor have taken good care of although have be kind enough to leave unbound now when hand must be feeling effect of fatigue after several hour of strenuous labour at paddle be likely to sleep soundly be possible that by biding time might be able to steal off to canoe cut bond of captive who have be so callously left in when must be strange indeed if out of gratitude for release of be not willing to help to make way back to mouth of river where must of course have to take chance of finding ship master of must be willing to receive on board be not perhaps very brilliant prospect felt that be at least preferable to to might look forward if remained in company of present owner accordingly when sable companion disposed to sleep apparently did same summoned energy to aid in task of resisting tendency toward somnolence felt stealing over be not nearly so easy a have believed must be if closed eye for few second delicious languor seized thought began to wander be only by almost painful effort succeeded in a be jerking back to full consciousness intention be to remain awake until companion have become wrapped in slumber then effect escape from to chagrin found that while be almost impossible for to remain awake captor owner scarcely knew to consider seemed restless watchful more le upon alert finally while waiting watching for sign that be succumbing to influence of drowsy god lost control of sank into profound delicious slumber chapter sixteen king banda how long remained steeped in delightful refreshing sleep did not then know when at length awoke with violent start ember of fire be merely smouldering while snort snore be emitted by recumbent figure grouped around seemed to indicate that fateful moment have arrived when might make bid for liberty with prospect of success be now very much darker than have be when sank into involuntary slumber for moon have swung so far over toward west at least two third of small clearing occupied be enveloped in deep shadow observed with dismay that path to canoe lay directly across patch be still bathed in moon ray that however must not be helped must not afford to delay until moon have sunk low enough to throw entire clearing into shadow for with setting of moon must come dawn sunrise therefore determined to start upon attempt forthwith a first step rolled over away from fire a though stirring in sleep be now lying with back to fire must therefore not see companion observe effect if movement have have upon resolved not to fail for want of caution so made further attempt to withdraw for next ten minute confined simply to few restless movement a though be actually case be being worried by swarm of minute creeping biting thing with spot abounded then at end of about ten minute from first movement ventured again to roll over in same direction a before once more brought with face toward fire now opened eye cautiously carefully surveyed surroundings not one of black figure about fire appeared to have altered position in slightest degree so far a must perceive while snoring snorting still proceeded a vigorously a ever lay quite still for two three minute then a everything seemed perfectly safe have not too much time to spare decided that might venture upon somewhat more rapid mode of progression accordingly raised upon hand knee proceeded to crawl very cautiously toward canoe looking back from time to time to see if be observed be while be thus engaged in looking back while still creeping forward that a put forth right hand fell upon something cold clammy stirred beneath touch next instant felt sharp pricking sensation in fleshy base of right thumb like lightning snatched hand away threw backward sprang to foot with involuntary cry a did so indistinctly caught sight of small wriggling object in long grass seemed to vanish in flash be snake have bitten yes there be mistake about for a lifted hand to eye there be light enough for to see two drop of blood about quarter of inch apart upon right hand upon spur of moment clapped wounded part to mouth sucked vigorously spitting out such blood a be able to draw from wound continued to do industriously for next hour more chance of escape be gone for night at least for cry brought whole of savage to foot a one man with weapon grasped ready for instant use dozen of seeing upon foot sprang toward surrounded with angry cry did not of course make slightest attempt to run on contrary showed wounded hand with two finger of left hand extended made motion a of snake striking fang into flesh individual whom took to be chief of little party thereupon led back to fire thrusting two three dry twig into smouldering ash fanned latter into blaze with breath thus causing twig to ignite then using twig a torch carefully examined wounded hand shook head a though to indicate have chance cast blazing twig to ground saying few word to companion lay down again composed to sleep example at once followed by companion however remained awake diligently sucking wounded hand soon began to swell grow acutely painful throbbing pain extending way up arm right to shoulder pain at length became so acute must sit still no longer therefore sprang to foot began to pace to fro have sooner done so than dozen of savage be beside not exactly interfering with for think understood pretty clearly what be matter with making perfectly plain that be watching that only certain amount of freedom must be permitted whether really understood be actually attempting to effect escape when snake bit be never able to determine at dawn arrived day broke sun rose few of savage taking bow arrow went off into bush to forage a surmised little later returned one after other bringing contribution to common larder while others busied in collecting fresh wood rebuilding fire while be thus engaged one of party who happened to pas near spot where have be bitten suddenly uttered most dreadful yell grasped left foot looked at moment then began with furious haste to search about in long grass pushed apart with blade of spear few second later fell to stabbing ground a seemed savagely finally stooping down picking up still writhing half of snake have be cut clean in two by blow of spear be not at formidable looking creature being not more than eighteen inch long perhaps three inch girth about thickest part of body be ugly repulsive looking brute head being heart shaped body almost same thickness for greater part of length terminating in short blunt tail ground colour be dirty grey upon occurred large irregular blotch marking of dull black with few splash of brilliant red here there fellow who have fallen upon with such ferocity who have evidently be bitten by brought two writhing fragment flung into fire in midst of writhed still more horribly then seizing good stout brightly glowing brand from fire coolly sat down applied almost white hot end to wound be in left instep think ever saw anything more heroic than act of savage for though flesh hissed smoked gave forth most horrible odour of burnt flesh man never winced calmly deliberately cauterised bite with a much care thoroughness a though have be operating upon somebody else that be not insensible to self inflicted torture be very evident from fact that in few second be literally drenched with perspiration started from pore of body while be happening leader of party have hurriedly raked from fire scorched blistered half of snake to head be attached seizing by neck squeezed until jaw be forced open revealing two long slender needle like fang projecting from upper jaw holding horrible object between finger thumb of right hand approached before have least idea of what intended to do seized wounded hand approached head of still living reptile so closely to that be easily to be seen that two tiny puncture in flesh be exactly same distance apart a snake fang inference being that be identical reptile have bitten having satisfied of man flung loathsome object back into heart of fire where be soon consumed be by time suffering most dreadful agony hand arm be so terribly swollen that have almost lost semblance to portion of human anatomy while two puncture made by poison fang be puffed up almost to bursting encircled by two ring of livid grey colour throbbing of limb a blood forced through congested passage can only be compared to pulsing of stream of fire be certain have be within reach of qualified surgical assistance at moment must have insisted upon having limb removed a be convinced that pain of amputation must have be le acute than from be suffering needle to say have appetite for food when be offered little while afterward felt thirsty enough to drink river dry quaffed several cocoa nut with ecstasy of delight that almost caused to forget pain for moment breakfast over word be given to re embark wended way back to canoe know whether be deliberate intention merely result of accident must not help noticing that during short journey from camping place to spot where canoe have be left there be always three four savage quite close to who appeared to be keeping very careful watch upon movement a though more than half suspected of desire to give slip be by time suffering such excruciating agony for time being at least thought of escape be completely banished from mind have become quite convinced that bite be going to prove fatal only subject of speculation be how many more hour of torture be doomed to endure before merciful death must come to relief after have be afloat for about hour be once more speeding up river a fast a sturdy arm of paddler must urge suddenly became violently sick paroxysm lasting for nearly ten minute when have in degree recovered from exhaustion attendant upon attack be equally surprised delighted to find that pain throbbing in arm be distinctly le acute from moment a much to astonishment of savage a of symptom rapidly improved until by evening be so far free from pain a to be able to sleep for several hour although swelling did not entirely subside until nearly forty eight hour later meanwhile fellow sufferer savage who have also be bitten who have resorted to heroic method of cauterising wound have be day steadily developing symptom similar to own before curative attack of sickness foot leg right up to hip have swollen to enormous size become so stiff that when moment arrived for to disembark for night be unable to move begged most piteously a interpreted tone of voice action to be left in canoe night to fight out battle between life death alone undisturbed next morning when went down to canoe poor fellow be not only dead whole body be swollen almost out of human semblance presenting in other respect most shocking revolting spectacle took corpse with until have reached main channel of river there flung overboard have scarcely left fifty fathom astern when there arose sudden violent commotion in water about second two later disappeared from view dragged down by voracious crocodile with river swarmed be by time quite free from pain apart from feeling of extreme debility have endured for hour on previous day be not much worse for alarming experience have undergone death of savage who have be bitten after undoubtedly by same reptile conclusively proved how very narrow have be escape from similar fate naturally fell to wondering how be that have succumbed to injury while have recovered from mine for seemed to at moment that remedial measure have adopted ought from very severe drastic character to have proved much more efficacious than own whereas opposite be case upon further reflection came to conclusion that while have proceeded to suck poison from wound at once within second two of infliction savage have wasted at least minute in pursuing slaying enemy before cauterising wound that minute of delay accompanied a be by somewhat violent action on part of injured man have sufficed for poison to obtain strong enough hold upon system to produce fatal result whether not be correct explanation must leave to who be better qualified than to judge day after day steadily pursued course up river for most part retained same dreary monotonous aspect of low bush clad mangrove lined bank practically same width save where at occasional interval widened out became dotted with island of considerable size at length arrived at point where land on western bank rose into range of hill eight nine hundred foot high densely clothed with vegetation to summit range of hill extended northward for distance of about thirty mile before once more sank into plain before sank completely out of sight astern more high land be sighted ahead two day later found navigating among very picturesque scenery with high land on side of of peak being twelve to fourteen hundred foot high late in evening of second day after entering upon picturesque stretch of river arrived at point where stream forked into two of apparently equal width depth one branch striking away to eastward while other continued northerly course here savage companion proceeded with utmost caution frequently landing sending one two of party away to reconnoitre otherwise behaving a though feared attack after slow anxious progress of twenty hour duration seemed to consider danger a past once more pressed boldly forward by time have completely recovered not only from effect of snake bite at companion seemed greatly astonished also from hardship privation have experienced during latter part of voyage aboard la mouette have begun to think very seriously of how be to effect escape from who held captive not be ill treated by far from enjoyed same fare a be never asked to share labour take be a much good treatment a must reasonably expect under circumstance knew that be not hampering by taking other prisoner long journey up river much of paddling being done against stream merely for pleasure of enjoying society intuition assured that action have more sinister motive than in case have desire to penetrate interior of equatorial africa therefore so soon a felt that health strength be sufficiently restored to allow of attempting long perilous journey back to sea alone began to consider question of escape longer thought of le became hope of success for very soon discovered that under circumstance be custodian disposed to allow to stray yard out of sight without imposing actual restraint upon invariably so contrived that if made slightest attempt to withdraw from three four of most active of party always well armed have occasion to go in precisely same direction a myself that however be not only difficulty for assuming for moment possibility of being able to give savage slip how be white man alone unarmed with mean of obtaining food to make way down more than two hundred mile of river flowing through country inhabitant of must undoubtedly be enemy whose delight must be to hunt to death told that if must obtain small light handy canoe weapon even though must consist of bow arrow situation must not be altogether hopeless for possessed very fair share of pluck resource felt that before must effect escape from watchful custodian obtain necessity might find in so dire strait a to render else valueless to yet must not suffer to feel discouraged for recognised that to abandon hope be to virtually surrender tamely to worst fate might have in store for be by mean disposition therefore continued to keep eye wide open for opportunity watch a might opportunity never presented thanks to watchfulness of companion must make one so time dragged on until after river voyage of more than three week one evening about two hour before sunset entered creek important enough to suggest idea that might possibly be small tributary of main river after paddling up for distance of about two mile suddenly hove in sight of native town of considerable size built upon north bank of creek upon area of ground have be completely cleared of undergrowth be well shaded by larger tree have be allowed to stand that town be of importance a well a of considerable size surmised from fact that with few exception habitation instead of being of usual circular bee hive shape common to most native african town be of comparatively spacious dimension substantial construction being for most part quadrangular in plan with thick wall built of substantial wattle interwoven about stout pole sunk well into ground solidly plastered with clay having dried hardened in sun have become quite weather tight protected a be from tropical rain by thick thatch of palm leaf with also steep sloping roof be covered average size of hut be about twenty foot long by twelve foot wide eight foot high to eaves there be others about fifty of altogether surrounded by cut off from rest by high stout palisade point of palisade being sharpened in order a took to render fence unclimbable be not only considerably larger more substantial in point of construction a afterward have opportunity to observe evidenced rude attempt at decoration in form of grotesquely carved finial affixed to roof part of town situated in centre covering perhaps space of forty acre be afterwards learned habitation of king banda court principal officer of army household priest whose temple fetish house stood on opposite side of square to occupied by palace of king appearance did not at first attract very much attention create very great amount of excitement when arrived within hail of beach in front of town upon be hauled up three to four hundred canoe of various size skipper suddenly sprang to foot placing hand trumpet wise to mouth began in curious high pitched voice to shout somewhat lengthy communication before be half finished there be very distinct commotion upon beach naked child who have be playing in water be racing up to town a fast a leg must carry shouting a went while from hut inhabitant came pouring out like ant from disturbed nest began to hurry down to beach by time that arrived there must have be at least two thousand people assembled to meet others be hurrying down in crowd soon found that be cause of commotion for sooner did step out of canoe than although travelling companion formed into cordon round headman chief who have in charge strove by virtue of authority to prevent such happening there occurred wild rush on part of crowd to get at least sight of while who must get near enough to insisted upon touching skin apparently with object of satisfying a to genuineness of colour from eagerness exclamation of astonishment came to conclusion that although might have heard of have never actually seen white man before conclusion afterwards found to be correct using butt occasionally point of spear freely in order to force passage through steadily growing crowd escort slowly made way toward part of town be enclosed by palisade a did so studied face of who thronged about with object of forming idea if must of fate might expect at hand must confess that result of inspection be by mean reassuring first fact to impress upon be that people among whom now found be of entirely different race from negro properly so called woolly pated high cheek boned ebony skinned individual with snub nose thick lip usually met with aboard slaver to start with colour be much lighter being clear brown of varying degree of depth from of mulatto to tint not many shade deeper than of average spaniard difference marked though be be not so great a between cast of feature of negro feature of people be for most part clean cut shapely in many case actually handsome nose especially being exceedingly well formed then head covering be hair not wool that of men being worn close cropped while woman allowed to grow at will wore flowing freely over back shoulder lock in many case reaching considerably below waist be invariably curly that of men growing in close tiny ringlet clustering thickly over head while of woman because be worn longer suppose took form of long graceful curl in colour be rich glossy black be certainly exceptionally fine race of people men being lithe clean limbed muscular fellow one of apparently in pink of condition while face figure of woman especially younger one must have excited envy of many english belle there be something very difficult to define in expression of people did not at like hardness about mouth cruel glint in eye especially of men looked at in manner suggested sort of unpleasant possibility excited within distinct longing to be almost anywhere rather than where be party who have brought to remote spot be of entirely different race from among whom now found fact that be making way toward what be obviously aristocratic part of town coupled with expressive conversation carried on by leader of custodian with three four individual who have joined led to surmise although of course did not understand word of what be said that have be brought up river a peace offering something of sort conclusion be again reverse of reassuring a drew near to exceedingly narrow gate in palisade have be thrown open to admit presently saw be strongly guarded by number of warrior armed with heavy broad bladed spear murderous looking sword small round shield target of wood covered with what looked like crocodile hide became sensible of horrible charnel house smell be not until have passed through gate be inside palisaded enclosure discovered from whence emanated then observing direction of wind wafted dreadful odour to nostril looked that way presently noticed large dead tree standing in middle of square formed centre of part of town be immense number of bird wheeled screamed about tree that first caused to regard with particular attention even then must not for moment see anything to account for bird odour minute two later a drew nearer tree stench meanwhile becoming almost overpoweringly strong detected fastened to trunk of tree in manner be not at first apparent nine human corps of so far advanced in decomposition even bird must not approach then understood that saw before that detestable thing of have often heard a most prominent object in typical african native town village crucifixion tree upon petty despot who rule over particular community be wont summarily to put to cruel lingering death such of subject a may be unfortunate enough to offend in case believe monarch be content to cause victim to be securely lashed to crucifixion tree by stout liana there to perish slowly of hunger thirst king banda potentate whose will be law in particular town have carried cruelty to utmost limit by adopting time honoured method of nailing victim to tree with spike nail driven through hand foot into tough timber enormous crowd who have followed up from beach be not permitted to enter palisaded enclosure be strictly taboo to common herd party therefore now consisted solely of who have brought up river four individual who have joined outside gate whom took to be official of sort unworthy self for own part must very willingly have waived distinction of forming one of party marching up to what conjectured to be king house from fact that be not only by far largest dwelling in enclosure be also distinguished by exclusive embellishment in form of row of dozen pole surmounted by human skull planted upright in ground before halted at distance of twenty pace from entrance with back turned toward crucifixion tree leafless branch of overshadowed waited ten minute twenty minute passed sun be within hand breadth of horizon when man emerged from palace bearing massive chair of ebony quaintly carved draped with magnificent leopard skin placed immediately before open door midway between house departed moment later man appeared time from fetish house on opposite side of square also with chair decorated with most gruesome looking carving placed beside first then tall enormously stout man clad in leopard skin moucha with handsome leopard skin cloak on shoulder came forth from palace leaning upon shoulder of two other men advanced toward chair have first be placed in position into subsided heavily casting strongly disapproving glance at second chair a did so then there arose sudden tramping of bare foot upon dry earth from somewhere in rear of palace there swung into view hundred picked warrior armed like who have mounted guard at palisade gate who formed up behind on side of chair with very commendable military precision simultaneously with appearance of guard for such be there emerged from fetish house man who appeared to be incredibly old for hair beard be a white a snow once stalwart form be now bowed wizened with passage of a seemed to hundred of year yet although in appearance very methuselah in age individual have pair of piercing black eye glowed sparkled with fire passion of early manhood bowed a be decrepit a appeared to be tottered across intervening space with extraordinary agility seated in second chair thus found in presence of two most powerful men in district namely king banda mafuta chief witch doctor contrast between two men be most remarkable for whereas mafuta appeared to be living embodiment of extreme age king banda must scarcely have be forty while mafuta be image of decrepitude banda despite excessive corpulence appeared to be what in fact be man of immense physical strength yet notwithstanding marked dissimilarity in appearance there be one point of strong resemblance between expression of face particularly of eye be ineffably cruel chapter seventeen king banda daughter for space of nearly minute there now prevailed intense silence while king banda sat glowering at party especially at in manner caused cold chill to run down back a reflected that be man who be responsible for gruesome fruit borne by tree branch of overshadowed that if must by chance take fancy into head to further decorate tree by nailing white man to there be nobody within hundred of mile who must dream of saying nay somehow have conviction that disapproval of such course must not very strongly influence at length when prolonged silence be beginning distinctly to get upon nerve king spoke to headman of party addressing to few curt word in decidedly ungracious tone of voice whereupon headman taking precaution first to conciliate majesty by prostrating rubbing nose in dust in token of abject submission rose to foot proceeded to spin long yarn of be evidently subject since repeatedly pointed to must have included in narrative incident of snake bite for at one point seized right hand turning palm upward pointed out spot where two tiny puncture of poison fang be still faintly visible appeared a if part of story be received with grave suspicion by banda mafuta for be led forward in order that in turn might examine mark after have be done several of savage who have be present at time be invited to give what took to be corroborative testimony when at headman have told story banda issued brief order to guard two of whom at once advanced toward laid hand upon shoulder a though to lead away whatever order may have be mafuta evidently objected to for sooner have be spoken than sprang to foot with quite marvellous agility hurried to seized by left arm saying in angry voice something to guard interpreted a order to release hold upon banda promptly intervened reiterating order to guard whereupon there ensued between two great men most unseemly altercation hubbub of have effect of bringing entire royal household to door of palace when catching sight of unceremoniously swarmed out crowded round with expression of most unbounded astonishment particularly on part of woman who apparently must not persuade that colour of skin hair be real for not only took skin between finger gently pinched when found that shoulder other part of body have be protected from sun be quite white whereas exposed part be by time quite a dark a own skin there be limit to amazement delight thought that woman folk seemed rather well disposed toward therefore did best must to strengthen feeling by smiling at speaking to in gentle tone of voice with result before five minute have passed be gabbling laughing together like so many child although side understood word of what be said by other in midst of mafuta sprang from chair in towering rage addressing few remark to king seemed to make latter feel rather uncomfortable took off to fetish house within vanished then king shouted something to woman folk caused to scuttle back into palace like so many rabbit next moment two guard who have in charge marched off to empty hut behind palace be luckily to windward of crucifixion tree odour from therefore did not reach a far a lodging having signed to to enter mounted guard one on side of door prison if such be be tolerably spacious affair measuring about twenty foot long by fifteen foot wide be absolutely empty also there being window to building light entering only by open door obscurity on entering seemed profound although few minute sufficed to enable one eye to grow accustomed to when at least during daylight be possible to see clearly enough for practical purpose have not be in new quarter above five minute when two elderly woman entered bearing upon head large bundle of dry fern cast down in one of two corner of hut most distant from door proceeded to spread there in such fashion a to form most comfortable bed upon at once flung for be very weary before must compose to rest two other woman entered one of whom bore upon thick biscuit like cake size of ordinary dinner plate two roast rib of goat generous portion of boiled yam while other carried calabash full of what took to be kind of native beer evidently be to be fate did not intend to starve gratefully accepting viand gave forth most appetising odour sat down made hearty meal after doing full justice to composed to sleep upon bed of fern enjoyed long most comfortable night rest may here mention never again saw party of savage who brought up river be therefore strengthened in conclusion at have arrived that have gone to trouble of conveying that long distance in order that might make present of possibly a peace offering from tribe to king banda who soon have reason to believe be decidedly formidable potentate a african king went for nearly week be kept closely confined to hut have be assigned to never being permitted to go beyond door of building where when sun have worked round far enough to cause building to cast shadow soon got into way of sitting for hour two doing best to ingratiate with inhabitant of place many of whom used to come stare at with never ceasing curiosity wonder with whom used to laugh chat although of course party understood word of what be said by other be to say neither understood other at first in course of few day found that with more intelligent of native be possible for to convey by sign by speaking with much emphasis sort of general idea of meaning be undoubtedly by diligent practice in direction that after strict confinement to interior of hut for five six day be permitted first of to wander at will about portion of town be enclosed by palisade ultimately to pas outside go practically whither must always accompanied however by two armed guard one of greatest discomfort from suffered at time be outcome of peculiar musical taste of king banda subject though be then happily unaware of fact period of great annual festival custom be approaching joy of populace began to find vent in nocturnal concert inordinately prolonged musical instrument consisting of tom tom beaten by two three four performer according to size of tom tom with monotony of cadence soon became positively maddening further aggravated by discordant squealing of number of flageolet like instrument made of stout reed now although have not hitherto have occasion to mention fact be passionately fond of music rather fancied a performer upon flute one night therefore when one of hideous concert be in full blast when consequently be useless to attempt to sleep sallied forth accompanied a usual by guard made way round to great square in front of king house where squatted round huge fire twenty of enthusiast be tootling thumping with vigour must not help regarding a utterly misplaced stood watching for few minute then approaching one of flageolet player held out hand pointed to instrument signifying desired to examine with show of hesitation man surrendered thing upon inspection found to be reed of about foot in length with mouthpiece shaped something like of whistle with four small hole drilled in length of tube whereby expert performer might produce seven distinct tone tone be not consecutive instrument be altogether very poor inefficient affair furnished with idea however on following day by dint of much suggestive gesticulation contrived to intimate to guard desire to obtain reed similar to from native instrument be made offered objection conducted distance beyond town through bush to spot on bank of river where reed be growing in abundance have resolved to make flute flageolet might prove easiest accordingly selected with great care dozen of most suitable reed must find borrowing spear from one of guard cut taking care that must be of ample length for purpose then hunted about for soft wood wherefrom to make mouthpiece stopped end of flute be while be thus engaged that made most important discovery be nothing le than that there be several very fine specimen of cinchona tree growing in jungle quite close to town be singularly fortunate opportune discovery for have already observed that fever ague be very prevalent among inhabitant hoped that if by mean of decoction of cinchona bark must effect cure might be able very materially to improve strengthen position in town therefore collected a much of bark a must conveniently carry took back with to hut where lost time in preparing generous supply of tolerably strong solution of quinine done sallied forth on look out for patient soon found a many a wanted be one thing to find quite to persuade to swallow medicine be not until at length administered pretty stiff dose to myself prevailed upon man to allow to experiment upon however be quite sufficient for did so much good that not only did come to hut clamouring for more brought several fellow sufferer with with result before week be out have firmly established reputation a powerful witch doctor very soon found however that reputation be by mean unmixed blessing for people jumped to conclusion that if must cure one disease must of course cure speedily found consulted by patient suffering from ailment of did not even know name expecting to be cured of yet astonishing to say be marvellously successful thing considered for when at loss administered pill compounded of meal dough strongly flavoured with first harmless substance came to hand so profound be belief of people in ability that at least half of be cured by wonderful power of faith alone however be exceedingly detrimental to reputation of mafuta chief witch doctor of community who found power influence rapidly waning soon discovered mean to make understand must cease to trespass upon what deemed own exclusive sphere of operation on pain of making mortal enemy of course be bad for be in position to make man enemy much le individual of such power influence a mafuta nevertheless continued to prescribe for who came to trusting that if ever must come to struggle between mafuta gratitude of patient must suffice to turn scale in favour meanwhile devoted spare moment to construction of flute after two three partial failure succeeded in producing instrument of very sweet tone sufficient range of note to enable to tootle air of several of most popular song of day a well a fairly full repertoire of jig hornpipe other dance music be particularly interesting to observe how powerfully anything in nature of real music like of air of braham purcell dr arne sir h bishop appealed to simple savage sentimental ditty such a anchor weighed tom bowling must hold breathless entranced rule britannia must upbraid set quivering with excitement seemed to know by intuition that sailor hornpipe be written to be danced to danced to accordingly wild furious mad fandango in extraordinary nature of gambol of performer be only equalled by ecstasy of enjoyment such proceeding a must not of course long exist without fame of reaching ear of king have only given three four performance when be summoned to entertain majesty household did in great square before palace audience numbering quite two thousand banda numerous family being seated in huge semicircle of be centre in front of palace while rest of audience filled remaining portion of square be now that first began to grow aware of fact that there be certain member of king household who seemed to be taking rather more interest in than one else have thus far manifested be girl of probably not more than sixteen year of age for that woman a compared with rest very pretty woman too quite light in colour exquisitely shaped with most pleasing expression of countenance especially when smiled a generally did when eye happened to meet hers have seen many time before have never taken very particular notice of until now that appeared determined to make understand that be friendly disposed toward endeavoured to ascertain who be although have contrived to pick up few word of language ignorance of be still so great that have experienced utmost difficulty in making understood must then learn about be that name be ama be not until later that discovered to be king banda favourite daughter discovery be made in sufficiently dramatic manner a will now be related happened that one night when a now be frequently case have be summoned to entertain king household by obliging with little music be playing soft plaintive air forget what when chancing to glance toward ama who seated on ground on extreme left of semicircle be well within range of vision fancied saw moving object close to left hand be resting lightly on ground at moment took scant notice of circumstance for flickering flame of fire be always kindled upon such occasion played strange prank with light shadow often imparted weird effect of movement to stationery even inanimate object presently happening to again glance in direction eye be once more caught by same queer wavering movement there be something so strange uncanny about for by time knew ground well enough to be fully aware that there ought not to be moving thing there that stopped playing sprang to foot so suddenly that movement appeared to startle ama who uttered little cry of alarm surprise made a though too must spring to foot at instant thing upon gaze be fixed looked like fathom of stiff tarred lanyard darted with lightning swiftness at girl coiled about shapely bare arm while piercing scream rang out from pallid lip of course knew in instant what be snake very possibly have be attracted to spot by note of flute startled by sudden cessation of music ama quick involuntary movement have instantly coiled round arm struck at in blind panic stricken rage acting upon impulse of moment scarcely knowing what be about with single bound flung upon terrified girl guided more by instinct than reason seized reptile immediately behind head in so vice like grip that jaw at once opened wide when tore hideous coil from girl arm flung far from into very heart of blazing fire then gripping wounded limb turned toward light of fire saw two mark close together upon inner part of arm just below elbow from a gazed two drop of blood began to ooze slowly without wasting moment applied lip to double wound intending to suck poison from even a have done in own case startling scream from girl caused to look up following direction of terrified glance looked behind beheld king eye ablaze with demoniac fury in very act of raising spear that have snatched from hand of one of guard to drive through body whether be that have not seen just what have happened a might very well have be case since whole thing seemed to have occurred in space of single instant be under impression have suddenly gone mad be attacking daughter know not be certain that ama scream certain hasty word uttered by only barely saved from fury sooner did lower threatening spear than once more glued lip to wound sucking hard at with object of extracting poison before have contaminated blood in effort be happily successful for although there be slight swelling of limb pain for hour two be happened before morning patient have quite recovered from effect of alarming adventure result of be that immediately became prime favourite of king there be further pretence of treating a prisoner on contrary be loaded with large house be assigned to use with complete staff of servant to attend to want abundant supply of food be daily sent to from royal table a understood be appointed physician in ordinary to royal household result to did not attach nearly sufficient importance at moment be that made implacable deadly enemy of mafuta chief witch doctor have said that there be further pretence of treating a prisoner be true only within certain limit a discovered moment set about taking measure to effect escape be allowed to go freely where pleased be true even to extent of making long hunting exploring excursion into adjacent country whether not by king order must never satisfactorily ascertain soon found that must never manage to steal off anywhere alone if ever attempted thing did very frequently party of king guard be certain to turn up in most exasperatingly casual unexpected manner join under pretence a made understand that be extremely dangerous to venture alone beyond confines of town if pretended be engaged in hunting for animal plant to be used in medical practice if attempted to go anywhere by water must take canoe chose two more men always insisted upon accompanying that might be spared labour of paddling be always same matter what hour of day night might choose to start upon expedition surprise be ever displayed at eccentricity in choice of time simply must not contrive to elude notice at length be borne in upon that if wished to effect escape must adopt tactic of totally different kind therefore very gradually curtailed excursion when undertook be careful that there must be nothing in nature of secrecy connected with movement meanwhile without effort on part now seemed to see good deal of ama king daughter who appeared to have assumed responsibility of seeing that house be kept in order that servant be faithfully performing duty be frequently in out a often a three four time day very seldom indeed le than twice moreover seemed exceedingly anxious to become instructress in own language a have already felt heavily handicapped on several occasion by inability to converse freely with around made demur although must confess that at length began to view with vague disquietude extreme freedom of intercourse thus instituted by young woman yet scarcely knew precisely what be that feared certainly have feeling that situation be not altogether devoid of peril one of most obvious of be foreshadowed in question frequently asked must king think of intimacy of daughter with one of totally different race view of life must matter chance to come to knowledge therefore kept very close watch upon be careful never to allow manner to relax in slightest degree from strictest formality although to preserve consistently attitude of extreme reserve be sometimes exceedingly difficult with companion of so amiable altogether winsome manner disposition a of ama under zealous indefatigable tuition of young damsel made astonishingly rapid progress a student of language spoken by around be soon able to converse in with very fair amount of freedom meanwhile have practically abandoned attempt to effect escape for time being at least for conviction have at length be forced upon that banda people must ever willingly let go therefore before engaging in further attempt must contrive to disarm suspicion completely create impression have at length resigned to live out life in remote african town with savage only for companion be while matter be in very unsatisfactory state became aware that event of extreme importance be imminent in town for upon sallying forth from residence on certain morning crossing great square in centre of stood banda crucifixion tree saw that number of men be engaged in setting up forty stout quaintly carved post in circle round about tree arrangement somehow have sinister suggestive appearance that made feel vaguely uncomfortable abandoning intention whatever may have be that took to spot returned to house a soon a ama made appearance asked what meant mean dear dick said laying hand upon arm looking very serious have insisted upon knowing name calling by early in acquaintance that custom begin six day hence men whom saw setting up post round crucifixion tree be making preparation for custom exclaimed in horrified accent for have heard of grim ghastly festivity before pray ama what be nature of custom under father beneficent rule oh be horrible hate answered girl last six day six whole day in people abandon to kind of licence cruelty in human blood be shed like water think will like dick at least hope not like ejaculated indignantly must think not indeed suppose fellow be not obliged to watch be will go off into forest up river during six day nay dick will not be able to do of thing answered ama in first place be not at certain that king must give leave even if did must not be permitted to go alone where must find men willing to absent from custom for sake of accompanying there be not man in town who must consent to do so no be afraid that will be obliged to witness said must devise scheme whereby may be exempted say that take place six day hence will be strange indeed if united ingenuity be not equal to task of devising simple yet efficacious plan tell ama where do victim come from how many of be usually sacrificed number sacrificed depends of course upon how many can be found answered ama generally there be at least three hundred time be hoped that there may be many more a to where come from good many be smelled out by mafuta assistant rest be made up of such prisoner a may happen to be in possession at time there be five hundred hunter out now securing prisoner expect back to morrow next day that reminds dick added with sudden access of gravity if have not be clever enough to save life when snake bit must most certainly have be one of victim indeed be with view to sacrificing at custom that father accepted from igbo dickens be ejaculated in dismay then who be to say that will not be still included in batch nay answered ama saved life for father will spare be not whom have to fear mafuta mafuta hate know must willingly smell out ' if dared people will not let for where must get one else to play beautiful music to if be to die besides do think must allow one to hurt father be king one not even mafuta dare dispute will have more influence than one else with king nay fear not dick none will hurt while live must must feel a fully assured of a appear to be ama answered with due respect to father may perhaps be permitted to remark that have impressed a man of singularly short uncertain temper if must ever chance to be so unfortunate a to offend at moment two guard presented at door of hut saluting one of curtly remarked king be ill command presence of white man at palace at once king father ill ejaculated ama in tone of greater consternation than seemed quite called for let go at once dick oh must cure must for own sake dick chapter eighteen doomed to torture must cure must for own sake dick exactly in uttering word ama unconsciously disclosed how slight be confidence in influence over father of have be boasting only moment two before arrival of summons for to attend father on bed of sickness be very well for to tell must cure suppose must not suppose that sickness might be must run course fail to yield to treatment what then reason so urgently expressed by why must effect cure for own sake dick be significant enough of direction in apprehension pointed there be necessity for to inquire what meant must cure king must be so much worse for how be to cure knowledge of disease be of slightest most amateurish kind for aught must tell to contrary might not even be sufficient to enable to diagnose case correctly much le to treat successfully however there be use in meeting trouble half way only possible course be to obey summons forthwith do best leaving result in hand of providence accordingly rose to foot motioning guard to lead way followed to palace with ama walking by side holding hand in protective sort of way distance from hut to palace be few yard quickly arrived at destination being at once conducted into presence of king who stretched upon couch evidently suffering severe pain in internal organ be surrounded by somewhat numerous member of family a approached side of couch gazed at with lack lustre eye groaningly said be very sick o dick entrails be being burnt up within cure at once will give thee daughter ama a thy wife make thee powerful chief thank thee banda for thy magnificently generous promise answered will gladly do utmost for thee without reward tell now how long hast thou be like not very long answered king perhaps while sun have be climbing thus far describing with hand arc of circle measuring about seven degree say hour have just finished breakfast when pain seized ah remarked trying to look a though knew about of what did thy breakfast consist of very little for be moderate eater answered king let consider there be first broiled fish fresh from river with boiled yam then few roast plantain not more than dozen think then roast rib of cow few handful of boiled rice yes think be except bowl of jaro ' latter being kind of native beer occurred to that probably after very moderate meal majesty might be suffering from indigestion although burning pain in stomach puzzled bit therefore came to conclusion that if vomiting must be freely induced almost immediate relief ought to follow accordingly prescribed only emetic must think of at moment namely copious draught of warm water followed by tickling back of throat with feather mean be so far successful that patient acknowledged certain measure of relief after time burning pain recurred seemed to become more acute than ever to profound dismay for goaded almost to madness by intensity of suffering king be rapidly growing a dangerous a wounded buffalo between paroxysm of anguish began to threaten sundry with certain pain penalty mere enumeration of made flesh creep plunged into cold perspiration at length after more than usually intense paroxysm of pain have passed gouroo banda favourite wife who be present whose virulent animosity have be unfortunate enough to arouse bent over patient whispered something in ear purport of must not catch be suggestion nature of be able to divine without difficulty for by way of reply banda ejaculated between groan yes yes let be instantly summoned a for white man let presumptuous pretender be closely confined in own hut until can decide upon nature of punishment away with at once if be allowed to escape guard who have in charge will be nailed head downward to crucifixion tree gouroo smiled smile of triumphant malice a in reply to summons two guard entered seizing roughly hurried away while ama bathed in tear flung upon knee beside father couch vainly besought to have mercy upon a passed out of room saw king writhing in agony rise upon couch strike poor girl violent blow while bellowed fierce command to to withdraw from sight be nearly noon when be conducted back to hut after futile attempt to cure king be not until close upon sunset got further news when one of guard who have in charge informed a brought in supper that mafuta have completely cured king within hour of moment when be first summoned to majesty bedside that banda have already risen from couch that in requital for service mafuta have claimed be granted right to dispose of a pleased upon occasion of forthcoming festival of custom meant of course be to die by exquisite refinement of torture nature of must probably be too dreadful for description for very shrewdly suspected that gouroo mafuta be equally interested in downfall might indeed have conspired in mysterious manner to bring about must probably take care that must be a complete disastrous a savage vindictiveness must make day now dragged away upon leaden foot yet apparent paradox with frightful rapidity for now no longer have household to attend to want meal be brought to with unfailing regularity by guard have apparently be forbidden to communicate with for not word must get out of good bad indifferent be not permitted to show in doorway of dwelling even to approach nearly enough to see what be going on in dreadful solitude waiting hoping for knew not what impossible happening to occur effect deliverance day seemed to drag out to length of month until darkness came then with realisation of fact be so much nearer to hideous fate hour seemed suddenly to have sped with lightning excited buzz bustle of preparation pervaded town day day while night again became pandemonium of barbarous sound for tom tom flageolet concert have be resumed with tenfold virulence since incarceration on one occasion terrific uproar announced arrival of unhappy prisoner who have be captured in order that festival might lose nothing of importance impressiveness through lack of sufficient tale of victim must not detect indication of attempt on part of one to communicate with at length latent hope that ama boast of influence with father might be verified that might succeed in inducing king to spare died out began to prepare a best must to meet fate might have in store for with fortitude befitting christian englishman suppose that while be supinely tamely acquiescing in fate awaited far from for first few day of captivity brain be literally seething with scheme for effecting escape most of wildly impossible admit there be seemed to promise just ghost of chance of success until attempted to put into effect when vigilance of guard with fear of crucifixion head downward before eye invariably baffled thus time passed on until first day of custom dawned when having received more than usually substantial meal be stripped of few rag still covered nakedness with hand tightly bound behind by thin strong raw hide rope be led forth to great square wherein custom be celebrated firmly bound to one of post erection of have witnessed week earlier of course be one of many who be to gasp out life in dreadful aceldama in very short time post stake be decorated with own separate victim of whom seemed be to perish by torture of fire for after victim have be secured to stake huge bundle of faggot composed of dry twig branch be piled around of what fate of rest of be to be there be nothing to indicate have doubt that must be something quite a dreadful a fire have fully made up mind that when turn came must endeavour by insult invective to goad tormentor to such state of fury exasperation a must provoke to finish off quickly being now ready gate in palisade be thrown open conch shell be blown waiting inhabitant began to pour into enclosure with eagerness excitement of audience crowding into unreserved portion of theatre in very short time great square be full front rank pressing close up to cordon of armed guard have be drawn round circle of post then while air vibrated with hum murmur of many excited tongue shout disturbance in direction of palace proclaimed approach of king household presently entire party numbering three hundred passed in made way to kind of grand stand from admirable view of proceeding be to be obtained looked for ama must not see gouroo however be present favoured with smile of malicious triumph banda took not slightest notice of presence sooner be royal party seated than commotion on opposite side of square portended arrival in few minute through narrow lane have be formed in dense mass of people mafuta myrmidon to number of nearly hundred came leaping bounding into open space beneath crucifixion tree daubed over naked body with black white red paint with hair gathered into knot on crown of head decorated with long feather string of big bead long strip of scarlet cloth obtained from goodness know where with necklace of bird animal claw about neck girdle of animal entrails round waist presented a hideous revolting picture a can possibly be imagined a went careering madly round circle man waving long spear over head now noticed curiously subdued distinct commotion among spectator of front rank of whom seemed anxious to surrender apparently advantageous position to whomsoever might be willing to accept singularly enough one seemed desirous to avail of neighbour generosity reason soon became apparent for presently in midst of wild bounding round inner edge of tightly packed mass of spectator came to sudden halt mafuta advancing alone proceeded to smell out who be supposed to be inimical to king own authority against whom of have secret grudge with body bent head thrust forward nostril working slowly passed along inner face of crowd shifty eye darting hither thither until gaze happened to fall upon one of individual for whom be looking when must come to halt appear to be following scent finally stretch forth spear lightly smite man woman on head with unhappy victim thus smelled out must thereupon be instantly taken in charge by mafuta follower process must be repeated until whose removal be desired have be gathered in in present case victim numbered nearly hundred finding of consumed best part of two hour process of smelling out being at end who have passed ordeal unscathed being relieved of further apprehension enormous crowd have gathered to witness sport settled down to thoroughly enjoy certainly there be very commendable celerity manifested by who have direction of affair there be disposition to keep holiday maker waiting unhappy victim be led up one after other before king banda supposed crime very briefly recited to whereupon majesty with equal brevity pronounced sentence in case that of death be at once carried out only difference consisting in mode of execution of unfortunate wretch being secured to crucifixion tree in one way in be very difficult for mere onlooker to decide of plan adopted inflicted most suffering victim must be explained be doomed to remain fastened to tree until death must ensue from hunger thirst exposure agony of wound then in batch of ten at time forty more victim be triced up to bough of accursed tree by raw hide rope fastened to one wrist one ankle in such position that body showed clearly against bright background of sky while thus suspended whosoever must be at liberty to shoot at with bow arrow great object being apparently to pierce body with a many arrow a possible without inflicting mortal injury king banda evidently prided upon skill in direction there be few bungler among crowd for of shot went so far astray that instead of hitting mark at be supposed to be aimed hit slew dozen of crucified one wondered whether by chance fatal wound be actually inflicted by interested person who desired to put a speedy end a possible to suffering of unfortunate friend if so whether idea must occur to ama to enlist service of few good marksman in behalf when turn must come when who have be condemned to die in above manner have perished further variety be imparted to proceeding by compelling fifty victim to run gauntlet be very favourite form of pastime among savage be carried out in variety of way in present instance narrow circular course be arranged round great square lane of about yard in width being formed through mass of spectator into lane victim stripped naked be introduced one at time to run round round until beaten to death by bare fist of a many a must get in blow at since lane be so exceedingly narrow happened that practically individual on side of lane be able to get in at least one blow to uninitiated may seem not particularly inhumane form of inflicting death punishment who saw whole remaining part of day spent in doing fifty poor wretch to death in fashion can tell very different story there be need to enter into detail may say that who be weakest who succumbed most quickly be to be most envied day have opened with cloudless sky brilliant sunshine a hour dragged slowly away cloud light filmy at first gradually growing more dense threatening began to gather until toward evening sun became blotted out whole vault of heaven grew overcast louring a though nature horrified disgusted at orgy of human cruelty being enacted here on little spot of earth be veiling face to shut out shameful sight by time that proceeding of day be over enormous crowd began to disperse became evident that more than usually violent tropical thunderstorm be brewing although might be hour yet before must burst over blood stained town naturally be very thankful that awful day have passed over that end found still in land of living for while there be life there be hope in course of somewhat adventurous career have seen so many extraordinary escape from apparently inevitable disaster that one piece of advice above others must give to everybody be never despair can recall more than one occasion when if have abandoned hope effort go with must not now have be alive to pen word man can ever know what totally unexpected happening may occur to effect deliverance at very moment when fate look blackest most threatening although have passed through day unscathed so far a actual bodily injury be concerned have nevertheless be day of suffering for growing ever more acute a hour dragged wearily away for apart from feeling of horror with have witnessed display of so much unimaginable cruelty torture bond confined to post have be drawn so tightly a greatly to impede circulation of blood through extremity until by time that great square be empty of crowd of bloodthirsty reveller anguish have become so great that be almost in fainting condition must give scant attention to anything beyond pang racked nerve of tortured body in fact observed with feeling of envy that many of fellow sufferer have already succumbed become unconscious if indeed be not dead however since have be spared thus far concluded that might reasonably hope to be reprieved at least until next day looked with impatience to be released conveyed back to place of confinement until dawn must again summon forth to witness peradventure be victim of accumulative horror soon discovered that even small measure of mercy be to be denied food drink be indeed to be served out to in order a surmised that might meet ordeal in store for with unabated strength night be to be passed a day have be secured to sacrificial post exposed naked helpless to element to myriad insect plague that attacked unceasingly noted that while who have not succumbed to suffering be fed a stood still bound to post who have become unconscious be temporarily released revived by being copiously soused with water further be allowed to eat drink while seated on ground before be lashed up afresh took hint feigning insensibility for sake of few minute of temporary relief hoped thus to win by time that attendant reached be so near to swooning very little pretence be necessary when at length released sank to ground in heap with low groan gathered from remark that be seriously concerned at condition for seemed that be reserved for very especial refinement of torture satisfactory application of demanded that must come to in possession of full strength feared have be seriously sapped by suffering have already endured freely expressed concern lest under existing circumstance must not furnish quite so much sport a be being expected of therefore displayed real solicitude in effort to revive took especial care must not accomplish too quickly oh what exquisite torment be mine when bond being released blood once more began to circulate through benumbed member must have screamed aloud with excruciating agony have not pride prevented be full hour before have sufficiently recovered use of hand to enable to convey food drink to lip food drink provided for be of especially nourishing character when at length have partaken of a much a must force down throat be again lashed to stake time so carefully that while for to loose bond be impossibility circulation of blood be in nowise impeded for even small mercy be inexpressibly grateful meanwhile night have fallen so intensely dark that completion of task of feeding unfortunate have to be accomplished by torchlight have not be very long left to ourselves before faint flickering of distant lightning low muttering grumbling of thunder warned to expect storm of more than ordinary violence everything portended atmosphere be absolutely still not twig even leaf stirred nature seemed to be waiting in breathless suspense for coming outbreak even insect have ceased to attack have retired to leafy retreat air be so heavy close naked a be perspired at pore not sound broke unnatural stillness save when at irregular interval low groan broke from poor wretch upon crucifixion tree in whom life still lingered even to relief be promised for with impending downpour of rain wound must quickly mortify then suffering must soon be at end very slowly gradually storm worked way toward zenith gathering intensity a rose at length probably about ten o'clock first drop of rain hot heavy like gout of blood began to fall quickly increasing to drenching downpour accompanied by lightning green rose tinted violet sun bright that lighted up town until object however minute be a clearly visible a in broad daylight while ceaseless crashing of thunder be unspeakably appalling in very height of storm when thunder lightning rain together be raging in perfect pandemonium stream of steel blue lightning darted straight from zenith struck crucifixion tree shattered into thousand fragment leaving great hole in ground where have stood storm continued to rage in full fury for about hour then flash of lightning with accompanying peal of thunder gradually became le frequent although rain continued to beat down upon parched earth in perfect deluge formed rivulet ay even brook of quite respectable size flowing in direction weary aching frame soothed refreshed by pelting rain must have fallen into kind of doze for be suddenly startled into full consciousness by feeling that one be meddling with bond next moment severed by sharp knife fell from limb then small soft hand seized mine dragged swiftly away from stake to have be bound be so intensely dark just then however be quite unable to see where be going be obliged to trust implicitly to unknown guide for two three minute twisted hither thither blindly so far a be concerned then flash came enabled to see that companion be a have already suspected faithful little friend ama that be conducting by somewhat circuitous route toward gate in palisade thousand thanks to ama for coming to help murmured in ear a squeezed hand whither be taking to gate can never pas guard be not there be sheltering in house close at hand expect took care to find out before coming to release now dick must be silent answered ama a cautiously approached spot where knew gate must be suddenly guide halted pressed herself close up against wall of building of kind at same time feeling for face in darkness laying finger on lip to enjoin perfect silence here waited for nearly five minute until flash of lightning came when companion having caught glimpse of surroundings again hurried forward few second later have passed through unguarded gate closed behind be rapidly making way through street of outer part of town in direction of beach about way down however turned sharply aside plunged down narrow lane after twisting turning at length brought out clear of town into plantain grove time have not seen single living creature not so much a dog living thing save have taken shelter from fury of element be not likely to venture abroad again until be over still hurrying forward ama led way through grove along edge until eventually reached narrow bush path through be necessary to wend way circumspectly for be now a black a wolf mouth save when occasional flicker of lightning from now fast receding storm momentarily lit up surroundings traversed path for about mile still maintaining perfect silence at length emerged quite suddenly upon tiny strip of beach beyond hissed gurgled stream already swollen by rain flash of lightning came most opportunely at moment revealed small light canoe hauled up on beach with couple of paddle sheaf of spear bow arrow few other oddment in get in quickly dick let be going murmured ama hastily storm be passing away can not now be long before one will visit prisoner to see how have fared indeed may have happened already whenever occurs absence will certainly be discovered search for will be at once begun will take little while for to ascertain that be nowhere concealed in town when have be determined will at once think of river party will be despatched in pursuit therefore be imperative that must secure a long start a possible of course answered a laid hold of light craft ran afloat quite understand that ama speak of a though intended to accompany must not be dear girl have already done nobly in freeing in providing with mean of flight must now do best can for can not consent to implicate by permitting to accompany therefore let now bid adieu with warmest most grateful thanks not only for what have done for to night also for friendship have shown from moment when first came to know now hasten back to own quarter a quickly a possible pray think can be trusted to find way back to without permitting share in night doings to be discovered farewell dear ama may god bless keep will never forget goodness to good bye in fulness of gratitude took in arm kissed for moment gentle girl resigned to embrace then freeing said thank dick for thinking of safety at moment dear can not return must go with not only for own sake for mine also understand way of people a do therefore without help must never make good escape a for father know that there be only one person who must dare to do what have done for to night even be to succeed in returning to own quarter undetected be exceedingly doubtful anger at loss will be so great that must assuredly condemn to take place at stake therefore dick concluded pleadingly must either go with undergo torture be destined for surely protested be about to argue that being father favourite daughter must never be so inhuman a to sacrifice to anger when sound of distant shouting came faintly to ear hark exclaimed ama do hear that dick mean that absence have be discovered that hunt for have already begun must not waste moment will take with must go back to face cruel lingering death not last certainly answered jump in little one let be off without further parley giving hand to steady in entering crank little craft waited until have seated aft taken steering paddle in hand then with powerful push sent canoe stern first far out into rapidly flowing stream sprang in over bow seized paddle proceeded to force craft off shore into strength of current chapter nineteen tragic death of ama now have leisure to observe that storm have so far passed away that there be big break in canopy of cloud overhead away to eastward through star be beginning to show affording enough light just to enable to discern two bank of stream not sufficient to betray presence to observer at greater distance than say quarter of mile there be therefore not much fear of immediate discovery since now learned from ama that starting point be at least three quarter of mile below town while apart from own exertion swollen current be sweeping along at speed of about six knot in little more than ten minute from moment of starting swept out of tributary stream into main river current of be also flowing pretty rapidly though not of course so swiftly a of lesser stream now a pushed off into mid channel found time to exchange few remark for own part be anxious to know what have first suggested to companion idea of effecting rescue by what mean after have conceived idea have contrived to carry plan to successful issue put question to by way of reply related to following story from moment when first became aware of father illness be not entirely free from suspicion when at length saw that effort to cure be only partially successful that symptom persistently recurred be convinced that there be foul play somewhere though why must not at first imagine when gouroo whispered to father hinting at incapacity suggesting that mafuta must be sent for suspicion began to take definite shape although be not able to verify suspicion finally made up mind that whole occurrence be outcome of plot between gouroo mafuta only enemy to ruin suspicion be confirmed when after have be carried away imprisoned father began to mend even before arrival of mafuta upon scene while seemed extraordinary to that witch doctor must know so well character of father ailment that be able to bring with precisely right remedy for administration now a told just now dick be quite unable to verify suspicion in own mind have not slightest doubt that mafuta gave gouroo poison of kind to administer to father make ill knowing that must be summoned to cure knowing too that failure to cure must result in condemnation to death by torture tried to intercede for not once many time father have suffered horribly have be terribly frightened believed that for gouroo suggestion must have allowed to die refused to show mercy fate seemed sealed unless must contrive scheme to save must think of nothing anticipation of death made feel so utterly wretched that at last entreated father that if must not spare must at least not compel to witness suffering be still dreadfully angry with for interceding in behalf persisted at length told that if did not wish to witness custom might remain at home of course did so although knew that be not to suffer until to morrow spent time trying to devise plan for effecting deliverance must think of none nevertheless a soon a everybody be in square custom have begun went down to river got canoe ready paddled down to place where found to night be while be returning searching for way to pas inside palisade without entering by gate that first saw storm working up knew that if delayed coming long enough might be able to save a happened circumstance must scarcely have arranged more favourably result be have now happiness to have here with in safety now dick must push on a fast a can travelling through night concealing resting during day for if be to escape must be by stratagem not by strength speed yes said can quite understand that if must take into head to pursue a seem to think will must have small chance of running away from one of big canoe manned by forty fifty paddler where do propose to take ama where do wish to go dick demanded companion answering one question with why replied of course be anxious to get down to coast again aboard ship be puzzled to know what be to become of when part must part dick murmured ama softly can not always remain with quite impossible dear girl answered hastily beginning at last to have faint suspicion of what be in savage beauty unsophisticated mind owe duty to king that duty imperatively demand that will return at once to ship in be serving where ama may mention place must possibly be found for forget that have saved life ama therefore come what will will not leave until have formed definite plan for own safety happiness what did think of doing when time come for to part girl be silent so long be obliged to repeat question before must get answer when at length replied feared must detect tear in voice must have execrated for stony hearted wretch have never looked so far forward a answered in quavering tone need not think of yet dick when time come have doubt that will know what to do now really must cease talking push on a fast a can will not reach place of concealment before dawn come to reveal whereabouts to pursuer be not sorry to have conversation closed for wanted little time for reflection be clear to that unsophisticated young savage have be dominated in action by one idea alone that of saving from death of unspeakable horror knew that in so doing be cutting off for ever from own people to whom must be impossible for to return in absolute simplicity have evidently thought that must be easiest thing in world for to throw in lot with mine how be to undeceive how make understand absolute impossibility of such thing greatly feared that to convince of must be wholly beyond power yet what be to become of must not abandon alone unprotected to fate must take with problem seemed absolutely insoluble at length came to conclusion that only thing to be done be to leave issue to destiny hour after hour paddled on in absolute silence making excellent progress for current be running strong in favour at length just a eastern horizon be beginning to pale with first hint of dawn ama gave canoe sheer in toward eastern bank looking anxiously about a did so be not long in discovering landmark of be in search few minute later canoe be threading tortuous way among tangled mass of mangrove root toward solid bank of river landing upon drew light craft bodily up out of water concealing beneath broad overhanging mass of foliage hid so effectually must defy anybody to find then taking bow quiver of arrow together with brace of spear out of canoe signing to to do same ama led way through dense growth bordering river bank until reached open grassy space of about twenty acre sparsely dotted here there with magnificent tree here ama signified that be to camp for day further mentioned that a felt sure father must have despatched party in pursuit of expected must by time be not far behind must be very desirable to keep watch for since be important that must know a much a possible of movement accordingly suggested must climb particularly lofty tree indicated keep look out for while went off into forest to seek wherewithal to furnish breakfast be very quiet subdued in manner greatly feared that be feeling deeply mortified hurt because have pointed out impossibility of remaining with after arrival at coast must be so fortunate a to get there a ama taking bow arrow tripped lightly away toward forest proceeded to shin up tree presently after labour found among topmost branch towered high above of other tree in neighbourhood being by time broad daylight obtained magnificent view of surrounding country extending for a estimated forty mile toward south east while toward north west view be shut off by high hill through river wound way to surprise found that camping place be much nearer river than have supposed be thus able to obtain clear unobstructed view of surface for many mile north south except width of few yard on eastern side be shut off by mangrove low scrub grew along margin most carefully searched shining bosom of stream for sign of expected pursuer saw none have hove in sight when about hour later ama returned with seven eight wood pigeon have brought down with arrow did not call to announce return in way set to work to mow circle of about ten foot in diameter in long grass then having produced fire by rubbing two piece of wood together proceeded very carefully to burn off short grass left inside circle setting fire to allowing to burn for few second then beating out again with branch in order that fire might not spread burn out to say nothing of betraying presence by smoke that must raise then when have at length cleared sufficient space lighted cooking fire taking care to use only dry wood thus make little smoke after proceeded to margin of river brought back large lump of damp clay piece of broke off completely encased bird in did with considerable care noticed when have completed task consigned whole to fire placing shapeless lump in centre of glowing ember piling more dry wood on top so a to maintain brisk blaze in about hour lump of clay baked hard by heat began to crack break open when ama carefully raked out of ember set aside then not until then did hail asking whether expected pursuer be in sight upon replying in negative informed that breakfast be ready invited to come down partake of felt somewhat curious to see how ama primitive style of cooking must turn out be all right simply broke open lump of baked clay with spear took out bird skin feather adhered to clay splitting open removed interior organ devoured flesh found done to turn particularly rich juicy in flavour then after have finished eating ama again disappeared to return shortly afterward with four fine cocoa nut opened with spear head drank now dick said ama when have finished meal need rest badly must have therefore compose to sleep near fire where can watch over will take place in tree look out for pursuer will be sure to be along very soon now be important must see upon what plan be conducting search for want to get well ahead of before resume journey to night yes said that be very well ama what about need rest fully a much a do retorted took plenty of rest yesterday in anticipation while be exposed day to scorching sun fly have be awake night so please lie down sleep for in case must watch river until pursuer appear promise that when have passed have seen can of will come down sleep too attempted to dissuade from resolution be in obstinate mood must not be dissuaded recognising at length gave in for be true that needed rest accordingly flinging down in long grass fell almost instantly into deep sleep must have be about four o'clock in afternoon judging from position of sun when awoke to find ama crouching over fire busily preparing meal even a rose stretched luxuriously feeling immeasurably refreshed invigorated by long sleep pronounced ready a sat down to partake of together ama informed that one of father largest canoe manned by forty paddler commanded by chief whom have recognised have passed slowly down river about hour after have composed to rest chief in charge intently scrutinising bank a went evidently in search of indication of presence have finally passed out of sight to southward after ama have descended taken few hour rest further stated that upon awaking have again gone aloft to take long careful look round have seen nothing more of pursuer be therefore inclined to believe that be now reasonably safe provided of course that did travelling at night kept sharp look out be careful not to allow to be fallen in with by other user of river supply of food ama have provided for afternoon meal be so bountiful that when have finished enough remained to furnish with good substantial meal about middle of night want for next few hour be consequently supplied have therefore no need to do anything further than just to wait for then resume voyage did passing intervening time in chatting together discussing various precaution must take in order to elude pursuer who by way be now several mile ahead of remained where be until close upon sunset when again climbed look out tree carefully scanned whole surface of river a far a eye must reach there be nothing of alarming character in sight therefore a soon a have descended to ground set out for spot where have hidden canoe launched made way out through labyrinth of mangrove root to margin of river where lay perdu until darkness have completely fallen when boldly pushed off into strength of current steadily pursued way soon found that travelling down stream with current in favour be very different matter from travelling up stream against within next twenty four hour be able to estimate that be now proceeding about three time a rapidly a be case when be making upward journey calculated therefore that full week ought to suffice to reach sea then what be to become of poor ama gentle loving companion ala destiny be soon to answer question most tragically too have known thanks to ama foresight admirable judgment progress down river be uneventful travelled during night resting refreshing during day never again saw sign of pursuer indeed of anybody else for journey be begun when moon be past third quarter rose late ama explained that native of region never travelled through darkness if must possibly avoid be on sixth day of journey that having landed a usual at first sign of dawn be resting in secluded shady spot after having partaken of excellent substantial breakfast have be sound asleep for hour for sun be well past meridian when be startled into sudden complete wakefulness sprang up with sensation have heard ama screaming calling upon for help glanced at spot where have short distance from be not there at once concluded that having awakened before have gone off into forest to obtain wherewithal for mid day meal listened intently silence of noontide have fallen everything be deathly still there be not faintest zephyr to stir foliage even very insect that so persistently attack one in african jungle seemed to be indulging in mid day siesta yet must not divest mind of conviction that abrupt awakening have be caused by cry for help from ama having reached ear seizing weapon set out in search of form in grass where have lain be plain enough to sight a also be track in direction of forest followed for distance without much difficulty coming out at length into open glade through tiny streamlet made way here among outcrop of immense granite rock came upon sign of tragedy long grass be disturbed beaten down a though desperate struggle have taken place ground be smeared splashed with blood in midst of lay one of ama spear broken shaft of other leading away from there be broad blood stained trail a though body have be dragged along through grass over rocky ground further on toward much bigger outcrop of rock be not difficult to read sign ama intent upon hunting have be surprised overpowered by ferocious beast now remained be for to follow rescue unfortunate girl avenge death accordingly fitted to bow stoutest arrow in quiver dashed forward in fury of rage grief absolutely reckless of consequence to myself animated by one impulse determination to slay beast might be that have wrought evil to faithful gentle companion for hundred yard more trail led over uneven rocky ground toward immense rock upon rounding found face to face with within dozen yard of splendid full grown male leopard who be crouching over poor ama motionless body snarling savagely a strove with claw to remove broken spear head of be buried deep in neck a rounded rock came in sight of rose to foot with two front paw on ama body bared great fang at in hideous grin a gave utterance to snarling growl might well have struck terror to boldest heart be so full of rage grief at dreadful sight before that there be room in for other emotion halting short in track gazed brute steadfastly in eye a slowly raised bow drew arrow to head never in life have felt more deadly cool self possessed than did then a aimed steadily at animal right eye felt must not miss did for while thus stood motionlessly staring at other released string next instant great lithe beast sprang convulsively into air with butt of arrow protruding from eye point buried deep in brain a fell back struggled writhing upon ground moaning horribly for few second ere great limb straightened out in death dashed forward seizing poor ama body drew out of reach of beast claw single glance sufficed to show that unfortunate girl be beyond reach of further hurt yes be quite dead gentle faithful savage girl who in return for comparatively slight service have unhesitatingly abandoned home kindred everything to save from cruel lingering death now only thing must do to show gratitude be to make sure that further violence must be offered to remains first impulse be to carry body down to where soil be softer there dig grave for while be considering plan occurred to that with more efficient tool than spear to serve a shovel must be practically impossible for to bury body deep enough to protect from jackal hyaena therefore determined that instead of burying must burn there be abundance of fallen bough twig in adjacent jungle to enable to build funeral pyre must have melancholy satisfaction of actually watching reduction of body to impalpable ash therefore took remained of poor ama in arm carried to top of bare rocky plateau close at hand upon intended to build pyre then diligently set to work to collect necessary wood took remainder of day to collect a much dry combustible material a considered must be needful to accomplish complete incineration of body to build pyre be done at last then once more raising corpse in arm gently placed on top then making fire a have seen ama do by rubbing two piece of wood together ignited torch thrust deep into heart of pyre through opening have left for purpose dry leaf grass have arranged a kindling material instantly caught fire in few minute flame be darting fiercely upward through interstice wreathing about corpse then placing to windward clear of smoke knelt down on hard rock be not ashamed to admit prayed earnestly that god must have mercy upon soul of simple unsophisticated savage maiden who have lost life while helping to save own be doing most imprudent thing to linger by side of pyre for smoke in first place light of flame when fell dark must scarcely have failed to attract to spot savage who might have be in neighbourhood when plight must probably have be a bad a ever at moment sorrow at loss of companion overcame other feeling for moment at least be quite indifferent a to what befell a happened one came near remained unmolested watching fire until have burnt out leaving trace of body have be consumed meanwhile since be almost naked be hoping soon to find once more among civilised people occurred to that skin of leopard have wrought dire tragedy might be of use to a material out of to fashion sort of garment therefore while flame of pyre be still blazing brilliantly utilised light to enable to strip pelt off great carcase when fire have entirely died down have satisfied that there be nothing left of poor ama to be desecrated by fang of beast beak of bird sorrowfully retired from fatal spot carrying leopard skin with making way with difficulty to place where canoe lay concealed sprang in shoved off four day later arrived at mouth of river without further adventure be fortunate enough to find fine slashing brigantine flying french colour riding at anchor there did not need second look at to tell that be slaver beggar must not be chooser must not afford to wait about for arrival of more honest craft at risk of being again seized carried off by native therefore putting bold face upon paddled alongside with leopard skin wrapped round petticoat fashion climbed up side inquired for skipper appeared that be ashore at moment making arrangement for shipment of cargo of slave on next day chief mate be aboard upon representing to a shipwrecked englishman who have be carried away captive into interior have just effected escape gave permission to remain saying that have doubt captain duquesne must receive if be willing to work passage to martinique be not at what wanted even martinique be better than king banda town therefore consented hour later captain returned upon repeating to yarn have spun to mate not only very readily consented to working passage also offered two excellent suit of clothes two shirt two pair of stocking pair of shoe worsted cap in exchange for leopard skin offer gladly accepted that night found domiciled in forecastle of l'esperance a one of crew companion although sufficiently lawless lot be nevertheless genial enough among let do justice made heartily welcome among naturally enough having heard have be captive among savage insisted upon relating to adventure inaugurated evening of yarn spinning in forecastle incident related having reference for most part to slave trade there be one grizzled old scoundrel in particular nicknamed appropriately enough doubt red hand who be full of reminiscence anecdote by by when grog have be circulating for time made mention of name virginia preciosa at pricked up ear for remembered at once that be name of two slaver that own american government be so anxious to lay by heel have hitherto baffled effort laughed at most carefully laid plan not altogether to surprise now learned that virginia preciosa be one same craft manned by two complete crew one american one spanish furnished with duplicate set of paper thus if by chance happened to be overhauled by british ship hoisted american colour american skipper officer crew showed american set of paper be produced result being that went free although might have full cargo of slave on board for british be not authorised to interfere with american slaver in like manner if american cruiser happened to fall in with showed spanish colour mustered spanish crew on deck produced spanish paper for inspection if be boarded there being treaty between america spain for suppression of slavery what did if happened to encounter french cruiser did not learn apparently such accident have not yet happened being remarkably fast sailer while french cruiser be notoriously slow coach be most valuable piece of information for to get hold of carefully laid away in storehouse of memory for use when occasion must serve on following morning began to ship cargo of slave three hundred forty of same night about hour before sunset weighed stood out to sea securing good offing by mean of land breeze sprang up later on finally bore away for cape palmas a happened weather be light fine progress be consequently slow cape palmas not being sighted until sixth day out here captain duquesne secured excellent departure by mean of three carefully taken bearing of cape observed at interval of two hour by mean of be able to establish position on chart with utmost accuracy done held on westerly course skipper intention being not to haul up to northward until have arrived at meridian of deg west longitude lest must fall in with of cruiser of slave squadron a luck must have weather fell still lighter at sunset on ninth day out on following morning at daybreak found becalmed within three mile of british cruiser promptly lowered boat despatched to overhaul by breakfast time have pleasure of finding once more under british flag captor proving to be corvette cleopatra by captain officer of be most kindly received when have related to strange story prize be promptly provided with prize crew sent into sierra leone in command of third lieutenant be given passage in four day later arrived at destination to great joy among vessel at anchor in harbour recognised eros pointed out to prize master good hearted fellow that be kindly let have boat to go on board a soon a own anchor be down chapter twenty crowning exploit come on board sir remarked touching cap a passed in through gangway of eros found face to face with captain perry master who be walking quarter deck side by side conversing earnestly while first lieutenant from break of poop be carrying on work of ship good heaven exclaimed skipper stopping short staring at a though have seen ghost be possible ca be yet by jove be mr fortescue welcome back to eros mr fortescue be delighted to see again where on earth have sprung from from fine brigantine have just come in imagine since see that boat brought be returning to mean before that look a though have be having pretty rough time of lately what of dolphin crew gave up for lost long ago with good reason sir answered foundered in hurricane in mid atlantic have only too much reason to fear that alone have survived to tell tale ah said skipper be bad news indeed fact that never turned up at rendez vous that intelligence must be gained of have prepared for well mr fortescue be afraid be too busy to listen to story just now must therefore dine with officer of ship to day then spin yarn meanwhile since seem to have returned to flying light without dunnage must recommend to get hold of ship tailor see what can do for in matter of knocking up uniform for rest may take boat go ashore to replenish wardrobe have better do at once for go to sea again to morrow have doubt purser will be able to let have such fund a need now run along renew acquaintance with shipmate see mr copplestone one two more glancing rather impatiently way a though be anxious to have word two with touching cap slipped up on to poop a in duty bound to report to first lieutenant who gave a hearty welcome a skipper have done then joined copplestone surgeon one two others who be obviously waiting to have word with retired with to gunroom where return be celebrated in due form of course be exceedingly anxious to hear story of what have befallen since dolphin eros have parted company steadfastly refused to tell anything

banda town escape therefrom with aid of poor ama of death of latter at hand expressed sincere regret finally of how have reached l'esperance extraordinary story have heard while aboard be not to be supposed be allowed to spin yarn without interruption on contrary be bombarded with continuous fire of question for elucidation of point have failed to make quite clear when have finished captain be pleased to express a perfectly satisfied with have done that loss of dolphin be due to cause entirely beyond control regret be expressed for loss of tasker keene of whom be highly esteemed by shipmate then conversation diverged to topic of audacious virginia preciosa protected by very ingenious fraud of double set of paper double crew be still merrily pursuing way bidding defiance to everybody ah ejaculated skipper with deep sigh of satisfaction thanks to friend red hand garrulity in cup mr fortescue will now know how to deal with precious craft go to sea to morrow will be business gentleman to bring to book fine feather in cap will be if must be successful first thing after breakfast on following morning captain perry went ashore remaining there until close upon eight bell in afternoon watch when at length came off looked uncommonly pleased with saw talking animatedly with first lieutenant for time then beckoned to suppose mr fortescue said when joined will not have very much difficulty in identifying virginia must be lucky enough to fall in with none at sir answered believe must be able to identify a far a must see boarded will remember took full advantage of opportunity to use eye oh yes will know if ever clap eye on again will be before very long hope answered skipper for by most lucky chance have to day obtained what believe to be trustworthy information to effect that be sighted four day ago bound for gaboon river perhaps must be more correct to say that be sighted steering east identified by master of brig who know perfectly well who have since arrived here that there be authentic information to effect that be time bound for gaboon in case sir said there ought not to be very much difficulty in falling in with when come out be what think returned skipper be quite ready to go to sea mr hoskins absolutely sir at moment notice answered hoskins very well then will weigh a soon a land breeze spring up said skipper weigh did little after seven o'clock evening securing good offing clearing shoal of saint ann by daybreak next morning knew that be customary for slaver coming out of gulf of guinea to endeavour to sight cape palmas in order that might obtain good departure for run across atlantic also because might usually reckon upon picking up trade somewhere in neighbourhood skipper therefore carefully laid down upon chart supposititious course of virginia from gaboon to cape palmas thence onward to caribbean sea then shaped course to enable to fall in with on latter at spot about one hundred mile to westward of palmas having reached spot shortened sail to three topsail spanker jib slowly worked to windward along course tacking two hour until have worked up to within sight of cape then bearing up running off to leeward for distance of one hundred mile again keeping hand aloft on main royal yard a look out from dawn to dark be weary anxious work for of course movement be being regulated by theory that for aught knew to contrary might be wrong a day succeeded day without bringing expected sail within ken there be not wanting among who denounced skipper plan a foolish argued that proper thing must have be to go direct to gaboon look there for virginia captain perry having carefully thought whole thing out stuck to gun refusing to budge inch from original arrangement in response to hint insinuation of who disagreed with result proved soundness of theory for on sixteenth day of quest about seven bell in afternoon watch look out hailed deck with large sail two point abaft weather beam steerin ' to west'ard under stunsails how far away be hailed skipper r'yals be just showin ' above horizon sir answered man ah that mean that be about twenty mile distant remarked skipper to being officer of watch too far off for identification purpose eh mr fortescue well sir answered be longish stretch admit yet with permission will get glass go aloft have look at thank mr fortescue pray do so by mean returned skipper hurrying below for own private telescope be exceptionally fine instrument slung over shoulder wended way aloft to main royal yard whereabout be dixon asked a swung up on yard beside ah there be see mind bit let have peep at man swung off yard slid down a far a cross tree while unslung glass brought to bear upon stranger rarefaction of air bothered good deal producing something of effect of mirage causing royal of distant vessel to stand up clear of horizon a though there be nothing beneath yet a rose fell with becend of sea shapeless snow white blotch appeared vanished again beneath occasionally be coming along very fast however presently when took rather broad sheer caught momentary glimpse of two royal just head of third mizzen proving conclusively that be full rigged a be virginia a skipper have surmised be still much too far off for identification thought rapidly idea occurred to caused to close glass re sling slide down to cross tree up go again dixon keep eye on vessel reporting noticeable thing about may happen to catch eye said swinging on to topgallant backstay slid rapidly down to deck well mr fortescue what do make of demanded skipper a rejoined be full rigged ship sir said a anticipated be still too far off for identification be steering course that have decided virginia ought to be steering have just occurred to that must indeed be that craft may give great deal of trouble if discovers prematurely seeing that be to windward must therefore suggest sir that bear up make sail so a to keep ahead of until dark then yes see what mean mr fortescue interrupted skipper doubtless there be many case where plan must be very commendable in case think must be better to close with while be still daylight can see exactly what be doing therefore be good enough to make sail at once if please ay ay sir answered hand make sail away aloft loose royal topgallantsails lay out loose flying jib board fore main tack in moment be bustle watch below tumbled up to lend hand without waiting to be called in five minute noble ship be clothed with canvas from truck down shearing through deep blue water with lee channel buried now mr fortescue said skipper will 'bout ship if please tacked accordingly a soon a be fairly round full again skipper hailed royal yard to know how chase bore answer be point half on weather bow just so commented skipper will keep on a be going until bear dead ahead then will edge away after presently eight bell struck hoskins came up to relieve whereupon made journey aloft to fore topmast cross tree time be raising very fast now that ship be steering upon converging line must already see nearly to foot of topsail settled comfortably determined to remain where be until must absolutely identify although even at time have scarcely shadow of doubt that be long sought virginia rather preciosa held in field of telescope twenty minute be hull up from point of observation by time there be further room for doubt descended to deck to acquaint captain with success of strategy be by time dead ahead of skipper thereupon gave order to bear away four point set larboard studdingsails at same time instructing look out to give instant warning of change in stranger course amount of sail set ship be now travelling very fast by time that have got studdingsails set stranger be visible from poop for about way down topsail rising higher even a watched in few minute more have lifted head of course above horizon still edging away keeping about four point on port bow presently a watched saw star stripe go soaring up to gaff end not to be outdone in politeness hoisted colour also for next quarter of hour two craft continued to close chase stolidly maintaining course while under skipper skilful conning continued to edge very gradually away a other vessel sped to leeward checking weather brace by few inch at time until yard be square at length when have brought chase fairly hull up became apparent that thanks to pain taken by skipper to improve rate of sailing eros be now trifle faster vessel of two consequently nothing short of accident must prevent from getting alongside chase still at sea there be always possibility of accident therefore a soon a be near enough captain gave order to clear away bow gun pitch shot across fellow forefoot a hint that wanted to have talk to be done notice be taken aboard chase next shot therefore be let drive slap at care being taken to fire high with result that shot passed through head of fore topsail only very narrowly missed topmast head seemed to rather shake nerve of skipper for next moment studdingsails collapsed came down altogether regular man o ' war fashion showing to be strongly manned instead of rounding to backing main yard a thought intended braced sharp up on port tack endeavoured to escape to windward be whit a smart with studdingsails a be instantly hauled wind after being now about one point on lee bow for next hour held grimly on firing more meanwhile by end of time have neared sufficiently to risk shot aimed with utmost care by gunner struck main topmast of chase sending everything above main yard over side to leeward settled matter next moment beautiful craft hove to mr fortescue said skipper know more about yonder vessel than of rest of therefore will take second cutter with crew fully armed proceed on board to take possession ay ay sir answered running down poop ladder gave order for boatswain to pipe second cutter away while went below to buckle on sword thrust pair of pistol into belt by time that boat crew be mustered boat made ready for lowering be hove to within biscuit toss of other vessel weather quarter be able to read with naked eye word virginia new orleans legibly painted across turn of counter d see that mr fortescue questioned skipper pointing to inscription hope there be mistake a to accuracy of information because if there be know will have got into rather awkward mess by firing upon winging that craft never fear sir answered confidently know secret of trick a will see very shortly very well said off go a soon a have secured possession let know will send carpenter strong gang aboard to help to clear away wreck get topmast on end before fall dark five minute later be alongside prize a on occasion of previous visit be compelled to board by way of lee main chain side ladder having be put over for accommodation yankee friend mate be on poop watching thought former turned trifle pale a noted strength of crew have brought with hand out of boat veer away astern ordered a swept alongside next moment party be over rail on deck have already made plan during short passage of boat between two vessel consequently moment that be aboard young copplestone who have come with led party of men forward to drive slaver crew below while with couple of sturdy seaman to back up ascended to poop look ' e hyar young feller began yankee skipper a set foot on poop wanter know what be meanin ' of outrage d see that there flag up there be galorious star stripe cut in yes recognise may a well tell at once know ship have right to hoist colour be preciosa slaver hailing from havana sailing under

ear must not listen instead pushed man roughly away angrily exclaiming hold yer silly tongue ye blame fool then turning to demanded who be be makin ' fool of ye time stranger nobody answered curtly acknowledge that did trick very handsomely when boarded on former occasion there be going to be fooling time assure well will be goldarned exclaimed man suddenly recognising if ai young britisher that

of paper declaring ship name to be preciosa port of registry havana ownership spanish spanish crew soon found snugly hidden away in spacious quarter beneath lazaret a to name on stern found that piece of wood on be carved painted be reversible having virginia new orleans carved on one side of preciosa havana on other that must be unbolted reversed in few minute by lifting couple of movable plank in after cabin called couple of hand into cabin have done forthwith much to relief of captain perry a afterward learned have full cargo consisting of seven hundred thirty negro young male on board a be remarkably fast well built ship be prize worth having to say nothing of credit that must win by putting stop to vagary transferred double crew to eros where be carefully secured in hold on top of ballast strong prize crew being put on board by captain perry be not long in clearing away wreck putting everything back into place again being ready to make sail by one bell in first watch being
