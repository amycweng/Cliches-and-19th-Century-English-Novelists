reputation of being most successful smuggler snug little fortune of ten thousand pound latter more desirable portion of acquirement carefully invested a dribbled in bit by bit in house property in

comfortable income amounting to five hundred pound per annum together with sea view last by mean least daughter fourteen year of age melancholy event occurred four year before date at history open lucy walford be therefore about eighteen year old when first of train of event happened be herein proposed to record mr walford be wont to assert just about time that lucy be very living picture of what used to be when girl if be indeed true be at once evidence of remarkable good taste late cap'n be said to have possessed of extraordinary change effected by hand of time for one must ever have suspected resemblance without mr walford assurance old lady be sad subdued personage thin angular of figure face with prominent cheek bone eye brow chin dark eye deeply sunk in socket broad forehead ploughed with innumerable wrinkle long sharp aquiline nose large thin lipped mouth querulous temper lucy on other hand be of medium height slight graceful figure abounding in delicate curve with small hand foot exquisite complexion face sweet piquant loveliness of set youth of alverstoke gosport too for matter by ear wealth of long silky golden hair persisted in twisting into most distracting conglomeration of wavy curl temper nothing not even mother querulousness must ruffle that lucy must be fairly beset by suitor be only natural there be not single bold young smuggler of marriageable age in country round about who did not cherish in greater lesser degree fond hope of one day making own albeit most of be be only just to say dimly cognisant of fact that be much too good for best of be probably in consequence of feeling that only one two boldest of bold of dashing fraternity have so far mustered up courage to approach young lady with distinct proposal of marriage be hardly necessary to say have be firmly a pleasantly a possible sent to right about class of lover gave lucy trouble whatever bold a might be in pursuit of lawless avocation be diffident to verge of absurdity in presence of beauty if associated with dignity refinement be painfully conscious of uncouth bearing manner lucy have little difficulty in keeping at proper distance if admirer gave trouble there be others notably two who did quite enough in fact to fully compensate for ease with be able to manage rest one of be certain lieutenant walford cousin of lucy other being captain george leicester of merchant schooner industry edward walford be only son of half brother of late captain walford be orphan twenty three year of age held commission in majesty foot then quartered in gosport be fairly well educated tall passably good looking of engaging manner who knew best said treacherous unscrupulous gamester george leicester on other hand whilst perhaps quite a handsome a rival be simply frank honest sturdy seaman carrying heart upon sleeve thoroughly master of profession diffident doubtful of in other matter trouble with two be that walford must not be made to see that presence be distasteful to lucy whilst leicester be provokingly blind to fact that fair girl loved with pure simple little heart have not given love to unsought must be understood far from george leicester have be one of earliest a be one of most constant devoted admirer be unremitting in attention to whenever be in port simple fellow be so doubtful a to prospect of success that have never given lucy chance must so gladly have welcomed to say yes to momentous question be ever hovering upon lip have never yet be able to get beyond be on certain brilliant june afternoon lucy a be frequent custom took book in hand strolled down to beach where making little nest for herself in shingle sat down to read think a whim might take ardent ray of sun streaming down out of cloudless sky gleamed flashed sparkled upon water of solent ruffled by gentle westerly breeze shone like sheet of liquid gold on further side of strait isle of wight upreared green wooded slope in fair perspective northern shore from nettlestone point to egypt bounding view on lucy right lay entrance to southampton water with further shore about stone point mouth of beaulieu river indistinctly seen through quivering golden haze whilst on left across water southsea castle stood boldly forward upon low projecting point watchful sentinel over magnificent anchorage of spithead inland from castle lay little straggling town of southsea beyond again still higher up estuary appeared spire roof of portsmouth harbour crowded with perfect forest of mast dozen men o ' war lay at anchor at spithead water of solent be dotted with sail of craft of size from stately frigate to humble enterprising bumboat a lucy sat there on beach basking in sun far too idle to read listless gaze became fastened upon trim smart looking little schooner under canvas must possibly spread be creeping slowly up from westward before light summer breeze glance of indifference with fair girl at first regarded little craft gradually changed to one of greatest interest lucy must be remembered be sailor daughter nearly neighbour be interested almost solely in seafaring matter daily conversation of by whom be surrounded abounded in nautical technicality have even made trip upon one occasion in father lugger only occasion by bye on hold of said lugger be absolutely guiltless of contraband freight lastly be not wall of home adorned with portrait of craft of various rig passing flushing needle of circumstance have combined to give lucy very fair knowledge of nautical matter sailor eye have not only learned distinguishing characteristic of different rig have also acquired subtle power of recognising individuality of different craft of same rig whenever there happened to be anything to excite interest in such craft so now first recognised fact that approaching vessel be schooner little later on when schooner have drawn somewhat nearer became conscious that schooner be well known to drawing small telescope from pocket focussed pointed at vessel yes there must be doubt about be industry little detail of canvas rigging proclaimed schooner identity then a though in order that there must be possible room for doubt a though george leicester have seen recognised charming girlish figure standing there on beach a possibly have through powerful marine glass white fluttering object gleamed out over rail soaring aloft streamed from main truck burgee with name industry worked upon in red letter at sight of lucy rapidly closed little telescope returned to pocket with bright flush conscious happy little laugh dear george murmured how glad be that be back safe how fervently hope that did not see watching schooner wonder whether will walk over evening then uncomfortably conscious of possibility that dear george might at very moment have accurately focussed in field of glass sauntered along beach with a much of air of total abstraction a must conveniently assume on spur of moment finally after watching schooner pas safely into portsmouth harbour there come to anchor returned home found mother suffering from more than ordinarily severe attack of miserables a lady be wont to term low spirit be one of mr walford peculiarity to be depressed in spirit in exact proportion to brightness exhilarating character of weather lucy be completely proof against just now sight have so lately looked upon have sent soft dainty flush into cheek light into eye song to lip mother miserables be wholly powerless to drive away went about house filling with melody of low sweet voice tea be over mr walford be made comfortable in wide arm chair with huge volume of sermon in lap lucy be trying to settle down with composure to execution of trifle in way of needle work when sharp click of gate latch be heard there be crunching of foot upon gravel walk front door be unceremoniously opened lieutenant edward walford walked in how do aunt lucy fair coz hope see in state of perfect salubrity be nonchalant greeting mr walford replied that be a well a must be expected did not say under what adverse circumstance lucy requested not to make ridiculous be too bad decided here have be looking forward to delightful visit from george leicester probably whole evening spent in society now pestilent cousin of hers must need take into perverse head to walk over from gosport to be found later on by dear george making fierce love to unfortunate lucy must be quite sufficient felt sure to choke said george off for at least voyage must never be be quite resolved must not prevent cousin coming to house since mother not only tolerated rather encouraged visit must must prevent making love to with determination sat down resorting to best mean must think of for keeping cousin at arm length produced writing material proceeded to discharge few of epistolary debt being thus unmistakably shown that presence be unwelcome to younger lady turned attention to elder one talking to about war then important most interesting topic of moment giving such scrap of news a have come to hand during day be perfectly evident from uneasy glance shot at cousin nervous way in tugged at long auburn moustache that occupation be not to liking at last abandoning further effort to accomplish almost impossible task of amusing old lady stepped to lucy side said in low whisper will come into garden with for few minute lucy have something of utmost importance to say to something will brook delay for regiment be ordered off to west indie may not have opportunity to see lucy knew a well a possible what something be cousin so anxiously desired to say to be convinced that be nothing le than proposal of marriage first impulse be to excuse that decided must hardly be kind on eve of departure for foreign service moreover might leave in possession of feeling that there be hope for possibly after many love speech have made might feel in sort bound not to marry one else until have have distinct refusal from must certainly be avoided so decided that must grant desired interview give dismissal a speedily withal a kindly a possible get out of house without delay be still early in evening who knew that might succeed in getting rid of unwelcome suitor before welcome one put in appearance so laying aside pen motioned to follow into large garden at back of house where must be perfectly secure from observation led way conducted cousin to little summer house at lower end of garden motioning to seat said now cousin edward what be important communication have to make be a brief a possible if please for really can not spare much time will said then pausing for moment making unsuccessful attempt to gain possession of hand remarked think must have already guessed what be have to say to lucy can not be ignorant of feeling with regard must have discovered long ago that love lucy deeply passionately tenderly a man love only once in lifetime have not known other very long be true continued after slight pause during have vainly looked into downcast face for sign of encouragement time have be long enough for to learn that hope of future happiness depend on think have also be long enough to enable to judge whether can entrust happiness to not know be by mean what ought to be here made pause hoping for word sign of disclaimer however never came hope will not judge too harshly be orphan remember robbed at early age of mother tender care gentle training have be left pretty much to mercy of stranger who allowed to grow up to manhood without effort to check development of evil propensity alike inherit from first parent then too have have misfortune to be thrown against will honestly assure into evil companionship in spite of disadvantage flatter that be by mean bad sort of fellow if will only take in hand lucy feel sure must make reformed character of then too consider society into must introduce wearing majesty uniform a do must pray say more edward beg interrupted lucy be grieved to be obliged to disappoint though think disappointment will be very great what ask be quite impossible in first place must frankly say that love in second must with equal frankness say that though might love ever so much must never marry man who needed must take in hand ' to make reformed character of be cousin a such will always regard with friendly interest will never be able to entertain for warmer feeling walford pale to lip with surprise chagrin looked incredulously in face of fair girl by whose side be seated be completely staggered idea of being indifferent to cousin have never for single instant occurred to have won for reputation of being lady killer now little country bred girl have impertinence to tell coolly that did not love nay more to hint pretty strongly that regarded with feeling not very far removed from contempt because forsooth have lived somewhat fast life why many of girl have met have positively admired for rakishness did not pause to consider what manner of girl be though by bye be monstrous be positively insulting then in addition to severe wound to amour propre there be disappointment of hope of pecuniary aggrandisement lucy fortune modest though be must have be of utmost service to be true knew that must not have penny of own until mother died that be firmly convinced must not be very long postponed event old fool a called mr walford in heart must doubtless be in grave long enough before returned from foreign service at event be willing to risk then lucy have said must not have surely must not mean be only saying to try stay be possible that loved that sailor fellow leicester must find out be quite sure lucy that will never be able to love asked infusing very successful affectation of passionate entreaty into tone of voice perhaps have spoken too quickly have taken by surprise have allowed impatience to outrun judgment perhaps if have waited little longer must have be just same must never have loved interrupted lucy now let return to house interview have lasted quite long enough be sincerely sorry if be disappointed edward must never give other answer so please say more about one word more exclaimed walford tell have right to know do love one else really see that have right to know anything about private affair answered lucy with hauteur in order that may fully understand hopelessness of own case will confess that there be one else ah ejaculated walford between set teeth suspected a much can form pretty shrewd guess a to who be too be that sneaking rascal leicester be not how dare sir speak to of friend in manner exclaimed lucy rising to foot stamping upon ground in excess of indignation go sir never come near again will never speak word to wo eh be sneering retort right will go will not come near again will make bitterly repent of treatment of yet name be not edward walford rising to foot walked rapidly up garden through house straight out at front door without so much a pausing to bid aunt good bye chapter two captain leicester hears bad news in meantime industry having come to anchor in portsmouth harbour captain leicester waiting only to see sail properly furled jumped into boat hurried away to owner residence here be detained for more than hour individual be desirous of seeing happening to be absent expected back immediately according to statement of solitary clerk who occupied little front room did duty a office owner of industry having at length turned up captain be instructed to haul alongside wharf forthwith in readiness to begin discharging cargo first thing next morning so george leicester greatly to disappointment have to return on board once more be not until clock be striking seven that schooner having be duly hauled alongside wharf securely moored thereto commander felt at liberty to leave set out upon pilgrimage to alverstoke for delay thus occasioned event herein recorded must probably never have occurred of at least chiefly concern captain leicester let take good look at hero a stand for moment in golden evening light on plank of wooden structure supported by ricketty worm eaten pile doe duty a wharf like thorough seaman a be be taking last glance at schooner before leaf to see that everything be thoroughly ship shape bristol fashion on board be small somewhat insignificant craft a george have sailed in for last four year of life two year a mate two more a master have become attached to looking at fault with lenient eye striving to conceal a much a possible from others a stand with hand lightly crossed behind leg trifle apart eye wandering critically over industry hull rigging see to be man of about five foot eight inch in height with well knit figure regular feature dark hair eye former surmounted by jaunty crimson worsted cap with silk tassel on drooping end tied into queue behind with bow of very broad black silk ribbon short black whisker on side of face with clean shaven upper lip chin be clad in wide skirted coat of fine blue cloth trimmed with large gilt button worn open to show kerseymere waistcoat beneath long flap of be confined by broad belt wear white silk kerchief round throat lace ruffle at wrist in honour of projected visit to lady love nether man be encased in knee breech white stocking shoe with large silver buckle there be frank pleasant look in keen dark eye expression of firmness about closed lip make most people feel when look at that must much rather have for friend than for enemy altogether a far a physique be concerned certainly have advantage of lieutenant walford a to comparative moral quality of two men reader will have abundant opportunity to judge for self unfortunately however for own lucy walford peace of mind george leicester be not only unaware of superiority on own part strongly suspect to be on other side have made walford acquaintance having met perhaps half dozen time in at sea view despite simplicity have have difficulty in recognising in lieutenant must be rival be just where own modesty self depreciation have played scurvy trick have noted walford easy nonchalant bearing two three flashy accomplishment have noticed too that lieutenant be not altogether devoid of good look have jumped too hastily a be aware at conclusion where woman be concerned plain straightforward honest sailor can have chance against dashing soldier like lieutenant at same time have by mean given up chase ever will so tell a long a lucy be free over over again have be upon point of speaking out learning fate over over again have hesitated closed lip deeming occasion unpropitious fearing to learn will make remainder of life blank to now have resolved to delay no longer have be screwing up courage to sticking place during whole of passage from waterford to gosport when stepped from rail of industry on to wharf be on way to alverstoke to learn fate satisfied at last that everything be right on board schooner leicester turned away directed step up high street thence out on to stoke road alverstoke church clock struck eight just a came in sight of next moment saw far ahead of man dart round corner come swinging along road towards at tremendous pace distant a man be captain leicester have difficulty in recognising in dreaded rival lieutenant walford guessed at once that lieutenant have be visiting at sea view what struck a strange be that walford appearance bearing be that of man in towering passion almost immediately afterwards however decided that must have be mistaken in supposing for a walford looked up recognised stopped dead in road for moment then hurried towards skipper with outstretched hand beaming face dear leicester how be walford exclaimed with effusion a grasped seaman hand wrung heartily how glad be to see when did arrive afternoon only be answer have be to sea view ' lately there be nothing wrong there hope wrong dear fellow why do ask well when rounded corner just now be walking at terrific pace looked so much a though be greatly upset about something feared there have be accident at sea view that be hurrying off for nearest doctor eh well may set mind at rest dear boy nothing be matter have just left mr walford lucy be in excellent health be glad to say be deuced kind of though to take warm interest in thank for with heart be prime favourite there can tell lad have be frightfully jealous of for long time now will never be so more lucy darling girl that be have have pity upon at last have condescended to set fear at rest so may congratulate if like upon having accepted a a future husband gasped leicester white to very lip exactly knew must be glad to hear being old friend of hers be reply mum word for present regiment be ordered away to west indie at once so lucy wish engagement to be kept secret until can return home to claim well must be off be going to sea view ' suppose mention conversation there please must not like lucy to know have already be prating of engagement if feel inclined to tell of of course be thing all right will not say word about may rest assured answered leicester a suffered hand to be clasped in farewell in fact suppose will have opportunity to mention to be not going to call there to night may not have time to call there at a will be very busy during next few day be thinking of giving up industry going somewhere abroad be ejaculated walford with great heartiness well done be glad to hear say so fellow with pluck sinew be never intended to potter about in trumpery little coaster well good bye two men separated walford to chuckle exult over complete success of suddenly planned ruse leicester with hope brightness gone out of face to saunter despondently along road back to gosport by way of haslar common avoiding sea view altogether so lucy be lost to well after be no more than have dreaded all along have be fool worse than fool to suppose that plain unpolished seaman must possibly have chance of success when pitted against fellow like walford curse not that did not mean that why must curse man to whom lucy have given young fresh love still be very hard to bear very hard hoped fellow must treat well if not let look to why must not walford treat well who must do otherwise who be there in whole wide world who must find in heart to be anything kind loving tender to yet psha who be george leicester that must judge man true have heard very queer story about same lieutenant walford doubtless be fabrication lucy be not girl to love man of whom such thing must possibly be true a to leicester own feeling of distrust dislike why be after only natural outcome of jealousy be certainly not to be relied upon a indicating faultiness of character in successful rival still argue a must have doubt must not dispel well be hard blow coming so suddenly too be difficult to bear patiently even now have shrewd suspicion that must be still more difficult to bear by by when fully realised extent of loss be use fretting over question be what be now to be done must not possibly live on old humdrum life longer must have excitement activity plenty of to keep mind occupied to prevent fretting over disappointment yes be happy inspiration have led to tell walford intended giving up industry must be first act after well after that must look about if must pick up tidy little vessel cheap must invest saving in purchase of sail in own employ try to stifle vain regret by plunging into more adventurous mode of existence so ran george leicester thought a made way back to industry meanwhile lucy having given one lover conge waited with loving impatience in vain for appearance of other on following day master of industry waited upon owner mr winter requested discharge mr winter be surprised chagrined at news that be to lose so well tried faithful servant a george finding hero inflexible in resolution must of course hing accede to request did at last with very good grace now said mr winter when account

dock dismissing coach at dock gate mr robert inquired of gate keeper where aurora be to be found inside ship fourth berth north side answered man pointing out direction be to take soon found vessel george standing on edge of dock wall saw before pretty little barque of four hundred odd ton copper bottomed with flush deck fore aft fine set of spar shapely hull a set eye glistening walked away from knelt down so a to take good look at run then went ahead of to see what bow be like finally very much prepossessed in favour already went on board accompanied by mr robert here be received by ship keeper who at once led way into cabin proved to be exceedingly snug comfortable apartment not very large yet roomy enough very tastefully fitted up abaft found captain cabin room twelve foot long entire width of ship well lighted there being skylight stern port fitted up in style gave unmistakable evidence of refined taste of former captain poor drowned wife from cabin proceeded to forecastle from thence into hold george time peering about everywhere for sign of weakness bad workmanship without finding having at length satisfied a to soundness of hull went aloft gave to spar rigging careful examination here too everything be perfectly satisfactory when at length stepped down out of rigging on to deck nodded approvingly to mr robert said right will take glad to hear say so captain be cheery reply be capital little craft be sure will like now a be nearly two o'clock what say will come take dinner with leicester acquiescing made best of way to eating house mr robert patronised

evening found undisputed owner of aurora next task be to secure freight have difficulty in doing in fact have choice of half dozen by noon have accepted charter for conveyance of general cargo to kingston jamaica to commence loading at once having completed business hurried away to shipping office be fortunate enough to secure service of very promising looking mate who undertook to establish on board forthwith so a to be on spot in readiness to receive cargo a came down to ship george now found comparatively at leisure have at one time serious thought of running down to gosport be only for day just to see lucy once more bid good bye well must have be for of have done so on reconsidering matter arrived at conclusion that good must possibly come of such proceeding whilst sight of lucy must only too certainly increase pang of regret already so keenly felt at failure to win so eventually decided to remain where be occupy in watching stowage of cargo chapter three capture recapture fortnight from day on captain leicester signed charter party saw last package passed into aurora hold on following day sailed for plymouth there to join fleet of merchant ship be to cross atlantic under convoy thanks principally to exertion of chief mate mr bowen george be fortunate enough to pick up very good crew comprising second mate who acted also a boatswain carpenter steward black cook two able seaman four ordinary ditto two well grown lad who have already be voyage two in coaster constituted complement of fourteen men told just sufficient to handle barque comfortably sailed from thames with wind at about west have capital run a far a south foreland aurora showing to be such smart vessel under canvas that commander be delighted with at point however wind still held from westward be dead against became question whether must anchor in down to await favourable change continue on endeavour to beat passage a far a plymouth prudence dictated adoption of former course being well known that channel be just then swarming with french privateer powerful lugger for most part captain of have unpleasant habit of slipping out of harbour a evening came on stretching across toward english coast on lookout for merchantman very often picking up valuable prize getting back into port next morning weather too happened just then to be highly favourable for operation of gentry sky being overcast with frequent shower moon on other hand however time be of utmost importance george have only five day left in to reach plymouth if be to avail of protection of convoy so after discussing question with mr bowen carefully weighing in own mind finally decided to keep ship moving to trust to fortune good lookout aurora accordingly proceeded stretching over a far a mid channel when went about on drawing in with land again leicester have satisfaction of seeing that must handsomely weather beachy head did tacking close in under land about breakfast time on day following departure from london at pm being at time rather nearer to french than to english coast george tacked again in order to close english shore toward at pm being abreast of littlehampton about eight mile off shore aurora went about once more stood over towards france close hauled on starboard tack weather have cleared somewhat sun breaking through cloud a afternoon wore on flooding whole western sky with splendour a sank to rest one by one a golden glory of west faded into sober grey star shone out peeping shyly down upon world from softly dappled sky there be prospect of being fine night in channel george accordingly gave instruction for ship to continue on same tack until midnight when be to be hove about once more then cautioning second mate who be in charge of deck to maintain strict lookout to call in event of change of weather appearance of suspicious looking sail in neighbourhood went below to snatch hour two of sleep having have none so far from moment of vessel sailing flinging off clothes threw into swinging cot instantly sank into sound dreamless slumber to be awakened again with start almost instantly a seemed to by flapping of ship canvas in wind starting up into sitting posture heard voice of chief mate on deck giving necessary order for tacking ship hillo thought what be meaning of nothing wrong hope can not be must surely have called perhaps be change of wind hope be well being awake may a well slip on deck satisfy a to meaning of accordingly sprang out of cot began to dress sound on deck having meanwhile ceased save for monotonous tread overhead of officer of watch occasional clank of wheel chain ship be heeling over to starboard showing that be on port tack rushing sound of water along side seemed to indicate that be moving pretty rapidly through a opened state room door to pas into main cabin heavy step be heard descending companion ladder next moment second mate appeared at foot in act of turning into own state room well mr cross said skipper what be news from deck have tacked ship seems be there change of wind sir answered cross wind still hold steady at about west though seems little inclined to back point so to south'ard be clouded over again gone very dark tacked at midnight sir according to order midnight ejaculated george surely mean to say be midnight already cross about quarter after sir answered second mate with smile have slept sound sir expect time have travelled fast with must have slept sound indeed answered skipper to seemed that have hardly fallen asleep when be awakened by flapping of canvas well will not keep from bunk will go on deck take look round before turn in again good night good night sir be reply second mate opened door of berth passed in whilst george sprang lightly up companion ladder stepped out on deck be indeed a second mate have said very dark so much so that skipper having just left cabin where lamp be dimly burning be unable to see anything for moment two then a eye grew accustomed to darkness caught first glimpse of man at wheel form faintly illuminated by binnacle light then figure of mate just turning near taffrail to walk forward finally dark shadowy pile of canvas towering away aloft until melted into general obscurity have gone very dark again mr bowen remarked skipper a mate becoming aware of george presence on deck joined be dark sir answered mate almost too dark to be poking about here in channel without light be rather risky admit returned george still think be so dangerous a showing light must simply be hanging out invitation to prowling french privateer to pounce down on how be head to man at wheel george mate having by time strolled aft together no'th half west sir be reply come be not so bad remarked george will fetch plymouth yet in good time to join convoy if be sail broad on weather bow broke in lookout forward with startling abruptness george mate instantly directed gaze in direction indicated by lookout presently shapeless something like blacker patch against black background of darkness loomed into view about one point before beam showing by rapid change in respective position of two ship how near be stranger why exclaimed leicester be coming right down for will be into port port hard up with helm smartly lad to man at wheel ship ahoy port helm can not see ay ay oh yesh be response from other vessel a came floating down upon wind stranger took broad sheer to port showing to be large lugger shot very neatly alongside aurora grappling iron being cleverly hove into barque fore main rigging a two vessel touched at same moment five twenty frenchman armed with cutlas pistol scrambled alertly in over aurora bulwark leader singling out george notwithstanding darkness exclaiming a promptly presented pistol at head vat cheep dis be eh aurora of london be answer tres bien cheep belle marie est un corsaire francais un vat call privateere et vous etes me prisonniers be ze fortune of war monsieur turn to night yours to morrow perhaps have have now dear sares a there not moosh time be permettez moi flung open companion door motioning significantly to george mate to go below poor george glanced swiftly round deck only to see that be in complete possession of frenchman one of whom be already at wheel so turning to mr bowen murmuring there be help for suppose signed to mate to lead way then followed dejectedly door being smartly slammed to after next moment heard sound of heavy body being dragged up to banged against companion entrance thus precluding possibility of stealing on deck again effecting counter surprise whole thing have be done so rapidly that be not until found ship being once more hove about with head pointing toward french coast captain leicester fully realised situation in le than ten minute ship have be taken from confined in own cabin prisoner have not be on deck at time of occurrence must certainly have considered avoidable misfortune to be accounted for only by most gross carelessness a be be fully able to understand that be entirely due to extreme darkness of night circumstance of lugger barque stumbling over other a be that made matter better for have lost ship now there loomed before immediate prospect of dreary confinement for many year perhaps in french prison thought goaded almost to madness sprang impatiently to foot began to pace moodily to fro over narrow limit of cabin floor meanwhile second mate who have started out of berth at first shock of contact between two vessel have made rush for deck only to be confronted driven back by frenchman with drawn cutlas be seated on locker alongside mr bowen listening to individual gloomy recital of detail of capture low murmur of two men voice annoyed george in then irritable frame of mind to avoid retired into own state room night being close sultry stern port be open a entered cabin sound of hail from to leeward came floating in through port be answered from deck kneeling upon sofa locker thrusting body well out of port skipper became aware that lugger be parting company that hail have heard be voice of french captain shouting parting instruction to officer have left in charge of prize looking away to leeward in direction from sound have come be just able to distinguish dark outline of lugger a bore up pursued way once more to eastward after considerable amount of excited jabbering took place on deck word cherbourg being so often repeated that george have doubt be to port that barque be to be taken in about hour died away perfect silence reigned on board once more from moment that lugger parted company confused idea a to possibility of retaking barque have be gradually attaining definite shape in george mind be rather desperate attempt to make be true with two mate shut up there in cabin aft while crew be doubtless confined in forecastle with possibility of effecting junction with still if bowen cross be willing to run risk of assisting might be worth while to try thinking thus drew head inside stern port made way back into main cabin where found two mate with arm crossed upon chest head bowed upon breast asleep giving gentle shake apiece to arouse sat down beside asked bluntly if felt disposed to run little risk in attempt to retake barque so avoid french prison may reckon on for one sir if have hit upon anything likely in shape of plan heartily answered chief mate cross here know wo hold back unless be greatly mistaken in never fear said cross if give word sir ship be to be retook will have how do propose to do will have to be surprise s'pose listen said george what propose be stern port be open believe that by assisting other may manage to creep out through on to main brace boom iron thence make way along ship side outside bulwark forward when by watching opportunity may possibly manage to overpower guard on forecastle throw off hatch release own lad then must just make fight for may perhaps three manage to take along with cutlas brace of pistol men must do best can with hand spike belaying pin in short anything can lay hand upon very promising plan indeed sir answered chief mate next question be when be to set about sooner better answered george so go at once please for pistol load carefully take cutlas from rack then will proceed to business in very few minute trio be ready going softly into george state room paused for minute two to listen for sound might furnish with clue to condition of affair on deck nothing be to be heard save occasional clank of wheel chain low humming of song by helmsman be curiously quiet on deck whispered george to two companion ca quite make out undoubtedly mean one of two thing however either be keeping very strict careful watch none at will soon see now cross stand by to give hoist if seem to require will go first a soon a be fairly out of way mr bowen can follow kicking off boot stocking skipper thereupon without further ado mounted locker passing body cautiously out of weathermost stern port held on by edge of port with one hand whilst reached out felt for brace iron with other soon found grasping firmly with right hand began to work cautiously towards task have set proved however to be much more difficult than have expected rake of ship stern so greatly interfering with freedom of motion at first feared must be obliged to abandon attempt altogether a foresaw that moment released hold upon edge of port must infallibly swing off backwards unless must manage to retain grasp of iron drop overboard so slipped in through port again to explain difficulty to mate to caution to be careful when came to turn then resumed attempt once more securing firm grasp upon brace iron watched roll of ship seizing first favourable opportunity boldly swung off into air where hung suspended by one arm with foot almost touching water in moment have hand upon iron giving vigorous upward swing be soon able to throw foot over tautly strained main brace to scramble up place astride brace block be now easy task settling firmly there prepared to assist chief mate when must make appearance have not long to wait hardly be comfortably established in comparatively safe position when hand appeared from behind quarter piece in search of iron george promptly seized guided to object of search then firmly grasped wrist with one hand keeping other ready to render further assistance look out sir be coming heard chief mate mutter then with tremendous swing mr bowen body came into view quick a thought george leaned over caught disengaged hand placed too upon iron then rising to foot exerting strength to utmost proceeded to drag chief mate up alongside now whispered a soon a have got there will begin to work way forward at once so a to be out of way have better stay lend cross hand will wait for in fore chain so saying stepped off brace iron planting foot firmly on broad beading ran along top edge of sheer strake leaning body against bulwark whilst grasped outer edge of rail to steady speedily easily reached mizzen chain here availing of partial shelter cover afforded by lanyard dead eye of rigging cautiously raised head above level of bulwark to survey state of deck inboard first object met view be figure of helmsman rendered visible by light of binnacle lamp a beamed dimly out upon feebly lighted up figure be leaning negligently against wheel with one arm thrown carelessly over eye be vacantly fixed upon cloudy heaven above with thought evidently far away not soul be visible either forward aft george thought must make out indistinct outline of something resembling human figure seated on bench to windward of cabin companion continued so long earnest gaze upon object that be quite startled to find first second mate beside came at last to conclusion that if be indeed human figure at must be that of prize master sound asleep turning glance from object forward saw that galley door to windward be shut whilst on lee side be open reflection of light inside shining pretty strongly upon lee bulwark showing shadow of men evidently in act of eating drinking do see that whispered george to two companion nothing must possibly be more favourable to plan will work way forward a far a main rigging when think may venture to slip over bulwark in on deck then must creep very cautiously forward find out whereabouts of watchman lookout whatever be overpower if possible without raising alarm done will set free own lad have fear whatever a to result three adventurer then moved noiselessly forward until came to main rigging when slipped in on deck crouching low in deep shadow of weather bulwark crept along until be within dozen foot of fore scuttle here paused began to peer anxiously about for man expected to find on watch on forecastle there be just forward of cat head whispered second mate hastily snatching heavy iron belaying pin from rail stole crouching noiseless a cat upon unconscious enemy six second later dull heavy blow be heard followed by faint groan dark object near cat head vanished cross returning to skipper side whispered be all right knocked sens clean out of then laid quietly out on deck reckon wo come to hisself again for next half hour now what be next move cap'n next thing answered george be to open fore scuttle quietly get own lad on deck be surprised that have not attempted to steal up of own accord before on going to forecastle hatch however soon discovered reason why men be content to remain so quietly below large mooring hawser having be coiled down on top of hatch thus effectually preventing imprisoned men from raising will never be able to move without giving alarm said george must contrive somehow to shut fellow up in galley keep there be easily done whispered chief mate cookey ' have lot of firewood stowed away in eye of long boat must get hold of piece cut dozen wedge from one of must then slide to door on lee side wedge tight with three of wedge whilst of at same time wedge up door to windward then glided away to long boat soon returned with small piece of wood in hand here be whispered now will soon have boxed up so tight that wo get out until open door for whilst speaking have produced knife from pocket notwithstanding intense darkness soon hacked out half dozen wedge though very roughly shaped be still good enough for purpose now sir said in low tone to george take three let cross go with slide to lee door with slam then slip in wedge jam tight home while will do same to wind'ard a soon a hear cross close lee door george took wedge accompanied by cross crept noiselessly up to galley door to leeward mr bowen meanwhile making way to corresponding door on weather side there be loud slam moment of silence then tremendous outcry accompanied by sound of heavy battering from inside galley three adventurer met again at forecastle hatch now then cried george have moment to lose so let capsize hawser bodily be ready then one two three heave by exerting whole strength to utmost heavy hawser be rolled off hatch hatch raised just a two figure came rushing forward from quarterdeck with loud angry outcry tumble up lad shouted george down scuttle tumble up smartly help to retake ship ay ay sir be eager answer from below then skipper drawing cutlas pistol turned to meet prize master helmsman who have hurried forward to learn meaning of disturbance in galley surrender be dead man exclaimed george thrusting muzzle of pistol into face of a yet only half awake prize master oui oui mbeieu oh yais surrendaire exclaimed poor fellow a felt firm pressure of cold pistol barrel against forehead hastily unbuckling cutlas thrust into george hand chief mate in meantime have incontinently felled other man to deck with single blow from fist have then left cross to secure with rope end barque crew have meanwhile made way on deck be now clustered about officer anxious to know what be to do whilst aurora left to herself have shot up into wind eye be now lying stationary with square canvas aback rest of sail fluttering loudly in wind one hand to wheel jam hard up commanded george rest of to station mr bowen mr cross will mount guard over galley door if please until have got ship round raise tack sheet round with main yard flatten in forward well there with main brace now swing fore yard board fore main tack haul over head sheet right helm lad give spoke two if find want a gather way then keep full by ' now lad never mind about coiling up just now can do after have attended to prisoner come forward open weather galley door a frenchman pas out seize lash hand heel together order be promptly executed discomfited frenchman being permitted to pas out of galley only one at time cross burly form drawn cutlas conspicuously displayed pistol supported by appearance of barque crew in immediate background proving effectual deterrent to attempt on part of privateersman to make rush for freedom in something like couple of hour from time of capture aurora be once more in undisputed possession of rightful owner chapter four departure of convoy about daybreak wind veered round blew fine fresh steady breeze from northward enabling barque to lay course with flowing sheet sunset found safely anchored in plymouth sound one of fleet of nearly two hundred merchantman have assembled there for purpose of being convoyed across atlantic convoy be to sail on following day one men o ' war constituted escort be already in sound along with several other ship of royal navy a cable smoked out through aurora hawse pipe that evening when dropped anchor george fondly hoped trouble be at end be mistaken a soon a canvas be furled captain leicester manned boat proceeding on board admiral ship reported circumstance of capture recapture of vessel requesting at same time to be relieved a soon a possible of custody of prisoner be speedily arranged by admiral order armed boat crew be at once despatched to aurora prisoner be released from bond passed into man o ' war boat in little more than hour from arrival in sound safely lodged on board prison hulk so far so good george have yet to learn that there be one inconvenient result generally attendant upon request to man o war for assistance boat after conveying frenchman to prison hulk duly returned to admiral ship instead of crew at once passing out of be ordered to remain where be lieutenant in charge alone going on deck holding short conference with captain after re entered boat proceeded once more alongside aurora george saw coming wondered what must possibly be errand be not left long in doubt be very sorry to trouble remarked lieutenant a encountered george at gangway whither latter have repaired to meet must ask to kindly muster men george knew only too well then what visit boded be quite helpless so putting best face must upon matter answered a cheerfully a must directed that hand must be summoned on deck hope however remarked to officer that will not deprive of of crew have shipped only just sufficient men to handle assure that even with fine weather have have in trip down channel have found that have not hand too many for efficient management of ship ah yes answered lieutenant with laugh merchant skipper tell same story will see will see must be exceptionally good men however must never have succeeded in recovering possession of ship ah here be fine smart crew look too upon word must congratulate mr um upon good luck in securing so many fine fellow why look capable of taking care of ship twice size really must relieve of one two of must be nothing short of treason to most gracious majesty to allow to keep when navy be in such urgent want of men crew be by time assembled on deck very disconcerted disgusted looking set of men be have submitted to week of voluntary imprisonment in crimp house for sole purpose of escaping impressment into navy now when voyage have actually begun here be man o ' war boat alongside to force into service regarded with so great abhorrence wonder that looked felt disgusted men be drawn up in line along deck in single file lieutenant sauntered leisurely along line critically examining man a came to without a george have anticipated ordering of into boat alongside at length reached last individual in line one of lad leicester be beginning to breathe freely once more hoping that be after not to be robbed of of crew when officer returned to head of line touching second mate lightly on chest with finger said be evidently born to become man o ' war man fine fellow get trap together pas into boat alongside a soon a have received wage excuse said george really must ask not to take man be second mate second mate exclaimed officer with well feigned astonishment surely mean to say carry second mate on board cock boat a certainly do retorted george somewhat tartly why not pray simply good man because individual be wholly unnecessary can take charge of one watch know mate will of course command other so that can have possible use for second mate why smart active young fellow like ought to be ashamed of such act of laziness a carrying of second mate pay man wage if please let pas into boat owe wage answered george on contrary other man of crew for matter have drawn month advance owes three week service yet before will be square who be to reimburse for loss be sorry to say be quite unable to answer question be reply giving mind strictly a private opinion be afraid will have to suffer loss for part have never be able to understand why master of merchantman will persist in so risky policy a payment of month wage in advance when can never tell what may occur to prevent men from working out time be not business must bear hand finish work will get severely rapped over knuckle then turning once more to men ordered carpenter to get thing ready go into boat said george by time thoroughly exasperated will not permit man be ship carpenter forbid sir to impress at peril forbid eh said lieutenant turning angrily upon george take care what be saying fine fellow may perhaps find way mean of impressing before sail then suddenly realising that have allowed temper to outrun discretion added in conciliatory tone well since say that man be carpenter will spare must have explained that fact to at first a to impressing why daresay know old joke about impressing ship master will understand be only jesting be capital fellow have behaved very well over business so will let off a easily a can of course must do duty take man two from if did not of other ship must be sending on board leaving really short handed with picked out with unerring eye two able seaman then turning to george with great show of generous forbearance announced that must leave rest though must hardly reconcile to conscience to go away with only three men out of so strong smart crew a belonging to aurora cross be by time with chest on deck other two impressed men soon followed disconsolate trio passed down ship side in moody silence unmoved alike by commiserating look of late shipmate jocular more than half ironical congratulation of man o ' war men in boat upon entry into so promising service a of british navy on departure of boat george held short consultation with mr bowen result of be very wise determination to grin bear rather than risk fresh annoyance by effort very strongly suspected must be utterly useless to obtain redress restitution of men determination come to carpenter be summoned aft installed into duty berth of unfortunate cross george thus finding crew reduced to three men officer included one lad in watch cook steward of course being idler service in working of ship only to be demanded on occasion of exceptional urgency on day one following that of impressment of aurora men gun be fired at sunrise by commodore blue peter be hoisted at fore royal masthead fore topsail be loosed on board ship of convoying squadron still morning air immediately began to resound with song of seaman clanking of windlass pawl a fleet of merchantman constituting convoy began to get under weigh there be considerable amount of emulation displayed among merchant skipper of at least whose ship crew have pretension to smartness in hour good many of craft be under weigh standing out to sea with light air of wind from eastward old tremendous led van closely followed by torpid while frigate andromeda vixen of gun assisted by dasher grampus throstle mallard gun brig cruised round round laggard making signal firing gun generally creating great deal of fuss noise excitement leading portion of fleet be hove to hull down at sea before last craft in convoy have succeeded in getting anchor making start by noon whole of fleet be fairly in channel when tremendous made signal to fill away went bowling along to southward westward dull sailers under rag must spread to wind now settled into fine steady royal breeze from east south east while smarter craft be compelled to show only spread of canvas a must enable dullard to keep pace with tremendous torpid under double reefed topsail led way about two mile apart frigate be posted one to windward one to leeward of merchant fleet brig brought up rear being duty to whip in straggler urge on slow coach keep sharp lookout for prowling privateer english coast be still faintly visible like light grey cloud on horizon astern when strange sail be sighted on port beam steering west course brought gradually nearer to convoy be brig rigged continued to approach until have reached point six mile from fleet when suddenly hauled wind without showing colour stood away to southward eastward close hauled under heavy press of canvas there have be considerable amount of signalling going on between various men o ' war from moment of first appearance now there be still more soon ceased last string of flag displayed by tremendous be acknowledged by andromeda weathermost frigate excitement appeared to be at end be afraid that mean trouble for of unless men o ' war keep good sharp lookout observed mr bowen to george jerking thumb over shoulder in direction of rapidly receding brig a two men walked deck together criticising appearance sailing power of various craft in company ah indeed remarked george see have come to same conclusion a with regard to stranger be that be french privateer just sir nothing else be reply be french over need for to show colour rig speaks nationality plain enough for blind man to read be be on watch for fleet for last week more may depend on now have gone back to report news to consort that west india convoy have sailed mark word sir will have to keep good sharp lookout few of will be snapped up yet in spite of men o ' war before sight next land well said george must take care that aurora be not one of few be luckily be not exactly dullest sailer in fleet must manage to keep well in body of be outsider will run greatest risk for next three four day unusual amount of vigilance be observable on board men o ' war especially frigate gun brig of kept well in offing during day evidently on lookout for prowling picaroons closing in again upon convoy at night nothing be seen to keep alive suspicion ship of description be encountered save couple of english frigate of replied to private signal exchanged number with tremendous on evening of tenth day out lofty precipitous cliff of azores be sighted passed week sped away without occurrence of incident worthy of record wind continued fair steady convoy though rate of travelling be rather slow made very good progress on afternoon of eighteenth day out from plymouth fleet being at time in latitude degree north longitude degree minute west about half way to jamaica wind fell light sky have hitherto be clear became overcast heavy mass of dark thunderous cloud slowly gathering in south western quarter gradually spreading athwart sky until whole of visible heaven be obscured barometer dropped slightly indicating in conjunction with aspect of sky probable change of wind consequent interruption to hitherto highly satisfactory progress a evening fell flash of sheet lightning be occasionally to be seen along southern horizon captain leicester anticipating thunder storm probable heavy downfall of rain made preparation for refilling of water cask though atmosphere appeared to be heavily charged with electricity thunder held off when night closed down upon convoy moon being then in third quarter rising late became a dark a wolf mouth light be of course displayed on board ship convoy having become somewhat scattered in consequence of failure of breeze effect be very singular striking being george first voyage across atlantic be naturally little anxious on night in question resolved to remain on deck until weather must have assumed more decided aspect there be fortunately still gentle breeze from about east south east fanning convoy along at speed of two knot in hour just giving ship steerage way be consequently able to keep out of other way thus avoid collision always great element of danger when large number of craft happen to be sailing in company about two bell in middle watch george being seated at time near companion smoking meditative pipe thinking somewhat ruefully about lucy walford carpenter who be in charge of deck approached said unless be greatly mistaken sir here be large craft without light creeping up on larboard quarter indeed said george rousing stepping aft to taffrail with carpenter whereabouts be carpenter looked intently astern for moment then stretched out arm saying there sir ah now can see be just about to shut out first of four light that can see close together there now have shut out see said george doe fellow mean by being without light on pitch dark night a must serve right to report to commodore in morning have smart vessel under foot though see how be overhauling why must surely be one of gun brig judging from spread of canvas lofty spar what can be doing here in very middle of fleet without light too stranger be by time little more than couple of cable length from aurora drawing up to fast apparently intending to pas very closely george glanced anxiously at stern light thinking might possibly have gone out be burning brightly must be distinctly visible to on board other craft gradually dark mysterious fabric drew closer still closer up on port quarter of aurora not faintest glimmer of light being visible from stem to stern not sound of kind to be heard on board george began to feel trifle nervous a watched silent stealthy approach of stranger fetching speaking trumpet from becket in companion way where always hung in company with telescope stepped aft to taffrail hailed ship ahoy hillo be response in tone of voice pitched so low that though be distinctly audible to on board aurora must not penetrate sluggish atmosphere to great distance what ship be that inquired george britannic majesty brig name unintelligible what ship be that aurora of london why be out of station without light sir be there anything wrong yes be reply hail more there be enemy at hand will sheer alongside presently tell what to do enemy at hand eh muttered george what can mean wonder if there be enemy by suppose mean frenchman in neighbourhood man o war fellow must have eye like owl to be able to see in dark just step down into cabin if please mr ritson give mate call half like in little more than minute mr bowen be on deck listening to george statement of what have already passed of uneasiness george have just finished speaking when there be sound a of falling handspike something of kind on board stranger followed by loud ejaculation of sacr r r r re nom de remainder of exclamation be promptly suppressed be enough george suspicion be now fully aroused whispered to two men standing by be french beyond doubt intended to surprise very nearly did too will not be caught quite so easily time ritson go forward rouse men tell to creep aft under shelter of bulwark let not one of show so much a hair of head above rail tell to look lively mr bowen be good enough to go below bring up cutlas apiece for hand chapter five choppee for changee black dog for blue monkey by time that aurora crew be on deck crouching behind bulwark aft on port side armed instructed by george a to what required of strange sail be within dozen fathom of aurora port quarter must now be seen with tolerable distinctness outline of hull of lofty canvas showing black a ebony against dark background of sea sky doubt captain leicester might have still entertained concerning be completely set at rest a glanced at cut of canvas be french over foot by foot brig for such be crept up to aurora until bow be in line with barque stern not more than twenty foot distant george stood by main rigging watching cutlas in hand calm determined plan already formed for action in event of suspicion proving correct in ordinary course of thing two craft be now quite near enough to other for communication however confidential in nature to be made without possibility of being overheard though george must see that figure stood on brig rail by main rigging not word be uttered keeping gaze steadfastly fixed upon brig captain leicester saw that helm have suddenly be ported for be sheering strongly in toward own vessel brig ahoy hailed what be have to say to come too close sir will be into never fear answered in perfect english dark figure on board brig will not carry away so much a rope yarn belonging to must be on board before can venture to give instruction oh very well said george if intend boarding have better do so by way of fore rigging may get nasty fall be very much littered up here abaft with spar so on ah thank very much will take advice be reply george saw man motion with arm brig course be altered sufficiently to put alongside with gangway even with aurora fore mast second two ship gently jarred together brig quarter dropping alongside barque at same moment enfans allons nous en exclaimed voice of stranger forward followed by sound of leap on to barque deck scramble among spar littered there now be time lad jump for life exclaimed george in low excited tone setting men example forthwith sprang from own ship bulwark to of brig dashing at helmsman cut down with cutlas before fellow must recover sufficiently from astonishment to utter cry then without moment pause seized wheel exerting strength sent with single twirl spinning hard over to starboard where lashed shock of collision slight a be caused two vessel to recoil from other be barely alongside when separated again george manipulation of brig wheel similar manipulation of aurora helm at last moment before touching of two vessel greatly expediting separation by time therefore george have looked about satisfied that whole of crew be safely with on brig deck two vessel be dozen foot apart increasing distance second bow diverging from other at almost right angle frenchman on boarding aurora divided into two party one of rushed forward to secure crew while other made similar rush aft for purpose of overpowering officer helmsman in astonishment perplexity at finding deck deserted paused for moment irresolutely then hurriedly searched cabin forecastle only to find that ship be utterly deserted then for first time glimmering of truth presented to mind of french leader suspicion be instantly confirmed for captain leicester having at moment rallied crew led forward finding that a have expected frenchman have boarded aurora with available strength leaving only five twenty men on board brig to handle after short sharp tussle drove men below secured complete possession of brig party on board aurora distinctly heard sound of conflict waited in breathless expectancy for termination have not long to wait in little over couple of minute captain leicester voice be heard giving order to shift helm brig having in meantime gone round until be head to wind with canvas flat aback to trim over head sheet then chorus of curse loud deep from deck of aurora proclaimed chagrin of frenchman on board her at to extraordinary unforeseen result of adventure captain be man of indomitable pluck energy readiness of resource by mean given to tame immediate acceptance of defeat realised situation in moment determining to make best of bad bargain promptly ordered sail to be crowded upon aurora in hope of effecting escape night being dark however men new to ship work went on slowly by time that topgallantsails be sheeted home own brig be once more alongside with two red light hoisted to gaff end alarm signal port open gun run out men standing by ready to open fire a drew up abreast aurora george hailed barque ahoy let fly sheet halliard at once surrender will fire into right be reply from french captain have won game monsieur so will not attempt to rob of credit of victory managed affair exceedingly well mon ami have taught lesson will remember for rest of life may come on board take possession a soon a like then gave necessary order in french to crew halliard sheet be let fly on board aurora george reducing sail at same time in brig two vessel losing way began gradually to drop into rear portion of convoy captain leicester did not however accept french captain invitation to go on board take possession once more of own ship that proceeding must have be just trifle too risky have game in own hand intended to keep there so quietly waited until one of men o ' war must come alongside a knew must soon be case in response to signal in short time brig be seen approaching under perfect cloud of sail unmistakably english gun brig time however sweeping up on port quarter of george prize officer sprang into main rigging hailed brig ahoy what brig be that jeune virginie french privateer answered george managed somehow to slip in among fleet unobserved in darkness threw heavy boarding party in on deck of vessel aurora suspected design just in time however a crew boarded boarded succeeded in taking possession two ship separating immediately thus preventing return of french to own craft ah see remarked officer effected exchange of ship choppee for changee black dog for blue monkey eh now want to get own ship back for not exactly answered george with laugh have already forced to surrender be craft barque immediately under lee will feel obliged if will take charge of prisoner lend sufficient men to navigate prize into port um well really quite know about will man prize for to night must see commodore about matter in morning if will authorise to lend prize crew of course will be very happy by way where did frenchman come from when saw craft first be about couple of cable length directly astern of answered leicester be eh remarked officer well there will be pretty row to morrow about being allowed to slip in undetected will send boat on board own ship at once to remove prisoner done will tell off crew to man prize for be accordingly done hour after arrival of throstle upon scene george crew be once more comfortably established on board own ship on following morning affair be officially reported to commodore who put into tremendous passion about declaring that occurrence reflected indelible disgrace upon whole british navy that must bring to court martial one of officer belonging to convoying ship however seeing that at bottom be fine good hearted old fellow never did after abusing everybody else sent for george complimented upon gallantry publicly on quarterdeck of tremendous offered to obtain commission for offer hero be foolish enough to decline gave hearty consent to proposed borrowing of prize crew affair did not by mean end here for on following night be almost a dark a preceding one three ship belonging to merchant fleet under convoy gave unusual altogether extraordinary amount of trouble to captain of gun brig by persistent straggling suspicion being at length aroused be found to be in hand of french prize crew having be surprised captured by jeune virginie immediately prior to unsuccessful attempt upon aurora have be only little le anxious to effect escape might a event proved have accomplished without slightest difficulty about pm on day following recapture of three vessel weather being at time stark calm with overcast sky signal to shorten sail prepare for bad weather be exhibited on board commodore ship old tremendous be very difficult to make out signal flag hanging from masthead in such close motionless fold that be almost impossible to identify so after long anxious scrutiny of through telescope george thinking must surely have misinterpreted message dived below to take look at barometer single glance at be sufficient to show that be not mistaken mercury having fallen full inch in little more than two hour when returned to deck again did immediately various ship be lying with head round compass merchantman showing sign that understood signal on board men o ' war crew be seen to be very busy reefing topsail topgallant royal mast yard being already sent down on deck captain leicester lost time in following example a far a be able to send down on deck of top hamper with limited crew be of course quite out of question called hand hurrying aloft set to work first to furl light upper canvas then to close reef topsail done ordered to furl main fore course be already clewed up part of crew be already on main yard remainder having completed reefing of fore topsail have descended from aloft forward be on way up main rigging to assist in stowing of main sail when heavy black threatening looking cloud bank lay stretched along western horizon be seen to suddenly burst open revealing broad copper tinted rent widened with alarming rapidity george quick eye detected change in instant knowing what meant that there be time to lose crew with loud shout of now then lad look alive aloft there toss up main sail smartly if be quick about may yet get gasket round before gale strike if be not will lose sail very probably of too men answered with cheery ay ay sir set to work with will leicester chief mate springing aft to wheel at same moment in meantime broad yellow rent in cloud to westward have spread very considerably vapour overhead have gathered way be scudding rapidly across sky in easterly direction already upon western horizon long rapidly advancing line of white foaming water gave unmistakable indication of close proximity of hurricane old tremendous now did what must to hurry up laggard by firing rapid signal gun crew of several ship waking up at last be seen swarming aloft when be too late to shorten aurora be lying with head pointed to southward with starboard broadside presented square to wind when gale first struck skipper anxious to save canvas if possible kept men aloft a long a dared urging encouraging with voice to exert to utmost when saw old tremendous bow under first stroke of blast a though meant to turn turtle altogether thought be high time to look to safety of crew make fast come down at once lad shouted down with for life canvas must take care of now startled by anxious sharpness of hail men hurriedly knotted gasket just a be scuttled in off yard like so many frightened squirrel be in main rigging when hurricane burst upon ship with terrific unearthly streaming roar rushed upon barque a if conscious of utter inability to withstand tremendous strength instantly went over on beam end with lower yard arm dipping into water men in lee rigging be almost completely sheltered by hull of ship have therefore little difficulty in holding on be obliged to remain where be lower portion of shroud being buried eight foot deep in water thus precluding possibility of men descending to deck whilst to go aloft again endeavour to descend to windward be a much a life be worth have practical illustration of in fact that two of men in weather shroud be actually torn from hold dashed with such violence against main top one man have arm other three of rib broken captain leicester on seeing near approach of hurricane have after hailing men to come down from aloft lashed wheel hard starboard then accompanied by mr bowen hurried away to foot of main mast where cast off starboard fore brace hauled in upon larboard until have braced topsail a sharp up a be possible for two men to get result of manoeuvre be that when gale struck aurora main topsail be shiver be blown clean out of bolt rope in instant a also be foresail partially stowed main sail whilst fore topsail be strongly filled at once being luckily new sail standing strain upon bravely quickly began to drag ship through water a soon a gathered way bow began to pay off presently recovered upright position with jerk snapped topgallant mast close off by cap wheel be now righted away aurora went scudding dead before under close reefed fore topsail only crew now made best of way down on deck head yard be squared effort be made to clear away wreck two of men volunteering for succeeding in dangerous task of going aloft to cut away fore main topgallant rigging george now have time to look about little observe state of affair prevailing outside own ship on side be to be seen ship men o ' war a well a merchantman scudding like own before irresistible fury of gale nearly ship have suffered damage of sort to sail spar rigging out of very few have come better out of first buffet than aurora here be to be seen craft with topgallant mast jib boom gone canvas hanging from yard in long tattered streamer there with nothing standing above lower masthead here barque with main yard carried away there stately ship with mizzenmast attached still towing astern crew busy cutting away at rigging held shattered spar here fine ship totally dismasted there now far astern more than one dark object lying low in water imperfectly seen through flying spindrift george leicester knew only too well be hull of ship have capsized whose crew must be left to perish miserably since human power must possibly save in hour like that soon became evident to crew of aurora though have so far escaped with comparatively slight damage must certainly not regard ship a by mean free from peril so long a remained in company of rest of fleet so many ship scudding together almost helplessly before fury of gale must not prove very great source of danger to other now that be no longer possible to regulate rate of sailing george soon found confronted with new anxiety that of being in danger of collision sea be rising with extraordinary rapidity various craft soon began to steer wildly sheering so rankly first to one side then to other that many of threatened to broach to altogether aurora be very smart little vessel under canvas a now proved by keeping pace with two large ship one of lay on port bow other on starboard beam so even be rate of sailing of three that of anxious a be to accomplish feat must draw away from others strength of gale be such that be equally impossible for to make to reduce sail there remained therefore maintaining exactly same relative position to other now sheering uncontrollably inwards so that man held breath braced for shock seemed inevitable under such circumstance must result in total destruction of ship anon surging a wildly off in opposite direction to add still further to captain leicester embarrassment trio of ship be rapidly overhauling fourth be wallowing along dead ahead of aurora be large craft apparently of about eight hundred ton measurement three topmast be carried away close off by cap wreckage be lying inboard cumbering up deck course staysail be blown to ribbon be steering so badly that be difficult to say where be going except that general direction be to leeward george saw must overtake vessel before getting clear of two already hampered so seriously catastrophe be inevitable speedily made up mind that aurora speed must be sufficiently reduced to allow of dropping astern into wake of one other of present consort only mean by under circumstance must be accomplished be by sacrificing fore topsail accordingly called for volunteer to assist in task mr bowen carpenter proffered service selecting latter requesting chief mate to take charge of deck superintend conning of ship george went forward followed by carpenter led way aloft now that be scudding before strength of wind be no longer felt to full extent be still powerful enough however to make journey aloft full of peril two adventurer be compelled to make frequent pause on way in order to avoid being blown out of rigging at length however reached yard producing knife began to work way outwards from mast one toward yard arm cutting seizing a came to task be soon accomplished for when seizing be cut wind saved further trouble by carrying away remainder sail gave one terrific flap sprung fore yard then tearing out of bolt rope went soaring away ahead of like flake of cloud thus relieved aurora speed sensibly diminished by time that george be once more down on deck be able by watching opportunity to sheer in under stern of ship have before lain upon port bow thus place aurora comparatively out of harm way be only just in time ship ahead be overtaken in sheering into new position aurora be compelled to shave close past stranger stern glancing up at a shot past with feeling of deep gratitude at escape george saw little crowd of passenger huddled together upon poop like frightened sheep be looking at aurora evidently fully aware of danger from have so narrowly escaped among george suddenly recognised face have more than half hoped must never see again face of successful rival a believed to be lieutenant walford george waved hand in recognition salutation be reluctantly returned then two craft separated not before george have have time to read name painted on stern princess royal of london chapter six mutiny on board princess royal now becomes necessary that must for short time forsake aurora follow fortune of princess royal at moment of making acquaintance of vessel very unsatisfactory state of affair happened to prevail on board be a have already seen large ship a ship went at time being of ton register capable of carrying close upon ton dead weight have saloon accommodation for forty passenger carried armament of twelve pounder upon main deck intention of owner being that must fight own way if necessary to fro across ocean so be independent of convoy on present voyage plan have to be abandoned activity of press gang consequent scarcity of seaman being such that cleared out of port of london with only thirty men in forecastle crew wholly inadequate to successfully defend ship of size in extremely likely event of encountering adversary be therefore compelled like many others to avail herself of protection of convoy upon arrival at plymouth like aurora received visit from man o ' war boat carried off four of best men reducing number of seaman to twenty six will thus be seen that when finally sailed out of english water be very short handed now a jack be to day so ever have be inveterate grumbler will find something to growl about be not to be wondered at therefore that with such good cause there must be constant dissatisfaction in princess royal forecastle though jack be always have be grumbler though probably nothing on earth will ever cure of habit for habit only be yet even where there be good sufficient cause for discontent little judicious management forbearance sympathy will prevent mischief from going further unfortunately however for princess royal connected with measure adopted by in authority on board for suppression of quickly discovered spirit of discontent be extreme opposite of judicious master a be sometimes case with master of very fine ship be haughty overbearing possessed of highly exaggerated opinion of own importance turning deaf ear to complaint of crew treating with impatience superciliousness of manner made heartily detested chief mate arrant sycophant taking cue from superior officer imitated to utmost extent of ability with like result while second mate be blustering bully whose great pride boast be that must always make one man do work of two hence from very commencement of voyage quarterdeck forecastle instead of pulling together making united effort to overcome difficulty of position rapidly grew to regard other with mutual feeling of enmity distrust matter have consequently a might be expected be steadily growing from bad to worse from first moment of sailing on day before gale very unpleasant incident have occurred on board arose in way on second mate watch being called one of men remained in hammock sending word by one of shipmate to officer of watch that be ill unfit for duty second mate instead of reporting circumstance to master having inquired into a be proper course jumped at once to conclusion that man be merely feigning sickness in order to avoid performance of proper share of work taking matter into own hand proceeded to forecastle armed with colt dragging unhappy seaman out of hammock drove on deck abusing roundly while in measured term setting to work to grease main mast from truck downward poor fellow who be really ill procured pot of grease started up rigging finding wholly unequal to task of going aloft descended again proceeding aft to poop went up to captain who happened to be standing conversing with of passenger requested to be released from duty repeating plea of illness second mate have however in meantime mentioned matter to captain putting own construction upon request be therefore harshly hastily refused refusal being accompanied by assertion that pleader be mean skulking mutinous rascal not worth salt lieutenant walford happened to be one of passenger standing near at moment a dissatisfied seaman turned away walford turned to captain said in army have very short simple method of dealing with fellow like flog assure prof never failing cure sick man heard remark so did man at wheel from moment walford be marked man captain turned round sharply do said then by jove will see if will prove equally efficacious here mr thomson have man seized up to grating give two dozen will be bound will be well enough to go aloft after if be will have couple of dozen thomson second mate at once sprang upon man seizing by collar ordered boatswain to call hand be done men be drawn up in waist of ship on lee side sick seaman be seized up at lee gangway in presence of on board except lady who retired to saloon in indignation disgust unhappy man received two dozen here further widening of breach between officer crew of ship took place individual appointed to administer flogging be boatswain mate great brawny cornishman named talbot individual when be ready bared muscular right arm to shoulder grasping cat firmly measured distance accurately with eye then stood waiting command to begin captain mate walford one two more of on looker smiled satisfaction a witnessed elaborate preparation for infliction of severe flogging captain willing to prolong man suffering a much a possible allowed long pause to ensue before giving word at length nodded to talbot who at once took step back giving tail of cat mighty flourish in air brought down upon man naked shoulder so gently that audible laugh broke spontaneously from entire crew at ludicrous sight captain turned livid with fury gasped what do mean by lubber lay on sir lay on hot heavy by jove will have seized up will give five dozen ay ay sir be imperturbable reply second stroke be administered with even more threatening preliminary than first with if possible even le effect put that fellow in iron at once shouted captain let have food except bread water until further order hear steward if have anything more will make responsible for will teach everybody else that when give order will have obeyed now rogers to boatswain take cat give that skulking rascal at grating two dozen so richly deserves boatswain stepped forward without removing jacket making other preparation sullenly took cat in hand chief mate meanwhile went off for pair of handcuff returning slipped on wrist of rebellious boatswain mate second mate who be still looking on noticing behaviour of boatswain ill concealed triumph of crew at talbot conduct now turned to captain said let play bobeun mate for once sir will be bound will give sneaking lubber proper 'lowance will never get from of shipmate can see very well do so said captain let have hot strong will show mutinous scoundrel that have in power to punish yet second mate waited for more whipping off coat rolling up shirt sleeve snatched cat out of rogers hand began at once to administer punishment first stroke drew blood forced shriek of anguish from quivering lip of victim sound extorted laugh of fiendish glee from captain second third fourth fifth lash followed in slow deliberate succession stripping off shred of skin lacerating back of sufferer until presented sickening sight at sixth stroke shriek ceased man head dropped upon breast at sight second mate seemed somewhat startled looked up inquiringly at captain go on said latter with encouraging nod of head go on finish dose be only shamming put little more strength into blow man will be bound can fetch howl two out of yet if feel inclined thus incited second mate actually proceeded with completed fiendish task at end of perspiration poured in stream down face so great have be exertion not cry must wring from victim in spite of effort poor fellow be insensible in condition be cast off from grating taken below to hammock there be doctor on board so unfortunate seaman be left to clumsy though well meant ministration of shipmate who did best must for captain refusing to supply salve lint in fact anything else with to dress wound at dinner that evening captain be urged by of passenger to represent to commodore of convoying squadron insubordinate condition of crew to request assistance however positively refused to do roundly asserting ability to command own ship a matter of fact only reason for reluctance to take step arose out of conviction that inquiry must certainly follow a to cause of insubordination from inquiry a be very well aware officer must hope for nothing complete revelation of own culpability at moment that course be being urged upon captain in saloon incident of flogging indeed whole question of treatment by officer be being discussed on forecastle by men singular to relate although talbot be believed by officer to be at instant in iron below if of have walked forward just then must have found snugly seated on deck free on fore side of windlass taking active part in discussion by time eight bell have struck have fully made up mind a to course of action assembly quietly dispersed next day be that on gale burst upon fleet on signal being made by tremendous to shorten sail prepare for bad weather princess royal be one of first to manifest sign of obedience be at time under stitch of canvas must spread not because be sluggish sailer for be reverse of because there being flat calm mattered not how much how little canvas be set must make possible difference in movement position of vessel captain seeing here fine opportunity to impose upon crew by way of punishment a put to officer great deal of unnecessary work ordered sail even to studding sail to be set for purpose a averred of giving airing first thing to be done in way of shortening sail therefore be to take in studding sail crew not being then aware of danger threatened ship proceeded to do in very leisurely deliberate fashion next task be to haul down smaller staysail then to clew up furl royal topgallantsails be aloft in act of stowing sail when hurricane burst upon fortunately saw approach in time to save leaving canvas drooping loose from yard hurriedly descended to deck by way of backstay be scarcely there when with first furious rush of wind three topmast went one after other in quick succession wreckage falling on deck lumbering fore aft crew regarded mishap with stolid satisfaction delay must occasion in prosecution of voyage be nothing to ship be stripped of everything above lower masthead leaving so much le canvas for crew to handle be cared about at moment little later on in day saw that if gale lasted of there be prospect loss of spar must result in separation from remainder of fleet a remarked upon to other men smiled grimly exchanged certain short pithy remark have be heard by occupant of saloon must have produced feeling of grave uneasiness crew be of course at once set to work to clear away wreck forthwith proceeded to do for own sake however rather than out of respect to captain order heavy spar dashing about deck with roll of ship in manner made positively dangerous to be there at by rest of fleet have passed out of sight to eastward scattered like chaff before angry breath of hurricane princess royal be left to fight out battle alone by dint of almost superhuman exertion shattered spar have be secured main sail cut away from yard such other disposition made a must allow of being kept dead before wind out of trough of sea during coming night when captain took seat at head of saloon table at dinner that evening be full of boastful exultation over prompt obedience of crew frequently congratulating passenger upon being on board ship in charge of such capable officer a mate of course did not actually say in so many word burden of remark amounted to nothing second mate have middle watch on eventful night just after have struck four bell wheel have be relieved be inexpressibly scandalised by hearing above howling of gale loud sound of singing jocularity on forecastle such sound be of so very unusual character on board princess royal coupled with circumstance of being uttered in middle watch of time in world be at first so astonished a to be quite unable to believe own ear very soon however be repeated one of men actually breaking into rollicking song burden of be invocation to let be jolly boy under conceivable combination of circumstance jolly scoundrel how dare so much a think of thing at time when be living under ban of officer severe displeasure ship perfect wreck aloft too be simply monstrous second mate righteous anger blazed up into full fury at once advancing to break of poop roared out in stentorian tone silence there for'ard what do mean unmannerly swab by disturbing ship fore aft with infernal howling at time of night unmannerly swab have not heard be so utterly lost to sense of respect due to officer a to pay attention to polite adjuration for song be continued with attempt at chorus second mate be not in habit of speaking twice to under did not attempt to do so now drawing knotted colt out of pocket descended poop ladder hurried forward a fast a heavy rolling of ship must permit determined to teach howling thief lesson must not readily forget meanwhile though be blissfully ignorant of fact sharp eye have be watching motion for time foot be scarcely on top step of poop ladder when jim martin owner of pair of aforesaid sharp eye exclaimed hurrah bully keep up here come shark have bolted bait without so much a smelling at group of men clustered on forecastle made slight restless movement a men sometimes will when be conscious of approach of great crisis in life voice of singer quavered merest trifle moment second mate be among eye flashing with anger colt uplifted to strike what deuce before must utter word leg be cut from under by sweeping blow of handspike fell with crash to deck back of head striking so violently on planking a to momentarily stun in instant belaying pin be thrust between teeth secured there with lashing of spun yarn then before have sufficiently recovered to realise position be turned over on face arm drawn behind wrist ankle firmly lashed together very neatly managed remarked talbot approvingly a gaze rested on prostrate figure on deck now mate what be next move come ned to boatswain be to be new skipper know give order cap'n will be yours obejently ' well then if be agreed upon shipmate first order be for one of tom to go aft into saloon knock at old man ' door note ask to come on deck at once a mr thomson have met with haccident two more of will wait for outside door when step out 'pon deck sarve same a have sarved respected friend here then do same with mr nicholls chief mate order be so skilfully executed that in quarter of hour mutineer have captain two aide prisoner bound helpless in hand without slightest alarm having be given to other occupant of saloon larboard watch be then called from first eager question when aroused became evident that seizure of ship be carefully planned affair of in forecastle be fully cognisant seaman having paraded on deck be with aid of lantern carefully inspected by boatswain to ascertain that there be recreant spirit among now that crisis have arrived man excepting half dozen left in charge of deck be provided with short length of well stretched ratline carrying proceeded in body to saloon entering state room surprised in sleep secured without difficulty whole of male passenger pinioned firmly then after depriving of such weapon a happened to posse locked up in own cabin lady be only disturbed so far a be necessary to make acquainted with fact that ship have changed hand that if have only good sense to acquiesce in arrangement must be perfectly unmolested cook steward be also called having be left in ignorance of proposed mutiny lest must inadvertently let secret slip addressed in somewhat similar term whereupon at once declared readiness to throw in lot with mutineer be forthwith sworn in note master of merchant ship be frequently spoken of by crew a old man whether year happen to be few many chapter seven lieutenant walford find in exceedingly unpleasant position on morning following seizure of princess royal by misguided crew day broke tardily revealing to mutineer wild threatening sky high increasing sea curling foam crest of raced after ship menacingly unbroken horizon round not solitary sail of description be visible be alone at mercy of towering mountain surge of gale howled deafeningly past sight on morning presented from poop of crippled ship be one to make stoutest heart quail to impress onlooker with overpowering sense of own insignificance compared with who hold ocean in hollow of hand of blasphemous arrogance of who must presume to take upon one of function of almighty in blindness of anger attempt to mete out to fellow men that justice be alone to repay yet such idea presented to mutineer if did man be careful to conceal from rest have be systematically down trodden ill treated from commencement of voyage life have be made burden to now having at last be provoked into throwing off of yoke of insupportable bondage thirsted for revenge upon author of misery a might be expected whole internal economy of ship be upset from moment that fell into hand of mutineer first act on morning in question be to transfer male passenger from cabin to forecastle to remove own belonging aft into state room thus rendered vacant lady of whom fortunately there be only dozen on board be permitted for present to retain possession of state room being given to understand however that be only upon express condition that be to make attempt to meddle with arrangement of mutineer to communicate in way with male passenger confined in forecastle arrangement completed rogers ordered steward to prepare serve to mutineer in saloon best breakfast that resource of ship must allow passenger in forecastle to be served with meal a ordinarily fell to lot of seaman while deposed captain two mate be to be left entirely without food of kind order be carried out to letter unfortunate lady being compelled to take seat a usual at breakfast table share meal of mutineer being over table be cleared spirit tobacco be called for rogers from seat at head of saloon table gave order that captain two mate must be brought aft put upon trial before court of whole crew there be one more a vote try at same time be sodger officer a got poor dicky rudd flogging observed one of men very well assented rogers bring along too mate intended to take by hisself matter bring whole four of 'em in few minute captain arnold nicholls chief mate thomson second mate with lieutenant walford be ushered into saloon handcuffed guarded by eight armed mutineer prisoner be before court announced talbot in loud voice anxious to make proceeding partake a much of character of ceremonial a possible four men be then ordered to range in line at foot of table order after little hesitation sullenly obeyed meanwhile mutineer having be served with tobacco brandy have lighted pipe provided man with stiff rummer of grog cursory observer must possibly have thought scene grotesque four men ranged at foot of table speedily detected in countenance of self constituted judge expression of stern determination caused heart to sink cheek to blanch with sudden fear low toned consultation now ensued between rogers nearest in talbot be summoned to take part at conclusion latter withdrew little apart rogers turning to captain said robert arnold yours be first case who be prosecutor be answered talbot on behalf of whole crew very good acquiesced rogers benjamin talbot state y'ur case upon talbot stepped up to cabin table said on behalf of whole crew of here ship princess royal charge robert arnold late skipper

charge in name of hand so if there be of yer a disagrees with what have said just stand up like men say so profound silence followed man making slightest sign token of dissent very well resumed rogers nobody seem to have anything to say agin charge now that agrees with talbot think a have stated case fairly hold up y'ur hand hand be at once unhesitatingly raised at arm length unanermous pronounced rogers now robert arnold have heard what be be charged agin yer have seen that hand of agrees that charge be just what have yer got to say in y'ur defence nothing answered captain except utterly disclaim right to sit in judgment upon to criticise action in manner whatsoever conduct be in last degree illegal unjustifiable be pack of mutinous scoundrel warn that terrible punishment will surely overtake if persist in defiance of authority if however will return to duty deliver up to duly appointed officer ringleader in disgraceful mutiny will undertake to overlook most serious offence so far a rest of be concerned hear what prisoner say shipmate observed rogers calmly do consider a have made good defence be opinion a have justified a think have hold up hand a think have stand up self constituted judge with one accord rose to foot that will do may sit down agin remarked rogers prisoner be found guilty next question to be settled be matter of punishment now there be many way of punishing man on more severe than others most severest a know be death death by hangin ' from yard arm a think prisoner arnold deservin ' of punishment hold up hand two three hand be hesitatingly raised after slight pause lowered again do understand a everybody think hangin ' too severe inquired rogers glancing slowly round table do a hand be shown well then let try something else perhaps shipmate of yer got hidee a 'd like to put afore court if so let hear what be think a must be no more desarves if be to treat for rest of v'yage a have treated from beginnin ' of 'd know then what be like if life long enough to get command of ship maybe will then know better how to treat crew observed one of men not at bad idee commented rogers have heard what phil say what d think o think be capical notion remarked one be agreeable intimated ay let see how like that sort of thing hisself remarked third so on hand intimating concurrence in suggestion wery good remarked rogers when have spoken then turning to captain said robert arnold sentence of here court be that be to be turned for'ard conwerted into hordinary seaman ' to do hordinary seaman dooties to receive just exactly same treatment a have sarved out to hand since here ship sailed from hold england namely more kick than have'pence lord have mercy on yer miserable carcase paused for moment on concluding in opinion impressive address then ordered that arnold must be removed to forecastle chief mate brought forward be done a nicholls chief mate stepped forward in answer to name ashy pale face trepidation of manner imperfect articulation showed to be labouring under very agony of fear charge against be also preferred by talbot in pretty much same language a be used by individual in charge against captain accusation in present case however being to effect nicholls occupying a did influential post of chief mate have instead of using influence with captain to make matter a agreeable a possible for men countenanced aided abetted encouraged superior in adoption of harsh tyrannical course of conduct upon charge be found guilty sentence be similar to of captain with addition that be to receive at gangway twenty five lash well laid on thomson second mate be now called forward yell of fiendish delight greeted a bully staggered up to cabin table fairly caused teeth to chatter with charge against be made by talbot who plunged eagerly into task with manifest gusto have be well suppressed in previous case indictment be very similar to preferred against nicholls in addition to that latter have be charged with talbot rapidly enumerated long list of wanton cruelty petty tyranny have sprung spontaneously unprompted a be from second mate own evil nature at conclusion of talbot address men without waiting for rogers to formally charge sprang eagerly to foot clamorously declared prisoner guilty question of punishment be then referred to by rogers moment that ceased to speak shout of death death hanging from yard arm rang through cabin let have five dozen at gangway before be up just by way of payin ' off dicky rudd debt with interest added voice suggestion be carried by acclamation miserable man be informed that sentence against must be carried into effect at conclusion of trial of fourth prisoner lieutenant walford who be now commanded to stand forward walford stepped up to cabin table with assumption of firmness be completely belied by ghastly pallor of countenance convulsive twitching of white lip grasping table with hand said in voice in vain attempted to render steady before proceed further in matter wish to remind that be merely passenger on board ship have nothing to do with quarrel may exist between officer have heard charge have preferred against be wholly at loss to understand in what way associate with can scarcely suppose imagine that passenger must regard a called upon to interfere in management discipline of ship for own part have always considered quite able to manage own affair quite capable of putting stop to injustice to might be subjected never appealed to for help therefore ought not to be surprised if have held aloof paused here for moment glanced anxiously round table to note effect of address seeing by stern expression on face of men seated at table that have wholly failed to make favourable impression hastily proceeded to add furthermore let remind that be officer gentleman wearer of most gracious majesty uniform in virtue of fact may claim do claim to be in sort majesty representative on board ship violence indignity offered to therefore be tantamount to offering same to king a be fully aware to offer indignity violence to king person be high treason crime punishable with death hope therefore will pause consider well consequence of hasty action present temporary assumption of power might betray into that before be too late before have too deeply inculpated yourselves will see advisability of restoring to freedom if expected appeal to be of benefit to be sorely disappointed for gloomy repellent expression on face of judge be only deepened by ill advised address moment two of complete silence followed utterance of closing word then rogers looking straight in face said well pris'ner have yer quite finished surely have said sufficient to demonstrate to impolicy a well a injustice of making suffer for fault of others exclaimed walford glad think so replied rogers with sardonic grin howsoever continued may keep y'ur mind easy about one thing ai goin ' to make yer suffer for fault of others a call will only be made to suffer for fault of y'ur own bad enough will find that reckon now ben what be charge agin one charge answered talbot with havin ' wilfully spoke word what got poor dicky rudd two dozen lash at gangway when poor feller be beost too sick to stand upright if have spoke a likely a not skipper have never have ' thought of so far a go belief that hand of be agreed that must therefore charge here pris'ner with bein ' man what acshully got poor dicky floggin ' hears pris'ner what crew have against yer what have yer got to say to interrogated rogers have evidently either forgotten about ill advised suggestion have believed crew to be ignorant of seemed to have thought that utmost extent of mutineer complaint against must be that have not interfered in behalf when therefore heard charge against realised fact that be wholly in power utterly at mercy courage at best of time be only of very flimsy unreliable character utterly gave way involuntarily turned eye for moment upon miserable second mate recalled fact that wretched man have be doomed to speedy degrading death by same individual who be now sitting in judgment upon shameful panic took possession of uncontrollable shivering fit seized frame be obliged to clench teeth together to prevent from chattering audibly glanced wildly round a if seeking for mean of escape after two three ineffectual effort to speak managed to gasp out brokenly through clenched teeth quivering lip give sacred word of honour gen gentleman be o only in jest nev never believed for moment cap t tain arnold must t take remark seriously a sure must n

spare life may do with what will ceased from sheer physical inability to utter word sinking upon knee stretched forth quaking hand in mute appeal for mercy disgraceful exhibition of cowardice be almost successful in winning for walford ignominious release mutineer be so unutterably disgusted that for moment impulse be to kick out of cabin like craven hound henceforward ignore existence impulse lasted only for moment recalled to mind insolent arrogance with same cowering creature have treated when deemed secure from retaliation determined that while miserable life be not worth taking must still receive so salutary lesson a must effectually deter from repetition of offence for remainder of life well shipmate exclaimed rogers breaking painful silence have followed walford shameful appeal what d think be pris'ner guilty not guilty guilty be unanimous declaration of assembly guilty in course be what be punishment to be death oh not death not death gentleman for love of god spare life be not fit to die be not indeed see how young man be why have never yet thought about dying mercy mercy shrieked miserable wretch a grovelled on knee before sought to clasp knee of man nearest attempt be repulsed with oath look of unutterable loathing kick brutal blow on mouth come lad speak up urged rogers wholly unmoved by interruption say what punishment to be let have done with be sick of here be well said talbot stepping forward wotes that prisoner be first made to go axe poor dicky pardon if ca get why let string up at yard arm to balance t'other one if dicky like to forgi ' e well will spare life redooce punishment to two dozen at gangway same a got for rudd make do rudd dooty 'til poor chap better arter prisoner can be set to do dirty work o ' ship how be shipmate ay ay ben will do bo will do fust rate may thank lucky star at bein ' let off so precious easy be rogers reply in remainder of men laughingly acquiesced then 'd better step way at once young feller remarked talbot to miserable walford see what can do with poor dicky if wo forgive yer mind be up with yer so saying opened door of state room in rudd be lying thrust victim into apartment closed door upon state room into walford be thus unceremoniously ushered be divided from saloon by bulkhead with door in upper panel of be fitted with sloping slat like of venetian window blind of present day be perfectly easy therefore for occupant of state room to hear passed in saloon vice versa a matter of fact rudd who be lying in berth broad awake have heard word uttered during course of trial shrewdly suspecting that shipmate be more anxious to thoroughly frighten than to actually hurt fourth prisoner having moreover trifling personal grudge against man who have secured for flogging determined to have little amusement at walford expense before according to pardon knew shipmate expected of when therefore walford staggered up to side of berth began eagerly incoherently to stammer most abject apology wildest prayer for forgiveness rudd simply growled forth oath impatiently flung over in berth with back to petitioner have intended effect of causing walford apology prayer to be reiterated with increased eagerness incoherence to hearty amusement of men in saloon at length talbot opened state room door thrusting in head said roughly here come out of mister have worried poor dicky quite long enough if wo forgive yer why wo that settle have have fair chance to see what must do with have failed decided to give yer quarter of hour time up so out come d 'ye hear next moment walford be seized by collar be being dragged roughly enough out of state room when rudd pretending to relent called out there take away ben be too hard on forgives just once hope wo never do again walford upon hearing word seemed to reprieve from very jaw of death broke away from talbot grasp rushing back to side of berth seized rudd hand kissed wildly burst into uncontrollable passion of tear in midst of

by terror of preceding half hour found in midst of by time more than half intoxicated seaman none of whom appeared to be paying much attention to for be talking loudly together discussing arranging detail of punishment of whom chose to regard a two chief offender men be greatly excited by potation in have freely indulged during mockery of trial in saloon difference of opinion on point be so strong that at one moment proceeding seemed more than likely to be diversified by pitched battle rogers however whose head seemed capable of resisting effect of almost amount of liquor interposed between belligerent by determined exercise of newly acquired authority by most frightful threat of chastisement personally must inflict on first man who ventured to disobey succeeded at length in restoring semblance of order achieved ordered grating to be rigged in larboard gangway when be done chief mate must be seized thereto order be speedily carried out when man nicholls stripped to waist be firmly lashed to grating in readiness to receive punishment rogers ordered that second mate must be brought to miserable thomson be thereupon led before more wretched spectacle than man presented must be difficult to find old blustering bullying overbearing manner have completely deserted fear of death be upon shivered like man in ague fit thomson said rogers addressing in calm matter of fact tone of voice a if what be about to say have reference only to trifling everyday affair be present at trial of man nicholls a stand seized up to yonder grating know punishment a be decided for to give be five twenty lash well laid on hears well laid on wery good now here same man nicholls seems to be in sort o ' way to blame for getting into trouble if 'd be proper sort of man understandin ' that

exclaimed thomson eye lighting up with gleam of fresh hope a thought detected in boatswain speech sign of relenting if mr nicholls have only put matter to a have just now put must never have given single man of slightest reason for complaint against never did anything of kind on contrary captain arnold encouraged to believe idle worthless lot of scamp to treat a such be plain simple truth swear wery good commented rogers then see thomson think alike namely that nicholls in kind of sort of way led into here miserable scrape that bein ' case think will be only fair if give twenty five lash well laid on that court have condemned to receive thomson looked eagerly into face of boatswain hoping that in proposal saw commutation of death sentence rogers returned gaze with look of grim satisfaction second mate mistook for half drunken leer of benevolence anxious above thing to propitiate man who undoubtedly held power of life death in hand excitedly exclaimed will do give cat will have cause to complain of way in will execute sentence right be bargain agreed rogers then turning to rest of mutineer ordered to fetch hand on deck to witness punishment hand exceptin ' lady mean 'd

lash well laid on so go ahead man let see if ca make yell bit louder than did poor dicky rudd thomson glanced at speaker nodded hope entertained of eventual escape from death have thrown into state of terrible excitement bordering almost upon madness ghastly pallor have vanished be now superseded by deep purplish tinge resulting from violent rush of blood to head vein upon forehead stood out like cord eye glowed like of wild animal jaw be flecked with foam streaked with blood trickled from wound in lower lip where in terrible excitement have unconsciously bitten through frenzied creature nodded comprehension of rogers command gathering up like animal about to make spring drew tail of cat slowly through closed left hand measured distance carefully making quick bound forward brought nine knotted lash down upon mate naked shoulder with demoniac strength seemed to literally bury in quivering flesh mate responded to with sharp yell be greeted by mutineer with mocking laughter rogers remarking to thomson that be pretty well know can do deal better'n that second stroke why go further with description of sickening scene let suffice to say that when inanimate body of mate be cast loose from grating bore appearance of having be mangled by teeth claw of savage beast rather than by human being so far so good observed rogers end act first now thomson be turn know strip boy without makin ' bone about let see if can take y'ur punishment better'n superior hossifer man spoke in rallying tone of such geniality that thomson grew more sanguine than ever a to remission of more serious part of sentence with ghastly grin in response to rogers patronising smile began to slowly strip even after drawing shirt over head summoned courage to walk up to grating leaning body upon to spontaneously stretch out arm leg to proper position when wretched man be securely spread eagled on grating talbot man be ordered to step forward administer flogging did relieving other at completion of dozen lash until entire fifty have be inflicted punishment be terribly severe intense excitement under second mate laboured enabled to retain consciousness throughout even to stand without assistance on being cast loose stiff reviver of grog be administered to by rogers order be then told to dress critical moment be now at hand when miserable thomson state of torturing suspense be to cease when must know for certain whether men be actually relentless whether having already wreaked ample vengeance upon must be content to ignore remainder of sentence after be more than half inclined to believe be nothing cruel hoax arranged beforehand for purpose of giving good fright hopeful a be however upon score must not help feeling terribly anxious be with utmost difficulty that controlled quaking nerve sufficiently to replace clothing without assistance during time that be thus engaged circle hemmed in be maintained unbroken mutineer watching motion with strong interest indulging freely in jocular comment jeering encouragement a winced shrank at chafe of clothing on lacerated back shoulder at length stood once more before fully clothed eye glowing like carbuncle visage blanched whole frame quivering with pain tensity of excitement suspense wery good thomson wery good indeed remarked rogers approvingly have showed great deal more pluck than of have ever give credit for so far if only behaves a well for next ten minute will feel quite respec ' for y'ur mem'ry now shipmate pris'ners for'ard go to carry out second part of sentence at word two of mutineer stepped forward placing one on side of second mate linked arm in led forward halting just beneath fore yard remainder of crowd following in body forming in circle round a before then at rogers command one of mutineer separated from main body in course of minute two be seen leisurely ascending fore rigging with tail block in one hand end of coil of light line in other thomson glanced upward at man like lightning stroke conviction flashed upon that doom be indeed sealed that death sentence passed upon be grim ghastly piece of jocularity hoax practised upon to test courage that be spoken in cruel bitter earnest for second two heart stood still head swam sight failed feeling of horrible nausea oppressed realised at last that be about to die that standing there on reeling deck a did in full

from earliest youth have chosen to follow evil rather than good have turned persistently away from right now there be time opportunity left for reparation utter blankness uselessness of life stood revealed to a one long unbroken unanswerable accusation in mad despair suddenly dashed aside two men who held in custody sprang with single bound to rail placing hand upon top of topgallant bulwark vaulted clear over before single hand must be outstretched to restrain with yell evermore rang in ear of who heard threw up hand vanished for ever into dark terrible depth of ocean grave little crowd of spectator stood for few moment silent almost stupefied at sudden tragic disappearance of second mate from midst occurrence be so totally unexpected that in measure sobered mutineer who regarded

to recover self possession be rogers who exclaimed with obviously forced laugh well curse if ai good un what in name of be foolish made man do that might have ' knowed a be only goin ' to frighten bit

horror remorse have yielded up possession of ship returned to duty boatswain taking in at glance critical state of affair fully realising own perilous position a ring leader in mutiny rallied men by exclaiming there now belay that arnold want none of preachin ' what be more wo have shipmate take notice of what say never meant to take second mate life 'd have stopped from drownin hisself if must so be just gammon to talk about bein ' murderer now march pris'ners down into fo cbe'le again clap bilboes on shut down scuttle upon then come aft into cabin hand will freshen nip proposal to freshen nip take glass two of grog be eagerly welcomed by mutineer who felt that must have something to dispel qualm of conscience so greatly disturbed in quarter of hour be with exception of two men at wheel one on poop who be supposed to be acting a lookout once more assembled round saloon table busily endeavouring to drown sense of guilt in flood of liquor lady who have long before effected retreat to own state room where have locked in be for time allowed to remain unmolested when libation in mutineer liberally indulged have at last achieved desired effect spirit of men began to rise one of most reckless of proposed that lady must be invited to grace revel with presence proposal be received with acclamation unhappy woman be forthwith ordered into saloon poor terrified creature at first made response hoping that if notice be taken of intoxicated mutineer must forget about leave in peace hope be of short duration for mutineer drinking deep rapidly soon grew excited finding repeated demand of avail staggered to foot breaking open state room door dragged forth victim compelling to seat at same table partake with of liquor with be bountifully supplied scene followed be simply too shameful for detailed description men inflamed by drink rendered reckless by feeling none of must entirely shake off that have already offended past forgiveness speedily grew more more outrageous in behaviour until orgie became one of such unbridled licence that one of lady young lovely wife of one of passenger imprisoned in forecastle in desperation drew pistol from belt of man nearest quickly cocking placed muzzle to breast pulled trigger sank upon saloon floor corpse shot through heart second fatality more sudden if possible than first brought unholy revel to abrupt conclusion mutineer thoroughly horrified at occurrence notwithstanding drunken condition staggering to foot with one accord making best of way out on deck where sought to sober by plunging head into bucket of water having to extent succeeded in endeavour next bethought of desirability of putting ship to right be still blowing very heavily sea be higher than ever dangerously so indeed a ship have more than once narrowly escaped being pooped sky looked trifle le wild than before glass be rising rogers therefore determined a first step to get up new foresail bend set sail room be accordingly opened then in pursuance of resolution to do a little work a possible prisoner in forecastle be brought up on deck ordered first to rouse out sail then to go aloft bend unfortunate passenger aided directed by captain at length accomplished though be at imminent risk of life violent motion of ship momentarily threatening to send unaccustomed a be to such work whirling off yard into sea sail being bent be loosed set close reefed after disabled ship not only steered more easily also became more steady further danger too of being pooped be at end spare spar be next cast adrift preparation made for getting new topmast on end a soon a weather must moderate sufficiently thus passed that eventful day walford be soon found to be so exceedingly timid when aloft that be not only of use there be absolutely clog hindrance to effort of others be accordingly relegated to ignominious post of cook mate in abundance of dirtiest work be carefully provided for on second day after assumption of new duty unfortunate individual while engaged in task of getting up coal from fore peak be unlucky enough to capsize lamp be using so set ship on fire instead of giving alarm instantly a ought to have done rushed on deck with intention of getting bucket of water endeavouring to extinguish fire unaided sooner however did make appearance than be hustled peremptorily off by cook upon errand when returned quarter of hour later forecastle be ablaze smoke just beginning to curl up through scuttle then indeed shouted fire with might at terrible cry hand rushed forward to find alarm only too true in first mad hurry confusion one seemed to think of inquiring how fire have originated walford be beginning to congratulate that happened complicity must not be suspected when talbot happening to run up against stopped abruptly exclaimed have lubber saw creeping up down forecastle ladder just now a gingerly a cat walking upon hot brick ought to know something about job by jove do too can see by blink of eye so out with long shore lantern jawed son of baked monkey to elegant adjuration walford began to stammer out exculpatory explanation however be abruptly nipped in bud by boatswain mate exclaiming there belay coil up slack of jawing tackle there be time to talk now tail on there try to make useful look out lad if fire get upper hand of curse if leave to roast in vigorous attack upon fire be speedily organised rogers talbot taking command of separate party be careful so to arrange that there must be possibility of prisoner concerting together in successful attempt to retake ship so far however a passenger be concerned appeared to be far too anxious to subdue flame to have time for other thought consideration through ensuing night curiously constituted party laboured in effort to get upper hand of fire have be allowed to obtain too firm hold upon ship before alarm be given much of cargo be of highly combustible nature though by zeal energy with hand worked succeeded to extent in retarding progress of flame when day at length broke became apparent to that ship be doomed when at last be compelled from sheer exhaustion to desist for time from long continued fatiguing effort fact have hitherto escaped notice became apparent that happily gale have blown out wind have already dropped considerably sea though be still very high no longer broke in former dangerous menacing fashion upon seeing rogers at once came to determination not to waste further labour in useless endeavour to save ship to devote energy to getting of boat safely into water mutineer be by time perfectly sober once more having shaken off with intoxication recklessness have engendered felt keenly anxious to escape responsibility of further waste of human life a usual in such case own escape not only from danger of being burnt with ship also from punishment due to misdeed be of paramount importance with before commencing therefore upon difficult task of launching boat rogers informed unfortunate prisoner that be willing to give couple of boat with necessary provision water if must individually take solemn oath never to reveal of circumstance connected with mutiny to say do anything must place mutineer within power of law if must do might have boat if not informed that must be left on board burning ship that mutineer must take such measure a must effectually preclude possibility of escape under circumstance prisoner have alternative to comply did launching of boat be then vigorously proceeded with task after immense amount of difficulty two three exceedingly narrow escape from accident of having boat stove swamped be at length satisfactorily accomplished after time be lost in provisioning manning a soon a boat be ready to receive lady be summoned from saloon to take place therein poor creature must hardly be persuaded in terror distraction to leave even such inefficient protection a saloon afforded so great be horror repugnance at idea of being brought once more even though might be for ever so short time into presence propinquity of mutineer when at length emerged from saloon standing upon wet slippery deck glanced first aloft at splintered spar tattered remains of sail end bight of rope streaming in wind then at great tongue of flame cloud of smoke enwrapped forepart of ship lastly over side at boat tossing like egg shell upon mountainous sea swept hissing past courage entirely failed be not until rogers growing impatient at delay strode up to gave choice of going instantly without further ado over side into boat of being left behind altogether that must be persuaded to essay dangerous adventure at length however by exercise of great care circumspection on part of concerned trans shipment of lady be safely effected then gentleman be ordered to go husband of unhappy lady who have be so cruelly driven to suicide have be for time eagerly looking about for wife not seeing at last made inquiry of other lady a to whereabouts grief when dreadful news of death be gradually broken to with gentleness of woman tender loving heart alone be capable be something pitiful to witness rushed into saloon entering state room in poor lady inanimate body have be reverently deposited by companion in misfortune flung upon knee by side of berth uttered alternately wildest prayer heaven must pardon act of desperation bitterest curse upon head of who have driven to be with utmost difficulty that be at last persuaded by captain arnold to bid eternal farewell to beloved remains to join rest of party in boat allotted to on hearing order given for gentleman to pas down into boat walford mingled with group pressed quietly forward to gangway having vivid remembrance of talbot terrible threat not caring to remind of by too obtrusive exhibition of anxiety to escape in consequence of still heavy run of sea several of mutineer rogers talbot being among be assisting at transfer when walford turn came to pas down over side be summarily ordered back by boatswain mate who gruffly exclaimed a eye fell upon quaking lieutenant here stand back will yer turn ai come yet walford at once fell back in state of most painful trepidation still hopeful that must be allowed to go with rest when passenger however have passed down side order be given for to cast off at once did ignorant forgetful of fact that one of number still remained behind walford be about to rush to gangway hail fast receding boat when ever watchful talbot caught by collar flung from with ah must yer kick sent unfortunate officer sprawling upon deck be now turn of mutineer to take to boat be not long before stood in gangway with bag containing few belonging in hand waiting to be passed in turn down over side rogers rapidly ran eye over satisfied that everybody be present then began to call out name in order in be to leave ship when one boat have received complement shoved off walford once more pressed forward half wild with anxiety now begged in piteous term that might not be left on board a now seemed to be actual determination of mutineer upon talbot lost patience with seizing once more by collar thrust before into saloon exclaiming a did so now look here meddlesome young jackanapes there be be enough blood spilt on board ship already chiefly in consekence of havin ' shoved in oar where be wanted advisin ' skipper to flog sick man want to have to shed more understand wery well then stay in here until that there clock have marked off good half hour arter that may come out do best can for there be plenty o spar knockin ' about deck here can lash together make tip top raft out of 'em upon can go for cruise on own account if show ugly head outside here cabin before half hour out damn if wo lash neck heel together heave into middle of fire there for'ard comprenny so saying coolly shifted key from inside to outside of saloon door slammed latter turned key then wretched walford heard heavy tramp of footstep upon deck rapidly growing fainter more faint a walked away chapter nine driven to madness a key turned in lock walford sank down in state of semi stupefaction upon one of saloon sofa listening like one in dream to distant sound of men voice occasional tramp of foot a mutineer passed one by one down ship side into boat few minute more sound ceased lifted up head listening eagerly must hear nothing save dismal creaking of bulkhead moaning of wind monotonous swish swish of water washing across deck outside with roll of ship dull hum crackling of flame a slowly ate destructive way further further into heart of doomed craft be actually gone asked be possible that be left alone absolutely alone on burning wreck thousand of mile from nearest land drifting knew not whither at mercy of wind wave with hope of rescue with certainty that in day two at most fabric bore must be so completely enveloped in flame kindled by own clumsiness that must no longer be tenable only alternative open to must be that of perishing in fire flinging into sea there to battle despairingly for extra hour two of life must not believe must not believe possible that men must be found so inhuman a to leave fellow mortal in so desperate strait be only trying a have tried that poor fellow thomson if must have patience to wait until stipulated half hour have passed must find still there waiting to receive into boat laughed aloud a thought what fool have be to allow to be terrified even for moment laugh be so utterly reverse of mirthful so harsh ghastly that stopped abruptly startled by hideous strangeness of sound then rose crept on tip toe towards saloon door on reaching crouched down applied first eye then ear to key hole key have be removed from lock shield have fallen down over opening outside so that be unable to see anything must detect sound indicative of presence of others on board once twice indeed thought caught sound of whispered voice just outside door must not be sure about matter in agony of uncertainty crept back to sofa to watch lagging minute hand of clock wait for expiration of half hour oh what weary time be that for lonely watcher a sat there with hand tightly locked together frame quivering with anxiety apprehension eye fixed upon inexorable minute hand must not hasten movement though life might be dependent on what if men must grow weary of waiting thousand horrible fancy crowded in upon until in distraction groaned aloud suspense became unendurable in anguish started up to burst open saloon door learn worst at once remembering talbot threat more than half believing to be capable of carrying into execution turned back again fell to pacing rapidly to fro whole length of saloon instead at last at last half hour of penance be over be free once more dashed at locked saloon door frantically hammering upon with clenched first until knuckle streamed with blood shouted eagerly talbot talbot half hour be up so open door please let out there be good fellow then applied ear to key hole listening eagerly for first sound of approaching footstep five second ten second twenty thirty minute why did not come be possible that have not heard applied mouth to joint between door jamb again shouted talbot talbot talbot until voice cracked with strain put upon still answer sound save wail of wind wash of water creaking of ship timber good god be really gone be after actually left there to die alone seized handle of door tugged at fiercely desperately with strength of madman stout lock stood firm defying utmost effort then suddenly remembered that captain cabin be situated on other side of ship with one door opening into saloon other out on deck with single bound wild cry crossed saloon laying hand upon handle of door of captain cabin turned door swang open bound be at outer door be locked twist of handle stepped out on deck with water surging splashing over foot what cared then for trifle be not even conscious of swiftly gaze swept round deck be empty in instant be at gangway peering over side boat there nothing empty tackle of quarter boat alternately swinging in air trailing in water with roll of ship where be boat have towing astern of course must simply mean destruction to if attempted to remain alongside in so heavy sea in frantic haste scrambled up poop ladder rushed aft boat be gone then be absolute fact that be left there alone powerless doomed to watch with horrible fascination steady relentless approach of grim enemy in most terrible form to suffer while in imaginative anticipation agony of thousand fiery death oh god be too much mercy mercy with demoniac yell stood clutching tugging at hair with hand teeth clenched eye fixed almost bursting from socket foam bubbling from lip raving madman terrible state of distraction endured for nearly hour then specie of numbness seized upon faculty anxiety vanished found thought straying away fixing upon veriest triviality conjuring up again before mental vision act word have never recurred to since day on have be done said mischievous practical joke played off upon unlucky school fellow mess room jest tattle thousand other absurdity at laughed aloud then disconnected word phrase rushed helter skelter through seething brain having meaning yet causing keenest annoyance because believed have heard before be anxious to connect with circumstance of utterance there be one in particular especially tormented go for cruise on own account go for cruise on own account brain reiterated with merciless pertinacity what did mean where have heard word before who have uttered felt absolutely certain that at time other have heard that phrase spoken that have intimate connection with that somehow concerned vitally there be something else too said at same time something about about what be something about ah yes spar raft spar raft go for cruise on own account what must mean finally gleam of reason returned to clouded mind realised dimly that be of utmost importance that must construct raft go for cruise on own account having at last grasped idea rose from seat upon have flung upon seemed to to have be sitting a long a ever must remember proceeded to carry out sauntering leisurely off poop descended to waist of ship repeating eagerly over over again word spar raft lest must forget there be several spare spar of various size ranging from topmast down to studding sail boom lashed to deck on side of main hatchway deliberately set to work to cast adrift with considerable difficulty at length succeeded in accomplishing task result being that spar be set rolling athwart deck with roll of ship nothing daunted by however dashed recklessly in among escaping heaven know how from incessant danger of fractured limb managed to drag out one after other launch overboard several of lighter spar having commenced work now toiled persistently on allowing pause rest until have disposed of spar unaided strength must allow to move then panting breathless reeking with perspiration walked to side peered over spar be nowhere to be seen in madness have never occurred to to secure with rope have consequently drifted astern be of course tossing of mile away in wake of ship somehow loss of spar caused distress indeed a matter of fact have again forgotten about raft have continued to labour on merely because have not occurred to to stop now that have stopped however began to be conscious not only of fatigue also of hunger for have tasted no food for nearly twenty four hour have be working hard through night so made way by instinct into saloon thence to steward pantry where found abundance of food attacked ravenously then after satisfying hunger bent step in direction of own state room entering flung upon bed soon sank into uneasy restless sleep meanwhile wind have be steadily dropping sea going down at same time when just before sunset glorious orb burst through dispersed curtain of storm tattered cloud have for so long time overspread sky golden ray fell upon princess royal now no longer rolling gunwale under swinging with slow stately motion over long swell still drifting lazily to eastward bow heading now way now that fore mast burned through towing over side flame in complete possession of a far aft a main mast walford sleep if such must be called lasted through night until just before dawn then overpowering heat smoke loud crackling roar of flame fierce ruddy light streaming into saloon through open state room door aroused sitting up in berth looked around in bewildered way passing hand impatiently over brow repeatedly a if striving to recall distinctly remembrance of something vaguely haunting memory ever eluding mental grasp glancing vacantly around red glare of flame fascinated gaze turned to watch leaping flickering flash of light a came went with sway roll of ship red began to mutter red a blood blood who said that have be cause of bloodshed who dare to say that be hand have splashed wall floor with such hideous stain have see how leap dance rise fall place be full of horrible horrible be there to taunt to reproach to accuse say did not do be not to blame how must know that what be let think blood be upon hand whose hand not mine swear must not do have not nerve courage for blood be upon hand who said that be not said to stay be to blame be fault ugh what terrible thing be to see standing there with rope round neck to know that be going to take away life for fault perhaps must never have committed for to feel have not courage to intercede in behalf to stand there quaking with fear whilst be driven to death did not drive to be have control over ah never tried to save yes yes be coming be that thomson be calling sprang out of berth making way through captain cabin passed out on deck first faint ray of approaching dawn be lighting up eastern horizon saw not be effectually hidden from sight by dazzling brightness of flame dense cloud of smoke went rolling heavily to leeward before now scanty wind fire have made steady progress during night hull forward being burned down nearly to water edge while flame have extended to after hatchway main mast burnt through at heel have gone by board fallen forward into fiercest of fire where be rapidly consuming luckily for wretched walford ship be once more dead before wind flame be fanned forward have head be in opposite direction retreat must have be effectually cut off a be heat be so intense that instinctively avoided by springing up poop ladder making way a far aft a possible arrived at extreme end of poop stood gazing intently down into black water presently began muttering again yes said pointing down into hollow of swell a came creeping up after ship be spot where went down saw be standing near bulwark when sprang eye followed heard dying cry saw last agonised upward look of despair a went down with plunge into hollow between wave water closed over head for ever for ever yes surely yet what be white gleaming object there now glaring up at from beneath water be be face of dead man have see be beckoning to then be voice heard calling to listen what be did call thomson will not answer be tired of calling white ghastly face be still there see there too be beckoning hand be summons must obey at moment weird plaintive scream of sea bird came floating down out of grey shadow of dawn walford starting violently stood for moment in attitude of rapt attention cry be repeated glared wildly round for instant then screaming hoarsely come come sprang over guard rail into sea chapter ten strange rencontre left aurora a reader will remember at moment when by merest hair breadth be enabled to avoid what must have be terribly disastrous collision with ill fated princess royal on day when hurricane burst with such destructive effect upon outward bound fleet deprived of fore topsail little barque be soon left astern by two unwelcome neighbour fleet rapidly dispersing now that be no longer possible to regulate speed of several craft composed by crew found comparatively speaking alone there being only twenty sail in sight from deck night be most anxious one for captain leicester gale being heavier sea considerably higher than have ever before witnessed aurora however proved to be capital little sea boat riding over great liquid hill light dry a gull when at morning broke revealing only two sail in sight george felt so easy in mind that did not hesitate to go below seek in comfortable berth hour two of rest so greatly needed first stroke of hurricane have be a be generally case worst for about hour have blown with frightful disastrous fury a have already be described after lulled somewhat then have again steadily increased accordingly when captain leicester went on deck at noon found gale still gathering strength sea higher than ever sky looking more threatening than remembered to have ever before seen ship be scudding under bare pole behaving capitally too george saw that if sea rose much higher there must be great danger of being pooped so like people on board unfortunate princess royal roused out new foresail with very great difficulty got bent set reefed sail dragged little barque along at tremendous pace from time there be further danger of being pooped overrun by sea on third day gale broke by sundown weather have so far moderated a to permit of aurora being brought to wind hove to manoeuvre george be most anxious to accomplish since ship have for over seventy two hour be running to eastward directly away from port at rate of ten knot hour giving over seven hundred mile of extra distance to make up aurora remained hove to during whole of night at eight bell next morning made sail under single reefed topsail course stretching away to northward westward on port tack continued on tack day went about at end of second dog watch george object being to work way back to spot a nearly a possible where fleet have separated there wait two three day if need be in hope of falling in with bulk of again captain leicester have of course taken full advantage of return of fine weather to repair damage crew have be busy during whole day getting two new topgallant mast aloft rigging bending new sail in place of split blown away so on aurora be consequently when night fell ataunto once more stranger looking at must except for new look of of spar canvas never have suspected that have have wing clipped at be standing to southward westward on port tack under stitch of canvas must draw wind be failing fast sea have long since ceased to break there be now only occasional white fleecy comb to be seen on crest of wave ship be gliding gently along with slow steady rhythmical rising falling motion over long heavy swell at rate of five knot in hour skipper be in excellent spirit at having escaped so well so cheaply from fury of hurricane remained on deck until midnight chatting with mr bowen chief mate relief watch have just be called george be waiting to accompany mate below when attention be suddenly attracted by curious appearance in sky to windward be still cloudy low down on horizon about two point on weather bow noticed that cloud be lighter brighter in tint than anywhere else look bowen exclaimed do see that peculiar looking cloud away there on horizon just over cat head what be meaning of mate looked in direction indicated more mature experience at once suggested explanation look to said a if there be something afire over there here tom to lad belonging to relief watch who have just come on deck slip up a far a fore topmast cross tree see if can see anything out of common away there on weather bow ay ay sir answered lad in moment be dancing nimbly up fore rigging form just dimly discernible in dark shadow of sail presently hailed from cross tree ca see nothing sir sky away over there look uncommon bright seems to flicker now then a if there be big fire burning under will do can come down again answered chief mate then turning to george said depend upon sir there be ship afire away over there well be steering course a will take pretty close to if so be a there be one suppose sir will feel like giving of overhaul wo most certainly answered george earnestly will at least ascertain whether there be human being on board mr ritson to carpenter who since cross impressment have acted in capacity of second mate steer present course please a long a wind will allow crack on can a soon a burning ship whatever be be fairly in sight give call then descended to cabin in five minute have fallen into state of blissful oblivion at eight bell four o'clock be ritson knocked at george state room door after calling chief mate said can see flame smoke from deck sir though ship be still hull down have be up in fore top howsoever with glass make out to be large ship close upon thousand ton must say ca see people on board of ca make out sign of boat be ablaze from for'ard right aft a far a main mast toppled over fell for'ard while be lookin ' at fancy people must have left sir right ritson answered george will be on deck in minute two within stipulated time captain leicester made appearance on deck proceeded at once to fore top where with aid of glass made careful inspection of burning ship well mr bowen said when have completed examination be once more down on deck be a ritson say there be sign of human being on board have looked long carefully at be quite sure must have seen people moving about have there be will stand on a be going however cross stern will then perhaps get chance to make out name somehow have familiar look with a though have seen before wonder if be in fleet like enough sir answered bowen be right in track of 'em maybe be one of slow coach a run away from possibly answered george abstractedly then two fell to pacing slowly fore aft from main mast to taffrail in persevering way be so characteristic of seaman aurora be now sliding gently along at speed of about four knot with sail set must draw gradually crept up closer closer to burning ship meanwhile be slowly drifting to leeward watch on deck be clustered together in body forward watching unusual sight ship being now about point on lee bow about mile distant suddenly there be loud shout from followed by cry there be somebody still aboard burning ship sir george mate who at moment be walking towards taffrail with back towards burning ship turned quickly at cry former hastily seizing telescope lay ready to hand on skylight swiftly brought to bear there sure enough standing right aft on raised poop must be distinctly seen solitary figure apparently that of man seemed to be gazing intently into water astern pointing gesticulating be evidently wholly unaware of approach of aurora yes said george truly enough there be man on board doe not seem to have seen yet perhaps glare of flame have dazzled eye just step down into cabin mr bowen if please bring up couple of musket will fire one after other report will call attention to fact of presence mate turned away to do george bidding have hardly disappeared down companion ladder when skipper who have telescope once more at eye saw figure start look behind a though have heard alarming sound then spring in apparent terror into sea be jumped overboard sir reported men forward who be now eagerly watching action of stranger ay ay answered leicester see have one of call watch below rest of lay aft here clear away starboard gig cast off lashing get ready for rousing off gallows into water gig have be hanging at davit ever since aurora cleared out of dock at london have be destroyed when ship be thrown on beam end in hurricane men have be so busy on apparently more important duty that have have opportunity of getting boat ready for service hence there be now considerable amount of delay in launching of boat george intended to despatch in search of swimmer mr bowen soon returned to deck with musket handing one to george retaining other fired one after other in rapid succession hoping by mean to attract unfortunate man attention show that help be near george then sprang into mizzen rigging looked anxiously out over glittering surface of sea in effort to catch glimpse of man must happen to be still above water be not however until aurora be fairly crossing wake of burning ship by time have drifted considerable distance to leeward that be successful then indeed did for instant detect small dark object on crest of sea standing out in bold relief against bright ruddy reflection of flame in water beyond almost at instant that caught sight of lost again a disappeared in hollow of swell then once more rose into view clearly unmistakably head of man right see exclaimed now then mr bowen be boat ready be going to poor fellow assistance so back main topsail if please send boat after a quickly a can a last word left george mouth hand rose above head body curved over towards water in instant shot downward out of rigging swiftly a sea bird making swoop entered water without splash on coming to surface captain leicester struck vigorously out at once in direction of burning ship knowing that man sought be exactly in line with that must probably not see until be close upon swam steadily on not hurrying husbanding strength a much a possible in about ten minute caught sight of object of be in search manner in that object presented to view be so startling that george first impulse be to turn round swim back towards aurora with speed impulse however be only felt to be instantly overcome man be suddenly revealed within six foot so of george grasp a latter rose upon crest of sea instead of swimming a george expected must be unfortunate creature be lying on back ghastly white face upturned to sky eye fixed staring with terrible indescribable expression in tell at once unmistakably dreadful tale of madness very naturally hero felt little doubtful a to expediency of placing within grasp of madman therefore before closing with exclaimed in loud cheery voice hillo there be tired if so just say word will drop alongside lend hand for visible effect speech have on stranger might a well have be stone deaf for vouchsafed not slightest notice george shouted again with like result then still feeling very doubtful a to best mode of proceeding struck out swam quietly round ghastly floating figure stroke two sufficed to place in position a enabled at last to get clear distinct view of stranger feature fully illumined by glare of flame instant recognition followed walford exclaimed then without moment hesitation dashed up throwing upon back seized rival by hair drew into position a permitted of taking walford head upon shoulder supporting high enough above surface to prevent sea washing over so suffocating walford offered resistance gave not faintest sign of being aware of george presence there two lay quietly floating on bosom of long heaving swell until boat came to assistance conveyed on board aurora on reaching ship george have rival promptly stripped rubbed vigorously down comfortably bestowed in own berth well warmly wrapped up in blanket with tom price one of forecastle hand very smart intelligent young fellow to watch over after skipper gave little attention to own comfort finally went on deck once more being by time too late to think of turning in again by time george regained deck aurora have crept to distance of about four mile from princess royal unfortunate craft be by time blazing fiercely fore aft fire having at last reached store room in there be considerable quantity of highly inflammable material hour afterwards powder magazine almost ship of size in day be provided with magazine exploded charred fragment of half consumed timber be widely scattered over now sleepily heaving surface of sea alone remained a relic of once noble stately ship destruction of have be last link in chain of disastrous occurrence resulting primarily from overbearing tyrannical imprudent behaviour of officer with appearance of sun above horizon cloud gradually disappeared wind dropped surface of ocean became like heaving oil aurora losing steerage way rolled almost gunwale to with canvas flapping loudly monotonously against mast about two bell nine o'clock one of hand upon being sent aloft to grease down reported sail in southern quarter on usual inquiry being put to a to what made out to be replied that be small topsail schooner small topsail schooner muttered george wonder what can be can not remember having seen such craft in fleet ritson to carpenter who have charge of deck do remember having seen topsail schooner among fleet sir ca say a do answered ritson believe there be such craft sir smallest a remembers be that purty little brig painted white down to water line perhaps recollects sir yes said leicester recollect craft perfectly well a far a memory serf be a say smallest craft in company conversation here dropped for time george resuming somewhat dejected saunter fore aft from main mast to taffrail half unconscious whistling for wind in have before be indulging pursuit of monotonous uninteresting occupation be interrupted by steward who requested to step down into cabin to take look at man a be picked up morning a seems to be took bit worse sir george at once went below found walford sitting up in berth muttering to disconnectedly occasionally addressing with great earnestness watchful tom whose horror stricken face plainly revealed that patient random observation have be of somewhat startling character on entering state room leicester at once addressed walford asking whether felt better unfortunate man glanced for moment in george face with air of semi recognition immediately passed away incoherent muttering went on again a before be just how have be goin on for last half explained tom talkin ' about murder hangin '' being left to burn in ship be enough to give one 'orrors to listen to george sat down by side of cot listened patiently for nearly hour to walford rambling talk although be unable to make out from clearly connected story heard enough to give shrewd idea of truth to convince that terrible tragedy of kind have occurred on board ill fated princess royal patient at length grew calm once more lying back upon pillow seemed inclined to sleep upon george quietly rose went on deck again to see how matter be proceeding there a meditatively made way up companion ladder must not help thinking of singularity of last meeting between rival comparing with one have occurred on lovely june evening on road to stoke a two men stood there on white dusty road with ray of declining sun darting down upon through foliage of overhanging tree a walford told story of just concluded engagement to lucy how little thought george must either of suspect that when next came into such close contact must be literally on bosom of broad atlantic up borne by nothing save restless water poor leicester be greatly disturbed by singular unconscious claim upon hospitality have so recently arisen be a generous hearted man a sun ever shone upon ever ready to give liberally ungrudgingly to one who seemed to be in need somehow wished that in present instance have fallen to lot of one else than to play part of rescuer benefactor that rescued individual have be one rather than walford fact be that wanted to forget if possible keen bitter pain of disappointment now presence of unhappy guest have brought back to must keep in poignant remembrance a long a two must remain together then bethought how selfish feeling have be allowing to indulge how utterly have forgotten that matter be one with lucy happiness must be inseparably connected fate providence rather a reverently corrected have in very great measure confided that happiness to keeping by delivering into care man upon whom have bestowed priceless treasure of heart best love a thought solemnly vowed that must honestly strive to prove worthy of trust that must be to lucy lover brother ay more than brother that must nurse tend restore to reason if god willed in case watch over protect at cost of own life even if need be until must restore to arm of woman who be impatiently awaiting at home safe return well being have be confided to a sacred trust murmured in conclusion please god will prove worthy of with resolution dismissed subject temporarily from thought turned attention once more to affair of ship glancing aloft then round horizon observed that have fallen flat calm moreover there be immediate prospect of breeze sky be clear deep blue in zenith merging by imperceptible gradation into delicate warm grey at horizon water be absolutely without ripple there be not so much a faintest suggestion of cat paw on glassy surface save for long sluggish sweep heave of swell a undulated past ship caught reflected varying tint of sky must have be difficult to detect presence of water at at distance of more than few yard from ship aurora be still rolling sluggishly on sleepy swell dazzling white canvas flapping sling truss of yard creaking with roll men rendered languid by heat be making such show a be able of being busy on various odd job about deck aloft man at wheel have lashed be leaning upon more than half asleep ritson apparently for want of something better to do be seated on main topmast cross tree with ship telescope in hand scrutinising motion of distant schooner whose tiny royal be now visible from deck gleaming white a snow on extreme verge of horizon noting thing at glance george turned to saunter aft thinking that on perfectly calm day with such still water might by leaning well out over taffrail get glimpse of ship bottom see whether have fouled at whether copper showed sign of wrinkling arrived at taffrail leaned well out over peered down into water first thing attracted notice be deep pure beautiful ultramarine tint of water a gazed far down into unfathomable depth next be presence of long greyish brown object under ship counter have escaped notice at first in consequence of being in deepest shadow of hull moment sufficed to satisfy that be huge shark a creature caught sight of with barely perceptible movement of fin backed out foot two from under ship a if in preparation to make dart at in case must fall into water george shuddered at thought of what might have be walford fate have monster be in neighbourhood of ship few hour earlier sliding body gently inboard again leicester turned to dozing helmsman exclaimed here ned rouse up man there be big shark under counter so get out shark hook ask cook for piece of good fat pork muster watch aft in readiness to haul inboard in case can coax into swallowing bait chapter eleven suspicious sail man hurried away joyously to do george bidding hailing comrade aloft to knock off work come shark fishing sea dog aloft there a soon a have placed sufficiently respectful distance between skipper there be sport pastime in sailor will engage more eagerly than in attempt to capture shark regard creature a worst most relentless enemy never willingly let slip opportunity to catch destroy one frequently venting hatred upon unfortunate fish when caught in utmost refinement of cruelty accordingly sooner be ned hail heard than dropping incontinently work happened to be engaged on whole watch ritson included hurried down on deck aft to taffrail to take share in sport ritson by virtue of superior rank assumed lead at once a matter of course taking hook with swivel chain attached piece of fat pork three four pound in weight from now lively wide awake ned called out for bit of stoutish line busying meanwhile in burying hook cunningly in bait in order that shark might not see for be well established fact that monster unless very hungry be acute enough to refuse bait if hook be not well hidden line in shape of gaff topsail halliard fall hastily unrove for occasion be soon forthcoming hook being at last baited to second mate satisfaction bent on to chain now stand clear commanded ritson a prepared to pitch bait overboard stand clear of yer when give word to haul in ' walk away for'ard with line bring head out of water long steady pendulum like swing two of bait followed then away went out over stern into water with splash leicester who be leaning over taffrail watching proceeding with greatest interest saw great fish turn like flash rush to spot where bait have fallen turning over on side a did so hurrah bite be got shouted one of men eagerly spoke rather too soon jack shark be not to be caught quite so easily instead of opening great jaw swallowing bait hook at gulp a be expected stopped dead in rush began to poke bait about suspiciously with point of shovel shaped nose finally with contemptuous whisk of tail left resumed former position under ship quarter great be disappointment of younger hand at failure ai hungry explained one ai contemptuously retorted just drop overboard try bo ' why 'd take sou'wester water boot down main hatchway of his'n without winking then come back axe for more 'taint mate be waiting for somebody most likely for poor chap a skipper picked up mornin ' come stow rubbish exclaimed second mate how do expect be going to catch brute if stand there palavering like so many fish wife be enough to frighten away altogether clap stopper on jaw tackle now of give chance to play bit speaker thereupon by sundry dexterous movement of wrist imparted gentle wriggling motion to line in turn conveyed corresponding motion to bait latter being slowly drawn through water at same time be too much for shark equanimity made dash at bait still refusing to swallow however second mate then tried virtue of few quick jerk upon bait a though drawing away from creature have effect of causing to turn once more on side make snap at actually taking into mouth still must neither swallow close jaw upon unresistingly suffered to be jerked out of mouth again will have yet boy ritson exclaimed pay out line to bare end be done shark keeping close to bait turning over over with nose persistently refusing to take now walk away steadily for'ard with line stand by for surge be next command away went men dragging line after towing bait through water shark followed closely up at last just a pork be being dragged out of water altogether made determined jump at swallowing hook together next moment men be brought up standing by tremendous strain on line a hook buried barbed point in creature body while water be lashed into foam splashed clear in over barque taffrail in fish frantic effort to free hurrah exclaimed ritson now have lad hold on inch of line will break away from yet bear hand here one of take spanker sheet throw running bowline round line so can get down over fin be sort ned let get into jaw cleverly done haul taut now have safe lead sheet for'ard let hand tail on to will run up out of water in on deck bowline in end of sheet having be successfully passed over fish shoulder under fin rope be laid along deck watch leaving one by one line to hook be attached got hold of sheet then with joyous shout of stamp go boy walk away with dragged monster still struggling furiously up out of water in on deck over taffrail for moment huge fish lay perfectly still then began to plunge about lash right left with tail in manner caused whole ship to resound with terrific blow rousing watch below causing to tumble up en masse to ascertain nature of disturbance tail exclaimed second mate warningly if of chap catch smack with across shin will snap like pipe stem where be cook axe question be promptly answered by appearance of cookie sable visage beaming eyeball rolling with delight a danced nimbly about deck dodging stroke of terrible tail with gleaming axe upraised in readiness to deal blow at first opportunity at length there be momentary pause in tremendous struggle pause of snowball black cook who go to sea seem to be dubbed snowball promptly availed quick flash of axe blade in sun dull crunching thud back bone be severed at junction of tail with body lightning like stroke of long keen knife followed severed tail be flung quivering aside a long thin jet of blood spouted out from body broadly staining snow white deck plank shark have plenty of fight left in still a one of men speedily discovered when on thrusting handspike into great jaw strong stout wooden bar be promptly bitten in two here lay hold two three of capsize ordered ritson must make end of beast of yer will get hurted yet can see now then a three of men seized shark by enormous fin one two three over with with cry of yo heave hearty drag great fish be turned over on back then snowball stepping forward once more placed astride creature with quick powerful stroke of knife slit open belly so put end to suffering so tenacious of life be that even after removal of vital organ heart be seen to be still expanding contracting continued to do for fully five minute after being taken out of fish head be next cut off back bone removed for preservation a curio after mutilated carcass be thrown overboard deck washed down ritson did not wait for completion of operation leaving superintendence to mr bowen who like rest of watch below have come on deck to see what be cause of unusual tumult retired once more with telescope to former post in main topmast cross tree resumed scrutiny of strange schooner george noticed vaguely wondering what have so greatly excited second mate curiosity glanced in direction to telescope be pointing to find to surprise that upper half of stranger topsail be visible from deck why ritson hailed schooner must have little air of wind surely be nearing perceptibly ritson entirely contrary to nautical etiquette made reply to skipper hail remained with eye immovably glued to tube for full minute longer when gently closed instrument descended slowly to deck arrived there walked up to captain leicester first glancing cautiously round to make sure that one be within ear shot murmured in low voice be heading a straight for a can steer sir with six sweep out three of side mean sir that skipper want so badly to get alongside of that be noways particular about trouble take to bring here george gave low involuntary whistle of astonishment be queer news indeed remarked after contemplative pause think then ritson that craft be rover sir more le answered second mate ai french be certain ai got look of besides johnny must ventur so far a in craft of size why ai more than about hundred twenty ton at very outside be rover be what be craft with low beamy hull painted black tremendous long spar canvas with just end of h'ist to give glass said george will go a far a cross tree take look at second mate handed over telescope skipper proceeding aloft soon saw quite enough to satisfy that ritson conjecture a to character intention of schooner be only too likely to prove correct descending once more to deck held hurried consultation with two officer result of be determination to fight to last gasp if crew be only willing to stand by must be necessary to ascertain feeling upon subject before anything must be done so being then within quarter of hour of noon george chief mate went below for quadrant took sun meridian altitude on bell being struck to denote hour of noon termination of morning watch captain leicester gave word for hand to muster aft lad said george when men be standing before in obedience to summons have called here in order may communicate to very disagreeable piece of intelligence briefly be strange schooner yonder be very suspicious looking craft mr ritson who have carefully examined through glass be quite of same opinion about namely that be pirate have look of one conduct tends greatly to confirm in suspicion for have rigged out dozen sweep be sweeping a straight down for a can come now lad want to know what propose to do in event of suspicion proving correct will allow to come alongside throw bloodthirsty crew in on deck to cut throat a if be so many sheep will fight for life take chance of being able to beat off there be few minute of anxious consultation among men then ned stepped forward a spokesman of party asked what must advise to do sir what do think of doin ' sir if may make so bold a to axe mr bowen mr ritson have resolved to fight a long a can raise hand in self defence answered george advice to be to do same alone three men can not hope to do much with aid certainly must not despair of beating off yonder schooner even though be full of men if worst come to worst find that must die will be far better to do so with sword in hand than to be slaughtered in cold blood yes yes be true none o that for thank'ee sundry other exclamation of concurrence followed conclusion of skipper speech then came very brief consultation finally ned once more stepped forward said have agreed sir a be in right of about fightin be quite ready to stand by yer hand of do best very well said george then will lose time in making ready for defence mr bowen will have up brass long nine pounder be down below provided for just emergency a ay ay sir answered mate in cheery tone of voice spoke volume a to confidence in ability to beat off pirate if such schooner must prove to be then turning to men continued now then of whip tarpaulin off after hatchway lift off hatch mr ritson will be good enough to rouse out couple of fourfold tackle get made fast aloft will require chain strop also be right lad off with hatch will soon have old barkie in fighting trim inspired by mate cheery manner men worked with hearty good will in le than hour have long nine pounder on deck mounted on carriage tackle hooked on gun loaded cutlass pistol distributed boarding pike cast loose everything ready for stubborn resistance preliminary arranged george chief mate made way aloft a far a main top to watch approach of suspected schooner have by time crept up to within about nine mile of aurora be still heading straight for barque telescope enabled to see that six sweep be being vigorously plied long steady swing perfect time be maintained in working of conclusively showing that be being handled by strong gang of men why must be full of men long heavy sweep must never be kept going for so great length of time remarked george to mate will have to devote attention to sweep in first instance can see if be only fortunate enough to knock away two three of will at least delay approach if breeze must only spring up smart a schooner look must not despair of being able to show clean pair of heel ay answered bowen be going to have breeze by by just way want too can make out upper edge of cloud bank rising now above horizon to east'ard there if can only keep yonder cut throat crew at arm length until get wind if will only come down upon pretty fresh when doe come think a say sir may give handsomely slip with view of getting still clearer idea a to possible advent of desired breeze mr bowen forthwith undertook journey a far a main royal yard upon comfortably established with one arm round royal pole whilst carefully studied aspect of weather a carefully scrutinised horizon to see whether there be other craft in immediate neighbourhood other sail excepting schooner however be in sight in direction having at length formed tolerably clear opinion with regard to weather descended again to main top remarked to george schooner must be coming up at rate of about three knot by look of yes about answered george be about eight mile off now must say continued bowen yes about eight mile returned george with eye still peering through telescope then remarked mate will take matter of two hour forty minute thereabouts to get alongside by time unless be greatly mistaken first of breeze will have reached hope will get before then because in light wind doubt what that craft must sail round round only let come strong enough to oblige to stow royal will bet old hat that can walk away from be afraid sha' scrape clear without finding out weight of shot can pitch at if lad be only steady when powder burning begin sha' feel noways very greatly concerned with summing up of case mr bowen dropped into sitting posture alongside commander letting leg dangle down over outer edge of top filled pipe proceeded to regale with what chose to term two whiff half chapter twelve marine duel result two occupant of main top maintained position therein keeping watchful eye upon movement of schooner until craft have approached to within about three mile of aurora when descended to deck captain leicester remarking to mate a latter swung down off rail think mr bowen may a well run up ensign perhaps schooner will return compliment oblige with sight of colour of bunting ay ay sir answered mate walked aft got out ensign bent on to halliard ran up to mizzen peak where hung in drooping fold swaying listlessly with sleepy roll of ship for time there be response on part of schooner held steadily on way straight for barque six long sweep plying a vigorously a ever churning up glassy water into long line of miniature whirlpool gradually diminished until finally subsided on side of gleaming wake breeze breeze here come at last thank god ejaculated bowen who have be for time anxiously regarding rising bank of greyish cloud to eastward a spoke faint barely perceptible breath of cool air fanned face of anxious watcher on deck of aurora be gone again cat paw two momentarily ruffled surface of water here there only to leave a glassy a before then came puff lasted just long enough to trail out ensign for instant to rustle royal then away on extreme verge of eastern horizon gleaming water assumed light blue tint gradually spread creeping slowly down towards two vessel blue on horizon insensibly darkening while conveying thrice welcome intelligence that breeze be slowly steadily freshening yes said george here come sure enough in few hour will have plenty of by look of sky stand by brace lad let go haul yard round be lively about can not spare time to be taken aback just now be right men well there with fore brace well with main brail in mizzen stow haul down mizzen topmast staysail now feel breeze hard up with helm man let wear short round let go lee main brace round in to windward gently now not too quick that be well catch turn with after brace then square fore yard well with fore brace belay coil up ah expected that latter exclamation be evoked by boom of gun from schooner turning eye in direction george saw white smoke floating lazily away from to leeward then white jet of water started up a shot came flying towards barque then finally scurrying splash a iron messenger swept along surface of water sank falling short by about hundred yard at same moment heavy sweep be laid in schooner sail be trimmed a if by magic to coy breeze head paid off a swept gracefully round upon course must enable to intercept aurora tiny ball went soaring aloft to main topmast head breaking abroad a reached truck square black flag fluttered threateningly out fit emblem of character of who sailed beneath not quite close enough mr rover remarked bowen cheerfully a shot sank into placid depth of ocean now gently ruffled by increasing breeze will return compliment sir not just yet answered george be still long way off can not afford to waste single ounce of powder shot be time that must have everything ready to carry on fight in earnest so must ask mr bowen a most reliable man have on board to go below see to passing up of powder will never do to run risk of having explosion in powder magazine very well sir 'd have greatly preferred to have be on deck to take fair share in fighting be ready to do duty wherever may choose to order said chief mate a walked away aft with rather rueful face on way below to magazine schooner finding that be not yet within range remained silent for next five minute then george who be keenly watching saw flash puff of white fleecy smoke once more ball came bounding over water straight for barque will reach time thought skipper be right shot striking water about forty foot from side of aurora then bounding harmlessly over except for hole punched in main try sail in passage now lad said george be turn mr ritson run out gun if please show what can do in way of shooting ay ay sir answered ritson gleefully water ship steady altogether be capital day for kind of work man tackle there run out muzzle to right trifle not too much so well there elevate muzzle leetle more there that will do will try now then snowball let have loggerhead ' ned just freshen that priming bit now stand clear lad tom touch off when give word then stooping down glanced along sight for instant two finally gave word fire at word tom promptly applied loggerhead there be ringing report a smoke cleared off shot be seen to strike water close alongside schooner next instant white scar in bulwark attested ritson skill a marksman showed that shot have taken effect hearty cheer from aurora crew manifested elation at lucky hit george who be watching schooner through telescope quietly remarked thank ritson be capitally aimed must have done execution among crew of craft too for there be great deal of confusion among on deck see ah there fire again once more shot came flying straight for barque once more whistled harmlessly over just touching main mast a passed inflicting injury on spar capital practice on side remarked skipper coolly six inch further to right gentleman must have plumped that shot right into main mast now try again ritson aim for spar sooner can cripple better will be out chance of getting clear of without loss to ourselves again aurora long nine rang out sharp report for reason probably from over eagerness on part of second mate shot flew wide passing twenty yard astern of schooner bad luck to exclaimed discomfited ritson impatiently run in gun lad be smart with be sort sponge well out that will do now in with cartridge three stroke with rammer now home with shot run out gun again bear hand with priming iron ned muzzle to left little more yet well with now tom stand by fire vessel fired at precisely same moment schooner shot passing in through aurora bulwark close to gun making splinter fly in direction one of latter grazing captain leicester cheek drawing blood very fortunately beyond further damage be done on other hand aurora shot much better aimed time cut weather whisker stay on board schooner compelled to at once keep dead away before wind in order to prevent loss of jib boom well shot exclaimed george enthusiastically fore main brace lad port helm man to helmsman let come up full by ' round in upon port brace fore aft board fore main tack aft with sheet cheerily lad if be smart may get out of gun shot before can repair damage well there of now to gun again lad let treat to dose of same sort men sprang about deck like wild cat in elation excitement did work of at least three men yard be braced up almost a soon a ship must luff to wind tack be seized boarded with irresistible strength energy sheet flattened in in considerably le than five minute aurora be rushing along on bowline with lee covering board nearly awash clear glassy surge spouting up on side of cutwater foaming away from sharp bow with hissing roar be sweetest music just then to ear of delighted crew now old barkie travel exclaimed exultant ritson unhook gun tackle sea dog rush gun aft will try shot out through stern port time at moment boom of gun from schooner be heard next moment shot came flying through aurora rigging cutting main brace pennant passing through head of foresail lee main yard arm at once flew forward throwing main sail aback of course seriously interfering with barque flight up with helm keep away until main sail fill again commanded george haul inboard brace one hand get marlinespike jump aloft to make splice be smart lad there be great harm done ritson be in meantime busy aft with gun presently fired again pitching shot fairly on schooner forecastle where of crew be busy with cut stay on board aurora main brace be very soon spliced after captain leicester have mizzen gaff topsail in short stitch of canvas must draw set to freshening breeze then inquiry having elicited fact that tea supper a men termed be ready ordered crew to knock off take meal whilst have opportunity george two mate have meal served on deck top of skylight doing duty for table be about half way through with when pirate schooner be seen to once more haul wind in pursuit however gave immediate apprehension a be far out of gun shot breeze be still steadily freshening aurora be plunging along at racing pace over short sea have already be raised with wind humming merrily through rigging great foaming surge hissing buzzing under lee bow streaming out in long trail of bubbling froth behind be going to have fresh breeze to night think sir remarked chief mate a helped to slab of salt junk if will only come fresh enough to oblige to stow royal think that on easy bowline best point of sailing will be able to fairly run away from chap yes said george believe will if can only get weather will give advantage over in matter of speed will feel very much inclined to turn table on give good wholesome lesson struck that gun threw shot considerably further than hers did be sure did emphatically corroborated ritson 'd be doin ' real service to give piccarooning rascal thorough good drubbing appeared however a though fortuitous combination of circumstance hinted at by captain leicester be not to be for before long became evident that schooner notwithstanding freshening breeze increasing sea be slowly steadily gaining on barque stern chase be long chase schooner while repairing damage have not only be left astern have also be compelled to run considerable distance to leeward so that when sun set short brilliant tropical twilight faded out of sky be still six mile distant broad on aurora lee quarter with setting of sun there came still further freshening of breeze laying barque down upon side until lee covering board be buried water spouting up through scupper be washing deck on lee side almost up to coaming of main hatchway wind be making weird wild music a swept through tautly strained rigging topgallant royal mast be whipping bending like fishing rod with pitch becend of ship while straining canvas towering away aloft toward dusky heaven stood a firm steady a though moulded in iron watch below be in hammock enjoying repose have earned by day of unusual exertion watch on deck be also by george express command snatching such weazel like sleep a must be obtained consistently with holding of ready for prompt call in case of emergency night wore slowly on young moon have be hanging like silver crescent low in western sky sank beneath horizon spangled heaven became almost wholly obscured by broadening mass of dusky vapour swept rapidly athwart there be light enough however to render schooner easily distinguishable with aid of night glass george after attentively watching for more than hour came to conclusion that aurora be at length holding own will clew up furl royal if please mr ritson said to officer of watch be getting uneasy about stick must be most unfortunate to lose just now believe will do just a well without royal a with in fresh breeze how be steering pretty easily to man at wheel sir be reply be gripin '' awful take half turn of wheel to keep out of wind then will take in gaff topsail mizzen topmast staysail a well said george that weather helm must make at least knot difference in sailing sail be accordingly shortened result proving justice of captain leicester surmise for there be perceptible diminution in speed of barque on contrary in half hour skipper second mate be convinced that aurora be gradually creeping away from pursuer spread of canvas be then further reduced by hauling down of main topgallant staysail furling of fore topgallant sail finally flying jib main topgallant sail be stowed after two craft appeared to maintain a nearly a possible equal speed through remainder of night next morning dawned with coppery red tint in eastern sky streaky look in cloud be presage of windy day schooner be about six mile distant bearing three point on barque lee quarter royal topgallant sail flying jib be stowed by way in be lying over to breeze dense shower of spray be incessantly flying in over weather bow be evident that be still carrying canvas must stagger under now said george to first mate when latter came on deck to take charge at eight bell think have fellow in power can do pretty nearly what like with in breeze with sea can outsail with water pouring in upon forecastle will be difficult for to work long gun to advantage believe unlike have fixed there on pivot so propose to let creep up within gun shot astern of fight there where advantage will be on side accordingly a soon a crew have taken breakfast captain leicester ordered jib fore topmast staysail sheet to be hauled over to windward in order that barque speed might be reduced without shortening sail so exciting suspicion in mind of pirate of desire on part of aurora to renew action manoeuvre have desired effect shortly before noon schooner once more opened fire shot flying past aurora at distance to leeward of be doubtless in consequence of violent motion of schooner being much smaller vessel than barque be much more lively in sea way gave aurora advantage over schooner a be at once apparent when ritson recommenced gun practice first shot passing through schooner topsail in close proximity to mast firing soon became pretty animated on side aurora having however decided advantage over antagonist in rapidity precision of fire thus while at end of hour only one of schooner shot have touched barque that without doing material damage own sail rigging be pretty well cut up several shot hole being visible in canvas whilst number of end bight of rope be seen streaming to leeward in wind at length lucky shot from aurora struck schooner fore mast just below eye of rigging wounding spar so badly that almost immediately afterwards went carrying away main topmast with in instant whole of pirate top hamper be towing to leeward causing tremendous confusion on board placing craft almost completely at mercy of antagonist hearty cheer burst from lip of aurora crew at sight of disaster on board adversary disaster of george be determined to take fullest advantage now lad exclaimed be at mercy will inflict on lesson be not likely to speedily forget clew up course then let go topsail halliard double reef fore main topsail a come down stow course men sprang aloft with alacrity to execute duty on return to deck sail be further shortened until barque be under double reefed topsail fore topmast staysail only when wore round stood directly for disabled pirate schooner long gun being run forward pointed out of foremost port on lee side firing resumed in very short time be close to schooner round round george proceeded deliberately to sail maintaining steady fire upon meanwhile pirate schooner however though disabled be by mean rendered harmless a captain leicester soon discovered to cost for a be sailing past to windward at distance of about fifty yard to very great surprise crew suddenly threw open three port in weather bulwark next moment three six pounder shot came whistling through aurora rigging cutting rope two happily missing spar gear connected with canvas be set at same moment ritson fired nine pounder struck schooner be listing over to leeward with weight of wreckage exactly between wind water now that two vessel be so close together became apparent that captain leicester have be perfectly correct in estimate a to strength of schooner crew for whilst strong gang must be seen hard at work clearing away wreckage of spar sufficient number of men be still available to work broadside gun to windward did with great animation a long a be possible for one of to be pointed at aurora be not for long however for barque holding on way wore round a soon a be out of musket shot passing across schooner stern swept up again to leeward ritson while keeping up animated fire from long nine evidently doing tremendous execution among thickly clustering men on schooner deck who whilst barque be to leeward be unable in consequence of wreckage to return more than very ineffectual fire at length after hour of work black flag have fallen with main topmast be exhibited above bulwark of schooner for moment lashed to boat oar be then dropped again in token of surrender mean that have struck sir may depend o exclaimed ritson walking aft a if for further instruction yes have doubt doe replied captain leicester if expect that fact of striking will be of benefit to be woefully mistaken be altogether too short handed to attempt to take possession of a prize a to leaving alone in order that may repair damage have opportunity of renewing depredation be not to be thought of be not entitled to of privilege of ordinary enemy will extend such to be simply pirate one of pest of high sea be duty of honest man to destroy if have opportunity that concluded grimly be what intend to do keep up fire sir aim so a to strike between wind water if possible will sink before have done with ritson accordingly returned forward communicating captain determination to crew resumed work at gun with stern set face of men who recognised that have very terrible disagreeable duty to perform from responsibility of dared not shrink a soon a schooner crew discovered that surrender have not be accepted reopened fire a well a must from own gun man be seen to jump into main rigging run aloft with something rolled up under arm proved in minute to be black flag ascending a high a lower masthead coolly climbed up on cross tree standing there deftly rapidly lashed to masthead after deliberately descended rigging again defiantly shaking fist at aurora a did so about ten minute after occurrence of incident there followed of infinitely more thrilling startling character aurora have worn round be once more passing schooner ritson be in act of glancing along sight of gun preparatory to giving order to fire when without slightest warning premonition of dreadful tragedy about to take place dazzling flash of light be seen on board schooner spar deck be upon went soaring in fragment high into air side be rent open in tremendous cloud of smoke with deafening report devoted craft disappeared barque whole frame jarred canvas flapped violently careened perceptibly under terrific concussion dead silence seemed suddenly to have fallen upon scene of strife then came splash splash of falling fragment into water around accompanied by heavy thud of others descending upon barque deck water seethed leaped madly for few second on spot where schooner have minute before be floating then subsided once more into long steady regular run heave of sea be over whether explosion be result of accident deliberate act of desperate reckless commander be of course impossible to ascertain very probably be latter whatever cause of pirate schooner be more few rent blackened timber with here there mangled remains of what have few minute before be human being floating on surface of heaving water be remained of crew george leicester grim deed of retribution be complete chapter thirteen surprised terrible ending to sin stained career murmured skipper of aurora with white set lip when first shock of surprise consternation have passed away sufficiently to allow to speak up with helm man continued to seaman at wheel up with helm keep away upon west by south course will get away from accursed spot a soon a possible man brace fore aft if please mr ritson square yard secure long gun then let hand make sail then going to companion passed word below for mr bowen to close magazine come on deck five minute later chief mate emerged from companion walking up to george observed well sir have managed to make pretty effectual end of buccaneer see yes answered george gravely schooner struck be much too short handed to take retain possession of such craft a so a did not feel justified in leaving at liberty to resume nefarious business continued to fire into schooner intending to sink be of opinion that captain recognising fact that escape be hopeless blew up with own hand hoping to involve in destruction also be terrible thing mr bowen to cause loss of so many life be convinced that only did duty now a there seems to be immediate prospect of falling in with fleet again propose to take full advantage of fine fair wind proceed upon voyage so please pack on ship everything will draw then let men clear up deck knock off work have have two very fatiguing day have fought well let get rest possibly can between to morrow morning when sun set evening aurora be flying to southward westward a if instinct with life thrilling with horror at terrible achievement before freshening gale at rate of fully twelve knot per hour with studding sail set on side alow aloft while crew assembled on forecastle discussed in low tone incident of fight skipper with hand clasped behind bent head furrowed brow held solemn self communion upon same subject george leicester now found at liberty to attend to guest spent almost whole of leisure time by side of walford cot for first week after arrival of latter on board aurora very little change improvement must be detected in mental faculty seemed to be almost paralysed must lie in cot for hour at time with wide opened eye staring into vacancy blank expressionless look upon face betraying utter inactivity of mind then there must occur short period during seemed that memory be struggling to re assert must glance vacantly round cosy sleeping cabin in found look of mild surprise must overspread feature must pas hand over brow with action of one who be trying to remember something then must recur vacant period during time never expressed wish uttered single coherent word only occasionally when memory be struggling to regain seat must mutter few incoherent word that of murder being sometimes repeated in low tone of suppressed horror dozen time together appetite appeared to be good since ate drank freely be offered if food be withheld a sometimes be by way of experiment at captain leicester order never asked for evinced surprise uneasiness at non appearance about tenth day however after one on have be picked up george thought detected sign of improvement period of thinking be more frequent more prolonged once during day when skipper entered cabin walford noticed opening of door turning eye in direction regarded george for moment with steadfast inquiring look recognition if such there be be momentary only hand be pressed meditatively to forehead next instant then blank look returned next day witnessed recurrence of same symptom added to there seemed to be vague sort of semi recognition of george voice for whenever latter spoke walford must look up with anxious questioning glance a though have idea that have heard voice before finally on same evening when george mr bowen be in saloon together chatting over tea table after cabin door being open so a to insure current of air through apartment walford who have be asleep suddenly started up in cot with exclamation surely be leicester voice george heard ejaculation springing to foot stepped eagerly into sleeping cabin saying of course be dear fellow how do feel now better better repeated walford have be ill have where be how did come here where did come from what string of question said george with laugh worry by trying to guess answer to of just now have be ill thank god be getting better again when be well enough to listen will tell know until then must be satisfied with assurance that be a safe a man can be in tight little ship with fine weather plenty of sea room safe ejaculated walford ah be safe have horrible feeling of dread upon sensation of frightful danger hovering over feeling that unless can do something know not what hideous disaster will happen shuddered violently a word left lip then turning suddenly to george grasped convulsively by arm exclaimed in agitated tone oh leicester tell what be that threatens have to guard against if know what be there said george soothingly worry about more did not intend to say word about for time to come since find that remember something about will tell much have be in very great danger indeed be long past be now on board ship more than thousand mile away from danger threatened a safe a man can be in mid ocean thanks thanks believe muttered walford with sigh of ineffable relief a sank back upon pillow so be in ship eh be strange ca imagine there will not worry more about matter will look after know be thorough good fellow leicester be almost sorry now that um what be now well dare say will remember further on say old fellow what time be nearly dinner time must think for feel most confoundedly hungry be nearly dinner time answered george delighted to find so great improvement in man have vowed to protect restore if can hold out for half hour think may promise decent meal by time will do yes oh yes dare say can manage to survive until then murmured walford whereupon skipper hurried away took counsel with steward result of be that in little more than stipulated half hour walford be served with best meal aurora resource must furnish from time grew steadily better in day two be able to leave cot to indulge in bath clean shave hour so on deck half sitting half reclining in hammock skipper have ordered to be slung for from spanker boom suffered from extreme bodily weakness doubtless result of frenzied exertion on board ill fated princess royal be of course evil rest nourishing food must speedily remedy did not recover use of reasoning faculty for time after period now referred to then recovery be only partial a for captain leicester be in high spirit breeze lasted fresh for four full day after encounter with pirate schooner so fresh indeed once twice be obliged to furl royal in order to save stick barque no longer compelled to moderate pace to of slowest sailer in large fleet maintained steady speed of twelve knot during whole of time thus fully making up in skipper opinion for time ground lost during gale encouraging to look forward hopefully to accomplishment of quick passage state of thing be too good to last on fifth day wind fell light on sixth failed altogether leaving aurora helpless in doldrums being at time about thousand mile from cape haytien six hundred from island of saint thomas be particularly vexatious because captain leicester considered that have breeze continued fresh favourable for only twenty four hour longer must in probability have run fairly into north east trade must then have be able to calculate duration of remainder of voyage with almost mathematical exactness what be still more to purpose must have be sure of breeze that fair one for remainder of way however there be help for have to take wind weather a came crew have busy time of box hauling yard now way now that trimming sail to passing breath of capricious air after trouble accomplishing only dozen mile during whole day on next day be same excepting that proceeding be varied by tremendously heavy thunder storm followed by instead of wind captain leicester so earnestly hoped for perfect deluge of rain lasted for rather more than hour be regular tropical downpour water descended not in separate detached drop in sheet splashed down on deck a if from cataract advantage be taken of copious downfall of pure fresh water to refill water cask after scupper be plugged wash deck tub filled hand stripping to skin indulged in unwonted luxury of thorough ablution in warm soft water finishing up by rousing out wash clothes treating to same beneficial process storm cleared away a rapidly a have worked up leaving sky absolutely cloudless water thrashed down by rain until be smooth a polished mirror heat be intense men notwithstanding refreshing bath went about work languidly perspiring at pore be positive relief to to see sun at last go down behind gleaming horizon greater relief still when hour later faint breeze from eastward came creeping over water barely filling aurora light upper sail gave just sufficient way through water to allow of head being kept in right direction at eight o'clock evening mr bowen retired to cabin being then watch below at nine skipper followed example ship be then stealing along through water at speed of about two knot royal topgallantsails more lofty staysail just asleep topsail alternately filling out flapping again to mast with barely perceptible swing of ship over low long sleepy heave of swell course drooping heavily uselessly from yard sky be a clear a bell to use favourite metaphor of ritson not trace of cloud being visible in part of vast sapphire vault stretched overhead spangled here there with few star of first magnitude with moon nearly at full hanging in midst like disc of burnished silver pure soft light flooding sea with dazzling radiance causing sail to stand out like sheet of ivory against deep dark blue of sky there seemed to be immediate prospect of change in weather george be thankful that ship be really at last moving once more though ever so slowly in right direction fervently hoping that breeze must last long enough to run into trade went below with easy mind after giving ritson usual stereotyped order to call must untoward event occur after overpowering heat of day comparative coolness of night be unspeakably refreshing with door skylight stern window open thorough circulation of fresh air through cabin several occupant be soon wrapped in sound dreamless slumber be even more pleasant on deck than be below for hull of ship have during long scorching day absorbed considerable amount of heat gave off again during night causing cabin forecastle to be unpleasantly warm even after possible mean have be adopted for thorough ventilation whilst on deck full benefit of breeze what there be of be to be obtained such at event be mr ritson opinion a sauntered listlessly fore aft between taffrail main mast glancing now aloft at idle canvas then into binnacle then over side at tiny bubble creeping lazily past ship side finally forward to where man on lookout must be seen seated upon rail facing ahead with arm folded back leaning against great wooden stock of one of anchor form showing black a of ebony statue against brilliant silvery sheen of moonlight on water remainder of crew be dimly visible seated on deck in black shadow of bulwark tiny red spark two indicating that of be solacing idle hour with whiff two of fragrant weed officer who be strict disciplinarian must have forbidden smoking in watch on deck must have insisted on whole watch keeping constantly on move a safeguard against dozing ritson be not strict disciplinarian liked to spare men unnecessary labour of kind a there be sail trimming to be done just allowed to rest weary body a much a must must have liked greatly to rest own weary body too for indeed felt to be almost torture to be pacing ceaselessly to fro there on deck hour after hour pulled out watch hand indicated that be ten minute to ten must be full two hour more before must be relieved there be most inviting looking chair standing on deck near skylight captain leicester have be using during day poor ritson thought how pleasant must be to rest tired limb in for few minute then took stroll round deck just to wile away time to make sure that watch especially lookout be not caulking shadowy figure scrambled somewhat hurriedly to foot on approach giving rise to just faintest suspicion that perhaps after might have be shutting eye to keep warm lookout man seemed unconscious of presence be humming scarcely above breath air of homely song a ritson passed gaze resting on brig ahead have be in sight day from fact that be steering in same direction a aurora be thought to belong like to dispersed fleet when ritson again reached quarterdeck be ten o'clock so struck four bell sharply wheel lookout be relieved then everybody settled down once more to pas away remaining two hour of watch a have be already hinted ritson be not so strict disciplinarian a to forbid smoking by watch on deck so long of course a smoking be not allowed to interfere with duty of ship nay more sometimes allowed luxury of pipe under similar circumstance thought might safely do so on present occasion so seating in skipper chair drew out pipe tobacco knife prepared to enjoy whiff oh how comfortable chair be how great relief to sit in even for minute two during be cutting up tobacco filling pipe work though performed with great deliberation be at length accomplished steel tinder box furnished with light began to smoke somehow forgot to get up out of chair again when pipe be lighted leaning back restfully in instead watched little ring wreath of smoke issued from went floating lazily away until vanished in soft cool air of night then by association of idea ritson thought strayed away to little flaxen curly haired urchin at home one year old son who used to be so delighted to watch wreathing smoke issue from father pipe that must crow jump kick upon mother knee until good woman have hard work to hold fancied must see young rascal still fat dimpled cheek wreathed with smile of delight blue eye sparkling fat chubby arm leg flourishing in air a made frantic grasp at little blue smoke ring floating toward yes must hear anna wife voice half jestingly half in earnest scolding happy father for keeping child awake letting thought have free play on so pleasant theme must recall same voice crooning soothing lullaby to little fellow a later on nestled into mother breast tired out with romp softly sank to sleep very soothing be that lullaby very soothing indeed yes be very very soothing little song ritson head sank upon breast a too yielded to seductive influence of sleep few foot away stood rather lolled helmsman body drooping over wheel on upper rim of have crossed arm for sake of welcome support on taking charge of wheel have be given course glancing into binnacle found that barque be heading in required direction upon like good helmsman at once selected star to steer by star be just finger breadth clear of main royal yard arm by time that have be at wheel quarter of hour discovered that ship be steering accordingly relaxed vigilance allowing thought to travel away whithersoever must gradually weary eyelid closed short period perhaps minute so of forgetfulness followed from must suddenly start guiltily glance first aloft at star then at motionless figure of ritson glance of inquiry showing that star still occupied proper position that second mate have not observed dereliction of duty eyelid again closed longer period of forgetfulness must ensue of course ended a be sure to do in man falling soundly asleep a stood a for man on lookout be notorious for somnolent power made pretence of effort to keep awake there be reason argued why must be fine night a light a day there be nothing in sight brig ahead although aurora be clearly gaining on there be likelihood of running over in watch therefore to keep lookout just then be quite useless formality besides there be officer of watch who must keep lookout required on brilliantly fine night arguing thus settled comfortably into position vacated by predecessor folding arm across breast tranquilly composed to sleep remainder of watch have settled down to sleep a matter of course have not lookout be within call of officer of watch must service be required that considered be be just then expected of closed eye yielded to feeling of drowsiness without shadow of compunction thus by half past ten o'clock night entire ship company of aurora fore aft be fast asleep whilst hand be thus wrapped in peaceful oblivion small object gradually merged into view immediately ahead of aurora have lookout man be broad awake instead of fast asleep a be must certainly not have noticed object until be within mile of ship unless gaze have happened to have be attracted by occasional momentary flashing gleam of silvery light because colour so artfully matched delicate steely blue grey of gently rippled sea that be absolutely invisible beyond distance even at distance of mile cursory careless glance ahead might have easily missed when quarter of mile only intervened between barque look out man have be wide awake with wit about must suddenly have become conscious that large boat painted grey full of men be pulling swiftly noiselessly toward ship on swept silently a dream not word be uttered on board there be warning roll rattle of oar in rowlock to apprise sleeping crew of approach of danger there be not even plashing sound of oar blade dipping into water rose fell silently a misty oar of phantom boat when at length swept up alongside aurora sign be be needed to convey order of officer in charge to crew right hand be gently raised oar be noiselessly lifted from rowlock laid in without sound upon padded thwart boat sheered alongside without absolutely touching painter be made fast to aurora fore chain sixteen armed figure climbed noiselessly a ghost over bulwark leaving two in charge of boat chapter fourteen sold into slavery when george leicester retired to cabin night be with full intention to at once retire to cot instead however of doing flung down on sofa to indulge in few minute of entirely undisturbed thought there sleep overtook from be abruptly startled into complete wakefulness by sudden cry immediately followed by confused sound of struggling on deck of dull crunching blow cry of oh god have mercy upon dear blow heavy fall on planking overhead deep groan then splash in water alongside conscious at once that something terrible have happened sprang to foot buckled on cutlas snatching up pistol in one hand lamp in other hurriedly stepped out of cabin to investigate be just in time to encounter at foot of companion ladder motley crowd of swarthy skinned stranger who with bared dagger sword blade be making way down to cabin that be enemy be so instantly apparent that george unhesitatingly levelled pistol at foremost man fired bullet struck man in shoulder shattering bone staggered to one side only to make way for others however who pressing upon george disarmed overpowered before have opportunity to do further harm mr bowen who have dashed out of cabin just behind george be similarly disarmed overpowered then crowd pressed on into cabin where found secured walford lad tom having made thorough search of various state room stranger who be evidently spaniard hurried prisoner on deck here single glance sufficed to show captain leicester that ship have be taken from by clever surprise aided rather rendered possible by terrible carelessness on part of left in charge of deck crew a found on rapidly counting head be present with one exception securely bound hand foot huddled together under bulwark exception missing man be ritson overturned broken chair blood spattered deck in immediate vicinity heavy splash into water alongside george have heard rendered whole story a plain clear a moon rode so serenely in heaven above poor ritson have paid with life penalty of disastrous lapse of duty drowsy helmsman who have obviously awakened in time to spring to assistance of superior be lying near skylight white ghastly in moonlight with skull cloven great black pool of blood slowly spreading on planking beneath head brig ahead now hove to evidently awaiting approach of aurora told george from whence enemy have sprung now that be all too late bitterly reproached for lack of caution with regard to individual who have thus cleverly gained possession of barque be a ruffianly set of scoundrel a must well be met with on high sea leader brawny thick set spaniard with skin tanned to hue of well seasoned mahogany ragged black lock bound round with filthy red silk handkerchief surmounted by broad brimmed straw hat body clad in red yellow striped worsted shirt confined at waist by cutlas belt into long barrelled pistol be thrust leg encased in sea boot reaching nearly to thigh be particularly truculent looking ruffian powerful negro somewhat similarly clad who seemed to be chief aide be little if anything better that be pirate there must be possible doubt poor george leicester expected nothing le than that ship company must have throat cut then be unceremoniously pitched overboard to keep poor ritson company soon appeared however that career be not to be thus summarily brought to end for after few word between leader negro george crew be after bond have be looked to made more secure distributed about deck chained to ring bolt in bulwark elsewhere aurora under influence of slightly freshening breeze soon joined company with brig from boat then put off bringing on board barque tall handsome man whose feature be however spoiled by expression of cunning cruelty legibly imprinted on said few word to spaniard in charge glanced round deck at helpless prisoner made jesting remark two at of course everybody dutifully laughed gave george who unfortunately happened to be nearest playful kick in mouth with heavy boot then sauntered leisurely down into cabin where from repeated loud burst of laughter singing soon arose carouse seemed to have be promptly entered upon sky to eastward be brightening with approach of dawn when reveller at last staggered once more on deck here handsome man who seemed to be chief of pirate crew paused for moment apparently to reiterate emphasise certain command already laid upon subordinate after went down side into boat five minute afterwards two craft filled away once more upon former course must be impossible to convey to reader without going into most shocking disgusting detail clear idea of suffering indignity to unfortunate captain crew of aurora be subjected during next three week suffice to say that during whole of time be never released from ring bolt to be chained that lay there on hard planking day night alternately scorched by fierce ray of noonday sun chilled by heavy dew of night that be sparingly irregularly fed then only upon coarsest most loathsome of food still more sparingly irregularly supplied with water that be recipient of incessant abuse brutality from wretch who be in possession of ship slight conception can be formed of dreadful state of body mind during interminable three week at end of time land be made late at night ship glided into anchorage where brought up canvas be furled in slovenly fashion drove poor bowen in spite of that have suffered half distracted boat be lowered preparation be at once made for transport of prisoner to shore operation under direction of truculent looking ruffianly spaniard already mentioned a head of gang in possession of aurora be speedily effected prisoner handcuffed with hand behind be sent down into one of boat lowered for reception there secured to length of heavy chain so that where one went rest be compelled to go also thus yoked together be transferred to shore glance at star lit sky in pole star hung only twenty to twenty five degree above horizon told poor leicester that be landing upon shore open to northward that from position of polaris in sky be somewhere within about twenty five degree of equator beyond that be just then unable to learn anything further concerning whereabouts a boat keel grated upon beach prisoner be ordered by sufficiently significant gesture none of understanding single word of spanish to climb over side make way up beach spaniard in charge pointed significantly with long whip carried to break in dense growth of tree clustered close to water edge then with ominous flourish of lash gave word for miserable band to move forward toilsome march of four five mile along track of heavy sand then commenced march fatiguing enough in after long period of close confinement to have be subjected be rendered trebly so by constraint of heavy chain to be secured staggering reeling stumbling forward conscious of nothing beyond dreadful state of misery suffering took over three hour to perform horrible journey urged on though be by incessant application of cruel whip then found outside enclosure formed of heavy slab of planking nine foot in height narrow door gave admittance to place being unlocked prisoner be driven in after door have be again securely fastened be released from chain still with hand secured behind allowed to stretch exhausted body upon ground take such repose a be possible under circumstance first definite idea to take possession of george leicester mind after have fully realised calamity of capture be escape whilst chained immovable to ring bolt on own vessel deck be clearly simple impossibility a now glanced round enclosure in found recognised fact that be still equally so be true that place be open to sky that scaling of barricade must be to strong active free man simply pleasant gymnastic exercise be not free hand be shackled behind sentinel armed with cutlas gun be promptly placed on guard over wretched group of captive last not least three week of confinement exposure privation to have be subjected have left mark upon must no longer call strong active man besides there be walford george vow to watch over protect man if possible to restore to lucy arm be ever present to recognised from very first that if ever must be so fortunate a to escape walford must certainly accompany when leicester contemplated additional difficulty necessity forced upon courage almost though not quite failed for since capture of aurora walford have under influence of suffering to in common with rest have be subjected relapsed into state of almost complete imbecility so that so far a assisting in matter of own escape be concerned be helpless a infant there be however one point in leicester favour be walford still knew appeared to recognise in spite of mist obscured intellect fact that george be keenly interested in be always passively obedient to injunction latter laid upon unfortunate crew of aurora be kept confined in enclosure four day during condition be somewhat ameliorated by administration of better quality more liberal quantity of food than before also by permission rather command to exercise cramped stiffened limb by daily increasing amount of exercise cause for altered treatment soon became apparent on morning of fifth day by time haggard half starved feeble appearance have to slight extent passed away be once more able to keep upon foot for hour so without dropping exhausted to ground spaniard who have charge of made appearance in enclosure still arrayed in filthy habiliment wore on board aurora armed a usual with whip cutlas pistol flourishing former threateningly in air roughly bade rise to foot command being obeyed chain be produced somewhat lighter than one before used prisoner be secured to then negro who acted a spaniard aide chief mate unlocked door whole party marched out route on occasion a on last be along narrow bridle path of heavy sand led through dense growth of tropical tree plant following path for about mile party emerged upon road crossing path at right angle into turned when at distance of about two mile straggling town of low white flat roofed house became visible with blue water beyond just beginning to be ruffled by sea breeze toilsome march of about hour duration along glaring white road during be scorched by fierce ray of sun nearly blinded by whirling cloud of fine dust entered town passing along number of narrow sandy street deserted save for presence of few negro miserable looking spaniard ragged dirty bearing barrel of water strapped upon shoulder goat herd two driving flock of milch goat from door to door emerged at last into large open square in centre of stood tall ugly stone fountain from more negro spaniard be filling barrel from wide basin of fountain george companion in misery be allowed to slake thirst then be conducted to large open shed stood on one side of square under welcome shade of wide shingled roof ordered to sit down have not be here long when gang of unfortunate negro time be driven into square under shed then making in four hundred human being huddled together there like cattle in pound then for first time full horror of position burst upon george wretched companion be in slave market be about to be sold a slave conviction that be actually to be fate fell upon like thunder bolt be almost too much for even george courage to bear up against a for poor bowen for moment seemed that must go out of sens altogether prayed cursed everybody else swore solemnly that must kill man who dared to buy finally in paroxysm of mad fury started to foot dragging at chain exerting such extraordinary amount of strength in spite of recent suffering in effort to break away that for moment seemed almost possible that must succeed cruel lash across face from spaniard whip lash tore away skin left livid bloody weal on cheek only maddened more seeing negro who with spaniard be in charge of party sprang upon gripping by throat hurled to ground with such brutal force that poor fellow lay there for time stunned at about nine o'clock square gradually began to fill large number of spanish gentleman arriving upon scene on horseback others in gig drawn by pair of horse driven tandem fashion smoked incessantly nearly of on reaching square proceeded at once to shed walking up down entire length examined with utmost minuteness individual beneath roof frequently stopping to make inquiry of who have poor wretch in charge at ten o'clock small shrivelled up specimen of spaniard dressed entirely in white made appearance in square followed by four negro bearing couple of chair lightly constructed rostrum accompanied by sallow cadaverous looking individual with large book under arm pen behind ear silver mounted ink horn at button hole selecting suitable spot for purpose negro placed rostrum on ground with one chair in other in front of shrivelled up spaniard mounted into position clerk seated in front negro perambulated square ringing large hand bell sale began black be offered first of large proportion have evidently be landed very recently from slaver for most part be tall fine looking set of men woman be to say have be disease privation have done almost worst upon a took place upon block one by one form showed gaunt spare a so many skeleton in spite however of poor condition competition ran bidding be brisk be rapidly knocked down one after other until whole of cargo be cleared then came gang of negro slave already belonging to estate of tobacco planter recently deceased whose heir be disposing of everything prior to trip to europe most of poor wretch have be born on estate others have be on long enough to form family connection upon now husband wife parent child be in many case about to be ruthlessly torn from other for ever be pitiful be heart breaking to unaccustomed to such scene to witness expression of utter despair on face of poor creature then a sale proceeded expression must sometimes give way to one of feverish hope a purchaser of husband parent must become bidder for wife child in one two rare case hope be realised a husband wife parent child found once more reunited once more property of same man joy be enough to wring tear from heart of stone in most case family be utterly broken up two member becoming property of same purchaser then dreadful misery heart broken anguish be simply indescribable must be left to imagination of reader at length came to turn of aurora crew mr bowen be selected a first man to be put up on being released from chain instead of at once stepping up on block a be signed to do turned to george whose arm be still bound behind extending hand touched latter lightly on head by way of farewell exclaiming well cap'n moment of parting come at last sorrowful enough parting be battle storm fire shipwreck be prepared for when sailed out of london never dreamed be on highway to slavery well god will be done here be s'pose must make best of while last wo be minute longer than of can help if know anything of if get clear first vow never to steer to east'ard until have joined company if must happen to be off first hope impatient exclamation from spaniard in charge of party with savage lash of whip gesture of command to mount block at once here cut short rest of poor bowen farewell speech mate fairly reeled under force of blow steadied in instant turned upon assailant with eye literally blazing with fury vein on forehead stood out like cord muscle of arm leg swelled a gathered together body quivered like of tiger crouching to leap in instant must have have presumptuous spaniard in death grip cry from leicester stopped just in time steady bowen exclaimed george eagerly steady dear old friend resistance be worse than useless just now be turn to day ours will come will come day then will repay with interest for present suffering right be cap'n be bowen reply a stepped quietly up on block turning to spaniard if ever meet on blue water well will rue day be incident being of somewhat exciting novel character seemed to afford great gratification to crowd of buyer gathered round spot who eagerly remarked to other upon courage indomitable spirit of british seaman dwelt upon pleasure must afford to quell courage humble that proud spirit to dust result of be keen competition for possession of man bowen be at length knocked down to tall man with thin aquiline feature expression of be pretty evenly made up of pride resolution relentless cruelty walford be next put up miserable condition of unfortunate man vacant look of imbecility excited nothing laughter ridicule one must make bid for seeing that must be impossible to sell lot alone spaniard with whip ordered george to be released placed upon block also stepping forward at same time whispering eagerly in ear of auctioneer latter thereupon explained to crowd while first of two men offered be undoubtedly valueless of alone must be made very useful if purchased along with second who have be found to have great influence over must in fact persuade to do anything might be required so on so on little brisk bidding then ensued for two on part of more speculative among buyer who be willing to risk little possible loss on chance of obtaining two slave for trifle more than price of one finally be purchased by man who have appearance of being overseer on extensive estate lad tom who be next put up be also bought by same purchaser in few minute three white men now slave found chained to gang of negro men woman who have also fallen into hand of same owner hour afterwards gang be put in motion with overseer for such eventually proved to be at head three other men mounted one riding on side one in rear a guard took way through town george at last ascertained be havana out into country inland toward hill along fairly good road well shaded for most part with dense growth of tropical verdure wearisome tramp along road for distance of ten mile brought late in afternoon to plantation be to be future home prison george walford lad tom with old negro who possessed slight smattering of english be installed into small fairly comfortable wooden hut thatched with sugar cane leaf here clothing have be wearing when purchased be taken from be supplied instead with short drawer jumper of blue dungaree plentiful meal of ground maize with little salt be served out to be left for remainder of day to recover prepare for labour awaited on morrow chapter fifteen dash for freedom to find one self sold into slavery must be thoroughly unpleasant experience yet when george leicester night found actually slave tenant of slave cabin with slave only for future companion associate felt by mean discouraged there be oppressive feeling of despair weighing down heart crushing spirit into utter hopelessness on contrary have feeling a if great load of care anxiety have be lifted from off heart now knew worst of what be to befall fully recognised that life before be to be one of unrequited hardship at least might be also of suffering bitter tyranny braced to meet whatever might be with unflinching fortitude sustained by steadfast inextinguishable hope of eventual escape hope indeed of eventual escape rose high within breast now that have actually arrived upon spot from must be made estate of be now one of chattel be that of tobacco sugar planter of extent must at present form opinion saw that be of considerable size whole of cultivated ground within sight being property of owner be situated upon tolerably level plain with road running through from main road along have recently travelled up to planter house wide straggling stone structure with thatched roof verandah round occupying summit of slight eminence nearly in middle of estate behind house at distance of twenty yard stood building george rightly guessed to be stable slave hut of there be thirty four be built at distance of about quarter of mile from house on gentle slope at foot of stood boiling house sugar mill store house tobacco factory etcetera just beyond again ran tiny sparkling stream from be obtained power for driving crushing machinery slave cabin be wholly unenclosed george have not failed to notice on arrival upon estate though be certainly fenced in fencing consisted of nothing more than common rough post rail fence evidently intended merely to keep out cattle in innocence began to think that escape from place must prove very easy matter after what indeed asked be to prevent rising from bed upon very first favourable night must arrive quietly walking off estate what indeed escape be far too precious thing to be risked by being undertaken in ignorance of peril might attend attempt so resolved that for present must not attempt to frame plan felt pretty certain that a new acquisition must be closely watched for time to come by who might have more immediate charge of first task told must be to disarm suspicion might exist in mind a to intention on part to escape time necessary to accomplishment of might also be profitably employed in acquiring knowledge of spanish without fully realised that attempt must inevitably fail believed that by time have thus paved way for great attempt ingenuity must have proved sufficient to gain without suspicion from fellow slave tolerably accurate idea of peril difficulty with must have to contend took lad tom into confidence at once intending of course that poor boy must if be willing to incur risk go with walford share with at least chance of freedom so from very first day of thraldom there be two keen intelligent brain incessantly at work diligently clearing way to recovered liberty to walford george said nothing whatever of purpose unfortunate wretch must not possibly aid there be possibility that might unwittingly betray at six o'clock next morning great bell at engine house rang being signal for slave to turn out get breakfast hour be allowed for at half past six be formed into gang marched off to field in charge of overseer george walford be handed hoe apiece attached to one of gang detailed for work in tobacco field lad tom be attached to gang spent first day of slave labour among sugar cane tobacco be fast ripening be just then at one of many critical stage plant requiring individually almost a much care attention a new born child plant required that earth must be hoed up round stalk with almost mathematical accuracy to certain height more leaf have to be tenderly scrupulously examined twice thrice daily to guard against ruinous attack of tobacco grub be exhausting back breaking labour particularly for unaccustomed to driver whip be freely used to stimulate sluggard who exhibited sign of tendency to shirk work george soon saw congratulated upon circumstance that rule be evidently mild one on particular plantation whip being rarely used without provocation be scarcely necessary to say that leicester be quite resolved to save from indignity of lash if hard work must do be fortunate enough to return to hut on first day without whip having once be raised against thus passed day after day week after week only variation being that when tobacco be in proper condition field have to be gone through with utmost care leaf be sufficiently ripe be then picked laid in little heap in sun to sweat cure process being repeated daily until entire crop be gathered in then followed cleaning of field preparation for crop so on upon of be unnecessary to dwell george tom devoted whole of brief leisure after work of day be over to cultivation of knowledge of spanish being fortunate enough in pursuit of acquirement to make acquaintance of young very intelligent negro who have be for many year valet to master being unlucky enough to incur gentleman displeasure have be sent in disgrace into field gang with a tutor progress be rapid in little over six month be able to converse in spanish with tolerable fluency when at length george found that be fairly master of language began cautiously to touch on subject of escape topic upon pedro tutor be luckily always ready to enlarge gentleman regarding a injured individual be always threatening among fellow slave of course to run away george be once on point of declaring to fellow own intention of doing same thing luckily discretion stepped in prevented committing so great imprudence reflection occurring to just in time that man who talked so much about matter be after very unlikely to act to purpose one night however pedro entered george cabin looking very gloomy sulky flinging down on stool announced that have called to say farewell a be fully determined not to submit longer to such base treatment why what have happened now pedro exclaimed george when heard announcement will tell friend george answered pedro may possibly have observed that miserable piece of insolence called juan who have be promoted to post from be so unjustly expelled well wretched ape must need send send mind not come down ask send for man to move furniture up at house there have doubt specially named a be ordered to go refused declined to be subjected to indignity for be at once flogged have be humiliated disgraced dishonoured be resolved not to bear longer will fly to night well said george hope will get off clear see reason why must not exclaimed pedro ah good friend be because be new to wretched country be not aware then that master keep quite pack of bloodhound for purpose of hunting runaway slave that bloodhound be turned loose night to scour estate have be trained to watch over prevent escape if must happen to encounter one to night will be compelled to abandon attempt for will follow about must attempt to pas fencing spring upon hold until baying brings overseer to spot have never encountered of fiend of dog never answered george heart sinking at startling news be first have heard of then be quite impossible to walk about estate at night without being pounced upon by bloodhound oh dear be reply be so trained that will not molest so long a keep within boundary of estate will watch follow until return to cabin of course a there be only dozen of dog in may perchance get away without encountering one of if do prospect of escape be still small for must be missed in morning dog must at once be put upon track regular slave hunt must then begin slave hunt be rare sport promise for everybody slave then seems remarked george even in event of getting clear of estate have very little hope of escape after none be reply none unless happen to posse certain secret secret of hiding scent so that dog can not follow trail then indeed may hope to escape not otherwise be fortunate enough to posse secret a have be good friend mind letting into provided that if make one in hunt to morrow take slave to help sometimes will aid escape in way can agreed exclaimed george joyously in case must do still secret be valuable one must like to be made acquainted with will amigo said pedro placing hand inside bosom of shirt produced handful of leaf do see asked george intimated that did take particular notice of so that may recognise again with certainty whenever see urged pedro note shape exact colour note peculiar odour above note taste for there be other plant quite worthless for purpose closely resembling one taste will at once tell when have found right one george eagerly took quantity of leaf in hand carefully examined noting that though varied in size be of exactly same shape hue then held to nostril inhaled odour until thought have become fully acquainted with finally put one in mouth masticated juice have very peculiar flavour indeed so peculiar that felt sure must never forget how do use leaf asked george if answered pedro have opportunity to gather only few hour before wish to use so that be perfectly fresh that have to do be to bruise crush so that juice will be free to escape then rub well over foot imparts odour of plant to skin so hide scent that dog be quite unable to follow if leaf have be gathered so long that have become dry must put in water to soak until become soft once more then first wash foot in water afterwards rub thoroughly with leaf only in latter case will require much larger quantity of leaf thanks pedro will remember that answered george one more question have done where be plant to be found ah now have given puzzle exclaimed black plant be very scarce be growing daily more so for reason that slave owner carefully root up destroy wherever find be fully acquainted with peculiar property know that have freed many persecuted slave from bondage of cruel tyrannical master that if allowed to flourish must free many more so be carefully sought out ruthlessly dug up when found notwithstanding plant be to be found here there by diligently searching after grows generally in wet marshy ground in such spot will have to seek for if ever need now must go be close upon time for head overseer to go round want to see in own cabin a soon a be once more fairly out of way will be off good night good bye good bye answered george grasping negro proffered hand good bye thank for valuable secret heartily wish good luck if get up hunt take to help will do what can to throw off scent way do go have better know nothing about answered pedro cautiously ask be that if catch sight of observe sign of having passed will simply keep quiet about now once more good bye ten minute later head overseer going round on looking into pedro cabin found that individual apparently fast asleep on floor with back against wall utterly fagged worn out look pervading entire personality that man be almost betrayed into momentary feeling of pity for poor boy surprise be therefore proportionally great when on following morning became apparent that pedro have succeeded in spite of dog in making good escape from estate slave hunt be at once organised about nine o'clock a george be hard at work in field saw hunter dozen in number mounted accompanied by bloodhound pas down main road through estate out on to open ground beyond here party divided half going in one direction half in other to encircle estate endeavour to pick up trail be absent whole day when returned at about midnight unfortunate pedro be with handcuffed secured by rope round neck to saddle of one of horseman afterwards transpired that have be perfectly successful not only in evading dog during actual escape from estate also in hiding scent from capture be due to unfortunate circumstance of having be met by friend of master who hour afterwards encountered party in pursuit of so put upon track next morning unhappy wretch be made example of by being flogged so severely in presence of other slave belonging to plantation at first seemed doubtful whether must ever recover from effect of though did eventually be nearly three month before be again fit for work incident of pedro escape unfortunate failure be naturally chief topic of conversation among slave for long time afterwards george heard so much of many difficulty attending such attempt that often felt upon very brink of despair obstacle be so great a to be almost insurmountable when who made attempt be strong healthy thoroughly inured to fatigue have faculty about when came to not only making good one own escape also that of feeble weakly companion of unsettled reason task seemed so utterly hopeless so thoroughly impracticable that appeared almost worse than madness to dream of undertaking yet in spite of notwithstanding terrible example have be made of unhappy pedro george clung tenaciously to idea never let slip opportunity to do anything in ever so slight degree might contribute to success when time must come for effort to be made a time passed on knowledge of spanish language became perfected uniform industry good conduct procured many little indulgence such a few hour of release from field labour now then in order that might instead be despatched duly provided with pas on errand message to neighbouring plantation to havana little journey not only afforded opportunity of made most of studying physical geography of island also of hunting for precious plant by mean of hoped to successfully hide trail in latter quest be so far fortunate that found at different time a many a eight of five of successfully transplanted to favourable spot on estate in out of way locality that fervently hoped must escape discovery next task set tom be that of propitiating making friend with dog nightly guarded estate in be wholly unsuccessful creature have be too well trained absolutely refused overture from men who wore detested garb of slavery circumstance however that be of white instead of negro blood be point in adventurer favour george accidentally made discovery probably in consequence of circumstance when be able by mean to conceal uniform usually wore hound though still suspicious be puzzled undecided how to behave towards in meantime whilst steadily cultivating favour of overseer by unvarying industry good conduct a sedulously cultivated good will friendship of fellow slave by exercise of great tact circumspection gradually won from without exciting slightest suspicion mass of valuable information a quite decided when time must come to make way inland to southward rather than to northward latter route though must soonest enable to reach coast being chiefly in consequence of circumstance by far most perilous one next matter requiring attention be acquisition of arm of description with party must defend in event of being pursued overtaken by lucky chance be at length enabled to procure in shape of three cane knife weapon closely resembling cutlas a regard length curve of blade provided merely with wooden handle instead of metal guard usually fitted to latter weapon same lucky chance enabled to secure cane knife namely finding of gold five dollar piece on road during one of excursion into havana also supplied with mean of purchasing three coarse canvas jacket such a be commonly worn by cuban coasting seaman at time with hoped to sufficiently disguise companion to avoid inconvenient questioning on road when time for great attempt must arrive auspicious moment arrived a such moment frequently do quite unexpectedly came about in following manner when george comrade have be in slavery trifle over year message reached estate to effect that ship have day arrived from europe in cargo of there be certain household article have be ordered expressly for use of planter wife that a happened to be stowed on top ship have already begun to discharge be desirable that must be sent for at once in order that might escape damage message reached estate quite late in evening in fact be within hour of time for knocking off work for night so impatient be lady to see new possession that insisted upon being sent for at once george a most trustworthy slave on plantation be ordered to take mule waggon couple of companion proceed into town forthwith to fetch so that might be at house ready for unloading by first thing next morning be instructed that a must probably be very late rather early next morning before returned be to drive waggon down to engine house place under shed there for remainder of night instead of driving up to house so that might not disturb occupant by noise of arrival leicester at once saw that errand must afford probably best opportunity must ever have for attempted escape therefore mentioned to overseer that thought tom walford must be most handy men must take with a helper at once went off in unconcerned manner with well assumed air of imperfectly concealed dissatisfaction at prospect of night journey to harness up mule on way to stable sought out walford lad tom bidding be ready to go with imparting to latter determination to take advantage of opportunity to attempt joint escape done hurried away to spot where have concealed treasured plant arrived there only to find that be gone whether have be discovered destroyed by overseer have be found appropriated by fellow slave acquainted with valuable property be impossible to tell one indisputable fact be that plant have vanished be most unfortunate circumstance george must not allow to dishearten fugitive must have several hour start before pursuit must commence then there be always possibility that other specimen of plant might be found thinking thus slowly wended way to stable where harnessed up mule threw into waggon quantity of grass cane leaf together with canvas cover rope supposed to be required for packing protecting article then drove to hut where tom walford awaited former very shrewd intelligent young fellow have immediately upon being apprised by george of intention hurried off to prepare supper recognising great importance of good substantial meal before starting especially in view of uncertainty a to when must be able to secure when george reached hut meal be just ready trio partook of last meal in slavery a hoped with great deliberation george being most anxious not to start until darkness must so far have settled down upon scene a to allow of smuggling cane knife canvas jacket in under grass in waggon without detection be at length successfully managed first taking careful look round hut to see that be leaving nothing behind might possibly prove useful clambered into cart drove slowly off night have by time fairly set in star be just beginning to peep out from deepening blue of cloudless vault above moon in first quarter hanging almost in zenith be already flooding scene with soft silvery radiance promised to be magnificent night for enterprise though excessively close hot a turned into main road leading into havana left estate fairly behind george lad tom felt spirit rising pulse bounding with joyous anticipation of speedy return to freedom whilst harnessing mule leicester have rapidly turned over in mind pro con of situation have come to conclusion that must be necessary in first instance to proceed three four mile on road toward havana necessity arose from circumstance that planter house stood upon slight eminence commanding perfect view of road for distance a leicester must not possibly be sure that one might not be idly watching from verandah progress of waggon a long a remained in view deemed only common prudence to keep to road until have passed completely out of range of such chance watcher done intended to turn sharp off make best of way southward utilising waggon mule for a great distance a possible then abandoning pressing forward on foot distance must have to travel be not very great island being according to such information a have be available to only twelve half spanish league about thirty english mile wide at part thus if be fortunate in choice of route so a to be able to use waggon for whole distance might succeed in reaching southern shore of island before escape be so much a suspected george explained to tom a mule trotted cheerily along road by time that plan of escape have be fully elucidated have reached point where might with perfect safety branch off make way to southward did at once branching square off to westward in first instance until be about mile distant from road completely hidden by bush from observation of one upon then turning in southerly direction dense belt of forest then lay before at distance of six mile with lofty hill top rising behind toward latter object george now headed mule a straight a scattered clump of bush must permit soil be very light sandy be covered with thick growth of grass prevented mule foot waggon wheel from sinking so that travelling be nearly if not quite a rapid a have be along road sharp lookout be maintained for sign indicative of approach to neighbourhood of plantation two three bridle path evidently leading to such be crossed at length reached welcome skirt of forest without having have least cause to suppose that have be observed in meantime however heavy bank of thundercloud have be observed rapidly gathering on southern horizon runaway have scarcely plunged mile into forest before heaven be obscured at once became so pitch dark that be utterly impossible for to proceed mule be consequently pulled up three adventurer made what few preparation be possible for protection from coming storm soon low threatening rumble of thunder be heard then a rapidly increased in volume of sound bright flash of light be seen blazing out beyond interweaving branch of tree storm a in tropical country quickly gathered force intensity very soon be raging in fury above around loud reverberating roll of thunder be incessant lightning flashed with ever increasing rapidity at last entire atmosphere seemed to be in one continued tremulous glare of unearthly light mule started quivered a lightning flash grew more rapid intense finally became so terrified that george have a much a must do to restrain from bolting so dashing waggon occupant to piece against tree storm be at fiercest when suddenly party found enveloped in blinding blaze of greenish blue light simultaneously there came terrific rattling crash a though universe have burst asunder occupant of waggon blinded deafened by dazzling brilliancy of flash tremendous report accompanied felt hurled violently to earth then followed oblivion chapter sixteen pursuit when george leicester at last awoke from stupor have sufficiently recovered scattered sens to remember where be strength fury of storm have passed lightning flash being much le vivid coming at considerably longer interval rain be descending in perfect deluge notwithstanding shelter of thick overhanging foliage ground be already so completely flooded that george at first thought be lying in bed of willow watercourse staggered to foot chill dripping wet taking advantage of intermittent light afforded by lightning looked around to ascertain if possible what have actually happened then saw that immense tree close by have be shivered from top to bottom by lightning falling across path have killed mule completely wrecked waggon own escape that of companion if indeed have escaped have be simply miraculous huge branch having struck waggon only about one foot behind seat upon have be sitting ground be littered with splinter encumbered with spreading branch of fallen tree among proceeded to search for tom walford low moaning sound short distance on right told that in direction must probably find one of missing groping way cautiously to spot found unfortunate walford lying on back with water surging round like mill race large branch of fallen tree lying across breast pinning down by exerting whole strength george managed to bear up branch sufficiently for walford to work way from underneath then helped poor wretch to foot inquiring at same time if have received serious hurt unfortunately one of apathetic fit occasionally seized walford have come upon george be quite unable to gain anything like intelligible answer from be scarcely able to stand continued moaning constant pressure of hand upon breast showed that be evidently suffering great pain seating unfortunate man at foot of tree where must be beyond reach of water making a comfortable a be possible george then went in search of lad tom whom found standing bewildered over wreck of waggon with thin stream of blood slowly trickling down face from scalp wound probably inflicted by blow from one of branch of tree a fell have tom be that exclaimed george joyously be just coming to look for how have fared in general smash be that cap'n answered tom well be very glad to find have turned up right have be smash mistake total wreck insurance will be bound well be unfort'nate ca be helped might have ' be much worse got whack on skull knocked sens out of for while feel very much worse for a'ter where poor mr walford sir what be become of be close by answered george big branch fell across chest be afraid be very much hurt let have look at said tom two men groped stumbled way without more ado to place where walford be still seated with back resting against giant bole of tree few trial be sufficient to establish fact that poor fellow be practically helpless for time at least then became question of what must be best to do under circumstance first idea be that george tom must take arm of injured man over shoulder so assist along moved with such great difficulty that be soon apparent other plan must have to be adopted have exclaimed george a bright idea struck hurrying away to waggon secured canvas rope have be thrown into together with cane knife canvas jacket other trifling belonging hurried back to tree now tom said look about lad see if can find nice light handy branch tolerably straight about ten foot long bring here a quickly a can ay ay sir answered tom starting off on errand at once whilst be gone george spread out canvas upon ground with aid of pocket knife have seen lying about in stable that evening have taken liberty of appropriating proceeded to roughly shape hammock out of material leaving enough canvas at end to form with rope eye through to pas branch from intended to be slung have hardly finished preparation when tom reappeared with waggon pole have found fortunately unbroken will do sir asked tom very thing be george delighted reply now walford continued lie down on canvas old fellow will soon have slung comfortably in hammock between where will travel without much pain to poor chest be now tom pas end of pole through eye capital now through other be sort now will take fore end of pole after end lift handsomely have got end on shoulder then off go have not such very great distance to travel only twenty mile so must get over ground a quickly a possible for when once nine o'clock to morrow morning have passed may make certain that will be after so must reach coast by time soon after if wish to get clear off in manner with walford slung in impromptu hammock between george tom set off upon wearisome journey lay before fondly hoped be to end in absolute recovery of liberty tramp tramp splash splash on trudged stumbling over root of tree tripping over long tough straggling creeper crossed path sometimes brought up standing half strangled by cord like llianas hung festooned from tree to tree naked foot leg torn by thorn stabbed by spine of wild cactus in thick impenetrable darkness for couple of hour then cloud suddenly vanished away on wing of land breeze star reappeared soft silvery ray of moon streamed down once more through gap in foliage weary fugitive flung down upon sodden ground for short breathing space george be of opinion that from time have be tramping through forest ought to have very nearly reached southern skirt a far a eye must penetrate in uncertain moonlight through sylvan vista there be sign of break opening of kind nothing apparently endless succession of tree dense undergrowth seeing leicester began to feel uneasy knew that have be travelling through timber in anything straight line indeed to do so must have be simply physical impossibility began to fear that in spite of effort to avoid misfortune have be journeying along arc of circle instead of progressing steadily in southerly direction wanderer be beginning to feel thoroughly fatigued what with day work in field exposure during storm painful tramp afterwards george felt that fatigued not must push on liberty must be secured first when be won must afford time to rest not until then first thing to be done however be to get definite idea of whereabouts be be obviously useless to continue plodding on knew not whither besides be frightfully fatiguing painful work marching through forest george felt that must be positive advantage even to deviate somewhat from direct course if by so doing must earlier gain open ground once more so looking around picked out most lofty tree must find leaving tom to keep watch by walford side nimbly scrambled up trunk be soon among topmost branch single glance around sufficed to show that suspicion be correct be only about mile from northern edge of timber consequently rather worse off than if have never left wrecked waggon at worse still george found that after travelling be little more than three mile from estate whole of be distinctly visible from lofty stand point be rather discouraging there be help for now knew exactly where be how much greater than even have imagined be necessity for immediate action so turned glance in southerly direction sought to discover most direct road out of unpleasant predicament here met with ample reward for trouble in climbing tree for saw that if pursued way due south a must now do directing course by moon must have to travel through at least seven mile of forest whilst by heading in south westerly direction keeping moon little on left hand must only have to traverse two mile of forest after there seemed to be tolerably open ground a far a eye must reach about three mile east south east of detected gleaming white wall of number of building judged to be portion of town of santiago beyond rose curiously shaped double coned mountain away on right lay table land of mariel joyous sight through break in rising ground to southward caught glimpse of sea with far away on utmost verge of horizon appearance of land conjectured must be isle of pine noting matter carefully making rough mental sketch of lay of land george rapidly descended to where have left tom walford rapidly detailed to former result of observation must be off at once explained for have time to spare have lost nearly three good hour blundering about here blindly in wood must be now nearly quite midnight if so leaf only ten hour at most to reach sea if be to do so without being overtaken accordingly weary stiff a be again shouldered pole from walford in hammock be slung once more set out upon journey now that be favoured by light of moon hoped must be of somewhat more prosperous character than have hitherto be painful toilsome tramp of couple of hour emerged to unbounded joy from southern side of forest on to comparatively open ground tree dense straggling clump of bush be still abundant enough far too much so in fact there be wide patch of grass land between over progress be tolerably rapid once clear of thick timber george again shaped course due south intending to pas through break in rising ground have seen from lofty lookout somehow missed involved great deal of toilsome climbing at length plunged once more into belt of timber stretched seemingly for mile across path here exhausted nature gave out tom declared utter inability to walk yard george felt scarcely better than companion so notwithstanding terrible loss of precious time involved selected first suitable spot must find flinging upon ground one on side of walford gave up to sweetest sleep have ever sealed eyelid george be first of trio to awaken when did so found to dismay that sun be already several hour high in heaven immediately aroused lad tom greatly refreshed by sleep pair once more shouldered poor helpless walford hammock resumed flight be a hungry a healthy men usually be after great exertion fast of several hour duration have not particle of food with so be compelled to subsist for present upon hope hope that ere long must meet with something more substantial felt particular anxiety upon score a george knew that wild fruit of several kind be tolerably plentiful on island about hour after have started be fortunate enough to fall in with wild plantain fruit of be just in right condition for eating time be lost in securing goodly bunch of very nutritious fruit upon feasted a went along until appetite be completely satisfied after trudging manfully along for about couple of hour found upon crest of range of low hill from caught through break in scrub glimpse of sea sparkling invitingly under noonday sun also caught glimpse of something by mean so pleasant namely town of considerable dimension immediately before only about two mile distant to avoid be compelled to make wide detour much valuable time be lost in way in reconnoitring for knew there must be several plantation in immediate proximity to so important place through must have a be to run gauntlet notwithstanding caution failed to effect passage entirely unobserved through dangerous district unfortunately happening just a emerged from bush be about to cross high road have be watching for nearly hour vehicle appeared in sight suddenly wheeling into road close to from bush path have failed to observe vehicle be occupied by two person white man negro driver a be utterly impossible to avoid observation of two person george told tom in few low hasty word to continue moving to carefully conceal appearance of chagrin to leave to answer question might be put to a vehicle approached fugitive owner signed to driver to pull up immediately changed mind passed on contenting with careful prolonged scrutiny of traveller disagreeable incident caused george companion to push on with renewed vigour be with sincerely thankful heart that at last plunged into willow ravine promised to lead directly down to sea then not more in leicester opinion than four five mile distant sun be by time sinking low in heaven traveller unutterably weary a be pressed eagerly forward hoping to reach coast before to discover craft of kind must appropriate in later on when night be well advanced must hope to do so unobserved might venture to put to sea be only effectual method of escape george must devise to put to sea upon chance of being picked up by passing vessel knew that when once fact of escape became established news must travel faster than possibly must whole country for many mile round must be apprised of number appearance recapture must be certain to get afloat therefore a speedily a possible be first object after must trust to chance providence rather for ultimate rescue a advanced along ravine grew deeper whilst side became steeper more rugged until at last place assumed quite appearance of mountain gorge defile with rocky precipitous side to few scattered shrub clung here there at length in deep silence of breathless evening thrice welcome sound of sea breaking upon shore came faintly to ear be merest faintest murmur be true experienced ear told in moment what be be within sound of sea in few short hour at most please god must be safe from pursuit bend in defile be before about quarter of mile distant toward eagerly pressed believing that when have passed must find face to face with sea in eagerness broke into run notwithstanding terrible state of fatigue soon rounded bend to find in cul de sac with perpendicular wall of cliff in front of nearly two hundred foot high with groan of bitter anguish disappointment deposited walford in hammock on ground turned to ask other what must be done in face of new difficulty a did so deep bay of dog smote upon ear from higher end of ravine sound be instantly repeated again again in slightly different key proving that cry be uttered not by one by several animal dog dog exclaimed tom be after by jove here be caught like rat in trap george glanced eagerly about up down ravine to go back be simply to throw into arm of pursuer for be pursued did not for instant doubt to hide even if hiding place must be found be impossible with keen scented brute upon track to remain where be be to await inevitable capture must go forward meant scaling that terrible wall of rock a george glanced despairingly up lofty perpendicular cliff thought that active man unencumbered might possibly accomplish feat at event be so circumstanced must try what must do knew lad tom must do also there be walford unable to walk much le to scale awful precipice a stood thus baying of dog again came floating down ravine how much nearer clearer be now sound brute must be coming down after at run a of course easily must upon red hot scent sound decided george to make one more desperate effort for freedom look here tom said after coming thus far must not be taken for want of little extra effort if be may be sure will never be allowed to make second attempt now only chance be to scale that cliff must do can do if only go resolutely to work will be difficult fatiguing awfully dangerous for must take poor walford with liberty awaits at top sea be not mile off know by sound of can reach before fellow can ride round to intercept so let set to with will lad will scrape clear yet take word for now out with cane knife cut away at grass must well pad poor walford round with so that may not be hurt by bumping against rock then will lash hard fast in canvas lash one to end of away aloft go chapter seventeen on face of precipice cane knife be speedily at work grass be long abundant a two men be working for liberty nay probably for life be not long in cutting sufficient quantity for purpose walford be then lifted carefully out upon ground grass be thickly evenly distributed over inner side of hammock then invalid be again deposited within securely lashed up head only being left free done two lanyard be securely attached to extempore hammock one at head other at foot well done be capital exclaimed george a last turn be taken making secure now slip bight over ah here come dog by be unfortunate must defend with cane knife will tackle first one take next mind have time to waste luckily there be only three of brute a yet must kill be up out of reach before others master arrive keep steady tom lad strike so that one blow will be sufficient now then come on devil a george finished speaking dog three superb specimen of cuban bloodhound dashed up to within about ten foot of fugitive there stopped not attacking a have expected merely baying loudly will not do exclaimed george if turn back upon for single instant will seize can not afford time to stand looking at will take dark one attack light fellow mind what be about for be a strong active a tiger now at word men sprang forward with uplifted cane knife made slash at dog creature tried to dodge blow one of one attacked by tom succeeded george however be more fortunate made feint a dog sprang aside followed up recovering weapon smartly at same time bringing down in second on creature head with such strength effect that skull be cloven open poor brute with yell of agony rolled over dead tom meanwhile be battling ineffectually with dog have attacked george turned just in time to see hound spring savagely at lad throat hurl to ground with single bound leicester reached tom side raising cane knife above head grasping handle with hand brought down with strength across dog neck taking care to avoid thick leather collar protected blow clove through skin bone dividing spine nearly severing head from body even then be difficult to free poor tom from iron jaw have seized with vigorous wrench however be effected george then dragged lad to foot be hurt panted leicester gasped tom beast only seized by collar of jacket then come on at once interrupted george third dog have turned tail like craven luckily for now slip bight of lanyard over neck follow leave cane knife will only encumber perhaps throw down face of precipice now look out be going to start a george spoke approached face of precipice taking advantage of projection must find began task of scaling tom following behind walford slung in make shift hammock between two worked desperately two men knowing how much depended upon next few minute onlooker must have be astounded at progress made encumbered a be with weight bulk of helpless companion in one minute from time of starting have gained height of forty foot then sudden trampling of horse hoof loud shout of pursuer told that latter have rounded bend that be seen in few second sound ceased at foot of cliff in instant voice of head overseer be heard shouting to hola there giorgio miscreant come down will fire keep steady tom gasped george let fire chance be ten to one that will miss do feel nervous lad not answered tom never felt steadier in life cap'n rope be cutting into shoulder awful bad though so be into mine returned george must grin bear now until get to top do look up boy if look down will grow dizzy likely enough slip then down must inevitably go be coming down rascal shouted overseer look much like reckon senhor chuckled tom to hoisting over edge of good broad ledge of rock a spoke ledge ten foot in width now exclaimed leicester a helped lad up will rest here minute two recover breath may blaze away at a long a like now be a safe from bullet a if be dozen mile away overseer companion however seemed to think differently for fugitive have scarcely settled comfortably when regular fusillade be opened upon a george tom be completely sheltered by projecting ledge none of shot came near be now about way up cliff from position excellent view presented for distance up ravine have just left george tom now that be sitting quietly down have leisure to think about felt sense of empty space immediately before of sheer precipice knew lay beyond narrow ledge to be exceedingly trying to nerve presently clatter of horse hoof came ringing upward to from bottom of ravine peering cautiously over edge of rock george saw that party of man hunter accompanied by four bloodhound have started off at gallop on way back to entrance of cul de sac at once guessed that intention be to ride round over hill endeavour to pick up trail again at top of cliff act of looking downward from so great elevation sight of sheer precipice on very edge of be hanging with absolutely nothing to prevent from falling over going whirling headlong down to bottom produced in george sudden attack of vertigo whole landscape appeared to rock to fro ledge upon be standing seemed to sway suddenly forward over abyss threaten to launch into space felt wavering upon very brink almost uncontrollable impulse seized to spring off take terrible downward flight glance downward impulse became irresistible drew back step braced for terrible leap flung arm above head uttering piercing cry be in very act of launching forward over edge when tom happening to glance at to detect suicidal determination just in time sprang up with cry of amazement horror dragged forcibly back against wall of rock behind why cap'n exclaimed lad a soon a have sufficiently recovered from astonishment to speak why cap'n whatever matter with yer what be goin ' to do for moment poor george be too unnerved to speak instant that be dragged back from ledge horrible fascination lost hold upon suddenly realised in fullest extent frightful peril from have be so providentially snatched covering face with hand a revulsion of feeling came upon shook quivered like aspen leaf minute two more dreadful feeling also passed away calmness self possession returned to placing upon knee there on narrow ledge of rock humbly returned hearty thanks to god for preservation prayed for help deliverance for companion in present sore need then turning to tom said thank tom have saved life a surely a ever man life have be saved by fellow creature in world be in very act of springing off rock when dragged back for body must at moment be lying mangled lifeless hundred foot below know how be when looked down over edge turned giddy sick in moment then felt that must fling down precipice let be warning to lad for show steady a be head aloft at sea be not to be too much depended upon when climbing precipice on shore come be high time that must be moving again fellow be half way to head of valley by time if be not smart will have yet do feel sufficiently rested to tackle other half of cliff ay ay cap'n be ready answered tom for lord sake sir for sake go for to look down get tempted to jump off again perhaps might be able to stop next time know right tom never fear answered george will take care not to run awful risk again may be sure now be ready then take end of poor fellow let be moving now that be ready to resume ascent terrible difficulty presented on looking upward for projection by to raise leicester for first time became aware that ledge on stood marked change of stratum below be hard rock above ledge must see nothing vertical unbroken face twenty foot in height of soft crumbling sandstone so soft indeed that scarcely merited name of stone at might be more fitly described a solidly compressed red sandy soil of such slight tenacity that be possible to scrape away with naked finger to climb smooth crumbling face even with aid of ladder george at once saw must have be utterly impossible for though have be spoken of a vertical be not strictly so inclined slightly forward so a actually to overhang ladder must therefore not have stood against face how then must hope encumbered a be to surmount task be obvious impossibility george saw that must be necessary to seek for practicable place elsewhere accordingly walford be once more laid upon rock with tom to watch guard against possible mishap whilst george went off upon exploring expedition first tried to left passing along ledge very cautiously with face turned to wall so that might not again be exposed to terrible temptation from have so recently escaped at first have great hope of success ledge beginning to slope upward a passed along to eastward when have traversed fifty yard so suddenly narrowed away to nothing under projecting angle of superimposed sandstone in endeavouring to get glimpse round angle soft material crumbled in george grasp lost hold staggered reeled struggled ineffectually to recover balance fell for single instant gave up a lost suffered in anticipation agony of frightful death have not fallen more than six foot when outstretched hand encountered long stout flexible twig rather young tree shooting out from interstice in rock grasped with iron grip of drowning man grasped with hand though bent double with weight held out bravely enabled to regain footing on face of precipice in moment have scrambled once more on to ledge where lay panting breathless with torn bleeding hand safe appalling peril from have thus second time so narrowly escaped inflicted terrible shock on george nerve be time before must find courage to once more raise head look about reflection however that two men one of utterly helpless be in same perilous situation a having indeed be brought directly into by helped to once more recover command of nerve somewhat ashamed of unexpected weakness scrambled to foot set out to explore in opposite direction by time that have once more reached point where tom sat patiently awaiting dusk be closing down upon landscape with rapidity peculiar to tropic shrouded a be in deep shadow of precipice be already difficult for to see other clearly meant still danger added to already confronted george felt that unless way of escape must quickly be found must be compelled to remain where be night prospect involved so many horrible contingency that dared not allow mind to dwell upon turning attention strictly to matter in hand hurried away on quest to westward in direction be more successful ledge at distance of thirty yard running into steep earthy slope ten dozen yard in height above precipice again rose sheer to top a far a must see in quick gathering darkness precipice again presented rocky face up inequality of might be possible for to climb single glance be enough to assure george that most perilous portion of journey still lay before in first place slope be frightfully steep rising at angle of fully fifty degree from horizontal in next place be covered with long thick growth of grass rendering face almost a slippery a ice lower edge terminated abruptly in vertical overhanging face similar to towered above place where have left tom walford so that must either of slip in traversing dangerous part of journey must lashed together a be inevitably slide roll helplessly down over edge into depth below a george contemplated fearful danger attending further progress idea occurred to that perhaps after now that pursuer have gone ground be left clear below must be better to retrace step endeavour to find more practicable way out of ravine few second consideration of plan convinced leicester of utter impracticability have by superhuman exertion succeeded in climbing up precipice knew that must never get walford safely down again there be nothing for then to go on upward even though must find pursuer awaiting at top contingency so much lost time rendered only too probable before going back however attempting passage up awful slope encumbered with walford helpless body george thought must be prudent to essay passage alone so that might learn from actual experience full extent of danger thus be better able to guard against disaster accordingly down went upon hand knee forthwith began ascent first attempt proved to that have in wise magnified peril of journey for knee slipped helplessly from under moment that touched grass be only by clinging desperately with hand to long tough herbage that escaped being shot down to bottom over edge returning once more to friendly ledge after danger have so recently passed through seemed to afford position of absolute safety george began to cast about in mind for mean of overcoming new difficulty at last hit upon idea of making narrow pathway up slope by pulling up grass by root however soon found must be work of considerable time also discovered that must be possible without great difficulty to remove small patch of just sufficient size to give precarious comparatively secure foothold at once proceeded to do hour of arduous labour in direction enabled to safely reach top of slope where to great gratification discovered platform of rock about six foot wide passing along came suddenly upon irregular fissure in rocky face of precipice fissure be about four foot wide at bottom wall sloping inwards like roof until met at height of seven eight foot from ground george at once unhesitatingly entered opening found that widened somewhat a receded from face of rock until at distance of five twenty foot inwards abruptly terminated in small cave like aperture six foot in height perhaps twelve in diameter being a nearly a must ascertain by sense of touch only roughly of circular form george be inexpressibly thankful that have be guided to place of refuge for here resolved party must pas night a easily must with most perfect safety be by time far too dark to attempt awful risk of passage up precipice felt sure that even must succeed in safely reaching top pursuer must be found there awaiting cavernous fissure afforded very shelter required existence be in probability absolutely secret even be not so be inaccessible to who chose to risk neck in effort to reach lastly must seek in rest so absolutely needed without haunting fear of rolling over precipice in sleep thinking thus leicester rapidly cautiously made way back to tom whom found in state of greatest mental perturbation owing to prolonged absence hastily describing to lad fortunate discovery have made george made what few preparation be required for short dangerous journey before then two resumed load with cautious step wended way along ledge to treacherous slope be by time a dark a must be throughout night circumstance rather lessened than increased peril for prevented realising a fully a in broad daylight giddy height of narrow path along be travelling brilliant light from star overhead be sufficient to enable to pick step find bare patch in grass in be so imperatively necessary for to plant footstep at last after nearly quarter of hour arduous labour several narrow escape from disastrous accident welcome shelter of cave like fissure be reached feeling way cautiously into laid walford down released from uncomfortable bond hungry thirsty utterly fagged out a be with arduous labour of day threw down beside with half unconscious thanksgiving for preservation trembling upon lip fell at once into profound slumber sleep lasted until late on in following day sun being already low in heaven when george be awakened by walford with querulous demand for food drink at once rose proceeding to mouth of fissure effected cautious reconnaissance result of be establishment of satisfactory circumstance that one be visible in ravine below next point to be ascertained be whether pursuer of be still maintaining watch for on cliff above george have not slightest doubt that when saw riding up valley on previous evening have resolved to ride round intercept fugitive pick up trail at cliff top if possible question to be settled be whether having failed in object must establish watch upon part of cliff at fugitive might be expected to make appearance whether believing that pursuit have be baffled escape effected must return discomfited to estate leicester be of opinion that failing to detect sign of fugitive dog being unable to pick up scent suspicion might occur to mind of pursuer prey be still lurking in precarious resting place on face of precipice in case doubt strict watch must be maintained for hour a to how long must be before patience of watcher became exhausted before conviction must thrust upon that fugitive have escaped must of course form opinion having thus far evaded capture thought must be only prudent to make sure that coast be clear before proceeding further in prosecution of flight having come to conclusion returned to inner recess of cave acquainted tom with intention to make trip of exploration a far if necessary a top of cliff forthwith set out upon mission george first act on issuing from fissure be to cast look aloft in order that might judge of nature of task still before sight be anything encouraging task of climbing vertical face perfectly smooth to intent purpose projection inequality being so slight a to be barely distinguishable beyond height of twenty five twenty foot seeming to even after recent experience of cliff climbing sheer impossibility to climb even unencumbered a then be be task not to be lightly entered upon determined that before attempting must seek further endeavour to discover somewhat le difficult path to summit with object in view continued way along rocky platform upon be then standing until rounded sharp angle where abruptly came to end gave place to rough jagged broken face very similar to have ascended on previous evening casting eye over up uneven face in effort to pick out most suitable path gaze be arrested by sight of bush growing out of face of rock bush be only ten foot distant be therefore close enough to not only to see that be evidently specie of wild raspberry also to discern very welcome circumstance that be literally bending beneath weight of ripe fruit be not long in making way to spot where stood then removing jacket knotting sleeve round neck with seaman readiness of invention converted into sort of bag rapidly filled to utmost capacity with cool ripe refreshing juicy fruit with hurried back to inmate of cave laying before bade eat freely returning to bush since lay exactly in way intended to take to satisfy craving of own appetite chapter eighteen fugitive make good escape having partaken of a much of fruit a deemed prudent george at once betook to task of climbing precipice be agreeably surprised at rapidity ease with accomplished ascent now that be unencumbered with walford weight be free from horrible dread have before haunted that false step on tom part might precipitate hand to bottom confidence in own power enabled to coolly approach successfully surmount obstacle under le favourable condition must have dreaded to face in few minute be within foot two of top here deemed prudent to pause for moment survey path by have ascended so that in event of danger might be able to effect rapid retreat glance downward permitted to take though only momentary brought on again though happily only in mitigated degree same feeling of vertigo nausea from have before suffered be obliged to close eye for short time clinging convulsively to rock meanwhile to avoid falling headlong to bottom having at length once more recovered steadiness rose cautiously higher higher until head be level with top edge of precipice then ventured to raise head rapidly cast flying glance round dip again latter precaution be needle ground still sloped upward so that must see for distance of forty yard only visible space be perfectly clear there be human eye to detect presence there once more raising head time taking more leisurely deliberate glance round to make assurance doubly sure proceeded to make way up over edge on to comparatively level ground at top be task demanding utmost caution for depth of eighteen inch of light soil crowned rock thickly covered with long rank grass owing to lightness of soil afforded very precarious uncertain hold soil too crumbled away immediately beneath touch so at very top of precipice be unable to find anything to must safely hold for short time almost seemed a if apparently trifling obstacle be about to baffle altogether be not until have actually laid bare rock immediately in front of a far a arm must reach that accomplished object stood safely on top of cliff now threw flat on ground in long grass thus effectually concealing from view of chance passer by crawled to crest of hill where again peered cautiously about ground from spot whereon knelt declined pretty steeply to sea only quarter of mile distant slightly to right there lay valley with tiny river flowing through into sea on bank of stream there stood two three crazy wattle hut scarcely worthy name of human habitation with net two spread behind on pole in sun to dry three four fishing canoe boat ship boat looked a though have be picked up derelict be moored in stream human being there be none visible in line with river commencing at distance of about two mile from shore extending right out to horizon there lay group of islet forty more in number far away beyond lying like thin grey cloud of haze on water must see isle of pine so far so good thought george spot be evidently lonely one inhabited by few fisherman only there be sign of watch being maintained on chance of runaway putting in appearance so chase have doubtless by time be abandoned a hopeless there be capital boat in urgent necessity felt need not scruple to appropriate lying in stream below everything promised favourably for successful escape from island though scene below looked so quiet deserted though boat lay there so temptingly within sight leicester felt that evening must be most suitable time for making final effort be in immediate hurry now be scarcely worth while to risk detection by putting off in broad daylight besides sea breeze be blowing gale in exhausted condition must scarcely be able to drive boat ahead against whilst by waiting until sundown must have calm to start with breeze when came must be off land in favour thus arguing matter with rose to foot sauntered leisurely back to cliff edge on return journey be surprised greatly disconcerted now to discover how easy be to miss spot at have made ascent strong breeze sweeping over grass have obliterated trace of recent passage through confidently walked in what believed to be right direction only to find mistaken bare patch of rock have cleared to facilitate passage over edge be of course when once found unmistakable landmark be quite five minute walking to fro on cliff edge before hit upon quite long enough to have insured capture have be surprised closely pursued having at last found however forthwith began descent here again be disagreeably reminded of much greater difficulty be experienced in descent than in ascent of cliff difficulty began with first attempt to lower over cliff edge notwithstanding utmost care several time found in position of most appalling peril however got down safely to cavern at last after detailing to tom result of observation threw down on rocky floor to recover in sleep if possible strength nerve necessary for final ascent when george awoke sun be within about hour of setting there be therefore time for to go out secure for companion meal of wild raspberry accordingly did fugitive have preparation complete in good time when everything be quite ready leicester went out stood at entrance to fissure watching shadow creep gradually higher higher up eastern side of ravine a sun declined toward horizon at length last golden gleam vanished entire landscape assumed hue of rich purple grey rapidly deepening in tone a darkness of tropical night settled swiftly down supreme moment have arrived returning at once to interior of cave george briefly announced that be time to start walford already securely lashed in hammock be at once hoisted up between george tom a before issuing from mouth of fissure fugitive forthwith began last most perilous part of ascent have scarcely risen couple of yard when rapid hoof beat be heard in valley below pausing for moment to glance down george saw mounted figure galloping rapidly up valley recognised at once a one of former pursuer saw in moment how completely pertinacious man hunter have outwitted immediately became clear to that failing to pick up trail at top of precipice fellow have jumped to conclusion improbable a might seem prey must still be lurking somewhere on face of precipice doubtless during previous night individual just seen have returned secreting among bush below have maintained untiring watch on face of cliff there must be doubt that have seen george ascent of cliff that morning observing to be alone have rightly concluded that journey up cliff have be made for purpose of reconnaissance have therefore remained perdu satisfied that before long patience must be rewarded a have be by witnessing attempted flight of whole party reflection flashed like lightning through george brain helped to instant decision must go on now exclaimed to tom have discovered hiding place if be to return to must simply blockade top bottom of precipice knowing that sooner later must inevitably fall into hand in addition to that must spread information of position over country perhaps offer reward for capture in case must have perhaps hundred watching for instead of dozen have chance yet for will take fully twenty minute to ride round by time if be fortunate can reach boat now tom lad do utmost in twenty minute will either have won freedom relapsed into slavery for ever not word be now said by of until awful climb be over have after countless hair breadth escape safely reached top of cliff when at last once more stood on comparatively level ground felt a though limb have strength to carry yard upon way so exhausting have be superhuman effort have put forth there be pause rest for yet onward must still press at topmost speed that have hitherto endured must be in vain short journey from top of precipice to summit of rising ground be cruel one slope gentle though be telling upon terribly a staggered forward over long slippery grass panting breathless staggering stumbling at step dreading moment to hear triumphant shout announcing arrival of pursuer upon scene so far save of own laboured breathing not sound of kind broke in upon deep stillness of evening hour when at last surmounted crest of hill scene below be one of peaceful solitude now one more one supreme effort tom in five minute will be free gasped george muster courage resolution let make run for can do ay ay sir will try be scarcely articulate reply without more ado set off down slope at run run well yes be run if be anything at run limb felt like lead walford weight seemed to enough to drag down to very centre of earth individual blade of grass seemed to be invested with toughness of hempen cable to trail directly across path for express purpose of retarding progress tripping up breath be gone mouth be open gasping heart be beating like sledge hammer against rib pumping blood in great red hot tide up into head brain reeled sight began to fail what little of scene be still perceptible to disordered vision be apparently whirling in mad dance up down round round

be beside stream twenty must be in boat hark what sound be that dull thud of horse hoof upon turf with what headlong speed rider be pressing forward have there be exultant shout tell that prey be in sight thank god there be dog with think george be there not then what mean deep sonorous baying sound break with such startling distinctness on frenzied ear on on for love of god press on gasp george with something almost like renewed effort fugitive once more spring forward hark now can hear deep panting of hell hound a lunge forward at gallop silent now that prey be in sight flaming eye fixed upon flying men in front of jaw champing in horrible anticipation one more bound boat be reached poor walford be tumbled unceremoniously into george tom follow latter wrenching from foetid mud stake to rotting painter be attached whilst former with last desperate effort sends crazy craft into middle of stream a roll in over gunwale heavy splash be heard cumbrous body scurry from slimy bank into water whilst at same moment foremost hound magnificent creature a big a lithe a panther spring boldly after receding boat almost reach not quite front paw catch upon gunwale rest of body fall short

at canine tragedy for human pursuer be now close at hand thowl pin luckily be already in place left there by fisherman who have be too lazy to remove stow snugly away oar be therefore hastily caught up tossed into place boat be spun round like top until head point seaward with vigorous stroke two men send foaming out along narrow river channel toward sea pursuer rein up upon bank with one accord draw pistol open fusillade upon flying boat fortunately be harmless one one bullet lodge in stern transom second chip shaving off loom of george third pass harmlessly through planking of boat bow skim few yard along surface of water beyond remainder fly wide after so long persevering hunt men be not disposed to sit still tamely witness escape of whom have sworn to take back with dead alive to plantation so after few minute of hurried consultation three of dismount hauling one of canoe to bank enter start in chase way in handle paddle send light craft surging down river in wake of boat prof that be novice in boatman art be two of whom be in chase george tom have already nearly forgotten terrible fatigue be fast recovering wind leg member in suffered most severely be now comparatively at rest entirely new set of muscle be brought into action a be perfect master of art of handling oar be getting surprising rate of speed out of old boat without very much effort in couple of minute be clear of river mouth through roller be breaking on miniature bar heading fairly out to sea human endurance have limit after have be tugging away for hour at clumsy ill made oar exertion began to tell upon strength began to flag canoe have hitherto contrived to keep at distance began slowly to gain on though how much must not well tell a be by time quite dark must only distinguish a small dark shapeless blot on surface of water with tiny luminous ripple under bow be just beginning to discus probability of success must come to hand to hand fight with three armed unfatigued men when faint puff of warm air fanned face thank god exclaimed george fervently thank god there be first puff of land breeze with began to fumble with one hand at lashing of sail lay stretched fore aft along thwart beside working oar with other hand meanwhile after little difficulty knot secured be cast loose turn partially thrown off now tom must finish job exclaimed george can reach throw off rest of turn where sit sail be lug by feel of at event here be yard of sort lying alongside mast when have cast off lashing be ready to step mast say word lay in oar then will scull boat whilst step mast hoist sail hurrah here come breeze hot strong get canvas on at last will be able to enjoy rest if fellow be wise now will 'bout ship at once make for shore five minute hence will be blowing fresh if look out will be blown off land altogether be ready then in oar step mast sway away upon halliard so said so done tom tossed in oar seized mast stepped halliard be already bent to yard laziness again fisherman evidently having be too indolent to cast adrift knowing that must only have to bend on again when next wanted to use sail in minute tom have sail mastheaded tack lashed down sheet aft in george hand whilst latter sinking down in sternsheets with sigh of ineffable relief too tired yet to ship rudder steered boat with oar have used for sculling whilst tom be busied in operation of making sail canoe meanwhile have crept up to within own length of chase oath exclamation of mutual encouragement be freely mingled with peremptory order to fugitive to surrender threat of punishment awaiting when caught sooner be sail set than boat drew rapidly away in ten minute more canoe with occupant still paddling furiously out to sea be invisible george confidently expected to be saluted with parting shower of bullet be agreeably disappointed owing possibly to circumstance that in hurry of pursuit crew of canoe have omitted to bring ammunition with for first four hour of flight voyager be sailing continuously among group of low islet george have seen from top of hill about midnight a nearly a must guess last rock be passed found in open water now want of chart made disagreeably manifest george be quite seaman enough to be able to steer tolerably straight course using star a guide by night sun by day unfortunately having nothing memory to go by have only very vague notion of proper course to steer of distance must have to travel plan moreover be by mean fixed one of idea be to stand boldly out to sea in south easterly direction in hope of hitting jamaica where must at once find among friend able willing to help against plan there be several grave objection chief of be uncertainty a to exact position of island consequent probability that from small size must miss altogether then again be absolutely without food water be true there be few scrap of putrid fish in boat tom have found fishing line under bottom board forward so that having line wherewithal to bait might possibly succeed in catching few fish then must obviously not do to rely on mere chance a idea be to get into open water southward of isle of pine look out for english frigate one of must be pretty certain to be cruising in direction eastward bound merchantman from honduras plan seemed to george most feasible under circumstance in favour of finally decided first matter to devoted on finding that have longer anything to fear from canoe be walford comfort poor fellow made complaint indeed have scarcely opened mouth to utter word since moment when received injury have for last two day be growing increasingly apparent to george that unfortunate rival be rapidly sinking into very critical condition under combined effect of injury exposure want be wasting visibly away strength be so completely gone that be quite unable to move without assistance george have once twice asked question whether be justified in involving poor weak demented creature in suffering there be only too much reason to believe still awaited must not have be truer kindness asked to have left walford in sheltered spot where there must be certainty of being speedily found taken care of reflection satisfied that must not to have left in hand of spaniard must have be to leave in slavery for remainder of life judging by leicester felt that death must be preferable to fate then again there be possibility slender one be true still possibility of speedy rescue in case with care nursing must be sure to receive there be reason why walford must not recover health intellect so comforting with reflection that be doing best must for unfortunate man george arranged comfortable berth for in sternsheets of boat deposited thereon still lashed up in canvas hammock grass packing of formed comparatively soft comfortable support to emaciated frame chapter nineteen death claim victim breeze continued fresh until about midnight after lessened trifle came off from larboard quarter daybreak found boat off north eastern extremity of isle of pine about five mile distant from curious chain of islet called by spaniard islas de mangle curve out like breakwater across northern face of island hunger have to extent be appeased by last plentiful meal of wild raspberry have be altogether forgotten in excitement of subsequent flight now returned to in full force breeze failing george determined to put line overboard try for few fish be successful beyond most sanguine expectation dozen fine grotesque looking fish speedily rewarding effort idea of devouring raw be rather repulsive a there be possible mean of cooking have to do go without breakfast so selecting most tempting looking cut up after making wry face over first mouthful two managed to satisfactorily dispose of be to say george tom did poor walford on being offered share shook head murmured that be not hungry closed eye again in patient suffering balance of catch be carefully cleaned strung up on yard in hope that must dry in sun great want now be water hunger being satisfied thirst began to assert george must have landed upon isle of pine endeavoured to find fresh water for fact that caught sight of several people on shore who appeared to be watching boat with pertinacious curiosity in strait tried plan of dipping shirt into sea putting on again dripping wet to great delight found that proceeding have very sensible effect in mitigating thirst upon tom tried same plan with equally beneficial result then well soused poor walford with sea water hoping that must to extent revive refresh by mid day isle of pine be broad on starboard quarter last cay on jardines shoal have be passed be fairly at sea in deep water might now reasonably look out for frigate at moment a must not do to depend upon source of rescue alone george continued to stand boldly to southward eastward hoping by so doing must not only improve prospect of falling in with british frigate that must also failing frigate meet with friendly merchantman by sunset be fairly out of sight of land so far nothing in shape of sail have greeted longing eye once twice white speck on horizon have temporarily raised hope have vanished next moment being probably nothing more than sunlight flashing upon sea bird wing george be hourly growing more more anxious for speedy rescue not so much on own account a for walford sake condition of latter being such a to give rise to liveliest apprehension have eaten nothing since previous day pleading want of appetite a sun went down watched gradual disappearance beneath purple wave with wistful eagerness murmuring last time last time then a solemn darkness swept down over sea star came out one by one in great blue vault above little consciousness of surroundings hitherto retained left fell to murmuring snatch of song mingled with babbling of childhood day word mother be frequently upon lip once burst into passion of hysterical tear murmuring child like that be very sorry that if must forgive must be good boy for future must never do again state of thing gravely alarmed george who began to fear that last great solemn change be at hand be therefore with feeling of intense relief that heard hail of sail ho from tom whose sharp eye have at last caught sight of genuine unmistakable sail broad on boat lee bow there be nothing however to be done to carefully watch helm of boat be already under canvas steering best course possible for intercepting stranger only thing therefore be to steer straight otherwise chance be that ship must be missed after strange sail be steering about east south east being close hauled on larboard tack from position george thought just possible that might intercept at event near sufficiently to permit of crew hearing hail a passed a night deepened breeze freshened by time that strange sail have be in sight hour be blowing so fresh that be a much a must do to keep lee gunwale above water yet dared not shorten sail for breeze be threatening at moment to capsize be also hurrying stranger more rapidly along consequently lessening chance of intercepting thick cloud too began to gather in sky threatening more wind by obscuring light of moon rendering just so much more unlikely that crew of approaching vessel must see at last heavy squall burst about mile to windward of george be reluctantly compelled to order tom forward to shorten sail unfortunately halliard have somehow got jammed aloft in sheave sail must not come down tom tugged tugged at desperately to purpose there stuck with squall rushing down upon like race horse cast off tack tom let sail fly shouted george lad have scarcely time to obey order when squall burst furiously upon sail streamed out in wind like great banner from top of mast lashing furiously shaking boat to keel crazy craft careened gunwale to notwithstanding that george have put helm promptly up in moment must undoubtedly have gone over with just a water be beginning to pour in over gunwale crack went mast thwart with over side boat be nearly half full of water in anxiety to free get before wind mast sail parted company from boat never saw again squall lasted about five minute then passed off leaving only gentle breeze behind a soon a be case have look round for strange sail made out topsail schooner about mile half distant george saw that there be still chance for so out oar pulled vigorously be going well when to intense surprise craft after approaching to within little more than quarter of mile of suddenly put up helm wearing round stood away upon south westerly course with one accord george tom started to foot shouted lustily repeatedly ship ahoy ship ahoy ship ahoy until throat be so strained that voice failed became unable to utter sound be to purpose cry attracted not slightest notice schooner ran rapidly away from at last george in despair laid in oar flung down in sternsheets covered eye with hand to shut out tantalising sight hour afterwards reason for extraordinary conduct on part of schooner became apparent upper canvas of large ship under heavy press of sail appearing in south east quarter that ship be man o ' war be evident at glance from cut of sail course be steering together with large spread of canvas showed that be in pursuit of schooner first impulse of in boat be to out oar pull toward five minute work sufficed to show that chance be almost hopeless frigate must pas at distance of about six mile with eye on board intently fixed upon chase what prospect be there in uncertain light of so small object a boat being seen at so great distance nevertheless toiled on with dogged perseverance did not abandon effort until frigate have passed topsail have sunk below horizon then indeed laid in oar directed whole attention to walford whose condition became more alarming moment not that made complaint poor fellow indeed seemed to be quite unconscious of pain weakness ghastly pallor laboured breathing convulsive shudder agitated frame from time to time be to george tolerably clear indication that dissolution be near at hand be still quite light headed mind wandering in feverish haste from scene to scene of boyhood a be evident from rapid disjointed sentence poured uninterruptedly from lip george be able to gather pretty clearly from even a lad walford have be wilful headstrong obstinate prone to go own way without much consideration for wish of others there be occasional wild word broken exclamation seemed to indicate that even whilst little more than mere child have allowed to be betrayed into actual crime a lay there gasping life away folly of boyhood graver offence of more recent day seemed to be in way jumbled up hopelessly in disordered mind with confused idea of urgent necessity for speedy repentance of there must be doubt that notwithstanding disordered state of unhappy man intellect conscience be busily at work with that be already beginning to dimly see error of way hollowness utter unprofitableness of past life possibly also critical nature of position mind be too completely shattered to avail of prompting remorse regret have tardily come to found expression only in simple pleading for pardon child offer to grieved parent distressing state of thing lasted at interval through night well into following day when dying man utterly exhausted sank into fitful troubled sleep pang of hunger still worse of thirst again making felt george once more put fishing line over side after waiting patiently for nearly hour have satisfaction of feeling smart tug at gave sharp jerk to strike hook firmly into fish at once began to haul smartly in have only gathered in foot so of line when there came terrific pull at sent cord flying through finger in spite of effort to hold promptly called tom to assistance even with aid be unable to hold fish a last resource threw couple of turn round one of thowl pin result be disastrous line snapped short off at pin when came to investigate further found that have lost whole of except bare fathom still remained in boat be misfortune indeed a deprived of only mean of obtaining sustenance be now becoming so urgent necessity to sailor be not easily disheartened forthwith set to work to manufacture new line out of rope still have in boat tom carefully unlaying strand jointing yarn george tried best to manufacture hook out of nail drawn from gunwale of boat task occupied for remainder of day when be completed hook line together constituted such very make shift hopeless looking affair george in spite of hunger must not repress incredulous smile at idea of fish with wit about being beguiled by tried however be utter failure must not secure even barren encouragement of nibble at last attempt be given up in despair shortly before sunset walford once more opened eye began to stare blankly about for minute two there be look in eye encouraged george to hope that reason be returning to abandoned throne look quickly passed away incoherent muttering recommenced sun went down night mantle of darkness once more descended upon sea then full moon in queenly beauty rolled slowly into view above horizon flooding scene with silvery light investing with magical beauty be not without influence even on poor famine stricken creature who be watching with such sympathetic solicitude beside dying companion suddenly walford be muttering ceased expression of joyous surprise lighted up ghastly wasted feature seized george hand with firm clasp in one of raising other exclaimed hark what be heard nothing ned answered george tremulously knew instinctively now that last dread moment be close at hand heard nothing what be mother answered walford mother calling to a used to call when be little innocent child when have there be again be own dear well remembered voice be calling to go to must not stay out at play longer did so last night know grieved said be naughty disobedient boy made cry forgave kissed after have said prayer father art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth a be done in heaven give day daily bread forgive trespass a first word of simple beautiful prayer issued from walford dying lip george tom threw upon knee in bottom of boat hand clasped head bent heart earnestly uplifted to who be thus mercifully taking poor sufferer to first sentence be spoken with child like simplicity after word be uttered with increasing fervour evident conception of momentous import until clause be reached forgive trespass be breathed forth with solemn intensity thrilled very soul of listener then voice suddenly ceased a george looked up with startled eye saw walford lip tremble radiant smile parted for instant sank heavily back on boat thwart dead george gazed long earnestly in face of dead man thought travelling rapidly back to eventful evening when two met one going humbly doubtingly to declare love other hurrying triumphantly away from successful wooing leicester grieved a pictured sorrow of loving woman heart when news must be taken to of sad event just past thought too of strange meeting in mid ocean of helpless state in walford have remained since then of own vow that have cost a reverently gathered fold of canvas about lifeless form felt comforted with reflection that though have failed have honestly done best to keep vow did what must to dispose corpse decently to prepare for last long sleep beneath wave be not much that be able to do did what must for lucy sake a kept on muttering to when be ready turned to tom poor lad utterly worn out have sunk down in bottom of boat with one arm supporting head on thwart be fast asleep well better so thought george to be enjoying at least temporary respite from misery will not disturb murmuring short earnest prayer raised body in arm lifted over side of boat allowed to pas gently away from grasp into peaceful depth below god have mercy on soul murmured with clasped hand stood watched shrouded form passing slowly out of sight for ever chapter twenty mr bowen unexpectedly reappears about hour afterwards fine breeze sprang up from north east putting boat before george seated in stern tiller in hand steered a near southerly course a boat without canvas must go very gloomy despondent be thought a sat there idly watching crisp curling wave racing past one of trio have passed away without food water without mast sail with strength rapidly ebbing away situation of remaining two be hourly growing more critical have not have misfortune to lose mast sail george must have endeavoured to return to isle of pine to do so with oar alone now that have scarcely strength to use be impossible there be alternative therefore to wait patiently hope that might be picked up before must be too late boat drifted on hour after hour sun rose wave crest sparkled glanced under cheering ray still horizon remained sail le at last tom after stirring uneasily awoke from stupor glanced with eager haggard eye around uttered groan of despair then be not true after gasped george noticed with consternation difficulty with poor fellow articulated be not true be only dream be dream tom asked george started at hollow sepulchral tone of own voice dreamt that noble ship have hove in sight be bearing down upon under stunsails be painted white from truck down to water line canvas be white a snow be flying great white flag from main royal masthead people on board be dressed in white be grand sight to see sweeping down toward with cool clear water flashing up under sharp bow there be ah see be dream after hurrah come come poor fellow pointed away to where ray of sun fell upon water in broad white dazzling glare merciful heaven muttered george be horrible lad be out of sens gone mad with hunger thirst sit down tom said coaxingly sit down there be good fellow can see ship what see be only glare of sun on water if be only patient please god ship will come pick up before long must be cool steady keep sharp lookout so that when heave in sight may be ready to signal to tom passed hand wearily over forehead shaded eye with hand again peered long anxiously over gleaming sea shook head despondingly bright vision have vanished sank moodily down in bottom of boat arm resting upon thwart head bowed upon oh that terrible time of waiting with sun beating mercilessly down upon uncovered head scorching up brain with hellish torture of hunger thirst already unendurable momentarily increasing in intensity with horrible feeling of deadly weakness fast paralysing energy dragging like leaden weight upon aching limb what wonder moment lagged until seemed hour minute day that hour stretched out into eternity of overwhelming anguish at last george feebly felt with curious mingling of despair relief that own sens be leaving soon boat be to disordered vision no longer drifting helplessly upon lonely sea be tranquilly gliding under silken sail up winding reach of gently flowing stream crystal water of flowed over golden sand between bank of richest flowery verdure with overshadowing tree whose bough drooped beneath load of blushing fruit whilst in distance palace of whitest marble gleamed amid many tinted foliage air be musical with song of bird no longer felt agony of hunger fiery torment of thirst plucked ripe fruit a boat swept gently past pang be assuaged no longer suffered from scorching ray of sun for silken awning floated over head cool breeze crept refreshingly beneath gently fanned aching brow no longer suffered from weariness for body reclined upon

clank of rudder chain sonorous hum of wind through ship rigging flapping of sail distant subdued murmur of men voice soft plashing of water at same time became conscious of gentle swaying pitching motion such a be felt on board ship close hauled with moderate breeze correspondingly moderate sea for minute two george felt languidly puzzled a to whereabouts be by mean anxious for enlightenment

idea be first to make round of various shipping agent office endeavour to obtain berth on homeward bound ship if failed then george thought might possibly aided by captain singleton influence obtain

once with took aboard told lieutenant in command about after knocking about with 'em for fortnight landed here just six month ago that end yarn what have be doing since then asked george after congratulating bowen on escape well cap'n be reply never once forgot promise made to day be separated in havana felt certain that 'd manage to get away somehow day felt just a certain that sooner later 'd turn up here in kingston so a soon a be landed here made inquiry not being able to learn that anything have be heard of just looked about bit got berth on board little coaster so to be on spot whenever might happen to turn up 'd told story pretty freely here in kingston so that even if 'd happened to have be at sea at time there be plenty of people must have taken in tow provided with needful until came in again now that have put in appearance of course will throw up berth will sink swim together thanks bowen thanks be just like disinterestedness answered george what be to do only thing can see for be to get berth if possible on board homeward bounder homeward bounder exclaimed bowen with contemptuous emphasis why there suppose know anything about must talk like about what asked george completely mystified why about prize that took dark night on passage out privateer brig jeune virginie be lying down there at port royal safe sound with british crew on board have got to do cap'n be to make claim establish identity ship value will be handed over to be possible exclaimed george then be lucky indeed must explain whole affair to that be easy enough answered bowen very first time entered port royal harbour saw craft lying there knew again at once think to myself now dick bowen lad first duty be to recover possession of prize on behalf of skipper ' so off go to admiral stated case made claim be very well fine fellow say doubt what be telling truth see ' say ca prove now must have something beyond bare word before give up possession of brig when can bring something in shape of proof that what say be true come to again will see what can be done in matter ' of course be right straight for'ard enough so went away troubled more about craft be safe enough have be using a cruiser taking care of doubt what be in just a good order a be on night when took now have got to do be to go to admiral again make claim there be three of time so that there will be difficulty at in getting delivered over to chapter twenty one aurora turn up again that same day george waited upon admiral formally laid claim to jeune virginie be very well received statement patiently listened to to make long story short in about three week afterwards claim be actually allowed vessel handed over to rightful owner george be agreeably surprised for notwithstanding bowen implicit confidence fully anticipated that there must be trouble over matter legal possession once obtained leicester have difficulty in raising money by mean of bottomry bond with provisioned brig for six month intending to take out letter of marque endeavour to make good loss resolution in be cordially seconded by bowen though gave plenty of occupation have not forgotten old crew found rather took time not only to prepare complete list of name full description of who be still so far a knew in state of slavery also to put into hand of proper authority with urgent representation of probable suffering that matter be at once taken up have satisfaction of knowing before sailed that negotiation be already in progress for discovery deliverance considerable difficulty be experienced in obtaining crew for brig good men being scarce at last be overcome on bright september morning anchor be hove up virginie started upon cruise shoal outside harbour be cleared in due time brig working like top sailing like witch to unbounded delight of hand then george hauled sharp up on port tack intention being to cruise for few day in windward caycos passage before shaping course for home for first five day of cruise be singularly unlucky seeing nothing man o ' war schooner on speaking found have be equally a unfortunate a on morning of sixth day however being then in neighbourhood of hogsties lookout aloft reported at daybreak couple of sail dead to windward hove to close together on usual inquiry being made lookout further reported that one of stranger be barque rig of other happened to be lying end on must not clearly make out from size judged to be ship mr bowen whose watch be at once went below informed george of circumstance then leaving to don most indispensable portion of attire returned to deck proceeded thence aloft to have look at stranger for by time that have seen that be then possible to see have descended again to deck george be awaiting there well bowen what do make of be leicester first inquiry well there be two of there sure enough close together good deal too close together to be up to good to thinking be reply what do think be then asked george one of be privateer pirate t'other be prize in opinion answered bowen then will make further acquaintance said george perhaps if trim canvas bit slovenly act a though have not seen craft may coax down towards privateer be will be best plan doubt acquiesced chief mate proceeded forthwith on tour round deck easing up brace here halliard there with touch also at sheet bowline by way of insuring agreeable harmonious result when have finished brig looked like collier speed have decreased from eight to little over five knot there said bowen to george with admiring glance aloft at own handiwork think that will do pretty well look helpless enough now for anything masthead ahoy to lookout aloft what about stranger now have dropped alongside one sir be reply very well keep eye upon let know when see change in movement stereotyped ay ay by way of reply be duly given then george bowen side by side with hand folded behind began to trudge fore aft from main mast to taffrail patiently awaiting course of event about quarter of hour elapsed then lookout hailed again on deck there barque have cast off be standing down towards be busy getting stunsails upon now sir right stay where be let hear if see anything worth reporting replied bowen few minute later report be made to effect that other sail full rigged ship have filled be standing to northward under plain sail be last news from of vessel barque shortly afterwards becoming visible from deck order be given to clear brig for action lookout be ordered down on deck there be capital working breeze not much sea be consequently not very long before barque have raised hull above horizon a soon a be fairly in view george brought telescope to bear upon ten minute careful scrutiny sufficed to satisfy that though spar be heavier now showed wider spread of canvas than of old be undoubtedly a have suspected own old ship aurora further noted that be not very deep in water being in fact just in very best sailing trim remembering former capability be not long in making up mind that if present crew happened to become suspicious of character of virginie shunned engagement must be very difficult matter to bring aurora to action if in possession of barque entertained misgiving certainly gave visible indication of on contrary came sweeping down upon virginie under perfect cloud of canvas in manner so obviously threatening that in order to maintain illusion to last george thought advisable to exhibit slight sign of uneasiness accordingly ordered royal to be loosed set edged away point two off course at same time however checking weather brace to extent that brig speed be not very greatly improved by manoeuvre in meantime deck have be cleared gun loaded crew fully armed with cutlas pike pistol port lid however be kept carefully closed so that presence of gun on board might not be revealed until action must have become inevitable mr bowen have in midst of work be watching approach of aurora with grim satisfaction gradually developing into condition of supreme exhilaration rubbed hand gleefully laughed softly to exhibited in short outward characteristic of thoroughly gratified man then must draw pistol from belt carefully inspect priming pas thumb meditatively along edge of cutlas casually test with finger sharpness of pike head at time expression of countenance boded good to approaching enemy virginie crew be kept carefully out of sight except three four hand who be ostentatiously posted on forecastle with order to assume appearance of deep interest in approach of barque bowen have carefully placed man exactly where wanted a aurora came sweeping down upon brig invisible hand on board latter gradually tautened up halliard brace tack sheet bowline until by time that two ship be within mile of other trace of slovenliness on board virginie have vanished sail be standing a flat a board brig be once more in condition to be worked to best advantage done men be ordered to gun be ready for commencement of struggle when within distance of about three quarter of mile from brig studding sail of aurora be seen to suddenly collapse in few second have entirely disappeared being taken in at once man o ' war fashion showed george not only that old craft be heavily manned also that be in command of man who knew how to handle sight did not greatly disturb have have time to discover that own crew be good one have studied brig mastered little peculiarity awaited with perfect calmness conflict be now inevitable a aurora studding sail fluttered out of sight sheered broadly to port flash accompanied by puff of white smoke issued from side in instant nine pound shot skipped along water across virginie bow george decided to take notice of hint brig held steadily on course shot followed with like result pirate then decided apparently to waste more powder shot upon so contumacious craft to make short work of affair by simply running alongside taking possession aurora be accordingly steered in such way a must admit of making wide sweep shooting up alongside on brig weather quarter be handled magnificently there be doubt of presently with graceful sweep came surging up alongside with water spouting up in clear transparent sheet under sharp bow yard swinging simultaneously to meet change of course white canvas gleaming in brilliant sunlight six long nine pounder grinning through bulwark deck crowded with men a fair yet a evil sight of kind a eye of man ever rested upon at same moment blood red flag streamed out over taffrail soared away aloft until fluttered out from gaff end fit emblem of rapine murder red time by way of change remarked bowen to george in allusion to encounter with pirate schooner fought under black flag well change be good sometimes added philosophically will give taste of quality now cap'n be just shooting into right position to get full benefit of dose of round grape ' have prepared for yes give answered george drawing cutlas with one hand pistol with other throw open port lad commanded bowen at word port lid flew apart six twelve pounder be run out on side a barque be in very act of sheering alongside virginie starboard broadside be poured into with murderous effect a be evidenced by frightful outburst of yell groan imprecation at once arose on board broadside be returned without inflicting much damage pirate evidently having be taken completely by surprise by sudden unexpected unmasking of brig gun next moment two vessel collided with crash now look alive with grappling iron heave boarder follow cried george dashing to rail making spring thence in upon aurora deck mr bowen at same time leading detachment on board by way of fore rigging englishman be met by very formidable party have evidently be told off to board brig in instant fierce sanguinary melee arose on aurora deck spaniard for such proved to be though taken by surprise greatly disconcerted by unexpectedly warm reception have met with from brig fought with fury desperation of demon for perhaps five minute crew of virginie have work cut out to maintain position on deck of barque pirate with sanguinary symbol floating over head believing that have be entrapped into attacking man o ' war felt that halter be already about neck that there be literally no alternative victory death for pressed forward with such recklessness ferocity that deck speedily assumed aspect of human shamble planking grew so slippery with blood that became difficult to retain one footing upon there be one spaniard in particular who appeared to posse gift of ubiquity seemed to be in part of ship at same time notwithstanding crowded state of confined space wherein fight be raging in george speedily recognised truculent looking individual who have led pirate on eventful night of aurora capture who have so brutally ill used poor bowen on morning of sale in square at havana there must be possible doubt a to identity there be same ferocious cast of countenance same mahogany brown skin even same filthy red handkerchief now more filthy than ever bound about ragged lock apparently same broad brimmed straw hat in short mark of identification nothing be wanting individual dashed from point to point apparently by mere effort of will encouraging here chiding there helping everywhere mere fact of presence mere sound of voice appeared to endue pirate with renewed life courage george speedily saw that there must be little hope of victory until man must be placed hors de combat therefore pressed in toward plying cutlas vigorously with one hand laying manfully about with butt of empty pistol with other calling upon fellow by despicable epithet must think of to turn meet have very nearly reached there be only dozen people between two when voice that of bowen be heard next instant chief mate eye literally blazing with fury appeared forcing way into thickest of throng with strength of madman seized dashed aside who ventured to bar path in single moment so seemed to george forced within reach of especial enemy at last at last bloodthirsty scoundrel white livered coward who be not ashamed to strike chained man at last meet again a told must time have come for to pay off part of debt owe no skilfully guarding savage down stroke from spaniard cutlas take that added launching out terrific blow with left fist catching spaniard fairly between eye felling to deck senseless a neatly a butcher fell ox in moment george be at bowen side placing back to back two managed to successfully defend until crew of virginie inspired by leader example have pressed in to assistance when pirate becoming scattered be driven irresistibly to opposite end of ship be actually driven overboard then recognising that be defeated suddenly losing heart threw down weapon cried for quarter worst passion of virginia crew be by time fully aroused thought of nothing fact that enemy be pirate men steeped to lip in crime of vilest description guilty of unnumbered deed of blood curdling atrocity many of spaniard be ruthlessly slaughtered before george bowen must induce to stay hand then when order authority be once more restored head be counted be found that out of crew of over eighty twenty three pirate only leader included remained alive be promptly clapped in iron bundled unceremoniously below strange to say notwithstanding desperate character of fighting virginie crew have suffered slightly in comparison nine killed thirteen wounded being total of casualty short breathing space be allowed men to recover after extraordinary exertion then hand set to work to clear deck of sickening evidence of contest crew be next divided equally between two ship with mr bowen in command of aurora craft then made sail to windward in company third craft full rigged ship meanwhile be still in sight from aloft dodging about under easy canvas evidently waiting for aurora to rejoin there must be little doubt therefore be in possession of prize crew of pirate george earnestly hoped might be able to reach in time to save life of at least of to whom rightfully belonged couple of hour later be alongside virginie on weather aurora on lee quarter with port open gun run out english ensign flying at peak red flag having be allowed to remain aloft on board aurora until ranging alongside strange ship when be hauled down english flag run up on board barque brig simultaneously pirate in possession be completely paralysed by turn event have taken have evidently be under impression that aurora not virginie have proved victorious now that found under gun of ship mistake be past rectification accordingly at george order backed main yard hove to ship upon strong party armed to teeth proceeded on board took possession ship proved to be vulcan of from liverpool bound to kingston with valuable general cargo several passenger be noble ship being of nearly thousand ton register regular clipper on boarding george found state of affair pretty much what have be on board aurora after capture by same pirate crew male passenger being discovered scattered about deck lashed helplessly neck heel together chained to ring bolt in deck bulwark whilst pirate have taken possession of cabin have held regular saturnalia there in progress of unfortunate lady passenger have be subjected to vilest outrage one poor little child have be cruelly murdered before distracted mother face captain chief mate of ship be found in cabin in dying condition having be mutilated in most cruel horrible manner in ineffectual effort to wring from secret of hiding place of large amount of specie pirate have somehow ascertained be on board tall burly negro identical one who have acted a lieutenant to spaniard in charge of aurora on occasion of first capture be at head of gang have be instigator chief perpetrator in many outrage have followed capture of vulcan time be lost in freeing passenger crew from exceedingly unpleasant situation done pirate ten in number heavily ironed be transferred to virginie stowed carefully away below vulcan then proceeded on voyage in charge of second mate by whom george forwarded letter to admiral at jamaica informing of capture of now notorious aurora george now felt that with two ship so many desperate men to look after have hand full therefore decided to make best of way to england forthwith accordingly hailed bowen requesting to give aurora store overhaul to ascertain whether provision water be sufficient in quantity to justify in making push across atlantic in about hour answer be returned to effect that not only be there abundance of everything that ship be more than half full of varied very rich cargo spoil doubtless from many missing vessel upon receipt of intelligence order be at once given for ship to fill make best of way to northward in company by nightfall be clear of caycos passage standing to northward on taut bowline under heavy press of canvas virginie aurora made excellent passage across atlantic stood to northward until trade be cleared when fell in with fresh westerly wind carried way across a weather be fine have difficulty in keeping other in sight during whole passage two craft regulating spread of canvas so that must outsail other passage be consequently uneventful one nothing worthy of note occurring until be in chop of channel then indeed adventure befell proved george to have be wise in determination that two vessel must make voyage in company be last week in october have just struck sounding when two craft ran into dense raw fog compelled hand to seek warmth comfort in thickest jacket necessitated a matter of prudence immediate shortening of sail fog lasted couple of hour when cleared up aurora be discovered about two mile astern of brig large ship be at same moment made out directly ahead stranger be hove to under single reefed topsail with head to northward topsail yard being just visible from deck fact of being hove to in position seemed to point to conclusion that be man o war supposition be confirmed when george took look at through glass from fore topgallant yard be frigate french apparently from cut of canvas of course be quite possible that might be in english hand english often taking french prize into own navy sending to sea again with little alteration still george thought best to be on safe side accordingly at once ordered virginie to clear for action aurora being signalled to do same intention being to attack frigate if enemy since a far a must make out carried only twenty four gun in meantime however brig barque have be discovered by frigate at once made sail manoeuvred in such manner a to intercept bowen on other hand guessing at once what be in wind crowded sail upon aurora soon recovered position alongside virginie approaching latter vessel within hailing distance in order better to concert plan for possible coming engagement be soon arranged not before have become pretty evident from comparatively clumsy handling of stranger that be indeed french doubt such a be be set at rest when frigate have approached within mile of by hoisting tricolour at gaff end soon afterwards sent shot across fore foot a polite intimation that must oblige by heaving to however did nothing of kind piece of discourtesy so preyed upon french captain mind that without more ado bore down upon opened fire from starboard broadside three ship at moment formed three angle of nearly equilateral triangle side of measured about quarter of mile virginie aurora occupying a be two end of base frenchman being at apex allowed english ship to attack enemy on same side starboard compelled frenchman to fight with only battery soon saw how great disadvantage laboured under by arrangement did must to get between be to purpose george bowen be fully a wide awake a be successfully defeated effort of in direction principally must be confessed by lucky shooting on part whereby frenchman spar rigging be so cut up that craft soon became practically unmanageable at length after brisk fight of about twenty minute frenchman fore main topmast went simultaneously over side frigate luffed into wind obstinately remained there be at george mercy virginie at once made sail took up position across enemy bow aurora placed across stern from two advantageous position raking fire be opened in le than five minute caused frenchman to haul down flag surrender prize proved to be twenty four gun frigate cigne be at once taken possession of by boat from virginie aurora crew secured damage repaired about midnight three vessel made sail in company arriving without further adventure at spithead on day one following chapter twenty two well that end well anchor be sooner on bottom than george found busy man there be certain authority to be communicated with a to disposal of french prisoner other authority to be consulted a to disposal of pirate still others again to be seen arranged with a to disposal of prize then there be owner of vulcan to be dealt with in matter of salvage of vessel so that altogether be kept going to fro from morning until night then there be lucy to be called upon knowing thinking knew that sad news have to communicate must go far toward breaking heart of poor girl eagerly availed of excuse offered to defer visit so happened that whilst lucy who have heard with astonishment joy unspeakable news of strange reappearance good fortune waited impatiently for longed for visit george be postponing day after day until nearly fortnight have passed in truth be so worried harassed with unexpected difficulty even if must have found time lacked heart for call to intense surprise learned that though have arrived at spithead with three ship of belonged to to begin with virginie having be captured whilst captor be under protection of convoying squadron be claimed a being actually prize of squadron though not one of ship belonging to have fired shot struck blow to aid in capture then a to aurora having not only bought paid also fought for george be strongly of opinion that at least be here again appeared that be mistaken have be taken from by pirate have be out of possession more than twenty four hour be therefore de facto pirate lawful prize of virginie rather of virginie owner namely convoying fleet aforesaid same reasoning applied with equal effect to cigne naval authority certainly be good enough to admit that george crew be in virtue of having be actual captor of vessel entitled to certain moderate share of prize money accruing therefrom further than that must not go if george found busy man also found outside circle ruled by official jealousy famous story not only of gallant achievement also of misfortune leaked out a such story will soon found much sought after man quite lion in fact to extent indeed be case even curiosity of royalty be aroused in very midst of perplexity leicester received summons to present at court summons george of course dutifully promptly obeyed whilst there not only told whole story of adventure also laid before most gracious majesty grievance from considered to be suffering be well rewarded for pain for when king came to be fully informed of detail of case took matter in hand with result that speedy on whole fairly satisfactory settlement be arrived at be also offered commission in navy majesty sagely remarking that so good man ought to be serving country in better way than by commanding mere merchant ship time george be sensible enough to accept offer at suggestion commission be also offered to accepted by bowen business being at length satisfactorily concluded george have further excuse for shunning sea view accordingly on first opportunity set out with considerable perturbation of spirit for alverstoke be about seven o'clock in evening quite dark when george reached house passing through gate strode up well remembered pathway administered sounding rat tat at door smart fresh looking maid servant answered summons on inquiry for miss walford showed into familiar parlour asked for name captain leicester answered george yes sir certainly sir said girl eyeing george with such undisguised curiosity admiration a showed that have undoubtedly heard portion at least of story missus will be down in minute sir please to take seat sir george settled comfortably in chair near fire looking round at well remembered picture curio still adorned room fell into reverie in mind travelled backward took again in imagination through have happened to since last sat in room from be brought back abruptly to present by opening of door entrance of lucy ah how george heart leapt within bosom a looked at be just same charming girl a when have seen last yet there be subtle difference be trifle more womanly form be more fully developed if be shade paler only made loveliness more distractingly bewitching than ever lucky ned thought george to have be chosen lover of such woman a ay though only for few short hour how willingly must change place with so have come at last captain said lucy offering delicate little hand be beginning to think that with honour have be showered upon have quite forgotten former friend lucy have not answered george have not forgotten one of least of have forgotten forgotten why have never ceased to remember believe single waking hour have passed over head since last met have not thought of lucy laughed blithely saw by earnestness of manner that be speaking literal truth have not forgotten must yet be well fie fie captain said be easily to be seen that have be to court have learned so thoroughly art of flattery have exclaimed george have heard of visit to majesty then yes indeed answered lucy have heard not only that believe whole story be possible be ignorant of fact that name be in everybody mouth that story be public property so have heard about remarked george then hope to heaven that have also already heard sad news came over to break to evening see be in black yes said lucy growing very grave at once be in mourning for poor mother died nearly year ago what be sad news of have to speak to have not heard then said george well be about cousin edward regret to say that bring bad news of be referring to death asked lucy with just faintest suspicion of tremor in voice because if so have already heard of of noble self sacrificing behaviour on behalf a relative a indeed only surviving relative let here now thank george in earnestness sincerity for devotion to unfortunate cousin by jove bear well ca have cared so very much for after thought george thanks be necessary assure be reply only did for what must have done with equal readiness for stranger have vowed that must be protector to must if god willed restore to arm be grieved failed to keep vow believe be through fault of mine failed lucy did best must god willed otherwise yes yes answered lucy in dazed sort of way yes god willed otherwise do mean george by talking about restoring to arm one must think to hear speak be married to well said george betrothal be sort of marriage be not betrothal exclaimed lucy looking more bewildered than ever pray explain captain leicester assure have not slightest idea of what mean be now george turn to look mystified idea of what mean stammered why why be engaged to cousin edward walford be not new light suddenly flashed into lucy mind all along have be convinced that there be reason for george failure to visit on occasion of previous arrival in port now matter be assuredly on eve of explanation so looked up into george face said quietly george never be engaged to cousin proposed to refused explicitly in most unmistakable term did panted george heart throbbing tumultuously when be that on evening of day when last arrived in portsmouth harbour in industry then in moment suspicion of truth dawned upon george be on same evening met out there close to church confided to a great secret circumstance that have just accepted be so near a yet never called for shame george exclaimed lucy well see be in fact must not plain truth be be on way to at time to try own fortune with when be told that have accepted cousin well felt must meet just then stammered george with desperate energy poor george murmured lucy how well cousin understood unsuspicious character knew must never occur to to doubt word told that tale to keep away from from from what from whom asked george oh lucy be possible that if have carried out original resolution night must have accepted yes george must indeed be murmured reply have loved only for long time not longer than have loved added roguishly a george took in arm avast there whither be running be high time that must 'bout ship haul off on opposite tack if must not be regarded a impertinent intruder love making be most delightful pastime particularly when come in at end of long period of suffering hardship misunderstanding loses piquant
