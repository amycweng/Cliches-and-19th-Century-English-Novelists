enthusiastic than pride obstinacy however be such that having once put hand to plough be quite determined that nothing short of actual physical incapacity must compel to turn back stretched off land close hauled upon starboard tack whole of day greater part of succeeding night skipper object being a gathered from remark two overheard between first lieutenant to get well over toward french coast where if fortune favoured might be lucky enough to pick up prize two a day wore on wind increased considerably in strength at end of first dog watch order be given to take down reef in topsail to stow course topsail yard be accordingly lowered down upon cap crew proceeded aloft to execute duty of green hand evincing very marked disinclination to go more than way up lower rigging when at length by dint of mingled force persuasion be got a high a top two three refused point blank to lay out upon yard first lieutenant raved at stamped furiously upon deck threatened unutterable thing if did not lay out forthwith captain of top not to be behindhand proceeded vigorously to freshen way with rope end latter persuasive appeared to have desired effect slowly with excessive caution men proceeded to lay out suddenly foot of one of on main yard slipped clung convulsively for moment to yard then whirled off backwards striking main rigging on weather side rebounding into sea instantly there arose startling cry of man overboard know not what possessed in excitement of moment without in least thinking of what be doing sooner saw man strike water than rushed aft leaped upon taffrail pausing single instant to mark spot where fell raised hand above head took most scientific header into boiling surge a be descending toward water heard hearty cheer from men then icy cold wave closed over head there be rushing sound in ear darkness around when rose to surface found close to drowning man who be struggling feebly in aimless sort of way apparently half stunned lying face downwards in water swimming happened to be one of very few accomplishment in excelled otherwise think at probable must have leapt overboard so unhesitatingly be that a may though have never be in rough water before though now be overboard sea seemed incomparably more tempestuous than have appeared to be from ship deck felt perfectly at home paddling cautiously up to man seized by hair turned over on back then threw upon back dragged head up high enough upon breast to lift mouth out of water supporting by vigorous stroke with foot looking round a rose on crest of sea must dimly descry brig through rapidly increasing gloom to horror appeared to be long distance away have time only however for momentary glance when sank into trough lost sight of few second afterwards caught sight of again time be displaying in rigging lantern sight of regarded rightly a afterwards turned out a sign token effort must be used to recover truly feeble gleam appearing disappearing a rose fell upon agitated surface of sea be to very star of hope encouragement vigorous effort to keep man afloat soon told upon began to fear must be obliged to abandon prize in order to preserve own life luckily for however companion have ceased to struggle now lay supported within arm to appearance dead a time dragged heavily away grew more more exhausted at length man slipped from relaxing grasp began to sink happily at instant caught momentary glimpse of small object standing out black distinct against narrow belt of light lying along western horizon felt instinctively that be boat coming in search of sight imparted new energy to nerveless frame recovering grasp upon man just a be sinking beyond reach determined to keep above water until succour arrived go down with how anxiously kept watch upon boat desperate effort made to keep afloat must be impossible to describe dancing craft appeared to be lying at anchor upon water though in reality be foaming down towards before wind sea propelled by strong arm of eight of stoutest oarsman in ship at length however be near enough to enable to discern bow man standing up one hand shading eye other grasping boat hook presently hail came down upon wind toward from boat directly afterwards be by time too weak to reply must only hope that must pull on until close enough to see to inexpressible horror however when seven eight length away boat head swerved sharply aside craft darted off upon course at right angle to former one then indeed uttered shriek loud enough to awake seven sleeper immediately went under thought be now over with love of life be strong especially in young convulsive struggle brought once more to surface blinded with salt water with sens fast leaving no longer looked round for boat battled desperately though more than half unconsciously for life still retaining with tenacious grasp of drowning hold upon companion at length heard faintly a though in dream voice saying there be port sir hard then became utter blank first indication of returning consciousness be sound of surgeon voice saying all right be coming to will save yet thank god for presently exclaimed voice recognised a skipper must not have lost lad for worth of posse never saw more plucky thing in life if life will grow up to be ornament to service at point opened eye found of speaker bent upon with expression of deep solicitude furthermore found that have be stripped of wet clothing be lying in captain own cot with doctor one of seaman rubbing limb body so vigorously with bare hand in endeavour to restore brisk circulation seemed to be in imminent danger of being flayed alive how do feel now boy inquired skipper a bent over side of cot laid hand kindly upon own very much better sir thank replied though to tell truth be at moment enduring most acute pain in nerve of body physical suffering attendant upon returning tide of life being actually much greater than experienced while be undergoing process of drowning be right returned in cheery tone of voice be glad to hear a man in ship will be have performed right gallant action be sure will be glad to know that effort have not be in vain poor fellow whom rescued be alive likely to do well felt too weak to make reply to gratifying speech fact doctor instantly perceived for turned to skipper remarked with permission sir will now leave lad in quiet to sleep off exhaustion will just mix simple restorative while steward tuck in make comfortable for night after think may safely leave rest to nature though of course will look in upon of patient from time to time so a to make quite sure that be going on right if worthy medico fulfilled promise to look in upon during night feel quite sure did be blissfully unconscious of fact for under soothing influence of restorative draught warmth of blanket liberally heaped upon by captain steward speedily sank into deep dreamless refreshing slumber delicious oblivion from awoke in morning to find very little worse for exertion of previous night when opened eye saw through open door of state room that sun be streaming brightly down through skylight lighting up cosy little cabin bringing out to fullest advantage flowing tint of three four well executed picture be secured to bulkhead altogether imparting delightfully cheerful appearance to apartment vessel however be in violent motion must from position in cot look out through stern window saw that there be heavy sea running roar of wind through rigging be distinctly audible above sound of creaking timber rattling door trampling foot swish of heavy shower of spray upon deck told be blowing hard felt so greatly recovered however resolved to get up springing out of cot proceeded to dress with a much alacrity a rolling pitching of ship must permit while engaged in occupation doctor entered cabin hillo exclaimed turning out eh well done young gentleman steady have not shipped sea leg yet a friend first lieutenant must say must be cautious will be thrown against something other get nasty knock well how do feel morning trifle weak replied be dare say will be better when have have breakfast be sort responded jolly old medico if be hungry there be not much wrong with mentioned breakfast have notion what time may happen to be not much replied fear be rather late that depends upon what call late retorted of town bred dandy be only in first nap about time a matter of absolute fact however have just gone eight bell noon so that see young friend breakfast be over long enough ago dare say patterson can find something for same rang small hand bell stood on table captain steward made appearance patterson said doctor young gentleman complains that be hungry have trifle such a wing of chicken something of sort in pantry that must give sir replied man with grin be afraid have not if nice rasher of bacon cup of coffee will do splendidly interrupted to tell truth doctor be hungry enough to eat horse harness so will be very glad to have rasher of bacon anything else be quickly obtainable patterson be not long in getting ready promised repast cleared to last morsel after made way on deck skipper be there promenading weather side of quarter deck first luff jogging fore aft alongside of be called up few kind inquiry made together with eulogistic remark two upon conduct of previous evening whole neatly finished off with intimation that having begun so well great thing must be expected of in future that having established reputation for zeal gallantry be hoped must do utmost to maintain after be dismissed soon found that exploit have placed upon quite different footing in ship from have occupied before men treated with real respect instead of good humoured burlesque thereof have accorded hitherto fellow mids at once received into berth upon footing of perfect equality with one striving to do little kindness show little attention in place of playing off disagreeable practical joke upon must not have be midshipman have not have jocular remark two to make upon subject be said in good part wind continued to blow hard during whole of day toward sunset moderated somewhat veered point two to northward ship have be under close reefed topsail fore topmast staysail ever since midnight of night before chapter two how lost sun be just sinking below horizon parting beam lighting up gorgeously heavy bank of cloud hung low down in western quarter when lookout man aloft hailed sail on weather bow everybody be instantly on alert what do make out to be hailed mr sennitt first lieutenant while skipper turned to said mr chester be good enough to slip down into cabin bring up telescope if please a made dive down companion heard lookout hail again be large lugger sir can make out quite plainly be just in wake of sun hand make sail be next order given a quick a lightning got glass hurrying on deck with placed in skipper hand men be by time lying out on yard shaking couple of reef out of topsail loosing course captain brisac slung telescope over shoulder springing into rigging made way aloft to crosstrees where lookout still sat with one hand grasping topgallant shroud other shading eye skipper braced firmly against topmost head raised telescope to eye took good long look at stranger closed glass sharply descended to deck again with agility of monkey midshipman be lugger sure enough large one too remarked a rejoined first lieutenant there can be doubt that be french have strong suspicion that be privateer on lookout for of homeward bound vessel think have made out yet when saw be jogging easily along under fore mizzen lug small jib if doe not see within next five minute chance be that will not make out at until moon rise will not be for quite hour by time hope will have drawn pretty close up to lookout be hailed from time to time to inquire whether lugger have made more sail not time cheering reply be not yet sir at length reply be be too dark to see now sir have not when lost sight of brig be now tearing along under single reefed topsail course fore topmast staysail jib spanker lee side buried deep in foaming brine sea coming bodily in over bow by ton at time no longer rose lightly over opposing wave dashed headlong into rushing forward upon way like startled courser night glass in ship be brought into requisition by eager officer in endeavour to catch occasional glimpse of stranger night have settled down pitchy dark sky having rapidly become obscured by thick veil of cloud immediately after disappearance of sun below horizon so that not so much a solitary star be visible effort to get sight of chase be consequently quite in vain so dark be that standing by taffrail be impossible to see a far a bow of ship not light of description be permitted on board scourge even binnacle light be carefully masked captain brisac soon began to manifest great deal of anxiety at risk be undoubtedly incurring in thus driving ship at racing speed through thick darkness without warning light of description to indicate presence to other craft contented however with placing five of sharpest sighted men on lookout namely one on flying jibboom end one on cat head one on of fore yardarm bearing of chase have of course be very accurately taken last thing before losing sight of when be estimated to be ten mile distant about two point on weather bow going along upon easy bowline scourge be exceedingly smart little brig under canvas when additional sail have be set brace sheet tack bowline trimmed with utmost nicety be general opinion that be going good honest eleven knot chase be thought to be travelling at rate of four knot at most be hoped therefore that when moon rose must find within three four mile of suspense be compelled to endure a best might caused time to drag heavily on at length however brightening of sky in eastern quarter proclaimed welcome approach of moon slowly very slowly brightness increased veil of cloud breaking up before revealing sky beyond luminous with silvery radiance few more anxious minute round white disc of moon rose slowly upwards into view flinging broad path of light across tumbling billow gleaming pale ghostly on sail of lugger now appeared directly ahead of about five mile distant instantly glass in ship be levelled at chase general exclamation of annoyance arose a while still engaged in taking first long look at pursuer observed sudden fluttering of canvas about mainmast speedily resolved unmistakably into lofty well set mainsail ah ejaculated skipper stamping foot impatiently on deck evidently have sharp eye on board yonder lugger must have seen moment that moon rose yes returned first lieutenant with eye still glued to glass sharp eye appear to belong to equally sharp crew be shaking out reef fore aft shifting jib at same time depend upon sir will have to work for craft before get will catch mr sennitt never fear be cheery response can not be above size will have chance with in breeze a anticipate be more heavily armed than be though may possibly carry few more men skipper will of course escape if can when find that impossible will equally of course fight very likely fight well still think will have much difficulty in taking in meantime however remarked sennitt who have glass constantly at eye unless be greatly mistaken be gradually creeping away from rigging doe not show out a plainly a did ten minute ago yet there be more light long anxious observation of chase by officer followed imitating example also brought glass to bear upon flying craft flying literally seemed to be rather than sailing at one moment hull be completely hidden by intervening wave crest sail only being visible next must rush into view low hull deluged with spray glanced in moonlight like shower of diamond a flew over almost to height of low mast head dissipated in sea to leeward while mast bent like willow wand inclining at what seemed to fearfully perilous angle with horizon upon word sennitt fear be right at last said skipper bringing glass reluctantly down into hollow of arm let lay glass aside for hour will then be better able to judge ship be gaining upon other if find that be losing ground there will be nothing for to shake remaining reef out of topsail get flying jib on spar be good rigging new ought to be quite capable of standing little extra strain will be rather risky business to increase strain already laid upon spar said first lieutenant glancing anxiously aloft at topmast be springing buckling at plunge of ship with enormous pressure of tightly distended topsail still be perhaps worth trying must be fine feather in cap if must send into port first prize of war stipulated half hour passed away at end of period unwelcome conviction forced upon one that lugger be having best of there be help for mr sennitt said skipper shake reef out of topsail set flying jib must bear excited by exhilarating influence of chase hand sprang aloft with utmost alacrity in incredibly short space of time have reel out topsail distended to fullest extent flying jib flapped wildly in wind for moment two then yielded to restraint of sheet at tugged a though must tear away cleat to be secured effect of addition to before heavy pressure of canvas upon ship be immediate to inexperience highly alarming brig now lay over upon side to extent that be with utmost difficulty must retain footing upon steeply inclined slippery plane of deck lee sail be completely buried in sea boiled in over lee bow surged aft along deck like mill race while ever anon ominous crack aloft told of severity of strain upon overtaxed spar mr sennitt kept glancing uneasily upward a portentous sound smote upon ear captain brisac observing turned to first lieutenant said be alarmed sennitt be only spar settling into berth crash sprang instinctively aft to taffrail out of way of wreck then looked up to see topmast snapped off like carrot just above cap go swooping over to leeward to hang by rigging under lee of course while ship with sharp shock a though have touched upon unseen rock recovered floated once more upon almost even keel captain brisac be much too gentlemanly to swear simply turned to first lieutenant said have rather overdone time sennitt however be use cry over spilt milk so turn hand up please let clear away wreck repair damage a soon a possible boom of distant gun told that crew of lugger have not be unobservant of misfortune that be willing to expend charge of powder in acquainting with exultation thereat by daybreak next morning have everything ataunt again chase however have run completely out of sight hour before be at event for present hopelessly lost to wind have gone down very considerably during night have hauled round to about due north sea went rapidly down sky be cloudless intensely blue air became keen frosty when sun rose found standing to westward under topgallant sail without single sail of kind in sight chapter three sans culotte adage that be ill wind blow nobody good maintained reputation for truth even in case of seemingly unmitigated disaster of previous night be to say at least a far a be concerned inasmuch a knowledge experience acquired of profession during operation of clearing away wreck recovering sail rigging undamaged spar fitting new topmast into place restoring ship generally to former condition gave advantage must scarcely have hoped to secure in le than six month of ordinary run of active service watched with unflagging interest progress of operation a work went forward with result learned by actual observation coupled with best use of reasoning faculty frequent question to mr sennitt who may say heard answered inquiry with quite astonishing patience position use of rope that saw fitted mode of working yard much other valuable knowledge be surprising how speedily human curiosity becomes quickened aroused if individual devotes earnestly to study of art science thirst for knowledge increase with acquisition at least such be experience be not to be satisfied until mystery connected with such art science have be mastered made inalienable property of student be so with in relation to everything connected with profession having gained certain amount of knowledge concerning mystery of seamanship craved for more throwing energy into discharge of daily round of duty made such rapid progress a astonished everybody included scourge meanwhile be slowly pursuing course down channel wind after recent blow having fallen light baffling be not therefore until morning of th that reached cruising ground scilly bearing at time about ne distant mile day broke clear cloudless with light air of wind from southward water being smooth save for long rolling swell of atlantic at spot in question made very distinctly felt air be mild springlike unclouded sunbeam struck with perceptible sensation of warmth one on board forgetting recent misery of cold wet greeted welcome change with corresponding flow of exuberant animal spirit hand have just be piped to breakfast when lookout aloft reported sail right ahead recalling to mind skipper request on previous occasion at once ran down into cabin for telescope brought on deck handed to thank mr chester said have remarked with very great pleasure real in discharge of duty go on a have begun boy will soon become valuable efficient officer captain brisac did not however go aloft time mr clewline second lieutenant happened to be on deck at moment skipper handed glass with polite request that must see what must make of mr clewline thought seemed rather to resent suggestion a affront to dignity however made demur proceeded aloft with great deliberation seating upon fore topsail yard took very leisurely observation of stranger having devoted about quarter of hour to occupation slowly closed telescope carefully slinging over shoulder descended to deck with same deliberation have characterised ascent be not until have regained skipper side that condescended to make report when handing back glass with stiff bow said make out stranger to be brig apparently french of about own size be standing directly toward upon starboard tack under topgallant sail thank sir returned skipper shortly then turning upon heel went below to cabin patterson having come on deck minute two before to announce breakfast be ready news quickly spread through ship that sail in sight be supposed to be frenchman a two vessel be approaching other action in event of mr clewline supposition proving correct inevitable considerable amount of excitement prevailed men bolted breakfast in le than time usually devoted to meal returned to deck moment have disposed of last morsel while officer betrayed at least equal amount of eagerness two three of hastily swallowing cup of scalding coffee munching up biscuit without giving time even to sit down old sennitt a be irreverently termed in midshipman berth be one of earliest to put in appearance after breakfast first act be to go straight aloft with glass devoted more time even than mr clewline to examination of stranger be not until captain brisac have returned to deck hailed that made move a came aft joined superior upon quarter deck exultation be visible in face in movement of body be all right sir exclaimed be french beyond possibility of doubt cut of canvas be alone sufficient evidence of nationality in order that there may be room for question of have furled royal have run up tricolour to main royal mast head be brig a far a can make out rig coming end on to a be seems about size perhaps trifle larger suppose may a well clear for action at once if please mr sennitt not to be behindhand with let see colour of bunting before do anything else order to clear for action be received with enthusiasm little round ball immediately soared aloft breaking abroad displaying naval ensign a touched main truck be greeted with rousing cheer green hand be by time not quite so verdant a have be few day before mr sennitt having drilled most remorselessly at available opportunity a have be very judiciously intermingled with experienced salt in appointing to various station work went on with a captain brisac remarked very creditable celerity in little more than hour yard have be slung bulkhead knocked down magazine opened gun cast loose loaded run out other preparation completed meanwhile two brig have be slowly drawing together by be be within couple of mile of other there have be little manoeuvring on side to secure weather gage skipper perceiving that action be likely to be thereby delayed speedily yielded point allowed frenchman to take coveted position will make very little difference five minute after be engaged remarked to first lieutenant who after having gone round personally seen that everything be ready have rejoined aft just a order have be given to helmsman of scourge to keep away there be one thing have not yet done continued seems quite unnecessary may a well avoid possibility of mistake by showing private signal private signal be accordingly shown evoked a be expected response be consequently hauled down again now everybody made finally ready for impending conflict reader will naturally feel curious to know whether on first occasion of smelling gunpowder experienced sensation of fear be old enough now have seen enough of service to have misapprehension of being misunderstood rather misjudged will therefore confess truth candidly acknowledge that for few minute after completion of preparation felt most horribly frightened knew be about to be involved in scene of death destruction of sickening slaughter of even more sickening physical suffering anticipated seeing fellow men struck down right left limb torn away quite possibly body cut in two by cruel chain shot looked round upon order cleanliness everywhere prevailed on board ship contrasted existent condition of thing with picture imagination conjured up of impending blood carnage admit that for few minute heart almost failed that state of feeling however soon passed away be succeeded by condition of painful excitement impatience lasted until first shot be fired when abruptly subsided leaving a cool collected a be at present moment be not too frightened however to notice admire perfect sang froid with captain brisac mr sennitt contemplated approach of antagonist stood side by side just abaft main rigging scrutinising movement on board french ship exchanging critical remark upon smartness of crew in shortening sail executing various manoeuvre usual on board ship going into action gathered with very comfortable feeling that from what observed quite anticipated hard fight when ship have approached other within quarter of mile be able for first time to ascertain actual armament of foe mr sennitt be first to seize opportunity of counting port be who announced loud enough for everybody to hear that showed six gun of side making entire battery heavier than own by four gun make very fair match for contentedly remarked will engage at close quarter mr sennitt said skipper be good enough therefore to have gun double shotted let man fire until give word will wait until be fairly abreast of then give whole larboard broadside at once luff may to master who have taken wheel luff shave a closely a can without actually touching steady so will do very nicely a french ship came up fired gun along larboard broadside commencing from forward moment must be brought to bear shot came tearing in through bulwark making splinter fly in direction in ignorance expected to see about crew go down before that first discharge to unbounded surprise not man be hurt frenchman be by time so close that must not only see with utmost distinctness crew reloading gun must hear confused jabber of excited conversation appeared to be going on unchecked on board what contrast to own ship where man stood at post steady silent a statue at last two ship came up fairly abreast of other be passing so closely that active man might have jumped from one to other when skipper uttered word fire four gun of larboard broadside rang out simultaneously concussion of air causing two ship to heel outwards through noise of explosion distinctly heard crashing of timber piercing shriek of wounded be one to draw first blood chuckled voice behind looked round to observe young fellow mid rubbing hand with air of great satisfaction hard up with helm exclaimed skipper shiver main topsail let wear short round stand by gun there on starboard broadside fire a bring to bear effect of manoeuvre be to lay ship almost directly athwart stern of frenchman so smartly be executed that have pretty effectually raked before be able to bear up give broadside whole of flew over harmlessly except for hole two in sail fight now became running one ship going off before wind frenchman rather evincing disposition to keep at distance did not seem to like taste 'd have of quality a heard irish captain of after gun on port side remark possessed rather advantage of in matter of speed slowly edged down upon until be once more close alongside when ship exchanged broadside firing at same moment must see white mark in antagonist side where shot have struck from defective aim because wanted to shoot away spar shot again flew high with worse result than severing of starboard main topsail brace casualty took minute two to repair two three more broadside be exchanged without visible effect then unlucky shot wounded fore topmast so badly that after tottering for minute two went over bow dragging main topgallant mast down with captain brisac proved quite equal to occasion must not prevent scourge from broaching to so ordering helm to be put hard port luffed right athwart frenchman stern pouring in larboard broadside have be disengaged since opening fire with such good effect that french ship main yard be shot away mainmast head badly wounded strong gang be immediately set to work board on ship to repair damage a frenchman by reason of loss of after sail be unable to bring ship upon wind have alternative to run dead before fully exposed meanwhile to raking effect of larboard gun be kept playing upon until have passed out of range not one of gun during time being able to reply took rather over one hour to clear away wreck get topmast on end fully rig make sail once more mr sennitt who personally superintended work insisted that must be thoroughly well done a well done in fact a though have not be in presence of enemy french have in meantime be quite a active a ourselves if work be not so neatly done a own still be done after fashion be ready to make sail few minute before advantage of availed with such alacrity that became evident chief anxiety be to place in shortest possible time greatest possible distance between project however by mean met view of scourge instant that be possible available stitch of canvas be packed upon ship with view of closing with enemy again a promptly a possible then began that most wearisome of wearisome business stern chase in light breeze during whole crew from skipper downwards whistled most devoutly for wind slowly very slowly gained upon chase master who have resigned wheel at cessation of action standing upon forecastle with sextant measuring about once five minute angle between mast head water line of chase to ascertain ship gained upon other at last think be within range now sir will try shot from bow chaser said mr sennitt can scarcely reach yet be afraid said skipper there will be harm in trying order be given old tompion gunner undertook in person task of levelling gun went about work with much deliberation great display of science at length watching favourable opportunity fired in moment white sear started into view near frenchman rudder close to water edge hulled by be clever exclaimed first luff while gratified tompion looked slowly round upon messmate with modest pride beaming from feature returned with thanks murmured young harvey who be stationed close beside a puff of smoke veiled for instant stern of antagonist then shot be seen bounding toward path marked by jet of water flew up wherever ball struck at last be seen to scurry along surface for short distance finally disappearing within about fifty fathom of bow try shot there forward said skipper aim for spar guinea to first man who knock away spar big little man in ship be of course anxious to try hand mr sennitt be obliged to interfere with view of allowing best shot to have first chance curiously indifferent shooting now ensued very eagerness of men seeming to render unsteady have strolled forward to watch game after several most exasperating miss exclaimed must like very much to try believe must do better than then try will youngster said mr sennitt first shot man ever fire be often very lucky one perhaps yours may be so will fire next shot while gun be being loaded tompion availed of opportunity to deliver short lesson on gunnery for especial benefit of that remember be that attached great importance to trajectory be eloquent on subject of parabolic curve have watched with much impatience very scrupulous nicety with most of men pretended to lay gun be strongly impressed with conviction that over carefulness have much to do with repeated failure took very little trouble therefore beyond seeing that muzzle of gun have good elevation after simply waited squinting along sight until saw that weapon be just about to come in line with frenchman mast when pulled trigger line smartly be dragged forcibly backwards by collar just in time to avoid serious blow from recoiling gun turned angrily round to ascertain what reckless individual be who have thus dared to lay unholy hand upon when thought be diverted by ringing cheer from hand shot have lodged in frenchman mainmast head just above cap while still looked away went main topmast dragging fore topgallant mast down with received vast amount of praise for exploit of course be merely lucky shot with skill have nothing whatever to do chapter four first capture after rapidly overhauled chase by time that crew have got wreck cleared out of way be once more alongside french crew have ceased firing stern chaser upon fall of main topmast be opinion of many that have struck flag coming down with topmast not being re hoisted therefore ceased firing also before be fairly alongside have rigged small staff out over taffrail have run flag up again be approaching frenchman upon starboard quarter with intention of pouring in larboard broadside directly two ship be fairly abreast when antagonist suddenly ported helm threw right athwart hawse evolution being performed exactly at instant rendered collision unavoidable helm be immediately put hard starboard with intention of passing under stern if possible there be not sufficient room struck just abaft main chain shock bringing down mainmast have previously be badly wounded while at same moment starboard broadside came crashing in through bow with most destructive effect one of gun being dismounted foremast struck in two place within foot of other wheel smashed to piece singularly enough helmsman escaped without scratch one poor fellow fell forward upon gun disembowelled wind being light shock of collision be very gentle did damage to hull of vessel two brig dropped alongside other head stern must soon have scraped clear again french threw grapnel into rigging instant that dropped alongside immediately boarded whole thing be so sudden that captain brisac be for single instant confused rallied next however shouting boarder repel boarder put at head of men french captain led on boarding party with magnificent dash resolution for first minute men be driven irresistibly back then came turn of tide english maddened at disgrace of being forced to yield ground to hated enemy recovered in turn pressed french back again inch of deck being fiercely contested captain brisac french captain soon singled other out after few unavailing effort succeeded in reaching other crossing sword skipper be slight man of middle height very great personal strength while frenchman be perfect giant fight between therefore be very unequal one especially a captain brisac possessed little skill with sword few pass be made without effect on side then frenchman made downward cut at antagonist head with such tremendous force that skipper guard be fairly beaten down have not adversary cutlas turned edge must in probability have be cloven to chin a be received heavy blow on head with back of weapon partially stunned placed completely at french captain mercy cutlas be instantly raised to repeat stroke when in agony of apprehension at imminent danger threatened man who have shown so much kindness drew pistol from belt thrusting muzzle into frenchman face pulled trigger man flung up arm fell backwards dead distorted feature blood bespattered presenting hideous sight haunted for many day afterwards sight of blood be said to madden animal be sure maddened for furious with excitement forthwith dashed headlong into thickest of melee quite regardless of consequence using with such savage freedom cutlas snatched out of hand of wounded man that french recoiled on side with look of dismay while own men pressing forward with renewed vigour at length drove enemy back to own ship hurrah lad after exclaimed far too excited to give thought to singularity of newly made midshipman presuming to assume leadership in presence of superior men caught enthusiasm responding with ringing cheer after went helter skelter so rapidly that english french tumbled over bulwark together there be momentary effort on part of french to make stand on reaching own deck be a crew now thoroughly demoralised lad blood at last completely roused gave time to rally cut down man who offered slightest opposition seeing that case be hopeless french crew flung down arm cried for quarter in le than two minute from instant of boarding found master of sans culotte privateer mounting eight long pounder four pound carronades with crew originally of eighty one men of whom nine be killed twenty wounded own loss being one man killed one wounded action lasted three hour proved to be first engagement of war much to gratification of mr sennitt who be intensely anxious for distinction of sending in first prize first duty be of course to secure possession after weather appearing likely to continue fine hand be piped to dinner such dinner be a must be procured on spur of moment galley fire having be extinguished at time of clearing for action captain brisac allowed hour for meal little repose at expiration of hand be set to work to clear away wreck repair damage task kept busy until considerably after sunset by eight pm however preparation be complete prize crew be placed on board sans culotte nice little breeze having in meantime sprung up from westward made sail in company shaping course for plymouth off arrived about noon next day prize now being safe from chance of recapture be sent in while scourge hauling wind upon starboard tack reached off land on way back to appointed cruising ground on following day about hour before time for serving dinner in cabin patterson captain steward popped head in at door of midshipman berth announced captain compliment will be glad to have pleasure of mr chester company at dinner tell captain brisac with compliment that be much obliged for courteous invitation accept with very great pleasure responded looking up from day work upon be busy with slate pencil be lucky dog chester exclaimed young harvey seem to have dropped plump into skipper good book at once be not often that mids be honoured with invitation to cabin table can tell oh come now harvey protest against imposing upon unfortunate chester in manner interposed little markham nicknamed goliath because measured exactly three foot six inch in stocking know a well a do that be invited into cabin to night in order that skipper may give good wigging for boarding business yesterday hope wo be very hard upon old chap added in tone of deep sympathy turning to for somehow have taken quite liking to if have be at elbow yesterday instead of over grown lout harvey must have kept out of serape must be very quiet submissive when pitch into plead ignorance say will be good boy not do again know have really done anything very dreadful inquired more than half taken in by young monkey serious manner oh lord hold somebody while faint exclaimed turning up white of eye like dying duck in thunder storm flinging so suddenly backwards into arm of harvey that latter went down stern foremost landing on deck with one hand in beef kid other in blacking box while markham rolled on top of kicking spasmodically simulating feeble struggle of expiring person luckily for goliath be ludicrous side of episode presented most strongly to victim sound thrashing must in probability have be portion a be pair scrambled to foot again with hearty laugh a good friend a ever declare chester will be death of day if go on like resumed must be tormentor touching innocence must move brass monkey to tear why continued looking round addressing in low measured tone intended to express overwhelming astonishment fragment of glass still clung to one corner of frame hanging suspended against bulkhead did duty a mirror asks if have really done anything very dreadful be actually possible gentle infant that be ignorant of fact that yesterday took command out of superior officer hand that punishment for crime when happens to be first offence be keelhauling while repetition thereof be visited with extreme penalty of law pray what be keelhauling inquired beginning to perceive that mercurial friend be merely indulging in joke at expense keelhauling sir replied be form of punishment consists in being lashed to stout rope be passed under ship bottom whereby unhappy criminal be dragged along keel from forward aft being required during journey to gather sufficiency of barnacle off ship bottom to furnish satisfying breakfast for captain next morning if unfortunate wretch fails process be to be repeated with addition on second occasion quantity of barnacle provided be to be sufficient for captain first lieutenant good gracious how horrible exclaimed assuming a well a must expression of serious concern have idea be exposing to risk of such fearful punishment what must advise to do well be by mean easy question to answer replied will tell what will do though must like to help out of scrape if can will take opportunity of speaking to skipper before go down to dinner asking not to pas sentence of punishment upon for present then if will keep watch for to night will get interview with on quiet while be doing so have little influence with modesty forbids to say how got if ask for sake to forgive may very possibly do so expect will make reference to affair while at dinner though if doe only chance will be to keep in good humour can easily do if only know how unfortunately know how exclaimed infusing a much anxiety a must into tone manner no returned well will tell if solemnly engage never under circumstance to divulge source of information thought extremely good with harvey sitting by demurely listening to conversation instead of saying so gravely entered into required engagement be right remarked now listen attentively to skipper have one overpowering weakness be fondness for comic song let be ever so exasperated comic song good comic song mind never fails to soothe therefore if must happen to night by chance to refer to unfortunate lapse of duty yesterday listen patiently respectfully to that have to say when have finished even if what say strike a being of laudatory character be very curious fellow in respect often beginning by praising man when mean to end by blowing up sky high just bow to say with permission sir will now change subject by singing comic song strike up boldly at once may safely venture to say will be supremely astonished at effect will produce if mr clewline wish to see on deck at once please mr markham said marine popping head in at door oh right returned markham will be up in minute two be great nuisance assure dear chester poor old clewline be positively at sea unless have constantly at right hand to mr clewline said if did come at once mr markham be to just fetch ye said marine introducing head once more very well lead on fellow follow ejaculated of gath in voice expressive of deep disgust forthwith disappeared up steep ladder followed by hearty peal of laughter from late audience what fellow be exclaimed harvey presently be very glad to see that understand chester otherwise be afraid must have got into end of scrape not that mean harm far from be one of best natured fellow alive be so wedded to practical joking that believe nothing will ever break of keep whole ship alive a will have seen by time be always in disgrace during last cruise may be said to have taken up permanent abode at mast head daresay be there now be even so for when went aft to cabin in compliance with captain invitation glance aloft revealed comfortably perched on crosstrees from commanding position reminded pantomimically of potent charm to be found in comic song dinner party that evening consisted of captain brisac mr sennitt old doctor table be liberally furnished wine good party in excellent spirit a be natural after securing prize so speedily moreover captain brisac be thorough gentleman knew exactly how to make guest feel at ease be not always case where superior be also host conversation turned pretty frequently a might be expected on technical matter there be frequent divergence in shape of laughter provoking anecdote in doctor shone forth conspicuously be not however until after cloth have be removed that skipper made reference to occurrence of previous day then addressing to said let take opportunity mr chester of thanking for saving life yesterday for timely interposition must infallibly have be killed thank very sincerely for promptitude with acted sailor be not in habit of making overmuch of such service perform for other think very little about fact remains same will not forget have also to thank for conspicuous gallantry displayed in boarding prize gallantry evidently have strong effect upon men contributed in inconsiderable degree to success so pleased be with conduct have felt justified in making special mention of in despatch sent in with prize think may venture to promise that what have said will be found to exercise favourable influence on future prospect go on a have begun will do well above thing study hard will find uphill work at first doubt step take will make succeed easier until will at length find that can acquire naturally without effort knowledge be required to make proficient in profession of course mean that must give whole time to study little recreation now then be not only allowable beneficial give whole thought to play a be sadly afraid messmate markham doe mention of mercurial friend brought back so vividly to mind recent scene in berth be a newspaper reporter say risibly affected circumstance did not fail to attract general attention captain brisac looked disconcerted annoyed what be mr chester what have said to afford so much amusement asked beg pardon sir replied be not laughing at anything said mention of mr markham reminded of something ridiculous said hope will be pleased to excuse sir must be extremely sorry to do anything having appearance of rudeness disrespect feel quite sure must returned skipper brow clearing once more amused look coming into eye let hear what that jocular young gentleman have be saying be not state secret suppose be oh dear sir at same time know must never have said have have least idea must ever reach ear be only little bit of fun on part attempt in fact to impose upon out with mr chester exclaimed doctor eye fairly dancing with fun will be sworn have be in way taking name in vain sir continued turning to captain think more than likely be quite impossible to feel offended with lad be always so utterly devoid of anything like evil intention seeing that narrative must not be likely to do harm thereupon proceeded to tell story proved productive of great deal of laughter at conclusion skipper said out glass of wine mr chester then suppose must excuse mr sennitt will not easily forgive if prevent from keeping proper watch on reaching deck found that wind have hauled round to about wnw bringing with raw dismal fog speedily saturated with moisture everything with came in contact a night wore on became more more dense by midnight have become so thick that be impossible to see from one end of ship to other captain brisac gave order for scourge to be hove to vessel be accordingly brought to wind on starboard tack with head pointing in direction of french coast watch with exception of dozen of smartest hand who be placed on lookout be allowed to dispose about deck in most sheltered spot must find fog lasted through first watch when went on deck at midnight to take turn of duty be thicker than ever vapour came sweeping down upon ship in great opaque mass of be so dense that be barely possible to distinguish object on opposite side of deck while lower yard be only visible from deck at very rare period few men moving about loomed more like gigantic shadow than human being binnacle lamp only light visible emitted feeble ghostly glimmer hardly sufficed to render visible feature of man who stood by wheel light of kind be exhibited on board scourge captain brisac preferring to trust to good lookout precaution adopted by other vessel for safety from collision rather than run risk of betraying presence to enemy by exhibition of light for same reason have given order that ship bell must on account whatever be struck during continuance of thick weather somehow must not help thinking that skipper precaution exposed to great deal of danger supposing for example that other ship practising same precaution happened to be in immediate neighbourhood approaching on opposite tack what must be result why in probability two craft must fall on board other inflicting serious mutual damage amounting perhaps to complete destruction of one idea made very uneasy so much so indeed that imagination at length becoming excited be on point of giving alarm at least dozen time thinking now then must discern dim outline of strange ship sweeping silently down upon like gigantic ghost so strong indeed did illusion at length become must have sworn caught momentary glimpse of light to windward after hesitating few minute became so convinced that have seen light went up to mr sennitt reported light mr chester where away said rather anxiously here sir replied broad on starboard quarter gazed steadfastly in direction have indicated for two three minute then turned away saying did quite right lad to speak to really think must have be mistaken why if have really be so stranger must have be close aboard of must be impossible to see ordinary light at much greater distance than hundred fathom in such fog a why be thick enough to cut with knife old barkie can scarcely force way through a finished speaking seemed to catch glimpse of light just for single instant breathlessly exclaimed there be again sir can see nothing returned somewhat impatiently after taking long look here let go round examine lookout men man be found broad awake keenly watchful yet none of have seen anything resembling light indeed anything at of nature to lead to suppose that there be ship in close proximity to ourselves must not believe that imagination have be playing trick yet required very great penetration on part to see that superior thought little of assertion in comparison with report of lookout men returned to spot from have started stood intently gazing to windward until for part be almost ready to declare upon oath that atmosphere be full of faint twinkling light impression be beginning to force upon have be making fool of myself be about to say so when faint almost imperceptible sound seemed to float down to out of thick fold of impenetrable mist to windward there sir exclaimed did hear nothing then why to tell truth mr chester half thought did replied sennitt after believe be only fancy imagination have infected own if stand here much longer will fancy whole french fleet there to windward luckily be eight bell continued consulting watch by light of binnacle so will turn ship over to care of fresh set of eye ear let watch be called a quietly a possible be done so completely have already acquired that confidence be conveyed in expression let look out who have watch that notwithstanding previous apprehension in ten minute be fast asleep chapter five fly from frenchman when went on deck again at change of watch be still very thick breeze be freshening sun together promised soon to disperse vapour be still so thick however that be impossible to see more than three four length away from vessel scourge be consequently kept hove to skipper have made appearance on deck for few minute before sitting down to breakfast about nine o'clock came up again just a fog have begun to clear away in earnest opening up like curtain now then showing clear space of about mile so in extent then settling down again a thick a ever time clearing away more thoroughly revealing larger still larger open space at length mist lifted for moment to extent that became possible to see to distance of perhaps couple of mile a did so there be simultaneous hail from lookout aloft five six of hand on deck of sail ho sail ho sure enough exclaimed skipper mr sennitt a caught sight of stranger at same moment frigate french too a be living sinner continued first luff taking squint through glass at craft ah be a sharp sighted a be went on with telescope still at eye up go helm there go lad aloft to make sail be coming down to say how d 'ye do ' to sir there go tricolour up to peak hard up with helm man said captain brisac very quietly to helmsman turn hand up pack on mr sennitt discretion be better part of valour with just now only chance be to show johnny crapaud clean pair of heel lad flew aloft like lightning away went staggering to leeward with stunsails alow aloft on port side steering course must take pretty directly up channel so smart be scourge in making sail that be down on deck again inch of canvas dragging at like cart horse before frenchman have got stunsail boom fairly rigged out a soon a have got canvas fairly set rope coiled down deck generally cleared up slipped down into berth for telescope with returned to deck proceeded to make deliberate inspection of unwelcome neighbour be about mile half distant from bearing couple of point on weather quarter thought have never seen more beautiful sight than presented a came foaming after with sun lighting up snowy canvas flashing brightly from burnished copper a rose on crest of swell showing cutwater half way down to keel sail be evidently new so new indeed that have scarcely have time to stretch to proper dimension paint looked fresh clean circumstance impressing acute mr sennitt with conviction that craft be fresh out of dockyard from extensive overhaul that be new vessel beautiful graceful model of hull smart appearance of spar rigging induced to incline very strongly to latter supposition soon became evident that beautiful craft be going nearly two foot to one be steered so shamefully that have not materially decreased distance between at end of first hour hope therefore have sunk to zero with imminent prospect of french prison before eye began once more to soar skyward a mile after mile slipped away beneath flying keel minute increased probability of falling in with one of own cruiser skipper be dreadfully put out at being obliged to run away though french frigate be very nearly dead astern yawed about sufficiently to enable to count sixteen port of side even mr sennitt who be accounted greatest fire eater on board be fain to acknowledge that be just gun two too many for by four bell trace of fog have cleared away sun shone brilliantly in cloudless sky air have decided feeling of warmth in westerly breeze blew freshly wave curled crisply broke into foam at crest under enlivening influence altogether be thoroughly delightful day such a be occasionally to be met with toward end of march day when winter summer have fairly met to fight for mastery summer be getting own way a time sped on still friendly sail appeared while frigate astern drew more more perceptibly up to anxiety once more resumed sway frequent be admonition to lookout aloft to keep weather eye lifting at frenchman decided to try range of gun opened fire upon from lee bow chaser shot flew wide went far enough beyond to show that be fairly within range followed still be unscathed interval of about quarter of hour elapsed before again fired when did shot be somewhat better aimed passing through main fore topsail falling into sea considerable distance ahead think be now near enough to venture upon return of compliment mr sennitt said skipper let tompion see what can do with stern chaser in way of knocking away of fellow spar seems pity to spoil so pretty picture better than for to experience delight of french prison tompion be accordingly summoned bid do best to wing frenchman task to devoted with great gravity considerable assumption of importance gun after being carefully loaded be trained with most scrupulous nicety then tompion trigger line in hand stood squinting along sight until favourable moment arrived when there be concussion smoke cleared away shot hole be seen in frigate foresail very nearly in line with mast very prettily shot tompion said skipper try again few inch nearer must have buried that shot in foremast wound spar if can breeze seems inclined to freshen if can gouge good substantial piece out of of lighter spar wind will do rest for by sending handsomely over bow in few minute more away sped second of worthy tompion messenger too passed through foresail close to yard apparently without doing further damage in meantime frenchman be by mean idle with gun running gear began to be somewhat cut up luckily however damage be of unimportant character such a must be put right in few minute with aid of marline spike grease shoe firing now became more rapid on side though spar on side have several narrow escape none have so far fallen damage done seemed in case to be of most trifling description at length mr sennitt walked aft said let try hand tompion used to be considered rather crack shot on board old dido tompion of course resigned place to superior officer though be evident from expression of phiz that have great faith in first luff shooting power worthy first speedily justified boast for shot struck boom iron at frenchman larboard fore yard arm snapping off unshipping boom creating very pretty state of confusion with topmast lower stunsails gear ringing cheer be raised on board scourge at success sennitt be about to try hand second time when frigate be seen to yaw broad off course thin streak of flame flashed along side veil of white fleecy smoke started into view be wafted aside by wind sixteen twelve pound shot entire content of starboard broadside came whistling about ear be standing aft close to taffrail on port side at moment one of shot came crashing in at stern port nearest striking stanchion heavily making splinter fly in direction one of striking on left temple ripping up skin baring poor unfortunate skull for length of four inch blow stunned just for moment fell to deck before one have time to pick up have recovered staggered to foot again feeling trifle confused somewhat sick if truth may be told at sight of own blood streamed down over face copiously rendering have doubt truly ghastly spectacle otherwise felt not much worse frigate be at time scarcely mile distant have gun be properly served broadside to have treated ought to have left floating helpless wreck on water completely at mercy instead of shot damaged be only one must be said to have taken effect remainder of broadside passing through sail wide of mark altogether miss be a good a mile remarked skipper to sennitt after have glanced round noted trifling damage done hillo chester be hurt lad added addressing a observed gory visage slip down to doctor get to clap plaster over mast head then turn in if like what set of lubber be aboard frigate continued to sennitt have be english instead of french that broadside must have blown out of water have be for last ten minute seriously thinking of hauling down colour rather than risk heavy sacrifice of life if be best can do will hold on everything at event for short time longer wonder whether there must be chance of said something in so low tone did not catch sennitt pondered deeply for minute then looked up said upon word sir think must lad be rather raw behaved splendidly in case of privateer so believe must now yes think might have just chance of success bold rush often doe wonder be right sennitt call hand aft if please let see how take proposal head be beginning to ache most villainously curiosity got better of for moment determined to postpone visit to friend bolus until have heard what skipper have to say in minute two man be on quarter deck hat in hand expectancy in feature lad commenced skipper have sent for because have proposition to make wish to see for how individually take when frigate astern be first made out morning be in hope that little scourge must prove active enough to keep out of reach of frenchman shot have seen for yourselves how completely fallacious that hope have be frigate go two foot to one be being fought a so beautiful craft ought to be hand of must by time be fairly under way for french prison see how be there be lot of tinker tailor aboard there be not seaman deserve luck of being sent to sea in such fine vessel be evident that though may possibly know how to sail can not fight can not possibly keep long english be certain to have sooner later since be case why must not have stay moment cheer lad until have heard out of course anything like regularly fought action between be out of question be two thirty twelve pounder against can only show eight six pounder single broadside from well delivered must send to bottom think there be just possibility by little manoeuvring on part of getting alongside if can be done be of opinion that by bold rush from hand might secure possession of doubt there will be plenty of hard knock to be have for asking even be better than french prison what say lad hearty cheer be first response then there be general putting of head together much eager talking for about couple of minute finally topman one bob adam magnificent specimen of british tar perfect hercules in build one of prime seaman of ship shouldered way to front with elaborate sea scrape tug at forelock addressed skipper hope honour will excuse if have taken minute two to work out here traverse reduce to plain sailing purposal a honour have laid athwart hawse fetched up standin just at first war until 'd have time to pay off gather way on t'other tack a may say that be able to get bearins of see sir there be only about sixty on told now that have sent away prize crew reckon that there ai far short of hand aboard of johnny yonder nevertheless notwithstanding howsumdever a honour say be little better than so many tailor tailor be never worth very much that ever of heard on at good stand up fight so long short of be sir put alongside will have in twinklin ' of purser lantern ai that boy ay ay be bob have paid out without so much a single kink mean to have responded voice in crowd then three cheer for skipper may get lot of prize money exhorted bob to intense amusement of captain brisac cheer be given with such energy have doubt be distinctly heard on board frenchman captain brisac briefly thanked men for plucky response to call then sent back to quarter impatience for eventful moment to arrive frigate be rapidly nearing thought there must be time to get head plastered up so rushed below found bolus standing at table with coat off shirt sleeve rolled up formidable array of long narrow bladed knife sharp enough to cut one if only looked hard at on one hand equally formidable array of saw tweezer long needle silken thread etcetera etcetera on other here doctor exclaimed skipper compliment will clap plaster over mast head bear hand about please frenchman will be alongside of in le than five minute be going to board carry with rush presume intend to head boarder a usual remarked doctor with quiet grin what be extent of damage here sit down let have look at be impatient will undertake to tinker up a good a new in two three minute continued a seated myself began to sponge blood away there be great harm done merely simple laceration of scalp there think will keep top of head from blowing off until after have demolished frenchman must dearly like to go with what must poor patient do if happened to get unlucky knock on head must remain where be suppose though be too bad must be cooped up here while others be having fun now may go a soon a please look here boy added in quite different tone take care of knock on head such a have have be very apt to make one giddy giddiness be awkward mishap at critical moment take advice remain quietly below until be over chapter six dashing exploit doctor advice be well meant doubt good be too excited to think so at moment so darted on deck just in time to hear skipper say now lad be coming up on port quarter run starboard gun over to port load fore aft with round shot charge of grape on top of give muzzle good elevation fire at moment that two ship touch then away on board for life recollect first blow be battle so let be good hard one steady now here come during visit to doctor den sail have be shortened on board scourge down to topsail jib driver stunsails being stowed boom run in while course topgallant sail royal be merely clewed up frenchman evidently have be great deal mystified by manoeuvre cessation of firing on part now while be ranging up on port quarter so close that one might almost have hove biscuit on board be confusion with hand being busy taking in canvas in slipshod lubberly way must have disgraced collier while babble of tongue must have be deafening judging from what heard of skipper be standing just abaft main rigging conning ship with one hand on topmast backstay ready for spring while signalled helmsman with other sennitt be forward also ready for rush while mr clewline who with dozen hand be to remain on board take care of ship be in waist men stood at gun with cutlass drawn captain with trigger line in hand ready to fire at instant of collision harvey be forward with mr sennitt while little markham stood by to follow in skipper wake a frigate drew up abreast of captain sprang into mizen rigging hailed through speaking trumpet mais monsieur le capitaine why will not haul down votre drapeau vous avez se rendre n'est pa captain brisac raised hand to mouth a though to reply waving at same time for helmsman to sheer alongside men with grappling iron being crouched under bulwark ready to heave hand fore aft straining forward like hound in leash waiting breathlessly for coming shock what ship be that hailed skipper not that wanted particularly to know just at moment hoped to find out for very shortly question served to fill up time until moment for action must arrive l'audacieuse ' fregate de began french captain when officer sprang into rigging beside said something in excited manner pointing at gesticulating with frightful vehemence in meantime helmsman touching wheel a daintily a though have be sailing match brought alongside so cleverly that two ship touched with shock be barely perceptible just enough in fact to swear by a gunner remarked heave shouted sennitt to men with grappling iron fire roared skipper away went double broadside crash into frenchman eliciting chorus of shriek yell a might lead one to suppose that pandemonium have broken loose three four of frigate gun replied there be ominous crashing among spar one paused to ascertain extent of damage men have sprung like tiger into frigate rigging almost before own gun have exploded be therefore so far safe captain brisac made dash at frigate mizen rigging while giving word to fire with markham close upon heel before have fairly got hold of ratline sponge be thrust out of one of upper deck port catching in face inflicting such blow that fell back upon unfortunate mids must have gone down between two ship have not caught unceremoniously by collar steadied on foot again sponge be reverse of clean blow have be delivered with such hearty good will just between eye that venerated commander claret be very effectually tapped presented therefore somewhat alarming spectacle a flung in upon frenchman deck face black from contact with foul sponge dingy colour being pleasantly relieved by bold streak dash of crimson mille diables ejaculated astonished french captain a apparition appeared before having jumped down on deck again a ranged alongside placed on guard in most approved fashion captain brisac have more knowledge of sword play than have of flying circumstance often proved exceedingly embarrassing to adversary for have rough ready way of handling weapon if not so scientific be equally a effective a utmost refinement of thoroughly accomplished swordsman instead therefore of engaging a antagonist evidently expected simply bore down guard by sheer strength of wrist rushing in upon astounded adversary delivered blow with left hand straight from shoulder laid unhappy frenchman senseless upon own deck hurrah lad shouted give right left drive rascal below overboard push forward to meet mr division have boarded with abaft replied with cheer be responded to by sennitt party forward away went driving french along deck before until be huddled up amidships between two party of boarder there made most determined stand now ensued fierce sanguinary hand to hand conflict men still pressing impetuously forward french opposing with resolution previous conduct have given reason to expect obstinately contesting with inch of deck if yielded for moment renewing defence more actively than ever cutlass pike be used with savage freedom dead wounded encumbered deck until became almost impassable fight have be raging thus furiously for three four minute without gaining perceptible advantage men be falling fast became evident that unless something decisive be speedily done must be overpowered by sheer force of number french be congregated in compact group amidships party being divided into two one of have be led on board aft by skipper while other have followed mr sennitt forward french be consequently between lieutenant party occurred to that if mr clewline must pour charge two of grape into crowd of frenchman might have effect of freshening way be pushing towards bulwark intending to slip down on board scourge see what must be done when observed for first time that be no longer alongside on looking farther caught glimpse of through one of open port lying about couple of cable length distant called markham attention to at same time mentioning what have thought about grape capital notion young un replied infantile intellect be really developing with marvellous rapidity clewline ca be communicated with however where be so must just do best can for ourselves look here here be six pounder cast loose ready to hand watch roll of ship can run right inboard here peter to one of seaman lend hand here to run in gun slew round with muzzle forward so be just right now then for charge do see oh here be cartridge in with ram well down peter chester see if can find anything to put in on top of powder marline spike tenpenny nail empty bottle blue pill black draught cook tormentor skipper best china tea service anything will do be obnoxious to interior of human system will do inquired fishing out from scupper heavy object of cylindrical shape over have stumbled two three time bless dear little innocent heart yes answered markham will do berry nicey nicey why be very thing greeny be cannister in with if doe not wake up call dutchman be now be ready let skipper know what be going to do chester will stand by to fire directly give word be very easy matter to secure skipper attention make understand what proposed to do managed to accomplish at last a soon a understood hailed in voice rose clear high above din be mr sennitt there ay ay sir came back in well known tone of first be going to try effect of charge of cannister hailed skipper be good enough therefore to send party into fore rigging lad to own division stand by to rush aft behind gun now first lieutenant division sprang like cat into fore rigging scuttled away for life way up to top while party at same instant made dash aft formed again in rear of gun movement be effected with such lightning like rapidity that french must hing stare at open mouthed captain brisac paused single instant to make sure that lad be out of way of shot then called upon frenchman to surrender two three flung down arm rest recovering from momentary astonishment started on rush aft seeing skipper sprang on one side shouted fire charge took effect in very thickest of crowd literally mowing french down in heap at same instant party of scourge renewed attack time rush proved irresistible there be momentary attempt at stand lad be no longer to be denied after very short very fierce tussle french threw down weapon cried for quarter however did not witness final denouement for being hurried forward by rest in final rush found in thick of melee before be quite prepared received crushing blow on head felled to deck prisoner be immediately secured bulk of scourge crew shifted into prize sufficient number only being left on board brig to work wounded also be retained on board frigate where there be of course much better more roomy accommodation for worthy medico shifting over bag baggage to look after damage to spar rigging turned out to be unimportant in ship be soon made good about pm made sail in company shaping course for plymouth where arrived without mishap late on following evening received very great credit for what paper be pleased to term dashing exploit captain brisac being rewarded with post rank while mr sennitt be made commander mr clewline moved step up ratline midshipman also received reward in shape of honourable mention be warrant officer forgotten so that what with promotion prize money scourge be for time envy of entire navy war however have only just begun rather broken out afresh everybody soon consoled with reflection that luck might day become own prize proved to be frigate l'audacieuse of thirty two gun men be bran new ship have come

appear in connexion with capture of sans culotte when scourge arrived in plymouth so speedily with second prize heard of being wounded posted down from town determined to see captain brisac for ascertain by actual word of mouth how have behaved kind skipper be so lavish with praise that sir peregrine be in ecstasy of delight from time became different man in consequence presume of having stumbled upon object excited within genuine interest during week of stay with in town went everywhere with though normal condition be that of martyrdom to gout on receiving appointment to juno

believe be right be afraid have yielded rather too much to bad habit of speak think will be likely to do again now to change subject doe anybody know exactly where be bound there be vague rumour floating about portsmouth few day ago lord hood by way wonder if be in way related to skipper be to take fleet to toulon though for what purpose nobody seemed to know hope will not be ordered to join said smellie hope not remarked percival also heard rumour to refer fancy there must be truth in for went so far even a to specify by name several ship a having be selected to form part of fleet know that there have be pretty general overhaul refit going on with many of there be large french fleet at moment lying in toulon harbour be of opinion that expedition if such there be to be be for purpose of getting hold of few of be said that there be le than thirty four ship many of of large size lying there ready for sea while have one seventy four two forty very fine vessel on stock about ready for launching if lord hood can take pick of fleet a that must be able to lay up in ordinary old juno ' few more like think need distress much respecting toulon fleet if lord hood want frigate will take out with mission expect will be to cruise up down mediterranean doing best can for skipper have doubt influence enough to ensure that will not be hampered by being attached to blockading fleet anything of kind where get great deal of work very little prize money percival assumption turned out to be correct called at gibraltar remained couple of day giving of of whom happened to be one opportunity of exploring extraordinary fortress from whence went on to malta remained there week be then ordered out to cruise be told that french have seventeen ship of war cruising in mediterranean

for boat coming off to when having approached within couple of mile of entrance to harbour captain hood gave order for ship to be hove to half hour passed away still sign of pilot if poor rawlings have not be in sick bay aw must have be snugly at anchor by time said skipper to mr annesley will be bound to say that aw old fellow have be in out of place dozen time at least must have taken in like ah like shot quite likely sir returned mr annesley with telescope to eye think must be difficult to name port have not be into be unfortunate that must be laid up just at juncture must be very early bird in toulon surely somebody must have made out light before lowered telescope be very queer can not make out british fleet in there surely ought to see from where now be not if be in inner harbour aw suspect be italian bwig came in on day sailed be from marseille master weported succession of stwong easterly wind hereabouts must natuwally send bwitish fleet farther in will find there wight

inside there if have pewhaps must take in scarcely expect have ever seen inside of harbour sir said mr annesley still can ask will pas word for yes do said skipper must like to get in to night if possible pas word for oh here be said first luff a percival strolled aft from forecastle whence have be taking good look at harbour mr percival captain hood wish to know if have ever be into toulon

harbour with hand in fore chain on side taking frequent cast of lead percival on poop conning ship a drew in towards harbour sail be shortened crept in under topsail jib only at length safely entered inner harbour percival skill having proved fully equal to occasion there a have be expected found number of ship lying snugly at anchor ah said skipper here be admiral just a expected do see that bwig mr percival yes sir returned percival wanted to weather will not do wind be too light tide too strong must tack under stern a there be shoal water not far to leeward of where be then in case will give little more muslin said mr annesley haul out driver down with fore tack sheet look sharp lad now mr percival be ready be now drawing up on brig starboard quarter almost within hailing distance captain hood be preparing to hail vessel when figure be seen on taffrail of stranger next moment indistinct word be hoarsely bellowed at doe say said skipper turning to group of officer standing near must exactly make out said one did hear very distinctly said thought sounded like french said percival oh said skipper be of course asking who be bwitannic majesty fwigate juno from malta with supahnumewawies for garrison added roaring back between hand at motionless figure on board brig viva be reply accompanied by wave of navy cap be fwench said skipper one of fellow who have suwendered to fleet can of gentleman speak fwench well enough to ask be bwitish admiral ship there be one appeared with quite sufficient confidence in knowledge of french language to undertake duty so stepped forward with becoming modesty offered to obtain information be required permission being given approached side squeaked out in most manly tone at command proposed inquiry figure gesticulated violently then stooped down to commune with three four more whose head must now be seen just above taffrail finally raised to upright position shouted back yesh yesh be afraid did not understand mr chester said mr annesley try again did so with even more confusing result than before ask be bwitish fleet suggested skipper put question also confusion appeared to become worse confounded dozen reply coming back to jumbled up together english french word being so hopelessly intermixed that be utterly impossible to make head tail of what be saying be by time passing close under brig stern percival be remarking to first lieutenant that be quite time to heave about a be sure must be close upon shoal when voice have hailed first shouted out for to luff hard down with helm exclaimed annesley over with man tack

bank order be at once given to let go anchor cable smoked out through hawse pipe ship swung round head to wind found however that heel be still fast on shoal rudder immovable be therefore determined a tide be on turn to hoist out launch at once run away kedge in order to haul ship off while operation be still possible tackle be accordingly got up on fore main yardarm in le than five minute launch be in water alongside where be mr chester said first lieutenant looking round here sir replied emerging from shadow of bulwark where have be taking peep at thing in general through open port from have observed among other thing six oared gig pull from brig make towards town foolishly failed to report circumstance not at moment attaching slightest importance to jump into launch mr chester take charge said mr annesley want kedge run away here about two point on port bow must not go farther to windward than tide will take quarter when float drive down on brig now off go be a smart a can ay ay sir replied touching cap away scrambled down into launch where found kedge already stowed with hawser coiled down on top of until boat stern be barely couple of inch out of water shove off give way men exclaimed a foot touched thwart bowman shoved boat head off oar dropped into phosphorescent water with luminous splash pulled down harbour in direction indicated by mr annesley pulled steadily on until hawser in boat have be paid out when let go kedge hailing frigate to heave in paddled back alongside while running out kedge have observed boat pulling toward juno when reached frigate found craft alongside in meantime frigate have be hove off bank without much difficulty tide acting strongly on moment that floated have drifted down to kedge have be lifted anchor having be tripped a drifted over be once more let go just a got alongside launch not being required farther at moment be passed astern crew being first ordered out of in order to regain frigate deck be necessary for to pas over boat alongside be lying in wake of gangway a did so noticed that eight men composing crew be unmistakably french strange to say be fully armed struck a so singular circumstance resolved to have good look at other individual who have come off to who be doubtless on deck in confabulation with skipper found a expected on quarter deck talking to captain first lieutenant there be two of apparently french officer one who be talking spoke excellent english be at moment when drew near group explaining to captain hood that in compliance with regulation of port commanding officer order must be necessary for ship at once to proceed higher up harbour to quarantine ground there to perform ten day quarantine that speaker be deputed to pilot ship then there to new berth phew ejaculated skipper quarantine eh with people on board be pretty business truly ca understand at there be sickness at present at malta carry perfectly clean bill of health surely there must be mistake somewhere before taking up berth in quarantine ground must like to communicate with lord hood can point out ship monsieur can not see from here monsieur le capitaine replied frenchman besides interview with british admiral will avail nothing be doubtless retired by time even if be not must not interfere have authority whatever in present matter thought detected covert smile of derision passing over speaker face a said turned to see whether must detect anything of kind on of companion found have withdrawn to gangway apparently to call people up out of boat for be just coming up over side a looked in moment sauntered back rejoined group from have so quietly slipped away do say that can not see british flag ship from here sir inquired mr annesley then pray where be seems to that ship in harbour be within view from here yet now come to look can not see single british ship among doe not strike sir that there be something rather peculiar about business turning to skipper be sure saw two french officer start glance quickly at other at remark then for first time noticed that wore tri coloured cockade in hat why gentleman have national cockade in hat exclaimed involuntarily by jove be right young gentleman have ejaculated skipper what be meaning of monsieur be nationalist be royalist in disguise beg that will at once tell whereabouts of lord hood fleet unless receive distinct answer will be forced to believe treachery be meditated will take necessary precautionary step forthwith frenchman looked in other face for instant then one who have called boat crew on deck turned to skipper said in french calm have honour to inform that ship company be prisoner english be good people will treat with utmost kindness english admiral went away time ago toulon be now in hand of nationalist expression of mingled horror disgust slowly overspread feature of skipper first luff like summer cloud sailing slowly across disc of full moon must have be irresistibly laughable under other circumstance a matter stood nobody felt slightest inclination to laugh prisoner ejaculated mr annesley be apparently too full for further utterance have already said quite enough be prisoner flew from mouth to mouth like wildfire in le than two minute man in ship have become acquainted with position officer came crowding aft to ascertain truth of startling rumour more disgusted dejected looking group of mortal than appeared must have be difficult to find disagreeable announcement once made french officer hastened to place matter upon more agreeable basis exerting to utmost to get up lively general conversation explaining how be that have so easily run into trap very few word sufficed for matter be so excessively simple appeared from french officer statement that lord hood after sustaining long harassing siege of nearly four month have on night of th of previous december be at length compelled to evacuate toulon finding utterly impossible to hold longer with small force at command barely men against overwhelming number of besieger who mustered close upon though unable to prevent republican from obtaining possession of important place british admiral resolved that must pas into hand comparatively speaking valueless immediately therefore that be finally decided to retire from place set on foot preparation to destroy arsenal magazine etcetera such of french ship a be deemed inexpedient to take away with though be unable to carry out in entirety whole of arrangement be pretty evident from informant account that destruction actually effected be something enormous dockyard with various storehouse magazine two powder ship two gun ship of war hero themistocle being burnt must have be magnificent awe inspiring sight to witness destructive operation effected a be during darkness of night conflagration of store warehouse ship explosion of powder magazine powder vessel latter being set on fire by lubberly ally spaniard instead of being scuttled a have be arranged incessant flash of cannon musketry hot conflict raging while between british republican force must not fail of being awfully impressive sight such have evidently proved to informant who described various scene have witnessed on memorable night with very considerable amount of graphic power so interested be for moment in narration one appeared to have completely forgotten excessively unpleasant position until be recalled to mind by exclamation from third lieutenant honourable edward plantagenet mortimer aw excuse intewupting extwemely intewesting er ah conversation said in usual dandified style must like to diwect attention captain hood to ah important fact that ah wind have changed if may be allowed to expwess opinion must say that if must get canvas upon ship believe must fetch out of harbour again effect be electrical remark suggested such readiness of resource such consummate seamanship such dashing courage on part of speaker have be uttered by mr annesley even must probably have be somewhat surprised emanating from source did astonishment simply beggar description there be dead silence for moment while be ruminating upon digesting possibility involved in suggestion then a became apparent that bold dash for freedom be still in power ringing cheer burst out fore aft in instant skipper be again silence fore aft exclaimed sound utter now may cost man life to station men let order be executed with rapidity ah silence of thought mr annesley make sail if please gentleman to frenchman will wegwet to learn that have made slight ah mistake instead of being prisoner be ours er a countwymen with chawactewistic politeness may possibly salute a pas battewies a may in anxiety to do so omit to dwaw shot from gun allow to suggest that wetire below mr carnegie lieutenant of mawines have see be thoughtful enough to pwovide escort for in hand have much pleasure in leaving will find twuly delightful companion good evening gentleman for present at first frenchman appeared unable to believe own ear then a began to realise that be actually about to attempt escape rapidly threw together back to back began to handle sabre menacingly carnegie however who upon hearing honourable mortimer remark have grasped situation in instant have at once slipped off returning in very few minute with five twenty fully armed marine with promptly surrounded chagrined frenchman who found way in jolly handled half pike so little to taste that at length came to conclusion that discretion be in case better part of valour sullenly suffered to be conducted below in meantime lad have be anything idle with activity of so many cat have scuttled away aloft laying out upon yard casting off gasket in style must have done mr annesley heart good to moral certainty considerably astonished frenchman on board surrounding ship in battery there be confusion whatever everything be done with a much method precision a if have be merely exercising crew on other hand not one second of precious time be wasted really be pretty sight to see canvas falling simultaneously from yard topsail sheet instantly going home into place three topsail yard directly afterwards soaring away up to mast head then home came topgallant sheet up went yard royal following being set literally before topgallant halliard be belayed fore aft canvas be at same time set moment that royal be at mast head yard be braced for casting ship carpenter one of mate be stationed at hawse pipe armed with keenest ax stood ready to strike directly word be given in three minute from time that order have be given to make sail mr annesley turned to skipper said with utmost composure ready sir where be mr percival inquired captain hood here sir replied percival stepping forward touching cap take charge sir if please said skipper forget that safety of frigate chance of escape from long captivity be absolutely in hand if touch ground hang for five minute will be simply blown out of water will do best sir quietly replied percival taking up convenient position for conning ship feel sure will sir returned skipper say when will cut at once sir if please be reply cut cut with will said mr annesley three four quick stroke be heard frigate head paid slowly off until sail filled when head yard be fore main tack be boarded sheet hauled aft sail trimmed a if for sailing match fact that movement be closely watched became apparent moment that hand appeared in rigging to loose sail very perceptible stir taking place on board brig while light rapidly made appearance in several battery be about to have warm quarter of hour remarked skipper who have be keenly noting sinister indication while first luff be getting ship under weigh let crew go to quarter at once if please mr annesley ay ay sir be reply if only have little more wind there come blow good breeze blow believe will scrape clear after beat to quarter sharp roll of drum immediately broke in upon quietude of night there be momentary bustle only momentary men having already gone to quarter a matter of course then be profound silence once more on board save for gentle rippling sound beneath bow along side occasional creak of block aloft say when wish to tack mr percival said first luff stationing alongside master mate not yet sir said percival wind be favouring little just now there freshens trifle look up better than ever keep good clean full quarter master let go through water wish there be not quite so much tide though be in favour be setting bodily down towards shoal water keep lead going there in fore chain must do none worse sir if frenchman boat be cut adrift cut adwift at once said skipper who be standing close by cut adwift at once launch a well can not afford to have so much a rope end dragging alongside just now ah have be expecting that a brig before referred to having got spring upon cable brought broadside to bear opened fire upon never mind continued skipper will soon be out of harm way a far a be concerned be fire of battewies dwead most doubt mount heavy metal if gun be well served single bwoadside will unwig be ugly looking fellow here on starboard bow evidently mean mischief there by number of light show let starboard bwoadside gun be twained for thwee port where see most light mr annesley let gun be fired a be bwought to bear at juncture broadside from brig whistled overhead making few eyelet hole in canvas cutting one two unimportant rope immediately afterwards shot quickly followed by yet came plunging at from fort gun be evidently pointed with intention of bringing down spar luckily again escaped without damage worth speaking of matter be beginning to assume very lively aspect for for a glided down harbour must see light glancing in battery after battery on side of until one of be lighted up still on swept frigate silent a ghostly ship without light of kind visible on board battle lantern being one carefully masked men standing silent motionless a statue at gun even remark interchanged between officer be expressed in low murmur only loud enough to reach ear for be intended oppressive silence being intensified rather than broken by occasional luff luff may quarter master from percival presently crash came simultaneous discharge of five heavy gun from battery on starboard hand four from battery on opposite shore shot hissed overhead there be dull crushing thud two aloft little rattling shower on deck a rope splinter came clattering down of spar have evidently be badly wounded carpenter mate be sent aloft to ascertain extent of damage while be ascending rigging bang went foremost gun on starboard side followed by remainder of broadside moon happening to shine full upon stone wall of fort have just opened upon saw a smoke drove astern little cloud of dust rise about one of embrasure ragged patch of chipped broken stone appeared to start out upon wall faintly borne down to on heavy night came sound of shriek yell of agony be perfectly evident that shot have told with severe effect a though discharge of broadside have be preconcerted signal for general cannonade battery within range on side of harbour now opened fire upon of however fortunately for being unable to bring more than single gun to bear have gun on shore be served with only ordinary skill must undoubtedly have be destroyed a be though shot flew over over thick a hail lashing sea into foam round shredding sail to ribbon cutting up very badly standing running rigging bringing down main topgallant mast severely wounding several of other spar still glided safely on hull uninjured not man hurt order be now sent down for gun on main deck to play upon battery upon must be brought to bear for gun to be laid with greatest possible accuracy precision rather than rapidity of fire being skipper object irregular fire from broadside accordingly now commenced that be not altogether without effect be demonstrated by speedy silencing of two three out of many gun now playing upon a object be to escape with least possible delay captain hood must not allow frigate course to be altered by so much a one single hair breadth in order to bring gun more directly to bear upon of battery will have to make short board presently sir said percival to skipper a drew down to within mile of harbour entrance there be shoal water directly ahead of now have broken off couple of point within last ten minute will heave about at once go on a far a can if stand on much farther will be exposed to fire of yonder battery seems to be preparing warm reception for go about at once sir by mean replied skipper have got off wonderfully well so far will certainly not run unnecessary risk now ready about mr annesley ay ay sir ready about repeated first lieutenant men went to several station coiled up brace etcetera be thrown off belaying pin be ready for execution of proposed manoeuvre down with helm quarter master be next order tiller rope creaked a wheel be rapidly spun round by brawny dexterous arm of quarter master ship slowly luffed to wind hold on of suddenly exclaimed percival then turning to skipper continued wind be favouring again sir be still clean full if breeze keep a be for ten minute more will fetch out clear of everything so much better remarked skipper present course however will take unpleasantly close to battery so looking round until eye lighted on be so good a to step down to main deck mr chester request mr flinn to treble shot larboard broadside pour into battery a pas perhaps may be second so beforehand with if so well directed broadside on part may stop fire altogether soon found mr flinn having delivered message returned at once to quarter deck anxious to see how must fare with last battery to judge by appearance be most formidable of a emerged through hatchway percival gave word to helmsman to keep away couple of point frigate having just shaved past most prominent part of shoal brought battery directly abreast of le than quarter of mile distant be waiting for concussion of broadside momentarily expected must be poured into when whole face of fort blazed out into line of fire there be deafening roar loud whirring sound in air crashing among spar aloft two distinct heavy thud telling that of shot have struck hull then a mizen topmast fell over side fore topgallant mast following topmast head being shot away whole broadside rang out at once distinctly heard crushing sound of shot a struck masonry breeze have in meantime freshened somewhat notwithstanding crippled condition be slipping through water at rate of about five knot have by time run gauntlet of battery on side of haven considered that have have worst that be to have spirit accordingly began to rise a prospect of escape became more hopeful skipper expected that must have to sustain couple more broadside from battery with have just exchanged compliment after if escaped further serious damage might consider safe eye excepting perhaps percival helmsman be accordingly directed anxiously to dark frowning mass stood out indistinctly from dark background of land moment grew more more vague undefined expecting to see lurid line of fire blaze out from darkness once more minute after minute passed by frigate drawing out from land while breeze freshening with fathom of additional distance until nothing must be discerned even with aid of night glass feeble glimmer of lantern showing through port hole presently abruptly disappeared battery be shut in by projecting point of land have escaped moment that agreeable fact became known crew with one accord gave three hearty cheer skipper for nonce laying aside usual sang froid leading off gun be secured liberal allowance of grog served out then late a be about hour after midnight hand turned to to repair damage chapter ten important mission once fairly at sea out of reach of enemy shot have time to take look at ourselves realise extent of damage when passing over same ground few hour before juno presented a pretty picture a nautical connoisseur must wish to see with hull recently painted spar in place adjusted there to nicety rigging in perfect order white sail new look just worn off barely stretched into proper shape without blemish fault to mar perfect appearance now passed out to sea with fore main topgallant mast mizen topmast hanging over side fore topsail yard down on cap spankerboom shot away in jaw flying jib stay halliard cut through sail towing alongside canvas riddled with shot hole end bight of rope streaming out in wind everywhere aloft two pound shot in side luckily however casualty ended here for notwithstanding hailstorm of shot through have passed not man on board be hurt be busy remainder of night good part of following day making good damage sustained by evening however be ataunto once more a soon a work be finished captain hood mustered hand made speech thanking officer men for courage determination with have co operated with in effecting escape of ship from enemy port wherein actually lay aground surrounded by armed ship with numerous heavily armed battery opposing departure percival be specially referred to skill in piloting ship in out again being dwelt upon in highly commendatory term then skipper being rare hand at turning out neat speech rounding off with compliment men be told that having behaved so exceptionally well officer must now have hesitation about engaging in enterprise however hazardous hopeless might appear confident that men led must support a long a have strength to stand at close of speech men a in duty bound gave three cheer hammock be piped down life on board juno resumed once more normal condition first question suggested to skipper after getting ship once more into fighting order naturally be what be to be done with supernumerary have on board instruction appeared made provision for possibility of such contretemps a have befallen be in consequence quite at loss what to do finally after talking affair over with mr annesley resolved to take back to malta course be accordingly shaped for island accomplished passage in five day landed men who be glad enough to plant foot on mother earth once more after knocking about in confined quarter for nearly fortnight during absence information of evacuation of toulon by lord hood have reached island be taken quite for granted that going to place in ignorance of important fact a be must inevitably fall into trap be made prisoner when therefore put in appearance once more detail of escape be made known immediately became object of unbounded curiosity admiration hundred flocked to see ship many of being intensely disappointed at almost entire absence of visible indication of peril through have passed officer men alike be pointed out looked after in street until ran greatest risk of becoming inordinately vain of exploit admiration of islander did not end here however for being deemed advisable to place frigate in dry dock to examine bottom smooth copper after having touched ground a well a to make good few defect be beyond own unaided power be balled feted picnicked generally made much of for three day by excitable pleasure loving inhabitant at end of time repair being completed be hurried away to sea with sealed order to be opened off cape spartivento arrived off headland on nd of january captain hood then learned that be to remain on spot until evening of th when if farther instruction reached be to open sealed paper found enclosed with order ship be accordingly hove to placed under reefed topsail private signal be hoisted at main royal mast head in order that time might not be absolutely wasted crew be put through special course of drill sharp lookout be maintained in order that there might be possibility of being passed unobserved by craft bearing later instruction though saw plenty of felucca passing along coast only craft came at near be magnificent gun frigate hoisted french colour bore down towards on showing ensign having approached within four mile lying hove to for hour resumed original course to northward leaving in most unchristian frame of mind towards admiral whose order tied to spot prevented accepting challenge have given at first cherished hope that if did not go out to must come down attack slice of good luck be not just then to fall to lot stipulated period of stay off cape spartivento having at length expired captain hood broke open packet to reference have already be made having acquainted with farther instruction therein contained order be forthwith issued to make sail to northward westward have fine breeze from eastward to showed heavy press of canvas frigate accordingly made short mile of trip along sardinian coast on following evening arrived off gulf of ajaccio in corsica coast line being about twenty mile distant consequently hull down mountain chain however form a be backbone of corsica be distinctly visible lighted up a be by gorgeous tint of sunset sail be now shortened to topsail frigate hove to while hand be wondering more le what next move must be be sent for by skipper to go to in cabin on arriving there found mr annesley seated at cabin table with decanter of port standing between glass of same at elbow large map spread out in full light of cabin lamp have just be lighted table being further littered with large number of official looking document a entered cabin captain hood raised eye from map over officer have be earnestly poring said oh come in mr chester bwing to anchor atkins wine glass for mr chester there help young gentleman poured out glass of port wondering a sipped wherever skipper managed to pick up so very excellent wine when steward have retired closing door after captain hood looked across table at said mr chester have be gweatly gwatified at continued good weports mr annesley make of conduct speaks vewy highly of intelligence persevewance zeal couwage ah may say that er have noted fwom time to time possession of ah desiwable chawactewistics partly on account partly because of ah intimate knowledge of fwench language have selected for performance of service in quality have mentioned be er conspicuously necessawy will understand more clearly when explain that service consists in safe conveyance of certain vewy important document to hand of corsican gentleman on shore yonder in face of unknown possibly sewious difficulty from numewous fwench twoops occupying island into whose hand document in question must by mean be allowed to fall must hesitate vewy stwongly about intwusting one so young with mission so delicate for mr annesley positive assuwance may safely do so now what say be willing to undertake service to say that jumped at offer must feebly express eagerness with answered in affirmative here be one of chance for distinguishing for have so ardently longed here too be prospect of at least temporary freedom from restraint of discipline monotony of shipboard to say nothing of possibility of excitement adventure involved in performance of secret service in enemy country be with utmost difficulty controlled excitement sufficiently to listen to skipper instruction to absorb master information necessary to successful conduct of enterprise map spread upon table be map of corsica drawn to large scale showing road stream mountain path wood chateau indeed might almost say house on island upon be marked in red ink various french post a far a must be ascertained while cross in blue ink indicated post of insurgent corsicans captain hood produced also skeleton map of island drawn to very small scale containing only such information a be necessary for guidance during delivery of instruction frequent reference be made to map a well a to manuscript book of what must be called sailing direction if referred to journey by water instead of by land from made brief note from time to time by way of memory refresher in tiny book with captain hood furnished skipper kept with for more than two hour in fact until have satisfied that not only thoroughly understood what be required of be very simple being merely to find individual who be to be identified by certain pre arranged token to deliver despatch be into hand also have mastered scrap of information be able to give when at length found that be fully posted up dismissed to make preparation cautioning to dress in plain clothes to exercise utmost care carried document article of description with whereby might be identified a belonging to english service otherwise grimly observed will hang without hesitation on nearest tree one thing more continued a rose to leave cabin a soon a be landed will proceed in search of commodore linzee squadron be ordered to join be therefore quite uncertain when may have opportunity to return to ship a have reason to believe will operate somewhere at northern end of island a soon a have accomplished mission have better make for calvi bastia when can learn actual whereabouts seize first opportunity offer to rejoin here handing packet be sufficient amount of fwench money to cawwy handsomely thwough business if hitch occurs if doe must exercise ingenuity to get out of difficulty now go away get weady ah er heartily wish success good bye offered hand with just slightest perceptible touch of stiffness in gesture seized shook so heartily in excitement of moment a to cause to raise eyebrow in astonishment at audacity next minute be on deck once more with cool night air fanning flushed burning cheek while urged frigate through water at rate of about seven knot toward light of ajaccio glimmered on horizon broad on starboard bow chapter eleven road to ajaccio descent to midshipman berth for purpose of making few preparation be signal for general fusillade of question from inquisitive messmate a to why wherefore of summons to cabin great be disgust felt that have be passed over in favour of so unimportant personage a myself be quite true that one of must claim to posse more than merest rudimentary knowledge of french yet be prepared with what considered amply sufficient reason why must have be specially selected for service mr midshipman raleigh maintained that duty be by right in virtue of seniority a to ignorance of french be mere trifle be quite satisfied must never have proved slightest impediment to success little percy neville blue eyed golden haired lad whom not even blind man must well have mistaken for anything else than pure anglo saxon flattered that cut of jib be so eminently french a to deceive even most practised eye while a to language must say bonjour bon soir bow with air of born parisian accomplishment be considered amply sufficient to ensure perfect safety while travelling to enable triumphantly to accomplish mission if need be in full light of day under very eye of unsuspecting thousand mr robert summer be of opinion that be very well might do if have be entrusted with duty first step must have be to proceed straight to ajaccio there disburse of french coin in acquisition of organ monkey together with full suit of picturesque italian rag of knew must be easily procurable provided with must have felt prepared to face with most unruffled nonchalance severest scrutiny of whole regiment of french detective acuteness of mere soldiery considered must have proved simply beneath contempt of other young gentleman be equally ready to suggest infallible scheme for baffling vigilance of enemy if conversation have other value at least served to amuse while making preparation for expedition money be mostly paper first act be to carefully secrete among lining of suit of long togs have decided to bend for cruise ashore then packed small leather bag with shirt two selecting such a say with shame have be too lazy to mark pair of sock brush comb piece of soap afterwards rejected upon urgent representation of bob summer that french never used soap much le carried about with few other necessary of trifling bulk together with small sketch book box of colour idea being that best way to elude inconvenient attention be by courting avoiding intention be to endeavour to pas a young german artist student on sketching tour sufficient knowledge of german drawing for purpose being among accomplishment lastly summoned up courage to ask of mr annesley loan of pair of beautiful little pocket pistol have frequently noticed when have have occasion to go to cabin completed equipment by time be ready once more on deck frigate have approached to within six mile of land be in act of heaving to being considered that be now a close in a be prudent to go when stepped on deck captain hood be on quarter deck talking to mr annesley mr rawlings master who be so far convalescent a to be able once more to resume duty of post a approached group heard skipper remark so know ajaccio well mr rawlings ay ay sir responded master almost a well a know portsmouth harbour have be in there twice can put ship wherever want within fathom so dark a be be there not ruin of sort close to water edge about six mile to southward of town there be old chapel believe be ground rise rather steeply from water edge there be covered with tree ruin stand just on edge of over hanging bank about thirty foot above high water mark beach below be be when saw last littered with stone block of masonry have fallen from building must be safe to attempt landing there with boat on night a asked skipper must find safer spot to land on anywhere in island confidently replied rawlings beach be shingle pretty steep bottom quite clear of rock not ripple there with wind way run boat nose up high dry jump out on to beach without wetting foot then a to chance of being discovered place be dreadful lonesome specially at night do say a be have'nted though ca vouch for truth of story do know much that last time be ashore there took stroll out a far a ruin towards told a know must happen if went there nobody ever went near place at so said did anything happen inquired mr annesley lord bless sir enjoyed walk amazingly sat smoked pipe among ruin watched sun go down stayed there till moon rose then walked back again to town never saw soul within mile of spot while be there doe not high road to ajaccio pas close by ruin inquired skipper within cable length of replied rawlings when once be in road turn to left be plain sailing for rest of way right into town there be only one turning in road be just after leave ruin be only narrow road turn to right lead off somewhere among hill just so remarked skipper in tone of great satisfaction what rawlings say agrees most accurately with information supplied to see continued addressing mr annesley so think if young chester only follows out instruction with ordinary care must have difficulty in finding place to be sent none must imagine returned mr annesley be very young admit to be entrusted with such important document on very account be le likely to attract attention have utmost faith in readiness of resource believe be quite equal to task of keeping clear of difficulty do still feel quite confident of success asked turning to perhaps ought not to say quite so much a sir replied feel nervousness whatever will do possibly can to succeed be quite sufficient said skipper now be time be off let man gig crew taking sidearms with a know place so well mr rawlings will ask to take command of expedition kindly put mr chester fairly in main road to ajaccio remember mr chester first turning to right ay ay sir replied few brief final instruction be given skipper once more shook hand wished success mr annesley following suit then gig being by time manned in water slipped down side seated in stern sheet alongside old rawlings bowman shoved off crew dropping oar with splash into water dashing into liquid fire stretched out to work sending light boat dancing over wavelet toward distant shore leaving far astern luminous wake with six small whirlpool of fire eddying on side of pulled steadily on for hour then that precaution might be omitted crew be ordered to muffle oar done resumed way at much quieter pace land rising up before uniform black mass against deep violet of star studded sky without faintest suggestion of detail of kind whereby to direct course how rawlings must possibly hit spot so absolutely invisible a ruin seemed quite incomprehensible to there be doubt be specially gifted in respect being apparently impossible for to forget confuse slightest detail of locality have once visited be that a may paddled gently on until boat be so completely within shadow of land that be in utter darkness being impossible to distinguish face of stroke oarsman from where few more stroke rawlings uttered in low tone word oar be noiselessly laid in in moment boat bow grated upon shingle of beach now a soon a have landed shove off to about fifty sixty fathom from beach lay on oar ready to pull quietly in again when hear whistle three time if hail instead of whistling bend back send in upon beach with strength then jump out shove off again moment be aboard for in case will have johnny crapaud after said rawlings to coxswain a stepped gingerly forward to bow of boat a soon a foot touched shingle turned round giving boat nose vigorous shove launched off beach with enough stern way upon to carry prescribed distance from beach without aid of oar a stood for moment watching be much disconcerted to observe how distinctly must be seen upon surface of starlit water by eye have become accustomed to surrounding gloom must have be seriously apprehensive of almost instant discovery for rawlings steady adherence to original statement that one must ever approach place after dusk upon consideration a be felt that sooner rawlings be once more on board on way back to ship easier must be in mind therefore proposed that must push ahead for high road without further pause spot be indeed of character calculated to impress with awe superstitious dread uneducated mind ground sloped steeply toward shore terminating at juncture with beach in sort of low cliff precipitous bank about thirty foot high face of be densely overgrown with shrub of various kind from midst of irregular stratum of coarse dirty white marble cropped out on extreme verge of cliff stood shattered ruin already referred to barely distinguishable from where stood a gaunt shapeless indefinable mass while beach below be encumbered with stone block of masonry have fallen from from time to time uneven surface of ground for distance on side of ruin a far back a road be completely overshadowed by enormous cypress tree of seemed extremely ancient while appeared quite dead withered there be in addition to tree thick undergrowth of long rank grass stunted shrub among outrageously prickly variety of cactus made conspicuously apparent to touch while more than half hidden by undergrowth there be dotted here there few sepulchral stone monument in very last stage of irretrievable dilapidation add to sombre surroundings melancholy sighing of night wind through branch of tree overhead occasional weird cry of nocturnal bird will not be wondered at if confess felt strong desire to get beyond precinct of eerie place with a little delay a possible after listening intently for minute two without hearing sound indicative of proximity of enemy eye meanwhile growing more accustomed to intense darkness pushed forward a rapidly a nature of ground must permit in about ten minute more found in excellent road about sixty foot wide rawlings informed led direct to ajaccio distant about seven mile now mr chester said duty be ended a far a be concerned have to do be to slip back to beach get off to ship a soon a possible will not be long running out to with pretty little breeze only wish task be a easy a remainder of mine there if be there 'd be honour credit in doing of make manner of doubt that if succeed in business promotion will be certain moment have sarved long enough anyway will be fine feather in cap got inkling of what be while talking to skipper just now did get quite right of be secret certainly not from replied at least have not be given to understand so errand be merely to deliver certain paper into hand of certain individual ashore here then rejoin ship a early a possible task must be absurdly easy be not for unsettled state of country seems to be up in arm what with french insurgent corsicans bandit latter being be told especially dangerous doubt doubt remarked rawlings in absent sort of way well wish well over cruise lad keep cool head for seems to that have white water round whichever way shape course concerning rejoining business how be going to set about captain hood advised to make best of way to northern end of island a soon a have delivered despatch think most likely will find juno there ay ay so be eh ejaculated rawlings well s'pose will haul land tack aboard for trip will be change from knocking about at sea if find ca work traverse just slip down to ajaccio quiet night there be whole fleet of pleasure boat of sort size there just jump aboard one of slip mooring make coasting v'yage of be most of capital sea boat know good model when see one by time s'pose take larger craft than can handle above take lateener be fine craft when have full crew aboard a know how to handle be dreadful awkward for one hand will find little thing about five twenty foot over be plenty large enough of 'em be regular leg o ' mutton rigged big sail for'ard jigger aft sail like witch will go right in wind eye look out for one of chap one man can handle in weather now must be off good bye lad good luck to ye so saying shook hand plunging into shrubbery disappeared chapter twelve betrayed into hand of philistine be now fairly embarked upon adventure various difficulty of seemed suddenly to present to mind in formidable reality while safe on board frigate surrounded by shipmate have appeared to be veriest trifle scarcely worth serious thought now that stood alone in enemy country with nothing to depend upon own sagacity nerve saw in instant a though truth have be revealed by lightning flash have indeed undertaken task successful performance of must tax to utmost extent one of quality for skipper have given credit however be now irretrievably in for there be possibility of backing out have be ever so inclined be not must have died first so pulling together conquering by strong effort curious quaky sensation have for moment oppressed set out upon journey spot to be bound be chateau situated about eighteen mile inland in very heart of mountain district be property of count lorenzo paoli brother of general paoli who at head of corsican insurgent be then endeavouring to drive french out of island despatch be be for count lorenzo though be of course unacquainted with content surmised that have relation to probable assistance to be rendered by english to corsicans under ordinary circumstance mission must have be extremely easy of accomplishment a have already remarked island be in thoroughly unsettled state almost male inhabitant being in arm french irritated by rising of corsicans imbued with feeling of cold blooded demoniacal ferocity developed during reign of terror rendering that period of french history for ever infamous be of course from whom have most to fear corsicans naturally excitable temperament raised to frenzy by atrocity of french rendered suspicious by frequent treachery impetuously rushing into system of most hideous reprisal be almost equally dangerous creed being that who be not with must necessarily be against proceeding with regard to suspected person be rumoured to be of most summary character lastly there be brigand composed principally of very dreg of corsican society community made up of criminality in island thief murderer escaped convict outcast of

to desirability of forthwith seeking safe hiding place wherein to pas day take repose of be beginning to feel need therefore turned off road plunged into forest for about quarter of mile when came upon dense almost impenetrable thicket seemed admirably suited to purpose accordingly forced way into until found spot of clear ground wide enough to stretch upon comfortably when flinging upon turf

concluding last trifling arrangement connected with ceremony doubtless be in reality to enjoy one more interview with inamorata before performance of holy rite be to make for ever count di solzi be absent when arrived young couple anticipating evil wandered away from chateau at length in preoccupation entered wood through run road from ajaccio across to eastern side of island sauntered along road for considerable distance when heard tramp of party of soldier behind looking back found in presence of detachment of french infantry there be great deal of ill feeling existing even then between corsicans french though be not of course anything like what be at present hostility have not a yet broken out flame be so fiercely raging to day throughout island being then no more than smouldering spark still rencontre be disagreeable to shorten a much a possible isabel lover turned back with intention of passing french in opposite direction by time that have resolved on french be upon instead of courteously permitting to pas officer in command ordered to halt give account of have of course option to obey did french officer however either doubted affected to doubt story announced intention of taking a prisoner into ajaccio isabel lover remonstrated entreated threatened by turn in vain at length officer turning from began to assail trembling isabel with jest of coarsest kind be more than hot corsican blood must endure suddenly breaking from guard frantic lover rushed upon commanding officer who seemed to be chief offender with single blow struck senseless to ground next moment must have be impaled upon bayonet of soldiery have other officer not interfered knew chief knew too that must never be forgiven did not preserve victim for punishment to be inflicted by halt be immediately called being at time in perhaps most lonely part of road strong guard be placed over prisoner rest of men piling arm vigorous effort be at once proceeded with for restoration of injured officer injury being slight be soon successful mock drum head court martial be then instituted by male prisoner be tried convicted sentence be passed ruffianly band at once proceeded jeeringly to carry into execution unhappy lover be stripped firmly bound to tree shrieking isabel be then dragged before in presence be scourged to death with soldier belt miserable girl be then released troop shouldered arm marched merrily away safely reaching in due time barrack in ajaccio meanwhile day passed on count robert returned to chateau a be custom at once sought daughter failing to find made inquiry among servant then learned that lover have left domain hour before intelligence made count somewhat uneasy remounting horse set out in quest of truant upon road learned have taken penetrated forest for distance at length be startled by hearing shrill scream of maniacal laughter imagine if can horror distress when on reaching spot from sound proceeded discovered daughter seated upon ground with dead lover head upon lap uttering peal after peal of blood curdling laughter a strove to bind up bruised lacerated body in strip of linen torn from own clothing on approaching poor girl appeared to recognise father in confused sort of way with little difficulty at length persuaded to allow to lay murdered man across horse back to accompany home be of course patent to distracted count that fiendish atrocity of sort have be committed be quite impossible to gather particular even most meagre hint from poor demented girl by side therefore made best of way back to chateau whence immediately upon arrival despatched couple of mounted servant one of whom have charge of note conveying hint of catastrophe to friend of murdered man while other have instruction to find bring back with to chateau first medical man in ajaccio by chateau be full of self invited guest attracted thither by rumour have reached ear concerning event of day sort of surmise suggestion be made a to probable perpetrator of outrage doctor too a well a friend of murdered man be there former have on seeing patient lost time in administering powerful opiate with object of procuring for unfortunate isabel temporary relief from unnatural excitement of overtaxed brain when at drug have done work poor girl lay stretched upon bed in state of unconsciousness general consultation be held at be resolved to spare pain to discover punish author of so atrocious crime with understanding visitor on following morning departed on several way for day effort put forth to discover offender resulted in complete failure in meantime poor isabel lay tossing restlessly with brain fever at length one night intoxicated french soldier blurted out secret in hearing of one of occupant of tavern little judicious questioning mingled with occasional expression of incredulity extracted from fellow full detail of crime be promptly communicated to count di solzi who immediately called upon officer who have be named a chief culprit taxed with wretch scornfully admitted share in outrage scoffed at agonising grief of poor old man challenge followed a matter of course meeting be arranged for following morning when morning dawned french officer be found dead in bed stabbed to heart count be immediately arrested on suspicion of being assassin though neighbouring nobility knew charge to be a monstrous ill founded a ever be brought against mortal man did lay in power to have matter properly investigated though soon after arrest one of own servant came voluntarily forward confessed that be not master who have done deed poor isabel father be summarily tried sentenced hanged over gate of own chateau act of base cruel injustice coupled with previous outrage caused smouldering spark of discontent disaffection to blaze forth at once into devastating insurrectionary flame most ruthless reprisal be forthwith resorted to on side assassination secret open became order of day corsicans flew to arm struggle commenced be now being waged can never end until hated french have be extirpated from off face of island how fared unhappy isabel meanwhile inquired be on father arrest brought here at imminent risk of life replied count while still lay delirious father execution took place chateau be then sacked when soldier have loaded with article of value be possible for to take away set fire to

through shameful deed of murder spoliation be imprudent enough to camp for night close to scene of outrage sentinel be duly posted everything be a man thought made perfectly secure be fatally mistaken sentinel be surprised in detail despatched without having have opportunity to give alarm then band of upwards of armed corsicans stole in upon defenceless camp slaughtered one of sleeping frenchman not one survived to tell tale isabel contrary to expectation rapidly recovered health reason soon became apparent that terrible change have be wrought in though how terrible did not realise until afterwards of course be not to be expected that girl who have passed through what have must ever be same again there be change in apart from what might reasonably have be expected under circumstance reason appeared to be completely restored talked calmly rationally enough upon subject not excepting even misfortune there be coldness reserve about even with most intimate friend found very difficult to understand at length one day missed apprehensive of recurrence of temporary aberration of intellect from have so recently recovered searched for in direction for three whole day without success at end of time received note from thanking for what be pleased to term great kindness informing that have taken step to carry out sole purpose of future life be vengeance upon author of wrong enemy of country knew not what to make of statement at first soon afterwards learned that meant have formed guerilla band at head of have placed avowed object of be war to knife with french a long a of remain in corsica most terribly have carried out purpose so far for already nearly frenchman have perished upon weapon of band fourteen french officer have met death at own hand adoption of so vindictive purpose have gained for title of bell ' demonio title have accepted a perfectly appropriate a indicative of relentless vengeance enemy may look for from what terrible history of wanton wrong of merciless retribution exclaimed when count have finished narrative be horrible to think that being claiming to be civilised can be capable of such monstrous deed be so a can testify from conversation of frenchman who took prisoner by bye reminds that be subject of remark have reason to suppose in sort of danger well replied count must scarcely say that consider in absolute danger of course be only reasonable to suppose that since brother have placed at head of insurgent must be regarded with certain amount of suspicion that occasion anxiety whatever for have one about whom can implicitly trust even to confide no more than can possibly help so think may say be reasonably safe from betrayal at same time omit precaution because have strong reason to suppose that action be being watched a believe have already mentioned perhaps will favour with recapitulation of remark made by french concerning have hitherto have mean of ascertaining exactly in what estimation hold light on subject must be especially valuable just now in accordance with request related substance of conversation have occurred among frenchman while be being conveyed toward ajaccio count listened intently never interrupting once must see by expression of feature how powerfully be moved especially by remark have reference to daughter when have finished thank signor how will call said name be ralph chester replied thank sincerely signor ralph for very valuable information have afforded give to position altogether new somewhat alarming aspect be true that be safe so far a paper brought be concerned be out of hand even if discovered contain nothing must possibly compromise what have just told appears to indicate decided desire on part of french to find excuse for molesting personally there be nothing must like better than opportunity for holding chateau against attack from french hate with deadly hatred heaven know be not without ample cause if day be to go against shudder to think of inevitable fate of darling child signor must never fall into hand alive must rather blot out innocent young life with unarmed hand than leave alive at mercy of fiend have already told somewhat of what can do be capable of even greater refinement of cruelty than poor bell demonio experienced at hand be glad to have heard what have just told greatly increase anxiety must only place francesca in safety must not greatly matter a be yes must endeavour to find secure retreat for child will have further peace of mind more think of clearer doe become that chateau be no longer fit place for conversed for time longer then maria made appearance with licence of old servant unhesitatingly expressed conviction have conversed far more freely than be at good for in feeble condition asserted decidedly that unless be at once left for rest of day in perfect quiet direst consequence must surely follow upon count abruptly took departure with elaborate apology for what chose to term want of consideration for remainder of day strict embargo be laid upon room by stern old disciplinarian maria on following day count be only permitted to enter for purpose of making few brief kind inquiry a to progress spent time chiefly in meditating upon charm of count lovely daughter in hoping for happiness of visit from to intense disappointment remained invisible maria mounted strict guard over when circumstance necessitated absence dark eyed angela be called in to relieve watch latter be evidently willing enough to chat with soon became apparent that have received order from maria that entertained too wholesome dread of individual lightly to disobey under circumstance time dragged on wearily enough so that when on fourth day received permission to rise from bed change room for hour two regarded inflexible maria with feeling of gratitude almost akin to love experience of sick bed be unfortunately so little rarity that most of reader will be able to realise for delight with after refreshing toilet clad in easiest a well a most gorgeous of dressing gown passed out through door of sick room sprightly angela be guide also to great extent support a passed down short corridor turned into small elegantly furnished room single glance round be sufficient to assure be in favoured abode of beauty table littered with variety of flimsy trifle lady be wont to dignify with name of

exquisite statuette supported on wall bracket delicate alabaster vas of choice sweetly scented flower cage of gaily plumaged bird there said guide a deposited in most comfortable chair in room be that to liking signor perfectly replied see here angela have not made mistake be understood be to occupy room if may hazard guess must say be mistress own especial apartment one to retreat when desire strict privacy be quite right signor be lady boudoir count instruction be that be to be taken to most comfortable room in chateau though there be many larger more grand know of none where must be quite so comfortable a in have doubt be perfectly right little one said greatly fear that in taking possession of apartment will be intruding be very unkind of to think such thing signor one who have suffered a have in cause of countryman must ever be deemed intruder in of apartment of chateau paoli said clear silvery voice behind turned saw that owner of apartment have just entered at open door in time to hear remark beautiful girl looked more lovely than ever thought a somewhat shyly congratulated on progress have made toward recovery playfully scolded unabashed angela for not putting room in somewhat better order before introducing to apologised for state of confusion be in finally asked if must do anything to add to comfort with boldness of british midshipman at once replied that comfort happiness must be complete if must condescend to favour with a much of society a possible dear girl blushed laughed called bold boy then at earnest request placed in chair near after slight pause of embarrassment commenced conversation theme of be struggle upon corsicans have just entered of course be very well highly interesting one must have looked at listened to so lovely creature unmoved a descanted in feeling language upon wrong from corsicans have suffered so greatly at hand of french to tell truth felt just then too weak to take more than languid interest in subject be too exciting for in invalid condition besides perceived that theme be painful one to companion therefore gradually drew conversation into lighter channel be soon deep in discussion of poetry music painting subject in seemed to be equally interested enthusiasm upon speedily broke down slight barrier of reserve have interposed between at commencement of interview result be that when objectionable old party maria came to announce arrival of moment when return to own room be judged advisable found comfortably established upon same lounge sitting very close to other deep in beauty of portfolio of choice engraving rested upon knee moreover have grown so confidential that by mutual agreement usual formal style of address have be discarded young hostess promising to call ralph if must address a francesca from date progress toward perfect recovery be rapid few day more be passed in francesca boudoir in enjoyment of delightful society then came happy moment when supported by arm be able to move slowly for short distance about superbly laid out ground of chateau delightful walk became more extended day naturally resulted in establishment of still more intimate relation between in very short time knew about past history future prospect of other latter be eminently satisfactory on side for with assurance of boy midshipman speedily announced intention of winning post rank in shortest possible amount of time chiefly a desirable preliminary to return to corsica for purpose of claiming lovely francesca hand in marriage sweet girl laughed heartily at at first though younger than be more of woman than be of man assumed with great many of air of senior upon vehement repeated protestation of seriousness permanent nature of intention laughter ceased became embarrassed agitated finally after much pressing assured face crimsoned with blush while that if ever came to claim must be mine now be quite aware that conduct in respect be wrong be too young prospect be far too vague at time to justify in speaking of love to woman besides in so unceremoniously laying siege to beautiful francesca susceptible heart might for must tell be seriously interfering with count plan for daughter future at time of thought anything of of thing being be perfectly content with state of thing a be happy in present quite agreed a to future to however of gave single serious thought think francesca be to blame in matter have never have mother to teach prudence certainly acted very wrongly for though little more than boy be old enough to know better offer excuse for conduct be quite inexcusable a be telling story of life feel must not be dealing fairly with reader did attempt to pas over fault misdeed in silence day two more passed swiftly away be rapidly regaining strength fractured arm bone have knit firmly together again though of course be still quite useless splint not having be removed use of sling promising to remain necessity for little time longer be revolving seriously in mind question of what must be best course to pursue in order to rejoin ship when little incident occurred immediately diverted thought in entirely different direction francesca be sauntering slowly down broad tree bordered drive led from main road to chateau when man passed francesca stopped to ask question two to give direction thus got full view of feature for perhaps quite three minute to intense surprise recognised in individual who have betrayed to french troop who have without doubt betrayed in turn to bell ' demonio guerilla band in word be guiseppe when eye met for first time saw in moment that not only recognised also that be most anxious to know whether recognised have on tip of tongue to tax with perfidy to threaten to denounce there be something in glance gave idea that be meditating further treachery instantly decided that most effective mean to defeat plan if entertained must be to throw off guard watch keenly course of event therefore assumed calmness indifference of demeanour certainly did not feel looked at a though have never seen before waiting until fellow be well out of ear shot asked francesca whether be one of servant at chateau well replied be not exactly that be merely kind of hanger on father died in service man be in younger day one of stable boy left about year ago to become wood cutter charcoal burner since then just come go when like finding board lodging when requires giving in return trifling service may be required of nothing more be said about man at time resolved to speak to count lorenzo about at first opportunity presented same evening on return to chateau recalled to count mind conversation have passed respecting among french soldier also directed attention to fact that subject of remark have be referred to in term seemed to leave room for doubt a to treachery individual of whom speak be called guiseppe be not remarked count when have said say certainly replied what be name of man matteo matteo bartolozzi be full name replied count thought there must be mistake somewhere have evidently be misled friend by accidental resemblance matteo traitor pardon dear signor ralpho if knew poor fellow a well a do must recognise absurdity of supposition have known matteo life must have hesitation in trusting with anything ay even with daughter safety heaven forbid that necessity must ever arise fervently exclaimed must be better to confide to protection of pack of starving wolf be not deceived by accidental resemblance feel a sure of identity of man whom call matteo with traitor guiseppe a be of own existence believe count must not speak so positively did there exist faintest possibility of doubt good sir returned count somewhat tartly assure that what say be quite impossible repeat have known man life have done nothing good have befriended in thousand way know must lay down life rather than bring harm to mine saw that effort to undeceive count be worse than useless therefore abandoned attempt at same time argument utterly failed to convince have be mistaken did not even raise most transitory doubt in mind therefore determined to simply wait watch course of event chapter fifteen night attack upon chateau for next two day matter went on at chateau much a usual old maria be a sedulously attentive a ever sole occupation being apparently preparation of tempting strengthening dish for consumption concoction of tonic herbal medicine administered with relentless severity weather continued gloriously fine enabling to be in open air greater portion of day although count be absent beautiful daughter more than supplied place a far at least a be concerned so that what with judicious nursing nourishment plenty of easy exercise in delicious bracing mountain air delightful society of francesca paoli be rapidly gaining in health spirit on second evening after conversation with count lorenzo respecting man whom called matteo bartolozzi francesca be slowly returning to house after somewhat longer walk than usual when be startled by sound of horse approaching at rapid gallop behind turning round saw that be count reined up when alongside of gaily saluting dismounted walked rest of distance to house with when reached broad terrace in front of chateau handed over still panting horse to one of servant placing arm in mine dismissed daughter saying have important communication to make to moment that francesca be fairly out of ear shot turned to said received about hour ago intimation that party of french soldier be on way here for purpose of arresting on suspicion of conspiring with insurgent against french government be also informed that authority have be given to officer in command to take by force must refuse to surrender accompany quietly at once set out to return here galloping way on reaching cross road about six mile from here saw approaching along ajaccio road detachment of infantry have not least doubt be party referred to have quite made up mind not to surrender must be simply throwing away life to do so with existing state of feeling of french towards corsicans must doubtless be subjected to ceremony of trial must be quite mock affair doom be probably already fixed will therefore defend chateau a long a wall will hold together quite despair of doing so successfully although garrison will be weak one suppose can muster more than twenty people told by mean reliable if come to downright hand to hand tussle question be what be to do with must fail again fall into hand of french fate be sealed will assuredly hang a spy on nearest tree may venture to ask count what be intention with regard to daughter said turned deadly pale for instant then blood rushed furiously to head face crimsoned eye sparkled vindictively vein of forehead stood out like knotted cord a hoarsely ejaculated man who lay hand upon must pas over dead body let tell signor inglese will not die easily much french blood will flow before fall unless unlucky bullet happens to strike fairly in forehead early in fight suggested do imagine that will be imbecile enough to expose in so reckless fashion a to render probable returned if fight will be for life not for glory therefore will take reasonable precaution to protect life still persisted in excitement of fight prudence be sometimes forgotten for brief space must not be advisable to take measure may be possible to secure retreat must such unhappily become necessary count made reply for full minute during continued to pace terrace in deepening twilight then turned to said wonder whether will understand if say that a far a be concerned retreat be quite impossible if once come into collision with french must either conquer die there be for middle course then that settle question a far be concerned replied be imperative that daughter must also die in event of sustaining defeat must either die fall into hand of french replied count sternly with fate of poor bell demonio fresh in memory must for instant hesitate a to alternative to accept must send away to seek shelter with friend presence if discovered must only compromise friend irretrievably a well a prove fatal to herself besides to speak truth there be so much treachery existing among dare not run risk if ship be only within reach think dare trust francesca on board must at least be safe from french have doubt captain must afford temporary protection until other arrangement must be made that must be certain replied eagerly can certainly venture to promise so much in behalf unfortunately however juno ' be now at north end of island only safe mean rather least dangerous mean of reaching seems to to be by water have come to conclusion that be way by will have to go if felt must confide miss francesca to protection must be only too happy to have opportunity to to make love to on way eh interrupted count with smile nay never blush look confused boy do think that because have not seen much of for last few day be altogether blind know just a well a do that two child fancy yourselves in love with other be few year older might have somewhat to say in matter a be be too young for to take serious notice of however be not now question do really think must safely convey daughter to north end of island place not on board ship in care of aunt brother wife be seaman know be doubtless skilled in profession how must proceed must be perfect madness to attempt engaging vessel to convey along coast reward for delivering over to french authority must be irresistible temptation to fisherman coaster must not dream of running so serious risk replied plan be very simple must make for ajaccio timing to reach place about two three o'clock in morning seize most promising looking boat must find make sail in only difficulty must be with wounded arm be at present quite useless dare say if be only difficulty again interrupted count may be easily must send one of people with man whom can implicitly trust who have moreover have experience on board small craft trade along coast not matteo hope said not matteo replied count be prejudiced against must probably refuse to take man be thinking of be called giaccomo be one of under gardener must like to see man said in meantime have not better make what preparation can to defend chateau a well a to secure retreat must such be necessary by mean said count let first go to stable arrange mean for escape must be necessary then will go round chateau together see what can be done in matter of defending turned away walked round to stable in stood ten fine horse count ordered to be removed at once to place called elfin grotto giving instruction that three be considered to be fleetest be to be saddled bridled ready for instant use francesca saddle being required for one of also hunted out giaccomo who looked smart honest fellow enough ordered to go with horse to grotto holding in readiness for lengthened journey at moment notice that be to understand be under immediate order to do might require of then retired to interior of chateau to examine into capability of defence a much to get out of way a for other reason francesca be directed to prepare small package of clothing such a must serve for week so father informing that might be necessary for to leave chateau for short time that in such event have undertaken to escort to place of safety done made careful examination of floor of building beginning with lowest ground floor chateau be built in italian style of architecture consisted of two wing lofty central tower window of lower floor reached from near ceiling right down to ground gave access by mean of row of three step directly to room from broad terrace along front window be protected by strong solid shutter of oak be arranged to be fastened on inside with three heavy iron bar one at top one half way down one at bottom door be very solid substantial affair of oak thickly studded with nail be so well provided with massive bolt felt confident of power to resist anything except artillery completed defence of lower floor so far a front be concerned back have very little fear about high solid stone wall surmounted by formidable chevaux de frise extending for about thirty yard from wing then stretching back far enough to enclose stable other office a well a spacious kitchen garden window of next two floor be quite unprotected count therefore gave immediate order to have available bed mattress cushion etcetera piled up along lower portion of window just high enough to protect person when kneeling on floor grand staircase be only one accessible from front entrance be also strongly barricaded in three four place sort of breastwork being constructed on first landing behind defender might shelter from fire of attacking party below done nothing remained to collect arm ammunition muster attendant await development of event have not very long to wait evening have closed down upon deepened into night during progress of preparation count be watching from one of window exquisitely beautiful spectacle afforded by clear moonrise when observed moving object among deep shadow cast by tree of distant avenue once twice cold gleam of steel where mellow ray of moon penetrated through overarching branch presently small group of figure emerged from shadow of tree approached along central drive led up to broad expanse of flower bed beyond terrace a came nearer perceived that consisted of officer in uniform of one of french regiment of foot couple of file of men bugler come said count to a soon a have clearly made out character of visitor let go down see what gentleman have to say made way down staircase passing through opening have be purposely left in barricade must be effectually closed in le than minute accompanied by dozen of most resolute trusty of count people armed with musket dagger emerged through great door upon terrace step leading to frenchman be just ascending be allowed to fairly reach terrace distance of thirty yard so then intervening between when count stepped forward raising hand cried in french in authoritative voice halt allow body of armed men to approach chateau nearer than spot where now stand without first receiving explanation of reason for presence officer in command may however come forward state business warn that if rest attempt to approach men will at once fire upon frenchman halted officer after apparently giving men brief instruction in low tone of voice advanced towards raising shako a joined saying have honour to address count lorenzo di paoli be individual whom name replied count to what circumstance be indebted for honour of somewhat extraordinary visit be instructed by general lefevre officer in command of force now stationed at ajaccio to request immediate attendance before in reference to matter closely affecting own honour replied frenchman a have not advantage of general lefevre acquaintance can not conceive what interest can possibly have in matter relating to honour may go back to sir tell positively decline to accede to request to say least of be very singular one to make to corsican noble regret to say that general anticipating possibility of refusal have ordered in case to arrest be disagreeable necessity must much rather have avoided leave alternative count lorenzo di paoli arrest in name of national assembly on charge of conspiracy answered frenchman stepping forward attempting to lay hand on count shoulder stand back sir cried count lorenzo stepping back pace levelling pistol at officer head be fully acquainted with general design against decline to walk into trap have set for repudiate defy authority will resist to death may go back tell so have say so exclaimed frenchman rash man will soon feel power of authority have so arrogantly defied for may inform have at hand party strong enough to compel submission order be not to return to ajaccio without then go sir bring up party retorted count scornfully will endeavour to give reception a will teach general to beware how attempt to molest corsican noble for future french officer bowed raised shako somewhat hastily retired withdrawing men from terrace directly joined stood watching down drive until having reached point about midway between terrace avenue well out of musket shot little party halted bugle call be sounded saw large body of men deploy into line beneath tree advance along drive at double then retreated to interior of chateau carefully locking barring great door behind closing barrier on grand staircase a ascended made best of way to principal floor from whence have decided to conduct defence in first instance disposition for defence of chateau be simple in extreme have only front of house to defend side rear being protected by high wall before referred to therefore divided little garrison into two party one to wing of building count heading one party confiding direction of other to a plan be complete count separated on reaching gallery at head of staircase going to part of building have undertaken to defend making best of way to own command on entering saloon where party be stationed at once went to nearest window to reconnoitre moon be by time riding high in unclouded ether flooding scene with soft effulgence of silvery beam rendering object be not obscured by black shadow of tree a distinct a though have be daylight brilliant disc be invisible from front window of chateau having by time passed somewhat to rear of building of course gave very decided advantage inasmuch a rendered difficult for attacking party to distinguish at window while be exposed in full radiance of brilliant moonlight when reached window main body of french have just joined smaller party have be halted presented formidable array numbering in estimation quite hundred armed with musket bayonet thought detected among small party of grenadier three four individual apparently officer be standing little distance apart from rest appeared to be consulting together remained thus for about five minute when bugler sounded parley one of officer separating from rest advanced alone towards chateau displaying white handkerchief attached to sword point on seeing count lorenzo threw open window immediately over door stepped out upon balcony also exhibiting white handkerchief officer continued to approach until be within easy speaking distance when halted exclaimed once more count lorenzo di paoli call upon to surrender resistance a must see from force under command will be quite useless can only result in needle effusion of blood assure will be visited with severest retribution not on alone also on who may be taken in arm with will retribution descend for own sake therefore for sake of misguided men who be being tempted by rashness to own destruction ask again for last time to yield without further resistance have one answer to make to appeal sir replied count be positively refuse to place in power of who have again again proved completely devoid of principle of honour justice here now throw off allegiance to country government of be in hand of regicide wholesale murderer declare to be in active sympathy with corsican patriot enough sir more than enough haughtily returned frenchman on head must rest responsibility for bloodshed may now ensue turning

interfered be barely in time to prevent volley being fired upon learned afterwards that count knowing temper feeling of people have before going out on balcony given most positive order to under command whatever issue of interview might be officer be to be allowed to retire unmolested attack commenced immediately upon french officer rejoining command entire force advancing at rapid double in order to place a speedily a possible under cover afforded by steep slope divided flower garden from broad terrace in front of chateau rush be made cover gained in le than couple of minute coolest steadiest marksman have already be stationed at window with order to select individual mark to make shot tell result be that almost immediately upon troop getting in motion irregular fire broke out upon from chateau short a be time occupied in making rush left ten eleven of number prostrate behind frenchman by mean intended letting have thing own way however for directly be safe under shelter of slope crept up shielding a well a must behind massive stone balustrade bounding terrace opened upon galling continuous fire fire grew hotter hotter until rattle of musketry along front of terrace became continuous bullet pattering in shower through window in spite of hastily arranged bulwark wounding more le severely many of people while terrace be obscured by thick curtain of fleecy smoke have lasted for perhaps five minute when from loophole of observation descried dimly in midst of smoky canopy dozen indistinct form hurriedly crossing terrace toward great entrance door of chateau immediately directed attention of party to men ordering to concentrate whole of fire upon stop advance if possible at hazard be just in time almost simultaneous volley rang out just a men be getting so near wall that must not be aimed at without complete exposure on part of marksman one of fell few second afterwards series of sharp explosion took place told that men have be bearer of grenade petard with to blow open door success have not be obtained without price for three of men be shot dead one more so seriously wounded that have to retire from combat in consequence of way in men have be obliged to expose in order to cover grenadier with musket meanwhile curtain of smoke veiled terrace be moment growing more dense in few minute from fall of grenadier have become so thick that be quite impossible to see what be going on outside at distance of more than twenty foot from window fire be maintained a furiously a ever bullet no longer flew so thickly about ear clear indication that antagonist be a much blinded a be be aiming pretty much at random a be of utmost importance to economise ammunition a much a possible therefore directed party to cease firing for time until smoke must have cleared away little at event only to fire when must descry object at to aim then went across to other wing to suggest to count adoption of similar plan have just reached side when violent explosion occurred below accompanied by sound of splitting rending of timber heavy crash to landing to landing man of shouted count have blown down door nothing can now prevent entering house keep cool steady men may yet successfully defend staircase ah be just about to seek exclaimed a eye fell upon must fly at once delay instant beg of will find francesca in music saloon will be guide to grotto a soon a have reached mount ride for life take care of ralph a must that own sister must be cared for may god be shield defence in danger now go there be time for further parley know must have do know where to seek for friend with whom wish to place francesca god bless dear boy farewell until meet again have already said farewell to daughter wrung hand convulsively releasing fairly pushed away from along corridor led to music saloon a hurried away loud shout arose from hall below accompanied by sound a of ax bar crashing into barricade at foot of staircase then rattling volley of musketry rang out from gallery followed by loud shriek agonised groan fierce oath yell of defiance answering volley from below followed by more shriek one two heavy fall a rapidly increased distance from scene of action varied sound merged into fierce whirling din such a might have arisen have pandemonium opened adamantine gate poured out upon hapless chateau legion of destroying fiend on entering saloon found francesca on knee ready equipped for journey with small gold crucifix in hand have removed from neck a entered apartment rose to foot hastily replacing jewel came up to placing hand in mine exclaimed with quivering lip oh ralph dearest what be meaning of dreadful strife why have attacked chateau will tell a soon a be out of reach of immediate danger replied at present have time for anything action so if be ready will proceed at once be quite ready answered feel very undecided what to do father told to prepare for journey to be ready to leave chateau with at moment do think must be justified in doing so now that be in such dreadful peril peril be by mean a great a appear to think said compliance with father instruction will relieve of very serious embarrassment so let not linger moment entreat suggestion that presence might possibly prove embarrassing to father at once decided placing hand in mine said simply be ready let go moved to door of apartment passed down entire length of corridor presently reached head of staircase leading to rear portion of house ordinarily used exclusively by servant descending traversed short passage at foot finally emerged through door into garden at rear path closely bordered with mulberry tree led down through centre of garden passing down eventually reached rustic building ordinarily used a tool house entering francesca turned to said now ralph there be secret door in back wall have never be through so know exact position be opened by pressing spring head of be formed like ordinary nail head differing from others only in that project little more from woodwork than others do think can find ran hand over boarding soon encountered what must have seemed to one unacquainted with secret merely ill driven nail pressing firmly upon yielded cleverly concealed door opened revealed very narrow passage like space between wooden partition solid stone boundary wall of garden entering turning back upon open door in accordance with francesca direction feeling cautiously before with foot found standing at head of flight of stone step cautiously descended francesca following closely behind after closing secret door in rear in few second found at foot of step standing in arched tunnel apparently about six foot high a many foot wide then moved cautiously rapidly forward hand in hand meeting with difficulty inconvenience during passage excepting such a arose from mephitic atmosphere however be in sufficiently trying be heartily glad when after lapse of nearly quarter of hour suddenly experienced delicious whiff of cool pure night air immediately afterwards emerged from confined tunnel like passage into moderately spacious cavern through foliage at mouth of broad patch of luminous star lighted sky be visible who go there ejaculated voice from mass of deep shadow on one side of cave recognised giaccomo voice at once replied adding inquiry a to whether have detected sign of presence of enemy in neighbourhood of cavern none signor replied have seen nothing time have be here have heard nothing except sound of distant firing in direction of chateau then let be off at once said sooner get into main road le likelihood will there be of meeting with molestation without more ado francesca be accordingly assisted by giaccomo to mount wounded arm precluding from seizing that coveted privilege after corsican sprang into saddle cavalcade moved forth into dazzling moonlight taking way over short springy turf in direction enabled to keep chateau between french being cautious at same time to keep a much a possible within shadow of tree after travelling in way for about couple of mile chateau became entirely concealed from view by intervening tree though sound of brisk firing must still be distinctly heard therefore sent giaccomo to front a guide with instruction to shape course a must take out upon high road to ajaccio ranged own horse up alongside of francesca who have behaved with admirable coolness courage throughout adventure seemed keenly distressed at necessity forced from father side at time of such peculiar peril to feeling at once set to combat making a light a possible of peril stating that attack upon chateau be merely wanton outrage on part of french inflicted by way of retaliation in consequence of count refusal to obey discourteous summons from general at ajaccio be successful beyond utmost hope fair companion deriving from representation comfort reassurance scarcely intended certainly have not heart to take away again so that by time reached ajaccio did without adventure of kind have grown to regard whole affair with very tolerable amount of equanimity after striking high road performed remainder of journey at foot pace object being to reach town by about one o'clock in morning by time giaccomo assured entire inhabitant of place must be in bed fast asleep on reaching point in road where have taken leave of rawlings juno sailing master dismounted turning horse head homeward after adjusting bridle so that must not be likely to trail on ground entangle foot giaccomo administered to of animal smart stroke across flank with riding whip sent off at rattling gallop back along road have come man assuring that must be certain to keep on steadily until again found at stable door at chateau did so a to avoid necessity of attracting attention to ourselves by seeking stabling for in town at late hour when steed be fairly out of sight resumed way walked leisurely into ajaccio safely reached just about time have previously fixed upon a most desirable for arrival chapter sixteen mouette vigilant requin on reaching port first consideration be to discover suitable craft in to make trip along coast to north end of island when actually came to point must confess that idea of seizing carrying off property of somebody else be extremely repugnant to still must see other course open without exposing party to imminent danger of betrayal have resolved in own mind that since necessity seemed to point to deprivation of unfortunate individual of property deprivation must be only temporary must take most suitable boat must find when done with seek mean of returning to owner with handsome sum of money a hire having made up mind so far took counsel with giaccomo who knew place well immediately ran over list of craft belonging to port one of thought must serve purpose passably well in midst of statement however suddenly interrupted with many objurgation upon own stupidity to added statement that have just that instant thought of craft must suit admirably one moreover need not distress about returning sound rather promising said what be giaccomo be pleasure boat measuring about fifteen ton replied man be very strange looking craft sail like wind be property of one of french officer who built for own amusement then said if be likely to suit will certainly make prize of without compunction lead on man let see if can find went on distance further until came to waterside not meeting with single soul on way there helped to rowing boat pulled out into bay where according to giaccomo account must find if then happened to be in port pulled through large fleet of fishing boat coasting felucca other craft mostly of size ranging from two to fifty ton at length just a be beginning to think search must be in vain giaccomo exclaimed there be looked in direction indicated saw long low hulled craft cutter rigged with what struck a set of spar altogether disproportionate to size oh exclaimed in tone of disappointment will never do why must capsize with capful of wind by mean signor replied corsican though yew must never believe to look at carry canvas better longer than boat belonging to ajaccio a for working to windward be simply astounding if be so said let paddle up alongside take look at did so on nearer inspection found to be according to then prevalent idea concerning naval architecture quite a extraordinary a giaccomo have described to be be about five time a long a be wide with bow like fine wedge good clean run very little freeboard be in fact singular foreshadowing of modern type of racing cutter consequently at date absolutely unique be rather taken with appearance curiosity moreover being strongly excited by marvellous story told by giaccomo respecting sailing power asserted have have frequent opportunity of observing from having be occasionally engaged to accompany owner on cruise decided forthwith to take possession of a lawful prize mooring boat alongside accordingly crept softly on board giaccomo immediately descended into little forecastle to ascertain whether one happened to be on board forecastle proved to be empty on going down into cabin saw by feeble glimmer of cabin lamp lad of about eighteen comfortably stretched out on cushion laid along upon top of locker drawing long knife from sheath giaccomo unceremoniously broke in upon slumber of youth brandishing gleaming blade before astonished eye while admonishing in fierce whisper not to utter sound above breath if placed slightest value upon life ordered to enumerate what store there be on board to indicate locality lad did leading first to small well arranged pantry then opening locker exhibiting content brief survey be sufficient to satisfy that craft be amply provisioned for cruise matter being thus satisfactorily settled repaired to deck proceeded to loose sail get cutter under way lad whom have so roughly aroused being persuaded by occasional suggestive exhibition of giaccomo knife to render best assistance in task while two be thus engaged conducted francesca below having indicated to small luxuriously furnished sleeping cabin of owner proposed that must take possession thereof endeavour to recruit somewhat exhausted energy by procuring if possible few hour sleep then returned to deck found crew in act of getting up anchor be soon done head sail be trimmed under gentle westerly breeze proceeded to work out of bay a cutter have boat of own towing astern cast adrift one have borrowed left to take chance of drifting ashore finding way once more into proper owner hand shortly after leaving anchorage passed close to leeward of long rakish looking lateener on board a ill luck must have anchor watch be being kept circumstance of getting under way at so unusual hour must have attracted attention on board craft at event casting adrift of shore boat have be observed a approached be hailed from deck with inquiry a to whether be aware that one of boat have gone adrift ay ay replied giaccomo know be all right will pick up presently care to tack just now in light wind for fear of diavolo hold tongue son of boiled monkey will let daylight into on one side out on other latter part of speech have be addressed to prisoner who encouraged by close proximity of two vessel have without sign of warning lifted up voice shouted with power of lung perfidie nous som remainder of sentence have be choked back by iron grasp of giaccomo hand upon lad throat dagger being flashed before eye threat hissed into ear at same moment be enough mischief have be done a glided past craft stern saw man on watch dart to companion disappear returning to deck in le than minute accompanied by individual whose fluttering white garment sufficiently indicated that have come direct from berth without waiting to observe decency of ordinary life too hailed wasted breath in attempting to reply fully aware that nothing must say must allay suspicion have be aroused instead therefore of shouting back possibly attracting attention of other craft devoted energy to trimming canvas to best advantage packing upon cutter rag must set per baccho ejaculated giaccomo between set teeth addressing author of mischief emphasising remark with smart prod of knife in most fleshy part of misguided individual person have great mind to slash throat open then launch overboard a breakfast to shark have drawn upon attention of rascally guarda costa captain of will not be satisfied until have received full explanation of remark maledetto remember moment capture seems certain will slit up a must sardine appropriate gesture with knife so if object to being slit open like sardine will give help can comprehend lad comprehended so well that be frightened half out of wit went round deck taking extra pull here easing off inch of sheet there shifting water cask in short doing knew to increase speed of cutter glancing anxiously astern at guarda costa in interval from to dreaded shipmate of course be aware ought to have interfered put stop to terrorism on part of hot blooded corsican must have done so have there appeared probability of executing sanguinary threat have already seen enough of to believe that bark be great deal worse than bite so a prisoner have evidently got into what might prove very awkward scrape be willing that must not be allowed to go altogether unpunished be even a giaccomo have foreseen be scarcely mile from guarda costa when saw canvas drooping in heavy festoon from long tapering yard by time that have increased distance to couple of mile anchor be trip be sweeping round on way out after called aide aft asked whether knew craft too well signor replied have be lot to be chased by often many anxious moment have caused have name of being fastest sailer inside gut be terror of honest smuggler round coast here ho ho said so that be how land lie be master giaccomo have be bit of smuggler in time eh yes frankly returned not so very long ago must have be taken to certainty have not shot from one of cruiser turned yonder inquisitive gentleman back let hope may meet with similar slice of luck time said do think stand chance of getting away from everything depends on weather be reply in light wind such a have never seen anything to approach cutter for speed must come on to blow vigilant will run under water be singularly agreeable piece of information to receive just at moment for sky have gradually become flecked with fast flying patch of scud dark threatening bank of cloud be working up to windward so far however breeze remained light while be gliding through water at rate of something like five knot with scarcely ripple under bow to indicate fact guarda costa appeared to have little beyond bare steerage way at first be sanguine enough to hope that seeing how slipped away from lateener must 'bout ship return to mooring nothing of kind held on like grim death skipper doubt being seaman enough to read in increasingly threatening aspect of heaven promise that turn must come by by in meantime wind grew rapidly lighter until became breathless calm there lay heaving sluggishly on long swell sail flapping idly from side to side bow boxing compass cloud bank meanwhile have be steadily rising at length completely veiled sky obscuring first star finally moon enveloping whole face of nature in mantle of inky blackness so intense be darkness that lost sight of guarda costa land in fact everything save two three riding light more prudent of skipper have chosen to display on board craft in roadstead breathless hush prevailed broken only by loud creak of boom flap of sail giaccomo shipmate prisoner whichever reader like be somewhere forward probably sitting down be impossible to see in impenetrable darkness called giaccomo aft voice when spoke in reply sounded strange weird unnatural considered aspect of sky portentous in extreme wished to have opinion a of man accustomed to weather of region asked what thought of will have down upon very heavily before long replied think will last above three four hour then have better bear hand shorten sail said take in gaff topsail bowse down double reef in mainsail will in foresail shift jib suppose there be storm jib somewhere on board down in locker forward said be careful to close hatch securely when come up signor will be swamped in le than ten minute will bury in breeze that be going to have three worked like trojan in remarkably short space of time have mouette a found cutter be named under double reefed mainsail storm jib latter well in along bowsprit with topmast lowered a far a must come fore hatch cabin skylight battened down everything made snug ready for regular stand up fight with element while be busy with preparation admonished giaccomo to keep smart lookout be careful also to do same myself in case guarda costa must endeavour to cut matter short by sending away boat after man assured that skipper of craft knew too well what be about to risk loss of boat crew by sending away under such threatening condition of weather smart a have be in making preparation be only barely in time have just comfortably completed work have established at tiller with giaccomo at mainsheet francois a french lad called at jib sheet when there came terrific flash of lightning green baleful illumining for single instant entire scene revealing pertinacious friend vigilant in old berth astern with long tapering yard lowered to deck two stumpy lug pocket handkerchief of jib hoisted in place then a opaque darkness closed down upon again there followed long deep reverberating roll of thunder vivid flash quickly succeeded thunder time being much louder nearer then after pause of about minute there came perfect blast of lightning so intensely bright that whole atmosphere appeared for one brief moment to be literally on fire simultaneously with flash came awful deafening crackling crash of thunder terrific detonation of completely stunned unnerved while lasted so overpowering be in comparison with anything of kind have before heard have scarcely time to recover hearing before became conscious of hissing roaring sound in atmosphere momentarily increasing in intensity looking to windward there appeared in startling relief against sable background long line of luminous milky foam rushing down toward from horizon in incredibly short time squall be upon on came like howling fiend over tortured surface of ocean causing to hiss seethe like content of boiling cauldron striking cutter with such resistless fury that went over helplessly before burying lee rail so deeply in brine that sail lay prostrate upon surface of water of instinctively shouted to others to hold on grasping at same moment came nearest managed somehow to clamber up deck a cutter went over passing out over low bulwark established on upturned side of little craft giaccomo have done same while francois be standing on side of cabin companion clinging convulsively with hand to weather rail crawling up to side of corsican placed mouth to ear shouted do think can cut away mast no earnestly returned see signor head be paying off will come up again in minute two can not turn over altogether ballast be too well secured for will not fill even if remains thus for hour yet water can get below except through companion door fit so well that very little will get down even through see there be coming up again already be even so while man be speaking cutter bow have be rapidly paying off until headed a nearly a must guess straight for shore when pressure of wind being no longer upon broadside heavy ballast have gradually dragged yacht into upright position have somewhat precipitately to scramble inboard again moment that yacht recovered wind of course caught sail away at once started to leeward with speed of hunted stag however must never do shore be straight ahead at rate at be travelling twenty minute must have seen dashed into matchwood upon rock very cautiously therefore brought upon wind though when again got broadside to threatened to go over once more with managed by careful manipulation of sheet to avoid catastrophe when have got once fairly jammed close upon wind former experience of mine in cutter sailing enabled to keep right side uppermost be perilous work for good hour after squall struck have occasionally seen in later day bold even reckless match sailing have never yet seen craft so desperately overdriven a be perforce little mouette on memorable night while first strength of gale lasted be literally under water whole time sea boiling foaming in over bow sweeping away aft out over taffrail in continuous flood believe must have sailed faster must assuredly have made much better weather of have be able to get close reef down in mainsail under circumstance be impossible since being so short handed must have delayed long enough to allow vigilant to get alongside before have got through with work there be therefore nothing for to keep on a be cutter heeling over to angle of quite deg so that be really standing upon inside of lee bulwark with back resting against steeply inclined deck up above knee in sea beneath little craft lee rail be deeply buried while owing to great speed rushed through instead of riding over sea be rapidly getting up so that when unusually heavy comber met be literally buried for moment while swept over luckily first mad fury of blast lasted only for two three minute mast must never have resisted tremendous strain upon a be stout though spar absurdly disproportionate to size of craft then considered swayed bent like fishing rod causing lee rigging to blow out quite in bight while to windward be strained a taut a harp string resemblance to be increased by weird sound of wind a shrieked through scarcely have tempest burst upon before veil of cloud have obscured heaven be rent to shred by fury sky be cleared a if by magic moon star reappeared former low down upon horizon have uninterrupted view of wild scene around be heading straight out from land sailing so close to wind that be taking sea nearly stem on frankly confess that heart be metaphorically speaking in mouth for greatest part of night while watching little craft rush bodily into steep slope of wave after wave felt quiver like frightened thing a swept hissing seething over head admiration for skill of builder be boundless for have not witnessed cutter achievement must never have credited power of wood iron to successfully resist such terrific strain battering a received when first wild struggle for existence be over have fairly settled down to work in mad life death race have time to look round see how opponent have come out of struggle have not far to look there be about three mile to leeward well on quarter dashing gallantly on now rushing upward upon crest of wave amid deluge of spray lifting fore foot out of water a though about to leave element altogether take flight into air like startled sea bird anon plunging down into trough until only small portion of head of sail be visible be evidently making much better weather of than be on other hand hour patient observation revealed to comforting fact that notwithstanding vaunted speed be head reaching weathering upon satisfied at length that be actually case asked giaccomo what now thought of chance of escape will get away from replied exultingly have no longer fear of what now dread be possibility of cutter foundering from under there must be considerable amount of water making way into interior with sea sweeping over thus incessantly indeed be convinced that be sensibly deeper in water than be do think must manage to get pump under way asked must try replied well be on larboard side close by foot deep under water then said must endeavour to get round upon other tack will watch for smooth directly come francois must round in upon mainsheet be ready replied in affirmative after watching in vain for five minute terrific sea burst over burying craft a seemed to nearly way up mast beyond water be comparatively smooth in with gasped a came out on other side of liquid hill gathered in sheet a though life depended on at same moment eased off weather tiller rope gave craft head surged up into wind canvas flapping so furiously that threatened to shake mast out of lee gunwale appeared above surface placing foot against tiller pressed gradually over helping round while stopping way a little a possible sea rushed up struck on port bow sending head well off on other tack jib sheet be promptly hauled over mainsail filled a hurriedly scrambled over to other side of deck secured ourselves anew with lashing round waist mouette plunged forward on larboard tack looking well up to windward heading about due north fixing rigging of pump be work of considerable difficulty danger be eventually done then giaccomo francois placing one on side set resolutely to work with determination of not leaving off a long a drop of water must flow from spout clear stream gushed out a soon a brake be set going showed unmistakably that have not begun moment too soon have still entertained doubt upon point must have be dispelled by length of time took to clear little craft of water be broad daylight when at length giaccomo panted triumphantly there suck just before sun rise noticed first indication of break in gale by eight o'clock have so far moderated that lee rail be just awash instead of diving through sea a have be ever since gale struck cutter managed to rise over everything heaviest be still too wet forward to permit of taking off forecastle hatch communication between cabin forecastle must be effected by mean of sliding door in bulkhead so francois be sent below with instruction to prepare thorough good breakfast with plenty of hot coffee let say have found infinitely more comforting refreshing than spirit after long exposure to wet cold combined after setting of moon have lost sight of guarda costa until dawn once more betrayed whereabouts when first seen be hull down about three point on lee quarter still under two lug jib so far be satisfactory have walked fairly away from in own weather giaccomo be in ecstasy ah chuckled monsieur leroux must have almost forgiven for running away with mouette have be here to see what shameful beating have given vigilant ' story be sure to leak out through of lateener people poor old lieutenant durand who command will not dare to show ashore at ajaccio will be so laughed at guarda costa people have idea of tamely accepting defeat a final sooner be light enough for to fairly make out than shifted sail substituting single reefed lateen for lug taking in storm jib out of way increased spread of canvas soon told tale for before hour have passed became evident that be gaining upon going faster through water be did not appear to weather on much if at fact that vigilant be overhauling however gave very little uneasiness for calculated that a be then sailing must take quite three hour to get within gunshot of probably half hour before there must be much probability of hitting by time expected must be within four hour sail of san fiorenzo where fully expected to find old juno probably few more of own ship thought very doubtful whether frenchman must keep up chase so far a for fear of running into trap being caught therefore went to breakfast with tolerably easy mind to say nothing of good appetite thoroughly enjoyed meal most sumptuous one considering place circumstance of preparation giaccomo condescending so far to relax sternness of demeanour to francois a to pat individual approvingly on shoulder to assure that such cookery went far to atone for extraordinary indiscretion of night before francesca sat down to breakfast with having quite unexpectedly made appearance on deck fresh blooming cheerful about hour before to unbounded surprise assured that have passed very tolerable night having indeed be sound asleep for greater portion of time have be somewhat alarmed when cutter be thrown upon beam end have not be in least incommoded by accident indeed aware of full extent cot upon be lying being very ingenious affair so contrived that always maintained perfectly horizontal position matter how much cutter rolled pitched how greatly heeled over be very gratifying news to for fully expected to see appear in morning excessively frightened possibly very seriously bruised by violent motion of little craft in have passed so adventurous night by time that have breakfasted wind have so far moderated that became necessary to make sail upon cutter vigilant having crept up well abeam of though still hull down apparently close in with land accordingly shook reef out of mainsail got foresail working jib set with canvas rushed along in true racing style lee rail well buried craft taking just enough weather helm to allow of being steered to hair breadth performance perfectly enchanted have never seen anything like before to unaccustomed eye seemed fairly to fly even giaccomo francois of whom have repeatedly sailed in asserted that have never seen do so well before when again have time to take glance to leeward at vigilant discovered well named craft bowling along under whole canvas evidently trying hardest to head reach upon for first half hour endeavoured to flatter that be still holding own at end of time such self deception be no longer possible breeze suited admirably there be still too much sea for little mouette vigilant superior power at length began to tell have carried sail a recklessly through night a have there can be doubt must have be alongside of by daylight by time too be abreast of calvi be able to bear away with beam wind for acciajola point round at bottom of bay lay san fiorenzo destination altered course gave opponent further advantage by bringing couple of point before beam have mortification of seeing that craft be edging out to intercept must to moral certainty cut off before must reach headland still resolved to stand on trust to chapter of accident for ultimate escape if change in course have given vigilant one important advantage have given to attached quite a much weight have brought wind sea abeam permitted to ease up sheet while sea no longer retarded also permitted to set little extra canvas accordingly lost time in getting topmast on end setting gaff topsail after must hing sit still anxiously watch result meanwhile two vessel be rapidly converging upon point distant about mile from cape acciajola wind continued to drop sea going down at same time a morning advanced weather became lighter appeared to be once more getting rather advantage of pertinacious antagonist so completely be attention engaged by vigilant that be not until craft have hoisted colour that became aware of fact that new actor have appeared upon scene be within seven mile of be brig when first caught sight of be running in for land from wsw with stitch of canvas set must draw including lower topmast topgallant studding sail on port side lay about three point on weather quarter be steering for gulf of san fiorenzo appearance of stranger naturally added very greatly to anxiety must not in least make up mind a to nationality for hoisted colour in response to vigilant display of ensign though struck a being thoroughly french in build rig must not understand why must be running for san fiorenzo if fleet be there while if be not seemed pretty certain that have run into what old rawlings sailing master be wont to designate centre of hobble in other word decided predicament how to act under circumstance knew not be thoroughly embarrassed away to leeward be vigilant in position that if bore up must be simply running straight into clutch up there to windward be mysterious brig from there be possibility of escape if hauled wind while if kept straight on be still almost certain to fall into hand assuming that be lucky enough to escape vigilant of course there be just bare possibility of being english if so appearance strangely belied seemed to that least imprudent thing to do must be to keep straight on a be going accordingly did still felt very anxious to know for certain who what brig really be at last determined to hoist english flag over french at gaff end hoping that signal must evoke response a far a brig be concerned be entirely without effect not so however with regard to vigilant sight appeared to greatly irritate worthy skipper for immediately hauled wind very soon afterwards tried effect of long brass nine upon shot fell short sixty seventy fathom be well aimed pretty conclusively demonstrated that monsieur durand be growing angry finding that be a yet out of range lateener once more kept away upon former course evidently recognising possibility that if did not might still slip past quarter of hour brought abreast of cape in about ten minute more have opened town of san fiorenzo well out in mortella bay large fleet of ship lay at anchor while much nearer shore gun ship frigate be visible also apparently at anchor briskly engaging battery of sort appeared to be built on projecting point of land at same time roar of distant cannonade have be shut off from by intervening high land be borne distinctly to ear meanwhile inscrutable brig have steadily pursued course without appearing to take slightest notice of little drama be being enacted ahead of now came foaming up upon weather quarter steering so a to shave close past taffrail have by time lost doubt a to nationality though still kept bunting well out of sight be unmistakably french over from keel to truck though be enemy must not help admiring beautiful order neatness characterised appearance two quality be rarely to be witnessed on board french ship at period be rather surprised that have not pitched shot across fore foot before a delicate intimation that time have arrived for to heave to a have not began to entertain faint glimmer of hope that be engaged upon special service of such importance that must not spare time to interfere with be evident that have intention of rounding to for there still stood studding sail without sign of preparation for taking in attention be now of course for moment given exclusively to curiosity being strongly roused a to intention in moment swept magnificently across stern so closely that bold leap must have carried man from weather cat head down upon deck a did so became aware of sundry tanned bearded face of seemed familiar to peering curiously down upon through open half port at same moment dapper young fellow in uniform of british midshipman sprang into main rigging speaking trumpet in hand hailed somewhat in following fashion cutter ahoy who be whither bound what be piratical looking craft down to leeward if be interfering with have better bear up follow in wake will take care that hilloa if be chester may never ahoy chester old boy know bob summer know up helm old fellow juno ' be in there rest be unintelligible brig being by time too far away to allow of further conversation of course bore up at once for brig being in english hand have further occasion for anxiety with regard to vigilant craft true to name have evidently be on watch to see what must come of meeting have just taken place have already arrived at conclusion that what have passed boded good for moment bore up did same wearing short round upon heel shaping course a nearly a must judge for calvi bob however who be evidently burning to distinguish seemed to regard a favourable opportunity for so doing promptly squared away steering course must enable to intercept guarda costa following steadily in wake to witness fun almost immediately afterwards heard shrill note of bobeun whistle followed by hoarse bellowing sound in functionary be wont to transmit commanding officer order to ship company occasionally be gratified with sight of mr bob summer squinting curiously at through telescope out of one of stern port moment that brig be fairly within range of vigilant bob bowled pound shot across craft fore foot a invitation to to heave to monsieur durand however seemed in humour for accepting such invitation just then for immediately returned decided negative from long brass pounder sending shot very cleverly through bob topsail narrowly missing mainmast head expected to see master bob round to deliver whole broadside in retaliation must have be quite like to do so instead of however maintained grim silence notwithstanding that monsieur durand continued effort to cripple brig at length however bob got within short pistol shot of adversary then in came studding sail together down went helm crash went broadside of four pounder into devoted frenchman bringing sail flag down by run together a brig rounded to main topsail be thrown aback bringing to standstill directly to windward of vigilant within easy hailing distance then master bob hove into view in main rigging once more still with precious speaking trumpet in hand guarda costa be sternly ordered to surrender a afterwards learned being at moment rather too far astern to hear what passed forthwith did cutter be thereupon lowered manned prize crew went on board to take possession little summer also going with party in meantime in mouette joined company heaving to close under brig quarter making out for first time word requin shark be painted on stern in small red letter after lapse of perhaps quarter of hour brig cutter shoved off from side of vigilant in minute bob be shaking hand a vigorously a though have not seen other for year a soon a have done with young rascal turned to francesca whereupon introduced in due form in french francesca at once frankly gave hand made pretty little speech a to happiness afforded to make acquaintance of friend of cher ralph etcetera etcetera master bob whose knowledge of french be of slenderest most flimsy description be in wise disconcerted by being addressed in what be to practically unknown tongue bowed with elegance grace must muster smiling meanwhile a suavely a knew how finally responding somewhat in style je suis most happy avez le plaisir makez votre acquaintance mile paoli j'ai already l'honneur de being partially acquainted with votre oncle general di paoli fine fellow be eye wo be surprised to see only wish must stay on board le juno ' better still take up quarter aboard brig skipper giving of course to chester with roving commission must be jolly there what be use of thinking of such thing of course be ever so much too good to be true by way chester turning to have dined yet have now suppose go aboard brig then will leave couple of hand to help crew here can then make sail in company say will present quite imposing appearance a bring up in roadstead expect skipper will send for on quarter deck thank before hand for gallantry important service bob jumped into boat alongside a concluded followed then francesca stepped daintily down into dancing craft where gallant bob established snugly in stern sheet close alongside then seized yoke line gave order to shove off give way in most authoritative manner in ten minute more be three comfortably established in cosy little cabin of brig with very tolerable dinner on table before chapter seventeen convention redoubt bob curiosity to hear story be about equal to appetite for dinner so while proceeded with demolition of comestible related to various adventure have befallen since leaving old juno demanding in return explanation of circumstance led to turning up in opportune manner related in last chapter oh replied can tell that in dozen word when boat returned from landing old rawlings went at once to cabin to make report soon afterwards filled away stood to nor'ard east'ard under easy canvas then wind fell light by by dropped altogether when daylight began to appear found within about six mile of brig skipper mr annesley toddled up a far a main topsail yard to take look at be about quarter of hour up there when came down first second cutter be sent away to see who what be mr flinn have charge of one boat percival went in other soon saw that be french lad gave cheer laid out to race for boat be rather lighter of two percival promised people bottle of grog if got alongside first in consequence of beat flinn to splinter seeing walking ahead hailed to keep back in line with be likely be oh yes did wish might get by time that be within mile of brig have got boarding netting triced up gun loaded depressed everything ready for warm reception withheld fire until be close to intending suppose to utterly demolish just before got alongside be watching with telescope a soon a have got broadside carefully trained be about to fire simply took broad sheer to port before must lay gun afresh be under bow into head from whence at last managed to hew way in upon deck disheartened frenchman began to give way at moment in came flinn lot over starboard quarter laying about right left settled business johnny flung down arm cried for quarter of course gave turned out to be requin privateer armed with eight long nine pounder with crew of forty men in forecastle hold crammed with choicest picking of cargo of five six prize so see proved to be valuable prize herself be put in charge with prize crew of eight men to take into malta also carried despatch for admiral on station old boy be a pleased a punch when read skipper letter actually invited to dine with night may be sure did asked good many question about fight about brig next day came on board gave craft thorough overhaul result be that be ordered alongside arsenal wharf where discharged entire cargo took in lot of iron ballast filled magazine water cask shipped quantity of shot provision for fleet here added seventeen more hand to book sailed again just week ago to day with order to join fleet at san fiorenzo report to admiral hood for whom also by way have letter despatch something of sort such be account mr robert summer gave of upon conclusion adjourned to deck be by time within three mile of fleet within about six mile of two detached ship be still maintaining vigorous cannonade upon shore battery brought telescope to bear upon two ship soon have gratification of recognising in one of own dear old craft juno did not appear to have received very much damage other be unable to identify seemed to be very much cut up about spar rigging while still intently watching progress of fight observed thin column of greyish brown smoke curling up into air from juno consort that be not smoke from gun must see at once by peculiar colour rapidly increased in volume a did so ship fire slackened until died away almost entirely still watching vessel a smoke from gun drove away to leeward saw three little tongue of flame darting out from side tell what chester exclaimed summer fellow ashore be firing red hot shot have set old barkie on fire such be in fact case in few minute saw signal run up to royal mast head of victory lord hood flag ship seventy four immediately replied at once ceased firing altogether fire from juno also slackening somewhat then saw rigging of two ship blacken a hand went aloft to loose canvas rapidly yet a steadily a though crew be merely being put through sail drill heavy fold of canvas be let fall from yard sheeted home hoisted head yard be braced back in minute two bow of craft paid off stood out from land close hauled upon larboard tack to rejoin rest of fleet old ship delivering port broadside a gun be brought to bear by way of parting salute be by time threading in out among transport on way to vacant berth at great distance from victory in about five minute afterwards requin prize came to anchor be amusing enough to see master bob strutting up down diminutive quarter deck of brig telescope tucked under one arm cherished speaking trumpet under other issuing order a to stowing of canvas squaring of yard etcetera after be only natural be first command be anxious that everybody must see that be fully qualified for when at length everything have be done to satisfaction ordered gig to be lowered jumping into pulled away to admiral ship to deliver despatch meanwhile amused by watching seventy four juno a worked up to anchorage be glad to perceive that fire have broken out on board juno consort have be conquered by time that have reached berth bob have returned in high feather at lord hood commendation upon conduct then joined leaving francesca for present on board brig while pulled away to juno to report to skipper be received very graciously by captain hood very cordially by rest of officer so much so indeed that a far a be concerned be gratified moved to discover high estimation in appeared to hold have only time to glance hurriedly round deck to notice that jolly old craft appeared to have suffered slightly in recent engagement with shore battery when captain hood invited into cabin forthwith led way have on reporting announced to in general term fact have accomplished mission now have of course to enter into full particular give detailed narrative of adventure be sight to be remembered to see skipper open eye in amazement when described to particular of flight from island with count lorenzo daughter winding up with statement that be at moment on board brig be good enough to compliment very highly upon zeal courage discretion have manifested in performance of most important duty also evinced little concern respecting damaged arm to speak truth be none better for experience on board mouette sending word there then for surgeon to come aft give overhaul must see that curiosity be powerfully excited with regard to francesca a soon a disabled limb have be dressed made tolerably comfortable ordered own gig to be lowered requesting company in boat jumped into be conveyed to brig evidently have a good eye for pretty woman a have for ship seemed immensely struck with lady love doing best to render agreeable placing ship hand at disposal francesca however young a be have perfect knowledge of propriety felt out of place on board ship clearly recognised desirability of at once placing under aunt care therefore thanked skipper very gracefully for generous offer said must merely trouble so far a to avail herself of aid in making way to quarter of uncle general paoli be matter involving very little difficulty general have established head quarter in small fishing village about four mile from san fiorenzo situated on shore of tiny cove visible from brig deck therefore proceeded in gig in first place alongside mouette where shipped be small packet of personal belonging then taking giaccomo in boat with stepped mast hoisted lug ran merrily down before wind to entrance of cove landing on beach in perfectly smooth water after rather more than hour sail be by time growing dusk when reached cottage in general paoli have established found that be out going round seeing personally to posting of sentinel wife however who have determined to share with if possible mitigate for husband hardship of campaign be at home from received most cordial welcome be of course distressed to hear of strait in have left brother in law count be quite decided in opinion that have done right to send francesca away to believed once freed of anxiety respecting daughter must be found that have be able to defend so vigorously a to eventually beat off assailant pressed very earnestly to remain until general must return in order that might have opportunity personally to thank especially for important service rendered to niece captain hood be anxious to get back to ship so a to go on board admiral ship to take part in council of war be therefore reluctantly compelled to decline before returning to juno however hunted up one two corsican officer with whom skipper have already become acquainted learned from that mortella tower battery have be that day attacked by two frigate have a far a have be able to ascertain borne storm of shot unscathed on way back to ship learned from skipper that juno consort in action be called fortitude that have suffered severely in engagement losing six men killed fifty six wounded having three of lower deck gun dismounted also being set on fire on reaching juno found deck cleared up sign of late combat effaced hand below anchor watch mr annesley however be on deck awaiting skipper return a followed latter up side first luff paused before following into cabin said that a soon a captain hood have left for admiral ship must be glad to hear account of shore cruise accordingly watched departure of gig then made way to poop where three of lieutenant be awaiting to related in full detail have occurred to from moment of leaving ship to of rejoining will not repeat flattering encomium narrative elicited suffice to say be greatly gratified by approval expressed by particularly by mr annesley assurance have only to go on a have begun to become ornament to service credit to connected with next day two passed in state of comparative inactivity with fleet lord hood having arrived at conclusion through experience of effect of engagement between fortitude juno mortella tower that further sea attack upon battery must be useless that reduction must have to be effected by land force use word comparative inactivity advisedly for though ship be idle a far a prosecution of campaign be concerned admiral be indefatigable in drilling exercising crew in accustoming of different ship to act in concert in addition to there be immense amount of passing to fro between fleet shore in transmission of despatch landing of store ammunition in service little mouette came in very useful sometimes rushing backward forward with bulky packet of official document at other time making passage with whole fleet of deeply laden boat in tow a might be supposed experience of capability naturally led to craft being entrusted to while thus engaged so that be kept in state of constant activity must however do captain hood justice to record before detailing for service gave option of remaining on board juno being excused from duty until arm have become completely healed a must take a much care of wounded limb on board cutter a must on board frigate gratefully declined to gratification of skipper must easily see thus have frequent opportunity of seeing francesca a well a of making acquaintance of uncle general paoli at length after interchange of vast amount of correspondence between lord hood major general dundas officer in command of land force be one evening announced that attack must be made on following day upon mortella tower from battery thrown up on adjacent height accordingly moment that there be light enough to sight gun cannonade commenced lasted for several hour fort replying with utmost vigour to fire of battery doing great deal of execution by by genius on side proposed paying off french in own coin by trying effect of few red hot shot upon make shift furnace for heating shot be accordingly hastily constructed shot be heated before being discharged at fort sun have desired effect parapet of tower be lined with mantlet constructed of bass junk for purpose of protecting gunner from splinter red hot shot striking mantlet set on fire whereupon french flag be hauled down garrison surrendered of fleet witnessed only from distance a be thought possible might be necessary for of ship to approach engage battery from sea thus distracting enemy attention placing between two fire everybody therefore remained at post on board ship in case of service being required luckily however for reputation interference on part of fleet be unnecessary land force proving sufficient for subjugation of battery mounted three gun only two eighteen one six pounder be garrisoned by more than thirty three men so far so good though have taken mortella tower be still nearly a far off having san fiorenzo a ever town be commanded completely defended by formidable redoubt mounted twenty one heavy gun be moreover perched upon eminence commanded other accessible height in neighbourhood possession of redoubt really meant possession of san fiorenzo so question of hour became how to find way of getting into convention redoubt a place be called first proposal be to storm place on making careful reconnaissance became evident that from strength steepness of acclivity leading up to storming party must be annihilated before must possibly reach top great elevation above sea level rendered equally hopeless to think of achieving good result by attack on part of fleet so strict watch be maintained by garrison that leader soon became convinced of impossibility of effecting surprise naturally subjugation of redoubt became absorbing topic of conversation while interest be at highest happened that mr annesley have occasion to go on shore took passage with in little mouette have never landed on island before so a ran down toward creek pointed out to various point of interest in landscape be very anxious to get sight of convention redoubt be not just then possible high rocky acclivity close to shore shutting out view have often looked at rock have thought what fine view of redoubt might be have from summit how easily place might be reduced be only possible to plant gun there mentioned something of while be going ashore worthy first remained silent for good ten minute after have concluded remark intently examining through telescope face of rock meanwhile at last said must like to give rock bit of overhaul chester be good hand at climbing pretty fair sir believe be modest reply well then a soon a have transacted business will go see what look like said accordingly a soon a be at liberty made way to base of rock call rock so certainly be there be considerable depth of soil in many place about side soil be thickly covered with short close herbage upon few goat be browsing here there sent thrill through to see active animal leaping from one projection to clinging like fly to almost perpendicular face of thinly scattered grassy slope looking up at through telescope frequently seemed that have got into position that must be equally impossible for to attempt to go forward to return without precipitating headlong to bottom of precipice be not encouraging spectacle to two person who entertained serious thought of scaling such cliff especially a stone detached by foot of scrambling goat above occasionally came plunging down about ear sailor be not easily daunted when come to question of climbing accordingly after careful examination with view of selecting most practicable path went resolutely at be not quite so bad a looked for about two third of way up when neared top rocky face became so nearly perpendicular indeed actually overhung in place that have serious thought of abandoning enterprise altogether however did not like to be beaten after having achieved so much so persevered at last after most perilous laborious climb actually succeeded in reaching summit view from exalted situation be superb be standing upon highest eminence for many mile round air be so clear transparent distant object be a distinctly seen a though viewed through telescope on left blue expanse of mediterranean stretched far away to northward westward dotted here there with sail of few tiny coasting fishing craft below apparently near enough for to have thrown stone on board of lay fleet of men o war transport with sail loose to dry from heavy shower of previous night men about deck reduced to mere moving speck in front of still below so near that must distinguish accoutrement of men forming garrison be redoubt with twenty one gun projecting muzzle threateningly over sod parapet symmetrical little pyramidal pile of shot heaped up alongside gun beyond lay san fiorenzo with narrow street red tiled white washed house terraced garden insignificant looking church harbour beyond with cliff stretching away beyond again a far a cape corso away out at sea small island of capriaja upon right continuous chain of hill reared thickly wooded to very summit while in rear calvi although something like thirty mile distant be clearly distinguishable redoubt be with chief point of interest examined with utmost minuteness mr annesley who possessed skill with pencil made accurate sketch of indicating clearly what seemed to weakest point done made very careful examination on side of face of rock upon stood finally coming to conclusion that though difficult feat be possible to raise few pounder to summit same evening mr annesley accompanied by skipper proceeded on board victory reported to admiral fact of having scaled rock exhibited sketch of redoubt explained idea a to practicability of establishing battery upon summit result be that on following morning lord hood commodore linzee sir hyde parker captain afterwards lord nelson skipper mr annesley took passage ashore with in mouette hand of shinned aloft first luff to show way rest to reconnoitre on reaching foot of cliff superior with exception of captain nelson rather threw cold water upon proposed scheme of raising gun to top mr annesley however with respectful firmness maintained belief in practicability of idea after great deal of discussion decided to at least attempt ascent see how project looked from lofty stand point of summit by time that have accomplished climb view have become somewhat modified captain nelson quick eye having lighted upon several spot in progress of ascent where must be practicable to erect sheers to secure tackle be sight of redoubt a seen from top of rock complete command of must be obtained by battery planted at spot whereon stood finally decided admiral to make attempt detail of plan be arranged there then most advantageous position for sheers etcetera fixed upon during descent resource of fleet discussed on passage off immediately on arrival alongside victory preparation be commenced anchor chain rope block etcetera be loaded into ship boat spare spar be launched overboard formed into raft same evening mouette left fleet with fourteen boat raft in tow wind happening to be dead fair just nice little breeze for purpose enabling to crowd stitch of canvas must set ran gaily down before by dusk have everything ashore in readiness for commencement of task first thing on following morning be not necessary to describe in detail operation eventually resulted in planting of battery of pounder gun together with necessary ammunition upon summit of precipitous rock at height of le than foot above sea level suffice to briefly say that by almost unparalleled skill perseverance of officer in charge equally extraordinary exertion of bluejacket feat be actually accomplished by sunset on th of february everything be ready for opening fire have hoped that a idea might fairly be said to have originated with must be entrusted with charge of one of working party engaged in task of establishing battery much to disappointment be left in charge of cutter during progress of operation be kept going between fleet shore literally day night in consequence of mr robert summer be turned over to a first lieutenant grumbled almost incessantly at hard lot in not being allowed to render valuable assistance more directly to work in hand reward for enforced self denial be nearer at hand than of expected morning of th broke fair clear with scarcely breath of air to ruffle surface of water with first streak of dawn hand be aroused by roar of cannonade from cliff battery a have named day long without moment intermission be fire kept up on into evening a long a there be light enough to see then fire slackened down somewhat effort of gunner being merely directed through night to prevention of attempt on part of enemy to execute repair on following morning gun again opened upon devoted redoubt shortly after midday message be brought down to for conveyance to admiral substance of be that there be indication of practicable breach being effected before sunset there be fresh breeze dead against crowded sail on cutter to extent in eagerness to get off to fleet with welcome news that be greatest wonder in world did not carry stick out of arrived under lee of victory bob jumped into dinghy rowing alongside flag ship sprang up lofty side finding admiral on quarter deck went up to delivered message be wondering said sir hyde parker who be also on quarter deck what good news young monkey have to tell that be carrying on upon boat in unmerciful manner if be not more careful young gentleman that craft will turn turtle with day friend hood will lose two of most promising officer eh admiral looked at for moment with just ghost of smile flickering over inscrutable feature then ordered signal to be made for captain of various men o ' war to rendezvous on board flag ship have arranged with dundas said to send brigade on shore to help make up storming party think will be best to let captain call for certain number of volunteer bob stepped forward with one accord just a sir hyde whipped round upon heel said sharply if have objection sir must like to lead bluejacket in affair will have to send one with will be worse than useless in hand of soldier officer since will not understand other might a well go a not to be thought of for moment sir returned admiral give one other of captain chance to distinguish have already made mark well what can do for young gentleman turning to will volunteer sir said a bold a brass must feel very much obliged if will put in word for with sk with captain hood sir if please have of ever be present at storming of fortress asked admiral sir cut in bob taking word out of mouth have boarded enemy ship before now sir be pretty much same thing about a much like a musketry fire of squad of marine be to broadside of ship remarked admiral lad take advice remain on board ship have doubt courage be more than sufficient for such work lack strength men be needed for storming party must be of possible use by going must only risk life needlessly be sorry to be obliged to refuse must not be justified in acceding to request may retire young gentleman will not forget gallant behaviour accordingly retreated down side very much crestfallen disappointed indeed jumping into dinghy returned to mouette just a captain gig from various ship be coming up alongside seating upon companion slide dangling leg disconsolately down companion abandoned to most gloomy reflection watching meanwhile boat a dashed up alongside flag ship cynically criticising stroke action of several crew be afraid skipper did not altogether escape disparaging remark have be sitting thus for about quarter of hour giving unrestrained vent to feeling of dissatisfaction when bob countenance suddenly brightened turning to exclaimed in animated tone of voice say chester what fool be let go aboard old juno wait until skipper return when call for volunteer will be first to step to front old hood be in unpardonably disrespectful manner alluded to admiral have forgotten about by time so will never think of mentioning to skipper request see why have good chance yet do sooner said than done knew that chief must at moment be seated in admiral cabin so filling upon cutter bore away ran down under lee of juno whose deck gained just a captain gig be shoving off from victory accommodation ladder ten minute afterwards captain hood came up side immediately gave order for hand to come aft then accompanied by mr annesley went up on poop stood there watching eager expectant face of men a clustered thickly in waist on side of deck officer be grouped together upon quarter deck waiting until hand be present skipper stepped forward to head of poop ladder waving hand for silence said lad have just weturned from conference with admiwal at captain in fleet be pwesent be ah charged by lord hood to expwess to officer men alike thanks for wecent exertion in waising gun to top of yonder wock battewy thus er ah placed in position will be expected effect pwacticable bweach in wall of convention wedoubt by sunset evening be intended to storm place a soon a ah darkness set in storming party be to be made up of equal number of soldier bluejacket here speaker be interrupted by enthusiastic cheer from audience repetition of be checked by skipper uplifted hand storming party continued be to be composed equally say of soldier bluejacket admiwal have authowized captain to call for fifty volunteer keep steady men be silent ah wait until have quite finished if please be authowized to call for fifty volunteer wish distinctly to understand that man who have in way misconducted will be accepted now let who volunteer for storming party come abaft mainmast bob knowing what be coming have gradually edged to front be of course with rest of officer already abaft mainmast directly skipper ceased stepped smartly out posted ourselves at foot of poop ladder to show that be volunteering then faced round to witness effect of captain hood speech upon crew scene be irresistibly comic in first place found that group of officer have simply shifted position in compact body so that stood pretty much a be before front rank of men have also advanced until be well abaft mainmast when halted be must have baited have not be for pressure behind be pretty steady in front portion of mass in rear something very like panic ensued almost before one must count ten unfortunate who have not already gained coveted position began to clamber over boom along hammock rail actually out through port along main channel in again through port farther aft in eagerness to volunteer struggling elbowing increased until became almost desperate when one of boatswain mate brawny muscular old sea dog with mahogany visage gigantic pig tail chest arm elaborately tattooed stepped out facing round exclaimed in stentorian tone avast heaving there ye unmannerly swab do take majesty quarter deck lifting hat for playhouse booth on southsea common belay stand fast mother son of ye let speak to skipper for ye then facing poop once more stepped forward out of crowd doffing hat while made elaborate sea scrape with right foot gave tug at forelock addressed skipper somewhat a follows hope honour will kindly overlook little bit of scrimmage be just took place forgive unperliteness seeing a how many of have never have chance of larnin how to behave ourselves in delicate sitivations honour doe need to be told at least hope not that did mean nothing in way unbecoming disrespectable to rest of hofficers not by manner of mean whatsomever want to say be just here that hand on down to powder monkey begs most respectably to wolunteer for here boardin ' party hope a how will take whole kit of 'ceptin ' of course black sheep a honour spoke of just now let jolly look arter old barkie who wo mind takin ' care of herself for hour two god bless while precious hinfants be havin ' little bit of lark with crapoos ashore there loud murmur of approval greeted effort on part of boatswain mate then everybody awaited in silence reply deep flush of gratification lighted up captain hood feature a said thank from heart men for um generous wesponse to call be sincerely sowwy can not take er eh at word admiwal instwuctions be impewative have power to dwaw more than specified number a therefore have volunteered juno contingent will be chosen by lot whereby partiality unfairness will be avoided hope that awwangement will pwove satisfactowy crew be accordingly arranged in double rank fore aft deck lot drawn man choosing folded slip of paper from bundle fifty of be marked remainder being blank then came question of selecting officer proper quota of be to go with men came out at stage of proceeding that skipper have be chosen to command naval brigade mr annesley therefore much to chagrin found that have option to remain on board second third lieutenant tossed up to decide of must go second be lucky enough to win one other officer be required lot fell on percival master mate doctor be to go a matter of course be to be non combatant little summer poor pilgarlic be so entirely consumed with disgust that must find word sufficiently powerful to express feeling simply stood glaring at other in moody silence suddenly brilliant idea flashed through brain winking encouragingly at disconsolate bob stepped boldly up to skipper touching cap said hope sir a officer will doubtless go ashore in cutter that will allow summer to land join storming party will try to make ourselves useful sir in carrying of message so on have be looking forward so much to affair that hope will not disappoint sir oh said skipper wish summer to join storming party eh well weally know what to say about must scarcely be fair to other young gentleman know still um ah let see admiwal of officer not forming part of stormers be going on shore will doubtless use cutter a will stay until be over think may venture to join if get into twouble over affair must do best can to make excuse for hurrah bob exclaimed a rejoined despondent friend faint heart never won fair lady skipper have given permission to slip ashore join stormers so off go at once get ready be long old chap for admiral lot more be going ashore in little mouette must be on hand directly signal be made never fear joyously responded bob will be ready in brace of shake have only to get weepons a scotch doctor call will be on deck again a soon a be having already so successfully enacted part of petitioner determined to try luck once more accordingly hunted up honourable mortimer who have retired to cabin one of hobby of somewhat eccentric third be collection of choice weapon several valuable specimen of adorned state room if ever saw anything specially curious choice in shape of sword pistol never rested until have made own when once coveted article have come into possession seemed to lose further interest in accordingly being also good natured individual enough be always ready to lend from stock provided undertaking be entered into to take due care of borrowed article to faithfully return to accommodating friend briefly stated case be simply that a there be just bare possibility did not like to put stronger remembering that be one of disappointed one of being present at storming of redoubt be anxious to be provided with more efficient weapon than dirk must feel very much obliged to if must lend one of sword at once did bidding take choice thereupon selected beautiful turkish scimitar curved blade of inlaid with delicate scroll pattern in gold be a keen a razor tucking under arm thanking duly for kindness next hurried away to armourer wheedled out of pair of ship pistol together with necessary ammunition after returned to deck awaited ally calm in consciousness be now prepared for emergency be almost immediately afterwards joined by bob whose face beamed with delight a directed attention to ship cutlas have girded to thigh pair of long barrelled duelling pistol fire eating second have entrusted to care at once trundled down over side into cockleshell of boat getting on board mouette with speed roused up anchor dodged about well in view of admiral keeping sharp lookout for whiff in mizzen rigging be especial signal for service chapter eighteen storming of redoubt attack on bastia a afternoon wore on wind grew light by eight bell have so far died away that be practically valueless to boat be to convey naval brigade to shore admiral however must not allow men to row being anxious that must reach scene of action fresh vigorous at last moment therefore one of lieutenant belonging to victory be sent onboard requin shark a be now almost universally called with order to get under weigh tow flotilla down to cove at same time signal be made in obedience to went through fleet took on board lord hood sir hyde parker vice admiral

everything be arranged to satisfaction of chief gave order for brig to fill away went took hour half to reach cove wind being so light in order to remain in company little mouette canvas have to be reduced to close reefed mainsail small jib under be still able to sail round flotilla occasionally in order that lord hood might see that be right be just growing dusk when boat having cast off from towing hawser pulled into cove grounded on steep shingly beach anchored mouette about cable length from beach landed passenger watched fairly out of sight on san fiorenzo road when bob leaped into dinghy be pulled ashore naval brigade be by time in motion hurrying forward soon found alongside juno contingent under command of second lieutenant whose irish blood be already up who greeted appearance with rollicking joke must in almost other man have be unbecoming dignity of rank paddy flinn micky flinn a be indifferently called by friend have subtle knack of behaving in undignified manner without jeopardising respect due to for let vagary take what form must never by chance descended to committal of mean cowardly ungentlemanly act camp of land force be pitched at distance of about two mile from beach march be accomplished in about three quarter of hour tar beguiling way with joke yarn of most outrageous improbable character strictest discipline be always maintained on board ship on land expedition must admit of little more freedom be tacitly permitted when reached point of rendezvous found troop who be to share with honour of night already on ground waiting gun of cliff battery be still thundering away far above redoubt be replying with apparently undiminished vigour place of rendezvous be sort of ravine situated about midway between two opposing battery ground being masked from redoubt by one of precipitous side of ravine at farther end precipice gradually merged into steep slope from summit of rose hill upon redoubt stood up two steep slope storming party

falling so copiously that promised soon to wet to skin at signal made by waving of lantern gun of cliff battery above suddenly became mute a though artilleryman have given up for night calm tranquil silence ensued broken only by gentle rustle of fitful breeze through foliage of fir be dotted here there along precipitous side of ravine chirping of insect occasional twitter of sleeping bird low murmur here there in serried rank of armed men stood awaiting order to rush forth to death victory star flooded scene with subdued mellow radiance for occasional gleam of naked weapon everything be suggestive of restfulness peace have be hoped that must be able to take garrison of redoubt at least partially by surprise fineness silence of night rendered impossible a soon therefore a everything be ready party moved forward toward farther end of ravine soldier leading way in accordance with proviso of major general dundas who refused to co operate with naval brigade upon other term took few minute to reach end of ravine directly be clear have reached point where first slope became practicable be led up at easy pace halted just beneath brow consequently under cover in order that hand might recover wind in readiness for rush up second slope to redoubt be not at period of life particularly susceptible to serious thought grave reflection a stood on steep hill side in hush solemn beauty of starlit night looked upon band of silent men one of with pulse of life beating quick strong within frame aglow with health nerve quivering with intense excitement awful thought flashed through brain that with many of few brief second only stood between eternity wondered to how many of have same idea presented then came question doe god ever in infinite mercy in such supreme moment a

shriek groan rose above thundering roar of artillery long line of dead dying men marked path of pitiless shot calmness stillness of night gave place to horrible discord of deafening sound earth beneath foot shook vibrated with ceaseless discharge of heavy gun baleful glare of portfires fireball flung down hill by enemy to enable more clearly to ascertain position incessant flash of cannon cast fierce unearthly light upon scene again again again came hissing storm of iron time with more deadly effect ground before around be ploughed gashed by rushing shot men be swept away before like withered leaf before hurricane death cry of cherished comrade continually pierced ear storming party be melting away like snow beneath scorching breath of fiery tempest still remnant struggled on at length fearful breathless climb be nearly over be so near redoubt that muzzle of gun must no longer be depressed sufficiently for shot to take effect artilleryman therefore left cannon joined

storming party from occupant of cliff battery away aloft in cool night air poor little bobby summer came panting in with ruck after be over first use made of breath after have recovered sufficiently to speak be to abuse in unmeasured term for what be pleased to term meanness in leaving to struggle up hill unaided hand remained on shore night to make everything secure to guard against possibility of attempt to retake redoubt storming party being quickly reinforced by strong detachment from camp have be held in readiness to march in a soon a redoubt must be carried then came sickening task of collecting dead wounded arranging former for burial attending to want of latter making a comfortable a possible under circumstance will not go into detail of accompaniment to pomp circumstance of war lest must unnecessarily harrow feeling of reader suffice to say that task be not accomplished until long after sun rise while of naval military surgeon of course lasted for week fall of convention redoubt left town of san fiorenzo at mercy accordingly when next day troop marched into town be found that french have evacuated have retired to bastia most important town in island at period of story also most strongly fortified whatever may be at present day be about six mile from san fiorenzo be situated on eastern opposite side of long narrow peninsula form northern extremity of corsica be against that in lord hood opinion next operation ought to be directed view however of major general dundas be widely divergent a to practicability of proposed scheme latter being of opinion that have strength mean sufficient to effect reduction of so strongly fortified place a bastia while lord hood on other hand be sanguine of success difference of opinion between head of force led to protracted vexatious delay during of fleet busied successfully in raising french thirty eight gun frigate minerve crew have sunk in san fiorenzo harbour ship be afterwards added to navy under name of san fiorenzo must not omit to mention that few day after taking of convention redoubt captain hood publicly thanked on juno quarter deck for assistance have rendered on memorable night story also reaching admiral ear have gratification of being warmly commended by great chief a well a of finding that name have be prominently mentioned in despatch home several other officer also thanked for supporting reputation of navy captain nelson being especially eulogistic for on subject so that altogether received far greater share of credit than seemed to so simple matter merited at length meeting after meeting having taken place between lord hood major general dundas without officer being able to agree upon question of investing bastia something very like rupture took place admiral declaring so confident be of success that since general dundas must not co operate with must undertake alone task of reducing place with seaman marine belonging to fleet resolution once arrived at lord hood forthwith set about work of carrying out with accustomed energy old twenty eight gun frigate called proselyte be specially fitted up a floating battery with rest of fleet taken round to bastia road marine be then landed aided by strong contingent of bluejacket who be placed under command of captain horatio nelson at once set to work to throw up chain of sod battery completely investing town on land side so much precious time have be wasted in discussing pro con of matter that notwithstanding utmost exertion be not until second week of april that battery be finished gun mounted everything ready for projected attack evening of th however saw preparation completed on morning of th proselyte be moved inshore moored in convenient position for battering seaward defence of town attack immediately afterwards commenced proselyte shore battery opening fire simultaneously french replied with utmost spirit gun being admirably served especially played upon proselyte soon became evident that unfortunate craft be getting decidedly worst of be only ship engaged admiral having early come to conclusion that must be madness to expose fleet unprotected to fire of heavy metal mounted in french defence therefore few of be who be not detailed for duty on shore have nothing to do for time being watch fun action have be in progress short time when observed that proselyte be swinging round on looking at more attentively with aid of telescope discovered that of mooring have be shot away remaining cable soon brought up again not until have drifted into frightfully exposed position fire of french battery be immediately concentrated upon devoted craft with increased energy presently little jet of greyish smoke issuing here there from side showed that enemy be effectively firing red hot shot about ten minute afterwards little string of ball be seen soaring aloft to mast head ball burst apart four signal flag fluttered in breeze raised telescope to eye read out number to mr annesley who be busy turning over leaf of signal book ran finger hastily along column of figure read out to skipper who be looking over shoulder ship on fire send assistance now mr chester keep eye on admiral see what say remarked skipper a spoke saw signal going aloft on board victory managed to get into field of telescope just a flag burst abroad at mast head read out number again all right know what mean without turning up number said skipper quickly mean send away boat to ship in distress ' so have goodness to pipe away pinnace first second cutter if please mr annesley in moment boatswain shrill pipe be sounding throughout ship boat be hanging at boom be brought alongside manned placed in charge of midshipman to boat despatched with speed to assistance of unlucky proselyte from by time dense cloud of dark smoke be issuing meanwhile boat from rest of fleet be also pushing off with same object a ourselves exciting race ensued be among last to arrive alongside having have longer distance to pull than of other boat when reached doomed craft flame be bursting out through port roaring fiercely up through hatchway soaring aloft by mean of rigging like fiery serpent of gun be already nearly red hot part of main deck have fallen in main mizzen mast be so far burnt through at foot that threatened momentarily to fall although flame be blazing so fiercely have obtained complete hold upon ship that magazine be expected to explode at moment although enemy taking full advantage of disaster be concentrating terrific fire upon part of ship where crew be mustered awaiting turn to go down over side into boat be waiting to receive there be not trace of hurry confusion commander serocold who have be given command of unfortunate craft stood on rail personally directed process of trans shipping sending down first injured then younger rawer portion of crew then veteran sturdy old bronzed weather beaten salt whose nerve be thoroughly proof against worst terror of battle fire flood next officer finally when be quite satisfied that living being remained on board raised uniform cap a if in salute slipped down side gave order to give way stretch out to work lad exclaimed a oar dashed into water throw whole heart into fire must be close to magazine terrific concussion dull heavy roar poor old proselyte be rent to piece a broad sheet of flame flashed up from hull skyward wall of water five foot high leapt up just under stern immediately afterwards curled over upon completely swamping boat fragment of plank beam heavy bolt spar other wreckage whizzed through air around one of gun still mounted on carriage with shattered tackle streaming in air be hurled outwards fell into water with tremendous splash within six foot of where be left struggling in water then great cloud of black smoke shot up into air blackened remains of hull collapsing amidships sank out of sight creating great seething whirl dragged helplessly into vortex sucked ruthlessly down down deep into darkening bosom of ocean stunned almost insensible from violence of shock still have presence of mind left to close nostril with finger of one hand to hold breath a be helplessly whirled hither thither at last just a power of endurance have reached point of exhaustion rose again to surface beheld once more welcome sight of bright sunlight flashing upon dancing billow water round be thickly strewn with wreckage few piece be still falling here there showing height to fragment have be projected dozen so of human head appeared on surface of water at great distance from others be momentarily popping up above wave owner one immediately striking out more le scientifically for nearest floating object looking round soon have satisfaction of discovering gallant commander of ill fated proselyte clinging to keel of boat be floating bottom up at great distance from seeing that hand appeared pretty well able to take care of at once struck out joined ah mr chester exclaimed a ranged alongside glad to see that have weathered so well be very narrow squeak have come out of good deal better than dared expect have be trying to count head make out thirty eight told how many men have with twelve answered twelve repeated then that brings out right for counted twenty four of people a passed down into boat make twenty five with dozen brings up complement here come boat to pick up have doubt explosion have frightened shark within dozen mile of started off to seaward under heavy press of sail otherwise must not feel quite so easy in mind about poor fellow of be clinging to very small piece of wreckage must have chance if attacked remarked that thought there be not very much danger opinion soon received singular confirmation for while be still speaking immense number of fish of size description killed others merely stunned by violence of explosion floated up to surface shortly afterwards when boat have picked up be pulling out toward fleet fell in with enormous shark floating helplessly on back in apparently paralysed condition running bowline be promptly slipped over tail drawn taut be triumphantly unresistingly towed alongside victory hoisted inboard chapter nineteen foolhardy adventure short time after melancholy event occurred cast gloom over entire fleet siege be not progressing to admiral satisfaction garrison showed sign of yielding chief became anxious to learn something with regard to condition of thing within wall of bastia moment that desire became known host of volunteer stepped forward with offer to do best to make way inside gain required information admiral hood however felt very reluctant to allow of volunteer to expose to so great risk particularly a turned out when questioned that not one of have be able to devise really practicable promising scheme least unpromising idea of be that suggested by lieutenant carre tupper of flag ship be that must endeavour to effect landing inside chain of defence penetrating into town gain information must trust to good fortune for mean of getting off to ship again plan seemed more feasible from fact that spoke french language with ease fluency of parisian after much consideration therefore admiral accepted gallant young officer offer gave consent to experiment disguise be accordingly prepared under lieutenant tupper own supervision on first favourable night experiment be tried be perfectly calm with overcast sky moon when stood dressed in disguise in gangway of victory receiving from admiral last instruction many hearty hand shake many fervent success attend dear fellow did receive before passing down lofty side of gun ship into pinnace with muffled oar crew armed to teeth awaited at foot of side ladder at last final parting be spoken final shake of hand given with gay laugh in response to half serious half jocose warning to take care of followed sprang lightly down side took seat in stern sheet gave order to shove off have most carefully reconnoitred place beforehand from topgallant yard of victory from deck of little mouette so that knew exactly for what point to steer there be hesitation upon score went well with little expedition until boat arrived within mile of bastia when little breeze sprang up canopy of cloud have overspread heaven cleared away a if by magic star shone out brilliantly flooding earth sea with light though subdued be sufficient to reveal to sharp eyed french sentinel small dark object be silently stealing toward shore alarm be immediately given instead of opening upon boat with heavy gun at risk of missing object driving off prey french allowed boat still to approach marking carefully spot for be making silently placed strong body of sharpshooter in ambush to await coming have frenchman in ambush observed most ordinary caution there be doubt must easily have captured boat whole of crew instead of gave way to excitement be one of failing indulged in such loud continuous chatter that coxswain of pinnace heard when within about twenty yard of landing place boat be at once pulled round with head off shore crew ordered to give way with will in order to escape very obvious danger be too late moment that be observed that destined prey have taken alarm terrific volley of musketry be poured into boat gallant young officer who have undertaken chief risk of expedition fell forward into bottom of boat dead riddled with bullet coxswain also two of crew be more le severely wounded boat be a speedily a possible taken out of range though when be found that there be prospect of escaping of battery opened upon two three boat started from shore in chase reached victory without further mishap about hour half from time when started upon disastrous expedition much grief be felt throughout fleet at loss of gallant promising young officer whose distinguished service at evacuation of toulon a well a kindly genial disposition have made universally liked respected after there be further talk of obtaining information respecting condition of enemy idea have taken hold of have thought about until have become completely fascinated certainly seemed to preposterous piece of presumption must flatter must succeed where older much more talented officer have failed idea have got into head more thought of more sanguine did become of success have after much thought evolved scheme appeared to so very promising determined to put to test without delay taking care however not to breathe word of purpose to of officer because felt certain that after late lamentable failure further attempt of like kind must be permitted needed assistance however to carry notable scheme into effect accordingly took little bobby summer into confidence mouette ought to mention have be brought round with rest of fleet be occasionally employed in communicating between ship force on shore bobby retained former post in a be required at hour of day night have removed chest hammock to little cabin merely visiting old juno at odd time to maintain connexion with when have nothing else in particular to do arrangement be most favourable to scheme inasmuch a allowed of embarking upon unmolested also rendered little bobby assistance available at moment might require there seemed to be only one serious difficulty in way be want of really good effective disguise difficulty be quite unexpectedly removed by merest accident have taken summer into confidence have received from prompt promise of heartiest co operation first dark night therefore followed upon unfolding of purpose to enthusiastic shipmate took first step necessary to accomplishment be a think have already mentioned excellent swimmer be upon possession of accomplishment chiefly based hope of success plan be simply to row in a near shore a possible accompanied by summer in cockleshell of dinghy belonging to mouette then quietly slip into water swim remainder of distance dinghy in question be so very diminutive craft felt sure might under favourable circumstance get quite close in without being discovered first thing considered necessary be to ascertain set rate of tide such a be to do started away in dinghy one very dark night armed with cutlas brace of pistol paddled leisurely in toward shore arrived in due time within about mile of harbour mouth then laid upon oar to watch drift of small piece of plank painted white launched overboard keeping boat just far enough away to prevent influencing course while at same time able to distinguish position pretty clearly have be occupied thus for nearly hour have seen enough to very nearly satisfy upon point in question when at great distance away heard sound a of one laying in oar upon boat thwart curiosity at once urged to ascertain if possible source meaning of sound a felt pretty confident must proceed from boat belonging to fleet easily arrived at logical conclusion that must therefore proceed from boat belonging to enemy abandoning therefore float to fate loosened cutlass in sheath pistol in belt supported very cautiously paddled in direction from whence sound appeared to proceed have not gone very far when heard sound of voice speaking in low tone apparently just inshore of accordingly turned boat head in direction a proceeded sound of talking rapidly became more distinct at length be near enough to distinguish that speaker whoever be ere conversing in french at point rested on oar again peered eagerly into darkness in endeavour to see something of neighbour after perhaps minute intense gaze shoreward bobby leaned over whispered there be right ahead close under bow be boat with two men in a nearly a can make out be leaning over side hauling something into boat looked intently in direction indicated at length succeeded in making out craft there be a bob have said two men in be leaning over side a watched one of raised arm detected just for moment faint glitter of object just beneath at same instant voice said in french here be fine fellow be too will make splendid dinner for general to morrow fisherman by be lucky exclaimed in excited whisper now bob let dash alongside board craft selection from rig of two men will make exactly rig want right returned bob be skipper give word will nab mossoos in jiffy now said dashed oar into water in dozen stroke be alongside astonished fisherman a two boat touched bob laid in oar with dinghy painter in one hand drawn cutlas in other leaped on board stranger treading a did so upon mass of fish lay writhing flapping feebly in bottom of boat instantly assuming quite unintentionally on part may be sure sitting position amongst thickest of slimy scaly cargo a boarded forward did so aft presenting pistol in hand a sternly a must while struggling to suppress laughter at bob exploit ordered fisherman to surrender to keep perfect silence upon pain of instant death a penalty of disobedience poor fellow be taken completely by surprise seemed to have idea of resistance meekly cast off portion of line still remained overboard taking to oar pulled quietly away in direction ordered towards mouette dinghy being in tow astern a rather rowed off to cutter questioned men a to reason for running so great risk for sake of few fish in reply gained information that garrison though still in possession of moderate supply of food foresaw that time of scarcity be rapidly approaching general have accordingly few day previously taken remaining provision under own control issuing to inhabitant daily ration upon very reduced scale under circumstance fisherman of place thought saw way to good market for fish must contrive to capture few of have accordingly ventured out at night with hook line be most valuable information if true coming from enemy thought scarcely reliable though men spoke with utmost freedom apparently in perfectly good faith therefore determined while slightly modifying original plan still to carry out on arrival on board mouette invited two prisoner down into cabin pouring out stiff nor'wester to cheer up little loosen tongue told frankly that be necessary must make way into bastia intimated to that a must be retained a hostage until safe return liberated immediately afterwards must obviously be to interest to give information help in power to enable to provide for safety also informed that must be necessary for to borrow certain portion of habiliment to be used a disguise be dangerous game be about to play monsieur remarked elder of two who gave name a jean leferrier greatest precaution be taken to prevent access of spy into place most of inhabitant be well known stranger must certainly be noticed sharply questioned a to how came there upon what business greatly fear will be arrested before have be three hour in place if monsieur will condescend to accept advice of poor ignorant fisherman like will abandon idea not embark upon so hazardous enterprise however must not listen to for moment in fact word spoken only made more determined to go on intimated pretty plainly perhaps if monsieur be to adopt role of escaped prisoner from british fleet might succeed in disarming suspicion remarked pierre cousin other prisoner monsieur accent be certainly not quite perfect if will pardon presuming to say so still may pas without attracting much notice if jean be to give note to la mere must take in look after be if monsieur must endure poor accommodation to be found under roof certainly replied jean might be done must have to report to monsieur le maire immediately on arrival must therefore have to be prepared with good detailed plausible story replied that thought must manufacture story must hold water sufficiently to satisfy functionary referred to thought flashing into mind must personate lad whom have found in charge of mouette on eventful evening of capture then if monsieur be still determined to pursue adventure will write letter remarked jean do so at once by mean said tell that venturing too far out have be made prisoner by boat crew from british fleet that found on board ship to have be taken prisoner who have contrived to make preparation for escape that have only time to write note informing mother of whereabouts recommending bearer to good office before proceeded to put plan into execution night being favourable for attempt there be time like present continued to summer night be dark altogether favourable for enterprise have locality fresh in mind so will go at once when do intend to return asked bob ah replied be more than can tell may depend upon will not stay hour longer than be absolutely necessary for obtaining required information whether will be able to get out again when be obtained be impossible to say there be one thing must do summer be keep constant lookout from time leave until turn up again if observe anything unusual inshore leading to suppose be attempting to get out do best can to help will leave note with for skipper explaining what intend to do that note want to take on board deliver into own hand first thing in morning then set about writing note by time have finished jean have also brought communication to close passed over table for to read found that be substantially to same effect a have suggested written in own homely not very precise style of composition looked very carefully through to see that there be covert suggestion therein of character intended to betray a far a must see be perfectly straightforward affair from beginning to end matter settled borrowed pair of breech long boot belonging to one of dirty ragged canvas overall of other topping off with dilapidated blue worsted cap have be wearing continually since joining mouette rig out be complete intended pulling boldly ashore in boat belonging to captured fisherman that being infinitely preferable to mind to swimming ashore a have originally proposed so a soon a be ready sat down once more questioned very minutely respecting position of landing place locality of la mere domicile everything else must think of likely to be of service in undertaking jean elder of two replied freely to inquiry adding such information a suggested to at moment winding up by saying monsieur must not be surprised if be challenged on entering harbour be almost certain to occur if doe have only to give watch word will not be further interfered with what be watch word asked simply bateau pecheur bastia ' replied if be challenged give pas word lie upon oar will show that be one of will at once receive permission to proceed very well think be pretty well primed now may venture to start good bye bob old fellow keep sharp lookout bear hand with assistance if see that need when returning forget letter to skipper right never fear will remember everything only wish must have gone instead of chester if succeed will be end of feather in cap if fail concluded sentence with pantomimic gesture expressive of strangulation there added have fear of never saw such fellow a for pulling through good bye old boy ta ta be sure write ' wrung hand heartily with gay laugh upon lip something very like tear glittering in eye a feeble ray of cabin lamp struggled through skylight fell upon face stepped into heavy clumsy slimy boat belonging to fisherman shipping oar shoved off gave way for shore faint twinkling light here there in town serving to guide upon proper course took nearly two hour to reach harbour boat being heavy oar much more cumbersome than have ever handled before passed in between two pier at last a did so dark figure appeared on extremity of one of looming up indistinctly against dusky sky voice exclaimed sharply in french who go there bateau pecheur bastia replied composedly resting on oar at same time be late comrade remarked sentry what luck very poor replied have only be able to find half line darkness be so great in searching for others have lost good deal of time ah returned be lucky to have found of pas on monsieur le pecheur good night good night shouted back stretching out at oar once more rowing laboriously up harbour against slight ebb tide have difficulty in finding landing place be sort of slipway leading down from top of quay to water edge ten dozen other fishing boat be either hauled up there moored alongside there be not soul to be seen about place when ranged up alongside green slimy pile of slipway be constructed be consequently able to moor boat at leisure in such way that if wanted again in hurry must have difficulty in quickly casting adrift then gathered up fish placed in basket be stowed away in eye of boat throwing rope strap over shoulder trudged with load up slipway until stood upon top of quay have be very minute in inquiry a to how be to proceed on landing so a to be able to go direct to abode of dame leferrier fisherman jean have be equally minute careful in directing have only to stand few second therefore a though taking breath after steep ascent look carefully about to recognise landmark have given to determine direction ought to take low villainous looking waterside tavern stood at corner of street at great distance dimly visible in light of grimy lantern swung over door making for keeping on right found in narrow wretchedly paved street up passed for about couple of hundred yard when found opposite rickety little hovel having light burning in window be directed to look for such light in house to be bound a appeared to be only place in street so distinguished walked boldly up to door raised wooden latch entered found in small low ceiled room stone paved with heavy wooden table in centre having rough wooden bench on side couple of three legged stool against wall pair of clumsy oar boat hook in one corner boat mast sail in fireplace with few smouldering log over be suspended iron pot occupied nearly whole of one side of room by side of hearth with back toward sat old dame leaning forward with elbow on knee gazing half asleep at almost extinct fire on entrance rose wearily to foot looked round in feeble surprise without sign of perturbation at seeing stranger before have honour to address madame leferrier inquired with a polite bow a heavy fish basket on back permitted to make be dame leferrier replied who be young man a far a dim eye will allow to judge have never seen before be quite right madame said be perfect stranger to note however from son jean will tell who be note from jean exclaimed what be meaning of why be not here be sorry to inform that slight misfortune have befallen replied comrade pierre be at present prisoner in hand of english will doubt soon find mean to escape a have just done prisoner exclaimed mon dieu what will become of what added will become of now have lost support only must give be not distressed madame replied on account own will be treated with utmost kindness prisoner though be for will need home until can get out of bastia return to own if will give shelter be able willing to pay well for still held note in hand a ceased speaking offered again read out to monsieur if please said sight be poor at best of time be certainly not equal to reading poor jean letter by light accordingly read letter over to when have finished remarked poor boy poor boy prisoner well well can not be helped must be patient trust to mercy of le bon dieu now monsieur a to yourself be doubtless hungry tired here be supper have prepared for two ala be not here to eat draw up monsieur put basket in corner there draw up to table be heartily welcome to such a poor widow have to give when have satisfied hunger will show to bed be boy poor jean ah will ever sleep on again drew up to table in accordance with poor old soul invitation while partaking of what turned out to be very savoury meal did best to cheer up with hope of speedily seeing jean once more meal concluded conducted up rickety worm eaten staircase to small room above have just left indicating one of two bed therein a one belonging to jean one therefore be to occupy bade good night retired must admit that now have fairly embarked upon adventure found there be certain physical discomfort incidental to be by mean to taste thus disguise upon safety to great extent depended consisted of clothing reverse of clean though be certainly odoriferous enough perfume be by mean that of araby blest then there be lodging be moderately clean perhaps compared with condition of few of place in immediate neighbourhood idea of cleanliness like idea upon many other matter vary place though doubtless considered scrupulously clean by rightful occupant be sufficiently reverse to make really uncomfortable for short time abandoned to reflection reverse of self complimentary with regard to impulse have led into situation fact remained be there common sense suggested desirability of making best of situation accordingly arranged matter a comfortably a must flinging upon coarse pallet be soon wrapped in dreamless slumber first business in morning be to find out report to maire have given great deal of consideration to matter while rowing ashore on previous night weighing carefully argument for against such course have finally arrived at conclusion that though such proceeding must undoubtedly be fraught with great danger must in reality be safest thing to do great thing to avoid be exciting of suspicion surest mean of achieving seemed to to be not actual courting of observation certainly careful avoidance of anything seemed like shunning accordingly after early breakfast during discussion of easily extracted from unsuspicious hostess information necessary to enable to find way to various point deemed most important to visit shouldered basket of fish set out on way to residence of monsieur le maire a slouched heavily leisurely along street affecting a nearly a must clumsy gait of common seaman on terra firma glanced carefully about to note such sign a might make visible of state of thing within town be not however until reached more respectable business quarter of town be able to detect much then observed ticket in window on stall announcing various article for sale especially provision at only such price exorbitantly high price be too soon have reason to see that resolution to report be wise one for have not proceeded far on way before found subject of sundry suspicious glance shortly afterwards corporal of infantry hurried up behind laying hand upon shoulder exclaimed halt friend give name place of residence if please be fisherman apparently yet two of own people have just pointed out to a certainly stranger be stranger comrade replied composedly only arrived in bastia late last night after effecting escape from british fleet two hour previously two of fisherman belonging to place jean

intended trying to escape directed how to find way on shore how to behave when here giving also note to convey to madame leferrier be now on way to house of monsieur le maire to report good exclaimed unwelcome companion will accompany there show house since be stranger did not of course dare to manifest objection to proposal must instantly have be made prisoner if indeed might not consider in reality one already accordingly acquiesced in most cheerful manner must assume trudged on together describing in response to corporal questioning detail of assumed escape just a have finished recital arrived at corner of street companion stopped said be street in monsieur le maire resides before go further may ask comrade what be going to do with fish in basket casting at same time hungry glance over shoulder well said really belong to poor jean leferrier mate intended asking monsieur le maire to accept one two of finest of after must sell remainder hand over proceeds to jean mother who find depended entirely upon son for house food clothing suppose one two more le will not make much difference to good dame especially bright idea striking a intend going out to night trying luck so if must like bit of fish for dinner will accept one two make choice comrade have be very kind in guiding thus far be sure be heartily welcome be about to unsling basket from shoulder a spoke hastily stopped be good fellow mon ami said accept offer not here must never do for to be seen here in public accepting present must be sure to get to general ear must be simply flogged for presumption why if have not told that be stranger must have known at once from ignorance of value of content of basket why be closely besieged mon cher provision be growing scarce fish be worth well almost weight in silver come way never mind monsieur le maire must only send on to general quarter to report there so may a well save intended present to better still hand to general cook will insure from further trouble in future especially if happen to make point of leaving little bit of fish at general whenever happen to be passing way ah here be at barrack turned in a spoke through pair of large high folding gate of

individual inquiry corporal related story of pretended escape from enemy hinting also desire to report to general winding up with description of anxiety to procure monsieur lemaitre acceptance on behalf of general of pick of basket began dimly to see that general whoever be be much dreaded individual that present of fish suggested by friend corporal be intended by in kindness a bribe whereby might obtain a favourable introduction a possible to presence of great man monsieur lemaitre stooped down with much deliberation turned over various fish have brought finally selecting quantity of choicest amounting to about stock laid upon stone pavement of hall done in very gracious patronising manner assured might count upon best service to obtain for early interview with master retired promising to send one forthwith to remove fish have selected moment be out of sight friend corporal turned to congratulated warmly upon favourable reception have be accorded by great man great man congratulating at same time upon opportunity have be afforded of rendering service of little importance to stranger a spoke thus cast such expressive glance into fish basket that there be possibility of misunderstanding accordingly when immediately added that a must now be of further service to must take departure uttered few word of thanks for kindness expressed hope that must oblige by making further selection of fish a slight token of gratitude well comrade said since be so anxious about matter will do more readily since between will find fellow about here such shark that will have to

key stood back in recess to deliberate upon next step became conscious of sound of running water looking along passage into barrack yard courtyard at back of tower saw by faint light of one two lamp that ground be flooded that be raining heavily so much better there must be fewer people about chance of escape must thereby be greater first question be how to get beyond boundary of barrack front barrack yard be bounded on three side by lofty building on fourth by high wall with gate in be true gate must be closed locked at hour of night difficulty of escape by way of front be great might very possibly prove insurmountable therefore determined to make first attempt at back keeping close within deepest part of shadow moved cautiously in direction of guard room have just gained courtyard when heard footstep entering passage behind darted out from under archway hastily concealed behind one of massive buttress supported back wall of building peering cautiously out from hiding place saw

have be there at least month boat be still there with several others a own safety be just then of more importance to than one else convenience did not hesitate on finding much smaller lighter boat

skipper to request presence on board thereupon master bob have presented note informing skipper of proposed expedition instead of expressing gratification at zeal a bobby have fully expected must appeared that skipper have exhibited very considerable amount of irritation finally ordering friend robert somewhat peremptorily back to cutter with instruction to send without fail on board juno immediately on return if skipper seemed to consider highly improbable ever succeeded in returning at by time that summer have brought story to close be ready for breakfast meantime have be preparing a be still much too early to present before captain hood who seldom appeared before eight bell sat down to meal with must be confessed somewhat diminished appetite hastily skimming through letter a munched away at weevily biscuit there be two one from dear old dad one from sir peregrine there be nothing of very special interest in father epistle dealing chiefly with few item of home gossip such a farmer giles of glebe have met with accident in hunting field colt falling with breaking worthy farmer leg doctor pronounced compound fracture that wife of lightfoot gamekeeper have presented husband with twin once more two girl time mother twin doing well that old jane martin have be laid up winter with rheumatism etcetera etcetera etcetera that finally at home be enjoying excellent health must be glad if must find time to write to little more frequently great uncle sir peregrine be not nearly so voluminous in correspondence a father sailor be not a rule very good correspondent what have to say be said in a few word a possible two page of note paper sufficed worthy admiral to inform that have be intensely gratified at term in name have be mentioned in connexion with storming of convention redoubt that be writing per same mail to friend hood admiral not captain asking to give a many opportunity a must of distinguishing of getting knocked on head thought that if needed cash draft upon must be duly honoured also that have not be out much during winter old enemy gout having attacked so pertinaciously that have be confined to house for week at time moored stem stern before library fire like prison hulk in portsmouth harbour letter breakfast be got through in about same time a bob emerged from tiny cabin on to cutter narrow deck ship bell be musically chiming out eight stroke proclaimed end of one watch commencement of skipper must knew be stirring by time so jumped into dinghy proceeded on board frigate a stepped in on juno deck captain hood made appearance at cabin door touching hat went up reported good morning mr chester observed affably be very glad to see have come safely out of escapade what do mean sir assuming tone of severity by presuming to undertake such expedition without asking obtaining permission be manifest breach of discipline a such must be punished placed in charge of cutter a kind of promotion by way of reward for exemplary conduct generally now will be compelled to deprive of command will return forthwith to duty on board frigate sir ay ay sir responded considerably crestfallen be extremely sorry to have incurred displeasure sir be sure must have asked permission sir be afraid that after poor mr tupper death must be refused very well mr chester have doubt meant well therefore have be lenient in punishment breach of discipline demanded have be reprimanded on quarter deck sir so will say nothing more about only must impress upon necessity of being careful to avoid repetition of offence now come into cabin have breakfast with can then tell how fared among frenchman if have not already breakfasted mr annesley to first lieutenant who at moment approached will be glad to have pleasure of company so saying skipper turned on heel led way into cabin where found table well provided with variety of good thing highly provocative of appetite in midshipman even though might have partaken of one breakfast already within hour a soon a have seated ourselves be supplied from stock of delicacy before now said skipper overhaul log mr chester let hear how managed to conduct difficult enterprise that young scamp summer told about gallant capture with just faintest possible ironical emphasis on word gallant of unfortunate fisherman so may a well commence at point where left cutter in boat in obedience to command at once proceeded with story giving detailed account of everything have happened from time of leaving cutter to moment of return auditor evinced greatest interest in narration be mightily tickled when described manner in have be relieved of fish by condescending cook friendly corporal interest increased when described imprisonment in mode of escape from dungeon when have finished congratulated very heartily upon what captain hood called resolution courage have exhibited be remarkably narrow squeak mr chester remarked skipper hope will be warning to not to unnecessarily expose to danger for future when duty call be of course quite thing be perfectly willing to give credit for desire in present instance to perform very important service have already reprimanded for breach of discipline committed in undertaking expedition without first obtaining leave let now express satisfaction with way in apart from that have conducted have succeeded in obtaining information believe will be of great value to admiral will endeavour so to represent conduct to a that will view in favourable light now if have finished breakfast have better go on board cutter transfer chest hammock to frigate by by will take on board flag ship introduce to admiral when can make report accepting a hint to be off about business rose making bow left cabin on reaching deck found that whole of inmate of midshipman berth already apprised by loquacious bob of escapade be anxiously awaiting reappearance to learn particular including result of private interview with skipper briefly informing however have be ordered to rejoin frigate postponing further information until more convenient season hurried down over side stepping into cockleshell of dinghy pulled on board mouette where master bob received narration with show of sympathy thinly veiled exultation at being left in sole command of cutter somehow did not greatly regret change be beginning to tire of cramped accommodation on board mouette although have be formally reprimanded for breach of discipline be acute enough to see that conduct have after made favourable impression upon skipper have on whole risen rather than fallen in estimation hurriedly bundling few belonging together stowing away in boat shook hand with bob be soon once more on board juno have barely time to trim up bit when message be brought to effect that skipper gig be alongside only waited presence on board to shove off for admiral ship victory be lying at great distance from be soon alongside followed skipper up side ladder found in presence of admiral who be taking constitutional up down quarter deck in company with sir hyde parker vice admiral hotham from britannia captain hood immediately joined company remaining discreetly in background in accordance with previous instruction in course of minute two party doubt in consequence of suggestion from skipper retired to cabin in about twenty minute afterwards be sent for entered cabin with must confess slight degree of trepidation for admiral be very queer sort of man in respect one never knew in what light must be likely to view exploit a mine have known of having disrated more than one luckless mid for far le heinous offence than so serious breach of discipline a of have be guilty disrating be one thing presented to a more objectionable than anything else in shape of punishment except flogging built hope upon skipper good office result showed that have ground for fear on entering be invited to take chair lord hood pointed out then waiting until cabin door be shut rested elbow on table supporting chin upon hand looked across at said captain informs young gentleman that understanding be anxious to obtain information respecting condition of enemy in bastia voluntarily undertook most hazardous journey thither be enabled during stay in town to make observation of considerable value must like to hear from own lip detailed

important service have rendered be also complimented by audience upon skill intrepidity with have carried out reconnoissance taking last remark a polite intimation that interview be at end bowed

will very irksome to be idling about deck day must think change of air must do good believe must sir replied thinking from manner of speaking that have proposal of sort to make yes doubt about returned skipper must like then be so kind a to find mr surgeon ask to step into cabin for moment if be disengaged certain now that there be something in wind lost time in hunting up worthy medico delivering skipper message supplemented by request upon own account that if proposal be made to send away upon expedition doctor must kindly throw difficulty in way to canny scotchman replied before makin sic promise will just bide wee speir few particular anent nature o ' said expedition laddie if be o ' nature to prove benefecial to health why then be saying what may be induced to do what can to forward view ' itherwise watched into cabin then stood off on outside upon quarter deck awaiting reappearance have not long to wait in le than five minute came out upon quarter deck seeing beckoned to approach be ' right laddie said just gang ben til pointing to cabin tak ' instruction be just vera thing wad hae prescribed for have be possible to hae have prescription mad ' up ye will gang oot o

skipper when made appearance took chair have indicated then proceeded admiral have important despatch to send away be anxious must reach england a speedily a possible vigilant will take hence to gibraltar admiral there will be requested to despatch frigate with for rest of journey a lord hood think vigilant scarcely fit to cross bay of biscay only question have be who to send with a there be still great deal to be done before fleet can leave island there be officer to spare lord hood mentioned matter to immediately thought of will have nothing to do simply navigate craft to gibraltar learn be quite able to do will be pleasant change for beneficial too malcolm say there be only one thing feel called upon to suggest to be caution recollect that be despatch boat not cruiser let nothing can possibly avoid tempt to delay delivery of despatch endanger safety be very young for trust know seem to have a much tact discretion a good many of senior see reason why must not execute service satisfactorily at event have answered for trust will do can to justify good opinion of have better shift trap over to vigilant at once then proceed on board admiral ship for despatch instruction a be anxious for to sail at once thanked skipper heartily for thoughtfulness consideration have procured for change of air seemed needed for complete recovery also for confidence in commission argued promised most earnestly that safe delivery of despatch must be paramount care be right mr chester said a rose to leave cabin before say good bye may a well mention have be greatly pleased with conduct ever since first joined ship consider most promising young officer have conducted extremely well on more than one trying occasion have procured little commission for in hope that will afford still opportunity of acquiring credit advancing interest wish quick prosperous passage will be glad to see safe return a long a continue to conduct well may count upon a friend willing to do be possible to aid now good bye take care of so saying shook hand heartily with then flinging back once more in chair turned to number of paper littered table while made way out upon deck scarcely knowing whether stood upon head heel so overjoyed be at prospect of trip in le than hour afterwards be on board vigilant with despatch box safely stowed away in most secret hiding place must find instruction in breast pocket night be lovely not faintest breath of air ruffled surface of glassy water in whose dark mysterious depth glittered perfect reflection of star beamed in blue black vault overhead so perfect be stillness of nature that must hear with utmost distinctness song of men on board different ship even talking laughing on board in more immediate vicinity when rigged out sweep to sweep craft into offing where hoped might sooner catch breeze roll rattle seemed almost unbearably loud in contrast with quiet prevailed around having good strong crew on board kept at sweep for couple of hour by time have gained offing of about eight mile when ordered sweep to be laid in canvas to be set shortly afterwards moon rose bringing up nice little southerly breeze with be soon slipping through water close hauled on port tack laying well up on course for old gib skipper have be considerate enough to send with midshipman quiet steady gentlemanly lad named harold smellie year younger than boatswain mate named tom hardy very superior well educated man for position prime seaman thoroughly reliable in way two put in charge of watch then having seen that everything be satisfactory on deck in look of weather went below tumbled into hammock leaving of course stereotyped charge to be called in event of anything turning up out of usual way on awaking next morning found that breeze have freshened very considerably during night so much so indeed that when went on deck vigilant be tearing through with lee rail under although lateen be reefed to utmost capacity there be very awkward jump of sea on already be fast increasing light beamy little craft although tossed spray in blinding shower from weather bow right aft out over lee quarter never shipped drop of green water be highly delighted at excellent sea going quality thought however that must take sea much more easily if be relieved of strain leverage aloft of long heavy swaying yard therefore have lateen taken in lug substituted for be rewarded for trouble by finding anticipation amply realised wind continued to increase through morning by noon be blowing quite fresh gale with correspondingly heavy sea at five pm lookout reported sail about two point on weather bow what do make out to be demanded look large enough for frigate replied man will have better sight of in few minute sir be steering way say chester suppose be frigate from gibraltar with despatch for admiral what will do exclaimed young smellie a stood together by weather bulwark hanging on to main rigging there be only one thing that can do be exchange despatch return a quickly a possible to respective starting point will be great bore if be obliged to cut short cruise despatch be urgent duty plainly be to forward with possible speed a vessel if prove to be frigate will almost certainly be much faster craft than will be in duty bound to put despatch box on board of how will get on board inquired companion must be very ticklish business to launch boat in sea must get near enough if possible to effect exchange without aid of boat returned with care on side think might be safely managed what doe stranger look like by time continued to lookout seems to that have very frenchified look about sir replied phew hope not said to smellie lend glass moment will mine be down below think will take trip aloft see what can make out about accordingly went aloft to fore yard sitting astride close to parrals took a good look at fast approaching craft a swaying of yard lively motion of little vigilant must permit remained there for quite ten minute by end of time felt perfectly satisfied a to nationality be french from truck downwards without doubt be extremely awkward rencontre one scarcely expected indeed own frigate be at time so thoroughly scouring mediterranean particularly portion of lying between gibraltar malta that enemy ship be almost last object might expect to see be afraid be in mess here said to smellie a joined aft by companion that fellow be frenchman have weather gage to say nothing of ability to sail round round in weather if took to heel now question be how can hoodwink slip through finger perhaps must personate other craft of about size rig suggested little smellie doubtfully um possibly let get french navy list just run through if there be anything at like will soon find companion dived down below in le than minute afterwards returned with list french signal book turned over together presently came upon craft named vidette seemed from description to be almost sister ship to vigilant accordingly determined to assume name during communication must soon pas between frigate french ensign be bent on then turned up vidette number bent flag also on halliard after must hing wait suddenly thought struck there be several old red nightcap still on board have be found when vessel fell into hand at once routed out made man on deck don one instead of sou ' wester be then effectually disguised a rest of clothing be concealed by oilskin be wearing to protect from drenching spray have scarcely finished preparation when smellie who be watching frigate through telescope reported that unwelcome neighbour have hoisted tricolour be of course polite request that must show colour of bunting run up ensign number said to men who be stationed at signal halliard away went bunting fluttering aloft flag abroad in lubberly fashion prevailed at time in french navy in few second signal be read in response up went frigate number little smellie read out a be going aloft private signal pennant eight two seven four run up answering pennant said to signal man a turned up number in signal book le narcisse be name corresponding to number be about to turn up navy list to learn what particular must respecting craft when companion exclaimed more bunting white flag with blue cross diagonal three nine nought one acknowledged signal on turning up found that be request to round to under lee wish to communicate with brought signalling to close in about quarter of hour afterwards rounded to on frigate lee beam while craft laid main topsail to mast a soon a two craft be within hailing distance dapper little figure dressed in full uniform of french naval captain leaped into mizzen rigging with activity of monkey raising hat slightly in salute of course scrupulously returned gave preliminary flourish two with speaking trumpet almost a big a then applying to lip squeaked out in french of course in shrill falsetto set people on broad grin vidette ahoy ' be guarda costa of name ay ay monsieur briefly replied oh very well said be citizen alphonse latour captain of le narcisse ' frigate in service of french republic whither be bound be cruising to southward eastward on lookout for english fleet be reported to be somewhere hereabouts replied with mischievous desire to see what effect mention of english fleet must have upon english fleet hereabouts diable exclaimed must like to fall in with hope however will not fall in with prize ah good listen monsieur fell in with captured english merchantman yesterday with valuable cargo on board will oblige by going on until fall in with be only about one hundred mile south east of will escort into toulon while a for le narcisse ' parbleu will remain here in waiting for accursed english fleet fight when will arrive be not so order will have best attention monsieur replied trust will not have to wait long for english have honour to wish very good day raised hat bowed simultaneously little french captain scrambled down out of rigging sprang off low rail on to deck filled away upon course once more leaving fire eating frenchman with topsail still to mast waiting for accursed english little smellie enjoyed good laugh over rencontre now that be past have escaped undetected united in cordial hope that gallant little skipper of le narcisse must have wish for meeting with english speedily gratified have a subsequently found out result must scarcely have be satisfactory to for when next saw malta le narcisse be in harbour there prize at six o'clock next morning be fortunate enough to fall in with prize barque of about ton loaded with various product of east forming a captain alphonse latour have truly remarked very valuable cargo have be steering course threw fairly into arm so to speak a weather have moderated sea gone down good deal simply ran on board drove astonished french prize crew below took possession on instituting search found that astute skipper of le narcisse have taken out entire crew except second mate three hand whom have left on board to assist in working ship so a to prevent possibility of rising recapture transferred frenchman to vigilant put eight of own men on board in charge of young smellie then made sail in company for gibraltar a however vigilant sailed two foot to barque one have run completely out of sight by noon must only hope that must reach rock in safety luckily did of vigilant ultimately netted good round sum in shape of prize money on account about three pm on same day a on took prize made sail dead to windward steering same way a ourselves rather edging down upon must have sighted other simultaneously for while still examining with telescope saw bear up upon course evidently intended to cut off vigilant however continued to steer same course a before intention being to try same trick with in event of being frenchman have succeeded so well with le narcisse if be englishman have of course nothing to fear in about hour have neared other sufficiently to permit of colour being seen sooner be case than stranger flew ensign english fired gun for to heave to at once obeyed in about twenty minute afterwards rounded to within pistol shot to windward of lowered boat day being fine be of course in ordinary uniform must not wholly conceal smile at look of disappointment disgust overspread feature of officer in charge a boat approached sufficiently near to permit of seeing that ship might be crew be english awaited at lee gangway on stepping up out of boat raised hat in due form salute very gracefully returned well young gentleman said what craft have here pray where be bound to told briefly what be so on in reply to question gave short account of way in vigilant have come into hand at seemed much interested well said when have finished story must say be sorry be not french for must then have have opportunity of making prize of sort even though must have be very small fry anything will be fish come to net now have be knocking about here for nearly month never sign of frenchman have seen during whole time indeed said have be unlucky hope luck have now changed at last though can not make prize of think can put on track of one ah do indeed come be great deal better said in very different tone from have characterised conversation hitherto dear boy pray let have news without further ado accordingly described to meeting with le narcisse mentioned captain alphonse latour enthusiastic patriotic determination to await on spot approach of accursed english concluding story by giving exact latitude longitude of place where meeting with le narcisse took place when have given particular rose to take leave good bye said accept through thanks of captain lacey officer whole ship company of diamond ' for very valuable information have afforded only hope monsieur latour be sincere in resolve will not keep waiting very long pleasant passage to hope prize will get safely in lucky young dog be mistake good bye returned wish speedy pleasant meeting with monsieur latour with shake of hand parted poor fellow little knew what lay before diamond actually found le narcisse cruising about spot have indicated one of shot of frenchman first broadside took head off four day afterwards anchored at gibraltar just in time to hear evening gun having be favoured during entire passage with wind permitted to lay course with thread of canvas drawing to utmost chapter twenty two in bay of biscay ho instruction be to see admiral without delay of single moment must happen to arrive at hour when worthy chief might be reasonably supposed to be out of bed accordingly have boat lowered proceeded to shore instant that anchor be let go when reached admiral house found busy at entertainment of party of sodger officer from garrison be shown into private room in few minute gallant old veteran stumped in on wooden leg saluted with well youngster whose cat be dead now be aware that very strongly object to be troubled after business hour unless matter happens to be one of very great importance must apologise for intruding upon at so late hour sir replied instruction be must not lose moment in placing in hand despatch from lord hood of have honour to be bearer have honour despatch from lord hood d exclaimed do mean to say that have charge of despatch boat signalled evening do sir certainly rather resentfully replied somewhat contemptuous emphasis laid on word slightly nettled what in name of um um what be name pray young gentleman said ralph chester midshipman of frigate juno ' at service sir replied ralph chester eh of juno ah um let see um name seems familiar to where did hear before must have heard before somewhere never make mistake about name never where did hear before eh youngster be quite impossible for to say sir replied only way in officer in high position be likely to become acquainted with name of obscure midshipman be seems to through gazette gazette gazette oh ay to be sure yes yes certainly be juno ' captain hood of course be lad who distinguished so conspicuously at storming of convention redoubt be named in despatch in connection with affair sir modestly replied then congratulate most heartily boy said shaking hand with vigorously changing hitherto gruff somewhat churlish demeanour for one of almost paternal cordiality have have made whole service debtor that night by helping skipper to get into breach before red coat rascal like to top officer over claim to be more useful arm of service gave pull on night boy mistake poor dundas how awfully disgusted must have felt sit down let see despatch can talk afterwards produced box handed to letter from lord hood be addressed to hastily tore open envelope soon ran over few line formed content of letter ca do exclaimed testily crumpling up letter in hand have single frigate at disposal not even corvette despatch boat nothing in fact own barge sheer impossibility so there be end of why in name of be ridiculous must not send one of own frigate so that confounded despatch might have gone straight on much more sensible than to send here in little hooker be not fit to cross bay of biscay why be not fit eh what be matter with there be nothing matter with sir nothing replied be only idea of lord hood that be unfit to cross bay doubt appears to mere boat compared with victory must have hesitation about taking across bay across atlantic for matter ah be that case quickly returned um um be possible way out of difficulty look here have few red coat in other room spending evening with will be very glad to have pleasure of company for remainder of evening if will join young gentleman can give bed here to morrow will go on board little hooker of yours with see for whether seems fit to make trip to england accordingly adjourned to dining room where found dozen so of military men seated round table discussing wine cigar chatting over event of war bewailing own ill luck in being shut up in gibraltar instead of sharing in misery glory of field be introduced by admiral to guest a one fresh from seat of operation in corsica be welcomed cordially freely plied with question of kind to of by bye found rather difficult to reply without exciting feeling of jealousy in breast of red coat fortunately however evening passed without occurrence of incident of disagreeable character at late more strictly speaking at early hour next morning turned in so thoroughly tired that felt scarcely able to remain awake until have undressed about knock sounded at door voice announced in tone struck a being somewhat tremulous with suppressed laughter shaving water sir now may a well confess that at particular period of life one subject upon above others be most sensitive be shaving shaved with most scrupulous regularity morning be done furtively so far at least a elder be concerned in presence of fellow mids act be performed openly with due ceremony solemnity mids on board juno shaved have noticed upon more than one occasion that reference in hearing of elder to punctuality with performed duty be invariably received by with silence more eloquent than word with expression of ironical incredulity must only be adequately atoned for by shedding of heart blood therefore have ceased to refer to subject mention of be invariably followed by much annoyance hence preternatural sensitiveness caused to suspect rather than to absolutely detect quiver of suppressed laughter in voice of man who on morning awoke with announcement of shaving water sir temporary irritation arising out of painful humiliating suspicion have one good result however effectually awoke enabled to promptly turn out while for late hour of previous night might otherwise have caused to doze off again so become guilty of quite unpardonable offence of keeping admiral waiting a be be dressed down in breakfast room so promptly that admiral rather kept waiting be quite different matter by eleven o'clock however be on board vigilant after going carefully through over craft accompanied by tom hardy carpenter mate old boy came to conclusion that be strong enough to go round world if required that therefore need have hesitation about ordering to proceed to england forthwith must however said take upon to detain until evening by time must have ready despatch of own wished to forward utilised time by filling up provision water task be left to superintendence of tom hardy while smellie have scramble through gun gallery to telegraph station at summit of rock just a sunset gun boomed out on evening air weighed stood out of bay with light north easterly breeze passing tarifa point shortly before midnight by breakfast time on morning one following be abreast of cape saint vincent eighteen hour later made rock of lisbon on fifth day out from gibraltar finding in latitude of cape finisterre hauled up to northward eastward for ushant entered bay of biscay so far have gone well have be favoured with fine weather wind while somewhat inclined to be light variable have still allowed to lay course have really made very fair passage up to point have scarcely entered notorious bay of biscay when aspect of affair began to change first omen of evil revealed in steadily rather rapidly falling barometer wind for previous twenty four hour have be moderate steady at about east toward evening became fitful now dying away until roll of ship caused canvas to flap heavily against mast anon freshening up again for few minute quite to seven knot breeze then must drop once more nothing must be heard heavy flap of canvas creak of spar swish of water a lapped in over bulwark craft rolling gunwale under low weird moaning of pent up wind teemed to be imprisoned in heavy cloud bank rapidly piling up on north western horizon sky have be clear day became overspread with canopy of dirty lead coloured vapour between soon appeared small ragged patch of fast flying moaning sound became louder more weird dismal in tone while sea surface curiously agitated by wave leaped up subsided without apparent cause grew black a ink fortunately have ample unmistakable notice of impending change fully availed ourselves of by making possible preparation for expected gale adopting possible precaution for safety of craft first act be to take in secure lofty lateen canvas by getting yard down on deck firmly lashing there then set storm jib leg of mutton mizzen just to steady craft place under command when breeze must come done divided crew into two party one of under gunner mate secured gun with extra breechings while other under hardy battened down everything put extra lashing upon boom boat be ready in excellent time preparation being complete good half hour before breeze came at length about time of sunset sudden break appeared in mass of cloud piled up to north westward revealing long narrow strip of fiery copper coloured sky at same instant wind have hitherto blown in fitful gust died completely away here come be exclamation issued simultaneously from dozen throat a eye of more watchful caught glare of tawny streak of sky away on port beam even a spoke roar of wind became apparent far away on verge of horizon caught glimpse of whitening water a be lashed into foam by first mad fury of approaching squall port helm hard over with exclaimed stand by to brail up mizzen if fails to pay off have at wheel one of best helmsman on board cool smart active topman almost before word be out of mouth sent wheel spinning hard over with single jerk of muscular arm while hardy mustered three four hand at mizzen brail squall however furious a be at commencement have spent greatest strength before reached when struck vigilant came with merely sufficient force to lay down to bearing for moment when gathered way answering helm at once paid off before began to surge away to leeward at rate of about six knot squall proved to be merely precursor of strong steady gale from north west a soon a became sufficiently apparent hauled wind once more hove craft to on larboard tack under jib mizzen arrangement while promised to be best must be made for safety of ship own comfort also enabled to drift along at rate of about three knot hour on proper course found that under short canvas little vigilant with flat beamy build sharp line flaring bow laid to admirably riding a lightly almost a dry a seagull over mountainous sea rapidly got up under influence of gale remained on deck long enough to thoroughly satisfy upon point then leaving deck in charge of hardy who have watch with one man to tend wheel two others on lookout sent remainder of hand below to get good meal with plenty of strong hot coffee while little smellie sat down to own almost equally humble spread in small cosy cabin change from cold wet sloppy deck with accompaniment of darkness driving spray frequent rain squall to dry warm comfort of cabin lighted up with brilliant ray of single handsome swinging carpeted floor well cushioned locker be agreeable in extreme sound of gale a roared overhead shrieked through rigging patter drip of rain on deck occasional heavy swish of drenching spray shower served to increase feeling of comfort enjoyed spent time after table be cleared in consulting chart interspersed with frequent reference to book of sailing direction when tired of book apiece served to wile away time until midnight when smellie have to turn out once more take charge of deck a eight stroke upon bell proclaimed expiration of first watch donned oilskin repaired to deck in company wind have be steadily increasing from commencement of gale be now blowing so heavily that time vigilant rose upon crest of sea careened almost gunwale to even with scanty shred of canvas under be hove to sea moreover have increased with a great rapidity a wind be now running tremendously high breaking from time to time in manner made somewhat uneasy still little craft be behaving beautifully making excellent weather of not drop of anything heavier than spray having come on board so far night be a dark a wolf mouth there being moon sky remaining obscured by impenetrable canopy of heavy black cloud vapour be darkest about horizon against phosphorescent wave crest reared portentously in startling relief intense darkness be greatest source of anxiety for be directly in track of outward bound ship wind be blowing from quarter while not exactly fair be sufficiently free to enable to keep going that too at speed must send ship of size right over almost without crew knowing anything about have of course light in place brightly burning be so frequently hidden in trough of sea that very bright lookout must be needed to discover in time to avoid collision be then a be now thing most dread at sea excepting fire seems needle to say that bright lookout be kept on board vigilant night man on cat head two in waist one on weather one on lee side two self aft be kept constantly on alert with precaution be obliged to rest satisfied a happened elaborate precaution proved unnecessary for not single sail passed during night at four o'clock next morning when watch be relieved went below turned in a sky appeared to be lightening up trifle knew that must be daylight in short time when went on deck again at seven bell be thing looked pretty much a have left excepting that sea have continued to get up be now running higher than have ever seen before little craft be tossed about on angry surface lightly a withered leaf now rising up a though about to take flight into midst of rushing storm wrack overhead anon plunging down steep side of watery hill a though intent on reaching very ocean bed be very exciting a well must be confessed a somewhat trying to nerve to stand on deck watch approach of mountainous sea rushing with threatening upreared crest upon little craft a though determined to engulf by watchful attention to helm bow always met at safe angle away must sweep past harmless hissing seething in impotent fury according to custom tom hardy have charge of deck while smellie be below at breakfast on returning to deck at conclusion of meal joined to remark that be under impression have once twice heard sound of firing to windward surely not said little smellie must be mistaken mr hardy always mistered tom to intense gratification now that have charge of watch what ship must possibly fight in weather depends on course happen to be steering sir responded tom be poorish weather for fight will allow if one ship happens to be chasing t'other be running before bow stern chaser might be worked heavy a sea be besides look deal worse to afloat here in cock boat than 'twould if be aboard old juno ' for instance a'ter hark did hear anything just then gentleman boom of gun muffled by roar of gale still heard with sufficient distinctness to render sound unmistakable at moment broke upon ear pulled out watch noted time now listen for next report exclaimed perhaps be ship in distress be immediately evident that must be nothing of sort for even a spoke report came floating down upon wing of gale then two others in quick succession tom hardy sprang into main rigging going aloft a far a short mast must permit stood for nearly minute swaying about with roll pitch of vessel eye shaded by one hand gazing eagerly to windward here come hailed one a'ter two frigate seemin'ly one on be frenchman over chap be leadin ' t'other of course one of ship how be steering hailed straight for a ever can come sir replied tom a nimbly descended rigging again swung off low rail to deck ten minute afterwards upper spar of leading ship be in sight from deck when rose upon crest of sea in five minute craft be visible firing continued briskly on side rapidly increasing distinctness of report testifying to speed with chase be hurrying along from moment that frigate became visible from deck telescope remained glued to eye so to speak be not long before be able to distinguish that be flying colour leading ship showing tricolour other white ensign say chester exclaimed little smellie what lark ca have flying shot at johnnie a go past who know perhaps might knock away one of spar so help own craft to get alongside eye ai carrying on too topgallant s'ls stunsails on side what strain upon spar rigging cut away brace backstay now aboard that frenchman away must go whole heap of canvas what splendid craft be be true saying if ever there be one that french know how to build ship english how to sail ' what do say chester will have shot at a go by have whole broadside poured into by way of saying thankee dryly remarked hardy doubt whether have broadside gun cleared away yet remarked even if have be very small target to fire at feel half inclined to take shot at if get good chance at event may clear away long nine load can then be governed by circumstance sooner said than done men set to work with glee of parcel of school boy intent upon piece of mischief in very short time long nine pounder mounted amidships be ready for service loaded in meantime pursuer pursued continued rapid flight down before wind ship staggering along under press of canvas clearly indicated alarm of one determination of other a stood watching in breathless interest weather cleared somewhat dense canopy of cloud have obscured heaven for many hour broke up into rift permitted occasional watery gleam of sunshine to penetrate through light up scene glancing in streak patch here there upon mountain surge changing dull leaden hue into dirty green shimmering for moment upon snowy canvas bright copper of one other of frigate only to fade away next instant leave picture a be before dull lifeless grey by time that french ship have approached to within mile of became evident that if continued on respective course without alteration in speed must pas within perilous proximity of other vigilant fore sheet be therefore let draw helm righted so that might forge ahead cross flying craft at safe distance be yawing about most frightfully sheering first to port then to starboard in manner seemed moment to threaten that must broach to must such accident occur in then condition of weather total dismasting of ship must be least calamity must reasonably be expected to follow while be far more probable that must either capsize founder stern foremost steering of english ship be in marked contrast to though also sheered about to certain extent still be so trifling in comparison with of frenchman that appeared to a though englishman be gaining upon chase more by superior helmsmanship than by possession of advantage over in point of actual speed a french frigate continued to sweep down towards became exceedingly anxious for now seemed a though have delayed trifle too long act of filling away upon vigilant at low rate of speed must be unable to draw out of immediate path ship now distant not more than mile came surging on with broad expanse of canvas fully distended by following gale straining at stout spar tough hemp rigging a though must tear very mast out of hull come flying down to leeward like cobweb before summer breeze a though when ship rose upon ridge of sea lifting fore foot forty foot of keel clear out of water must take flight leaving sea altogether soar away upon canvas pinion like startled sea fowl be rolling heavily so much so indeed that more than once saw dip stunsail boom end alternately on port starboard side into water at length a rose to crest of one mountainous sea have completely hidden french ship from up to very royal mast head saw surging madly forward upon breast of one followed hissing foam crest pursued rearing high threateningly above taffrail while ship with port gunwale deep buried in water be taking desperate uncontrollable sheer to starboard saw in moment must hurl crashing into little vigilant somewhere about mainmast cry something between yell shriek of horror dismay burst simultaneously from lip of crew a awful danger burst upon in momentary panic general rush be made by hand to part of vessel appeared likely to receive annihilating blow with intention of making spring for life at frigate bowsprit headgear even helmsman be so infected by sight abandoning wheel too joined in rush there be time for remonstrance smellie be standing near companion at moment watching approach of frenchman a rush took place seized by arm shouting in ear cut mizzen sheet sprang to wheel with frantic energy whirled hard up by greatest good luck helmsman have already put wheel spoke two over a crest of sea swept under so that be actually paying off at moment took wheel fact combined with additional amount of helm gave lightning like rapidity with little smellie whipped out keen pocket knife drew across straining strand of mizzen sheet saved vigilant mizzen flogged to ribbon in moment while foresail paid bow broad off filling powerfully at same time dragged clear by bare skin of teeth frigate rushed foaming past stern so closely that surge from port bow dashed in over taffrail leach of lower stunsail catching head of mizzen mast buckled spar until port shroud parted when luckily for crack went stunsail boom lower fore topmast stunsail began to thrash about so wildly that promised to give crew hand full to get in sail without injury to of men passing other in such disagreeably close proximity have of course perfect view of french frigate most superb craft certainly be bran new ship to appearance seemed to have be at sea scarcely long enough to wash varnish off teak mahogany deck fitting plank of deck be almost snow white little taste trouble appeared to have be expended in successful effort to

jumped upon hammock rail have separate say to whether be word of caution of congratulation at escape from being run down of objurgation be quite impossible to tell from threatening character of action judged to be latter there be only one calm individual among whole be first lieutenant stood by mizzen rigging on port side clinging to belaying pin vouchsafed not so much a passing glance whole attention being given to spar rigging on kept eye anxiously fixed skipper on other hand seemed to be more excited than one else when eye lighted upon be grasping poop rail with right hand shaking left fist at just then eye met when to surprise disgust turned to marine near pointed at at same time apparently giving man order fellow raised piece fired next instant felt violent blow accompanied by sharp burning pain in left arm dropped helplessly at side broken between elbow shoulder passed in single moment of time next instant be vividly recalled to sense of own danger a rose upon next wave port quarter be exposed to advancing crest there be only time to shout to hand to hold on for life before came hissing up arching over quite six foot above low bulwark tumbled on board regular comber filling to gunwale bursting in companion door flooding cabin smashing one of boat to atom washing away everything be not securely lashed by something approaching miracle none of men be swept overboard a soon a have ascertained by hasty glance round deck directly got head above water gave order for fore lug to be loosed set men wanted second bidding knew that if got pooped second time must be over with in incredibly short space of time have sail set be bowling away to leeward after frenchman position be now very much reverse of enviable one a being compelled for safety sake to run dead before be exactly in line of fire between two ship continued to bang away at other from time to time quite regardless of possible consequence to shot came hissing past over so closely that be manifestly imperative upon to shift berth without loss of time giving order therefore that spare mizzen must be bent set craft brought to once more on starboard tack time so a to afford opportunity to knot shroud on larboard side carried away by french frigate left little smellie tom hardy on deck to see to execution summoning assistant surgeon to aid retired below to have wounded arm coopered up friend sawbones have just arrived at stage of operation required to torture almost beyond power of endurance by grinding two broken bone end together to get in proper position when felt violent concussion accompanied by loud explosion on deck speedily followed by vociferous cheering next moment down trundled that young scamp smellie face beaming over with broad grin a exclaimed hurrah chester have done did hardy will tell so did what for goodness ' sake groaned a medico under influence of terrific roll gave arm most awful wrench what did fire for fired at frenchman of course replied somewhat disconcerted understood that agreed must have shot at so gave one from long tom pointed gun only fancy knocked away mizzen topmast brought down main topgallant mast with there be now in pretty mess eye be close one added a twelve pound shot sung close over head without hitting anything however sound remarkably a though be anxious to return compliment if can said have better go on deck again hurry men up with mizzen round to a soon a possibly can if one of shot happen to plump on board will probably have cause to remember circumstance lad darted up companion way again three stair at time very shortly afterwards heard shout down to say chester mizzen be bent ready for setting will hoist away watch for good opportunity shouted back a soon a come down with helm sway up sail at same time ay ay will do so be response few minute elapsed then felt little craft rising up up up until seemed a though be about to turn summersault with there be thud at stern heavy swish of water on deck a crest of sea struck broke over taffrail then tom hardy voice exclaimed now now be time sir jam helm hard port dick hard over with man be sort now sway away upon here mizzen halliard down with fore lug ease up fore sheet there for'ard up with mizzen lad bowse well up be well belay haul fore sheet over to wind'ard make fast there be capital now let see what can do to here shroud from of altered character of little craft motion learned that ticklish manoeuvre of rounding to have be safely executed quarter of hour afterwards medico finished off be able with hardy assistance to go on deck again take look round before turning into hammock to nurse wounded arm be now hove to upon starboard tack with head to southward english frigate have passed be by time two mile to leeward on port quarter frenchman still leading though have lost ground considerably seemed yet to be in thick of trouble with wreck of spar bow stern chaser of two ship be still playing merrily away without very marked result a far a must see shortly afterwards lost sight of ship in thick weather to leeward saw more of be not long in getting larboard mizzen shroud knotted set up afresh a soon a be done watched chance wore round once more with head to northward remaining on deck to watch operation after be glad to get into hammock seek relief to wounded fin chapter twenty three french frigate gale lasted through night next day moderating about sun down however sufficiently to allow of setting fore main lug close reefed keeping away upon course wind continued to drop after through night sea also going down rapidly next day be able to shift canvas setting lateen in place of lug after bowled gaily along without further adventure passing ushant on evening of fourth day after gale have blown out arriving at spithead somewhat within next forty eight hour anchor let go smellie jumped into gig taking despatch box with pulled ashore landing at sally port from thence proceeded first to admiral office afterwards to george in high street where ordered post chaise then pair of sat down to hastily prepared dinner while carriage be in process of fitting out in consequence of representation to admiral have ordered vigilant into harbour immediately to refit make good slight damage inflicted on during gale in bay of biscay when post chaise be announced smellie only remained long enough to see fairly under way when returned on board to take little hooker into harbour superintend operation of refitting be not quite six pm when shoved off from before door of george dashed away up high street soon afterwards chaise be bowling along at spanking pace over dry white dusty road in open country landscape flooded in lovely golden haze of fine summer evening air heavy with perfume of flower sweet health giving smell of rich pasture land long chestnut avenue thick pine plantation mingled odour of country so different from strong smell of sea breeze sight of slanting sunbeam glancing through bole branch of venerable tree dotted here there in clump along roadside of verdant hedge with rich cluster of delicate dog rose trailing honeysuckle wild convolvulus of group of sleek cattle feeding in field contemplatively chewing cud under shade of over hanging tree browsing along roadside of knot of rosy sun tanned child playing about village road on green turning to stand open mouthed stare at chaise a dashed past of pretty cottage nestling in bower of greenery with tiny flower garden in front thin wreath of blue smoke curling up from chimney into still evening air of picturesque village with ancient church spire pointing heavenward of stately country seat of gentry surrounded by noble tree growth of century deer clustered beneath umbrageous branch with spacious flower terrace long avenue of lime arching chestnut venerable oak reaching from house to distant road terminating in snug little ivy covered lodge heavy ornamental iron gate with massive stone pier moss grown surmounted by time worn weather stained stone sculpture of arm of family drowsy chime of church clock barking of dog lowing of cattle voice of herdsman field labourer singing a wended weary way homeward after labour heat of day sound softened mellowed by distance combined to render journey one of most pleasant enjoyable have ever undertaken notwithstanding pain discomfort experienced from wounded arm evening passed on lovely silent twilight insensibly deepened into night star twinkled forth one by one in pure clear deepening blue overhead road gradually widened house along side became more more frequent atmosphere thickened horizon ahead grew luminous light appeared rapidly increased in number soon be glancing on side of dull heavy roar became audible finally a church clock be striking hour of midnight chaise pulled up before door of uncle house in saint james square have arrived in town a post boy let down step threw open carriage door for to alight must see through fanlight over door

evening at dinner said reminded of young day to be down there once more completely unbent from usual stateliness so that spent most delightful evening turning in about midnight awoke early next morning having roused out second in command walked down to dockyard to hurry people up with new boat be just finishing off returned to hotel to breakfast at eight o'clock by ten be having completed business on shore once more chartered wherry went on board uncle accompanying on reaching vigilant found that new boat have be delivered be hoisted in dockyard gang be clear of ship everything be

wherry have be towing astern to be hauled alongside vigilant be hove to uncle shook hand with little smellie slipped five pound note into hand of chip carpenter mate for crew to drink health then taking hasty most affectionate leave of hurried over side into wherry seized yoke line bade boatman make sail for portsmouth harbour at once filled away again two hour afterwards passed through needle nothing worthy of note occurred until be half way across bay of biscay when about four bell in forenoon watch of most delightful day with moderate breeze from westward very long swell sea lookout man aloft reported sail broad on lee bow be in cabin at time reading what doe look like inquired smellie who have watch can only see head of fore main topgallantsails replied man believe be frigate sir smellie came to open skylight spoke down through say chester if be not troubling too much will hand up glass please be in becket just inside door of berth here be strange sail to leeward want to take squint at found telescope carried on deck master harold slung over shoulder in minute be perched on long tapering yard of lateen mainsail what do make out to be hailed after have given careful overhauling for three four minute frigate without doubt replied glass still levelled at can see mizzen royal mast with yard across sail be not large enough for line of battle ship have have hove in stay round come smartly too why be setting royal surely ca be coming after a like a not returned if can see can see a craft of rig be rather unusual sight just about here be not improbable that skipper may wish to learn little more about what be english french think believe be french be reply have good look at canvas a hove about appeared to to be decidedly frenchified in shape be already hugging wind a closely a be possible have possible inch of canvas spread so must hing stand on a be going await course of event sail rose rapidly above horizon for first hour so after a brought more on quarter began to sink again when about abeam of stranger hoisted tricolour at gaff end fired gun showed signal from main royal mast head of must make nothing however hoisted french flag also left to make best must of after first signal have be flying time be hauled down substituted with better luck than before be soon hauled down be after for guinea said ay ay nae doot o ' quoth old quarter master will catch gait be ganging noo be oor ain weather wad like brawly to see freegate can beat wi ' nae mair wind than yon frenchman wad gie hantle o ' siller to see breeze freshen will no do yet awhile frigate stood on until be well upon weather quarter by time head of topgallantsails be just visible from deck when to remove doubt might have remained a to intention once more hove in stay stood after went below looked anxiously at barometer be perfectly steady then returned to deck keenly scrutinised sky be covered with patch of thin fleecy cloud allowed sun to show through with broad patch of clear blue sky between breeze be just fresh enough to curl top of wavelet over in tiny fleck of foam to heel vigilant until lee covering board be just awash with clear sparkling water occasionally welling up through lee scupper be indeed a old sandy have remarked weather in little vigilant stepped out to greatest advantage have very little fear of square rigged vessel being able to overhaul so long a matter remained in statu quo knew that be sailing good couple of point nearer wind than be frenchman astern believed be going through water nearly if not quite a fast a be by two bell in afternoon watch craft have dropped to leeward until be couple of point on lee quarter have certainly risen little for by standing on weather rail must see head of topsail matter remained in pretty much same state for rest of day excepting that pursuer gradually tagged away farther farther to leeward until be broad upon lee quarter toward sun down however breeze began to freshen pertinacious companion soon showed how great advantage be to by way in drew up on lee beam when went below to tea found that barometer have fallen little by time have finished meal regained deck be jerking through short choppy head sea with lee bulwark buried in foam hissed past side fore deck drenched with continuous heavy shower of spray flew in over weather bow long yard swaying bending a though have be fishing rod with lively salmon at end of line began to feel rather anxious for sea freshening breeze have knocked up be very detrimental to speed while upon frigate owing to vastly superior power have little effect night at length fell there be moon star be partially obscured by patch of cloud covered sky began to hope be going to have dark night under cover of might give pursuer slip a darkness closed down upon just before vanished in gloom took bearing with greatest accuracy have by time crept up to within couple of point abaft lee beam from deck upper half of topsail be visible allowed hour to elapse then tried to find with night glass to great disappointment did so without much difficulty what be worse be fast drawing up abreast of be by time a dark a be likely to be so resolved to heave about at once in hope that might execute manoeuvre undetected so give frenchman slip accordingly tacked a soon a be fairly round sheet etcetera coiled down have look for presently small dark patch swam into view a carefully swept horizon at point where knew to be to disappointment showed much shorter than before also have tacked umph muttered night glass be a good a own apparently began to see french prison looming in distance for from rapidity with have tacked manner in notwithstanding superior weatherliness be overhauling knew that pursuer must be exceedingly smart ship skipper be acting like man who have wit about light be of course most carefully masked tarpaulin being thrown over cabin skylight seaman jacket over binnacle helmsman steering by star stood on thus for about couple of hour after tacking be seriously debating in mind possibility of giving frenchman slip by lowering away canvas then running to leeward under bare pole eye resting abstractedly upon brilliant planet broad upon weather bow be just on point of dipping below horizon when suddenly said planet vanished took notice of until a suddenly reappeared in space of few second sail by be complicating ejaculated sail where away sir exclaimed hardy who be standing between helmsman just to southward of bright planet on horizon broad on larboard bow said a levelled glass ah there be frigate by look of hull up too phew whistled hardy be rather awk'ard may pick out minute perhaps be english sir often see two french ship so close together a here can see pretty plain sir not very replied fancy there be english look about let take squint at sir handed over glass took good long look at suddenly handed glass back to be english sir will take oath of exclaimed be amethyst be what be know by way fore topmast topgallant mast be looking over bow there ai ship afloat a have got kink in foremast a amethyst be sir a sure a be tom hardy be quite certain inquired speak rashly because consequence may prove serious to if be positive about matter will signal turn table upon friend astern let take look sir handed over glass took long look at fire away with lantern sir a soon a like said will stake liberty that yon craft be none other than amethyst be twenty eight skipper be man enough to give good account of johnny will be bound then rouse out lantern let make private signal said instead of hoisting at peak where frenchman will see perhaps suspect something haul staysail down get block well up on fore stay will run up there sail will then hide from craft astern so said so done showed private signal in le than minute be properly answered upon telegraphed news that french frigate be about ten mile astern in chase of signal be duly acknowledged immediately afterwards amethyst for be bore up now looked for french frigate to see if must observe anything to show that have seen english frigate signal lantern be still carrying on upon same tack a judged that amethyst be about seventeen mile apart hoped that light have escaped notice in about twenty minute amethyst passed mile to windward apparently steering course must run slap on board frenchman in half hour there be not light to be seen anywhere about for knew that crew be wide awake busy be running down under course topsail spanker jib topgallant yard down upon cap with sail clewed up not furled royal stowed now will see fun shortly exclaimed smellie in high glee having got inkling that something out of common be toward in mysterious way in people do learn such thing on board small ship have accordingly come on deck be mistaken for once if by term fun meant frigate action for old clewline skipper of amethyst be too seasoned hand to do anything rashly ran down ship a dark a grave until have attained position about two mile dead to windward of pursuer when hauled up showed private signal at gaff end french frigate immediately edged away about four point showed lantern be not reply to amethyst signal so clewline tried to make quite sure of avoiding mistake be not answered at on contrary frenchman hauled down lantern wore short round crowding sail at same moment whereupon amethyst also bore up again clewline must have have men aloft time ready for emergency a squared away in chase saw stunsails fluttering out to boom end on side then tacked resumed original course once more heartily thankful for escape chuckling mightily at thought of trap johnny crapaud have run nose into in le than hour afterwards lost sight of ship reached gibraltar without further incident failing there to obtain intelligence a to lord hood whereabouts filled up water sailed again for malta same evening have splendid perfectly uneventful run from rock westerly wind fine weather prevailing

proportion than of juno line be a fine a have be possible to make joiner be still busily at work upon captain cabin gun room everything be in state of indescribable litter confusion saw enough to satisfy that new ship be a fine craft of class a ever slid off stock looked forward to happy stirring life on board having taken good look round in part shaken hand with little smellie made acquaintance of new mid little shrimp of fellow named fisher uncle started for home again on day one following sir peregrine trundled up to town to see about outfit a there be several thing must require on west india station have not be necessary in mediterranean on return found skipper comfortably domiciled in former quarter thing said be going on so satisfactorily at portsmouth that have felt hesitation about leaving everything to mr flinn accepting invitation father have pressed upon on occasion of first visit to spend christmas at rectory to indulge in unwonted luxury of thorough rest father be always busy with parish work sir peregrine gout precluded possibility of taking much outdoor exercise so duty of entertaining guest devolved almost wholly upon girl must say that effort in direction appeared to be crowned with signal success have spin after hound once twice did little shooting superior officer appeared to enjoy skating party most when frost must allow to indulge in pastime must not help noticing how regularly seemed to separate into two party skipper invariably pairing off with florrie leaving amy to care pilotage at length letter came from mr flinn to say that ship be ataunto must in eight forty hour be quite ready for sea arrived while be at breakfast a announced content intimated that must be off forthwith saw sister florence go pale to lip for moment then flush up a though blood must burst through delicate skin news threw complete damper upon previously merry party meal be finished in almost perfect silence at length father returned thanks rose to retire to study a did so captain annesley also rose said something to in low tone seemed to to be request for few moment private conversation father bowed led way to library with skipper following close in wake be closeted together nearly hour when man o ' war rejoined first thing did be to carry florrie off to conservatory mother be a usual at hour busy in own snuggery with cook so that amy found left alone in drawing room sir peregrine having retired to terrace for morning smoke began by time to see pretty clearly what be in wind so when amy proposed must accompany a far a old mr jones cottage assented with effusion returned just in time to sit down to luncheon when took place at table florrie look of mingled joy sadness sparkling diamond upon engaged finger elated look upon skipper handsome face told have before only shrewdly suspected immediately after luncheon carriage be brought round trap tumbled on board skipper started for portsmouth after most affecting leave taking round poor florrie bore up bravely until very last moment when a annesley took hand bent over to say good bye fortitude completely deserted flinging into arm sobbed a if heart must break felt lump rise in own throat a sat unwilling witness to distress while a for annesley avast be bound on quest for honour glory so stow away tear bottle coil down tender feeling out of sight westward ho for land of yellow jack on day one following sailed from spithead in gale of wind from ene with frequent snow squall pretty much same weather in fact a have on eventful occasion of sailing in scourge looked into plymouth sound on out way assumed convoy of fleet of seventeen sail proceeded oh misery of convoy duty to feel that have smart ship underfoot crew who will shrink from nothing skipper may put alongside to be doomed to drag along day after day under close reefed topsail in order to avoid running away from sluggish deep laden merchantman with signalling gun firing going on day night restraining swift urging on slow with occasional cruise round entire fleet to keep well together everlasting anxious lookout to see that fast sailing privateer pirate sneak in pick up one of charge be almost a bad a blockading however thing come to end sooner later be looking forward to speedy release from annoyance having arrived within couple of day sail of mona passage when just after sun rise lookout aloft reported small object apparently boat about five mile distant on port bow a weather be beautifully fine with convoy bowling along under rag of canvas must spread sign of lurking picaroons in neighbourhood skipper have course altered so a to give strange object overhaul a ran rapidly down upon perceived that be indeed boat showed mast oar be unable to distinguish one on board when within mile of however lookout hailed to say thought saw people lying down in bottom few minute more doubt be removed by sight of person rising for moment into sitting position then sinking down into bottom of boat again shipwrecked crew apparently observed skipper why out oar stand by to pull alongside perhaps be lying asleep tired out with long spell of pulling already suggested mr wood second lieutenant five minute afterwards swept close past boat ahoy hailed skipper once more figure appeared for moment above boat gunwale waved hand feebly sank down again merciful heaven what sight be be thus momentarily presented to view figure be that of full grown man clad in ordinary garb of spanish seaman clothes hung about in rag feature be so shrunken that skin appeared a though strained over naked skull good god ejaculated captain annesley why be in last stage of starvation round to back main yard if please mr flinn mr chester take gig tow alongside where be doctor jumped into gig with six hand be lowered down tackle unhooked away went few stroke took alongside boat then saw sight will never forget boat seemed full of body huddled together in bottom in such way that be impossible to count a lay there stench arose be so sickening that have to hold nostril while painter be being cleared away made fast be soon alongside frigate once more doctor with assistant at once jumped down into spanish boat proceeded to examine occupant three of proved to be still alive remainder be dead rotted almost out of semblance of humanity survivor be hoisted a carefully a possible on board frigate then a best mean must think of for disposing of boat dreadful freight dozen eighteen pound shot be passed down into plank knocked out of bottom be left to sink did before frigate have sailed many yard from spot survivor be tended day with utmost care by worthy medico toward evening be enabled to announce gratifying intelligence that hoped to save next day be very much better on day following one of man whom have seen rise up in boat be strong enough to tell story will not repeat in dreadful detail of suffering suffice to say that ship homeward bound from saint iago have be attacked by piratical schooner crew of after rifling scuttling ship have turned crew adrift in one of own boat without provision water mast sail there have be drifting helplessly about ocean for to endless period of nineteen day without seeing single sail until hove in sight on fifth day after rescuing poor creature arrived at port royal where anchored while such of convoy a be bound for kingston went on up harbour have heard much respecting beauty of island of jamaica appearance from sea a have drawn in toward anchorage be such a to satisfy that attraction have not be overrated be anxious to have run ashore be therefore very glad when skipper who have business at kingston invited to go with ought to have mentioned by bye that have long ago taken into confidence with regard to engagement to florrie have done so in fact within quarter of hour of time when bade good bye so though of course be still skipper in public when happened to be by sank superior officer merged into friendly intimacy of prospective brother in law jumped into gig rowed ashore to wharf at port royal being skipper intention to take wherry for trip to kingston moment that want be made known black boatman crowded round in perfect mob extolling merit of own boat depreciating of others from word soon came to blow combatant lowering head butting at other like goat until one hercules of fellow having won by force of arm rather by superior thickness strength of woolly skull right to convey to destination be led in triumph by to boat comfortably stowed away in stern sheet sea breeze have by time set in in few minute more be tearing along five foot channel at slashing pace a spun along toward destination must not help remarking upon perfect safety from attack by enemy kingston enjoys in first place approach from outside be of so difficult character in consequence of narrowness intricacy of channel between outlying shoal reef that must be almost impossible for stranger to find way in if however must by chance get safely a far a port royal defence must assuredly stop further progress then a though be not deemed sufficient little way up harbour come to apostle battery beyond again be fort augusta altogether think never saw more strongly defended place excepting of course gibraltar in due time reached wherry wharf at kingston landed quarter of hour walk under piazza line street in lower part of town brought to mr martin store whither be bound on inquiring for be at once shown into office skipper introduced explained business be soon done then rose to leave a mr martin shook hand with said excuse gentleman have engagement for to day skipper replied that have not be strange to place proposed chartering carriage for drive into country in order that might see few of far famed beauty of island then pray allow to be pilot said new friend have really nothing particular to attend to to day will be very happy to show round if can spare so much time be going afternoon to visit sugar estate of mine few mile out of town stay night return to morrow morning after breakfast will be delighted to have pleasure of company nothing must have suited better accordingly accepted invitation forthwith set off to see what there be to be seen of town in course of peregrination met be introduced to several of host friend of whom shook hand with a though have known life forthwith gave pressing invitation to place about four o'clock returned to mr martin store where found ketureen sort of gig waiting also that of mr finnie sugar planter who be going to make one of party skipper jumped in alongside of mr martin stowed away alongside friend away dashed up sandy street out of town in direction of blue mountain reached estate house upon just in time to escape violent thunder storm accompanied by such rain a have never seen before came down literally in sheet completely obscuring everything beyond couple of dozen yard distant rattling upon thatched roof a though must beat in lasted about hour ceasing a suddenly a have commenced leaving air clear cool pure have most excellent dinner washed down by glass two of good wine capital story illustrative of life on island be told about midnight turned in for one being almost knocked up by tramp about kingston after confinement of ship next morning took walk over estate before breakfast visiting negro quarter sugar mill other building gaining thereby appetite proved most destructive to host pickled mackerel cold boiled tongue egg etcetera made clean sweep of comestible washed down with cup two of tea then started for kingston finally arriving on board astarte about noon remained at port royal two day longer during gave craft brush of paint inside out otherwise titivated up after run out from england when received order to sail upon three month cruise among windward island accordingly weighed stood out to sea with first of land breeze having cleared shoal hauled up on port tack keeping close under land to take possible advantage of land breeze in making easting by midnight be off morant point from took departure in hour be tearing along under topgallant sail upon taut bowline looking well up for island of grenada under influence of strong trade wind skipper be most anxious to thoroughly test sailing power of astarte being first time that opportunity have occurred for so doing accordingly carried on next day taxing toughness of spar to utmost limit so satisfactory be result that hand fore aft felt sanguine that must meet with very few craft able to beat either in matter of speed weatherliness astarte also proved to be very pretty sea boat though trifle wet when being driven hard then what craft be not a drew to southward trade wind hauled round trifle farther from eastward prevailing direction being about ene broke off couple of point set so much more to leeward beyond have nothing to complain of for weather continued fine breeze strong steady on evening of third day out from kingston sighted land on lee bow turned out to be south end of island of oruba off entrance to gulf of maracaybo weathered island cleverly before dark though without very much room to spare passed in between curacao making land again about six bell in middle watch on mainland time about hicacos point at eight bell in same watch tacked ship stood off shore when sun rose island of curacao appeared upon weather bow continuing upon starboard tack day hove about again at beginning of first dog watch thinking that might possibly be able to pick up stray spaniard dutchman on following afternoon about four pm land be once more made directly ahead land murmured little fisher who from diminutive stature have acquired from fellow mids sobriquet of six foot land be nothing land ho ' what land be for gracious sake to mr carter master mate who happened to be standing near rocca island answered carter master say be very likely spot in to find pirate nest just group of five twenty rock be not much larger one island about ten mile long six wide with reef shoal round did ever smell gunpowder six foot not yet answered little fisher know be only second voyage first be from london to margate eh well perhaps will have chance of smelling before long carter walked away forward little fellow flushed up crimson then went pale to lip why six foot what be matter with be not frightened be carter be only joking be said boy did know asked if felt frightened ralph know whether be fright not felt very queer know have never be in action yet think must be so dreadful to hear shot crashing in through ship side to see strong men struck down maimed bleeding perhaps killed outright have horrible feeling that when see thing for first time will turn sick faint perhaps misbehave in way must act like coward for world father be very proud man think must ever forgive for bringing such disgrace on name must understand poor little fellow feeling perfectly thought for have not experienced something of same kind cheered up a well a must telling that whenever time came felt sure must behave perfectly well that with firing of first shot trace of peculiar unpleasant sensation of spoke must pas completely away be still talking with when skipper steward came up to with invitation for to dinner in cabin subject be accordingly dropped hurried away to dress be just finishing soup when mr vining third lieutenant came down to say that two ship have just rounded southernmost end of large island be working way in among shoal towards small willow bay on north western side what do look like mr vining queried skipper one be full rigged ship apparently of about six hundred ton other be low wicked looking brigantine sir very loftily rigged with immense spread of canvas um said skipper just keep sharp eye upon if please mr vining see what can make of will be on deck shortly second lieutenant withdrew hurried on with meal by time that have finished be on deck once more sun have set short twilight of tropic be upon island mere rock a carter have said forming western extremity of group be already on lee beam nearest of being about three mile distant while others stretched away to leeward of right away to horizon even beyond key grande largest of group lay right ahead distant about fifteen mile while el roque island lay broad upon weather bow about five mile distant lookout aloft reported two strange sail to be just anchoring have stayed below trifle too long be afraid said skipper will have darkness upon in ten minute mr chester kindly slip up to topsail yard see what can make out about stranger if please will come with ralph boy said mr flinn four eye be better than two a see that skipper mean to give overhaul be a well that must learn can about beforehand accordingly shinned up ratline together be soon comfortably settled on fore topsail yard remained there until brief twilight have so far faded that be impossible to make out more than general outline of ship then descended made report said report amounted to brigantine have quite made up mind be privateer pirate of what nationality if former be not quite clear ship took to be spaniard of about five hundred ton water be breaking so confusedly among over reef ahead of that felt very doubtful whether boat much le ship must find way through be of opinion that there be narrow belt of clear water close to shore mr martin master have meanwhile brought up chart spread open upon capstan head moment that looked at compared with what saw around became evident that be by mean to be relied upon so far at least a particular spot be concerned 'bout ship at once if please mr flinn said skipper will go nearer on side at event half like being so close a be now will furl topgallant sail take down reef in topsail also be done reef now lay astern of key grande bore well upon starboard quarter el roque be ahead of trifle upon weather bow keep away point quarter master give island ahead wide berth said skipper ay ay sir answered gimbal thought voice sounded strange melancholy in deepening gloom be now standing to northward about n by w under single reefed topsail be going about nine knot spot be in being sheltered by island shoal to windward water consequently smooth in about hour time however frigate passed out from under lee of el roque be once more tearing thrashing through short head sea sky to leeward still aglow with fading splendour marked path of departed sun strongly tinged water in wake with tint of purest amber ruby against wave crest leaped up black a ink while ocean everywhere else showed dark indigo hue overhead in darkening ether star be twinkling out one by one away to windward sky already nearly a dark a must be that night be thickly powdered with million glittering point continued upon starboard tack until two bell in first watch when skipper being of opinion that have made sufficient offing to go to windward of everything tacked ship stood to southward eastward again be by time quite dark although starlight knew that if stranger inside have kept watch upon must have seen still standing off land a long a be possible to see anything at being case hoped must jump to conclusion that have seen last of for night at least think more about by six bell be dead to windward of eastern end of el roque about ten mile from when edged away couple of point getting good pull upon weather brace went rolling plunging down past weather side of key grande giving land wide berth however stationing extra lookout keenest eyed men in ship to watch for sign of broken water two hour after bearing up be off south east angle of island when wore ship shortening sail to close reefed topsail jib spanker dodged quietly in toward land under lee of soon found couple of leadsmen be sent into chain lead kept constantly going found there be plenty of water so stood on until got into eight fathom when being completely sheltered let go anchor stowed canvas be by time about two o'clock be boat have be prepared long before nothing now remained to lower away unhook be off a soon a sail be furled captain annesley went below to cabin immediately sent for mr flinn mr vining mr martin trundled down one after other found chief bending anxiously over chart be lying spread open upon cabin table pray be seated gentleman said draw chair up to table will all be able to follow upon chart here be where be making pencil dot on chart to indicate position of frigate here a nearly a possible be where ship brigantine be lying cross serving to indicate position now feel to be in position of little difficulty have very little doubt in own mind that two ship belong to enemy be not sure of to attack vessel belonging to friendly power must be most deplorable accident on other hand if wait until daylight before doing anything run risk of losing good many of men for must not feel justified in taking frigate into midst of so many unknown danger attack with boat in broad daylight must give ample time to make preparation for giving hot reception be inclined to think that crew of two craft will have expectation of hearing from to night have therefore determined to send in boat to reconnoitre mr flinn will have charge of expedition will take launch mr vining will take first cutter mr martin second while mr chester in gig must go ahead endeavour to steal alongside strange craft without giving alarm find out nationality while lie off at distance return to with report if be friend there be harm done if be enemy do a think best few word of advice followed then returned to deck boat be lowered twelve pound carronade placed in bow of launch fighting crew paraded weapon examined to see that everything be in fighting order then trundled down over side shoved off chapter twenty five rocca islet night have grown somewhat darker within last hour few light cloud having come up to windward spreading over sky obscuring good many of star so by time have be away from ship about quarter of hour be impossible to see anything of except light twinkled at gaff end might easily have be mistaken for star rounded south west angle of island soon afterwards found pulling up narrow channel between island reef in perfectly smooth water save for slight undulation of ground swell reckoned that stranger be now about two mile distant so with muffled oar in strictest silence paddled gently on mr flinn leading in launch after about hour of work launch ceased pulling other boat following suit word be passed for gig in have be bringing up rear to pas ahead did so in minute be alongside leading boat ca be far off now ralph said paddy in loud whisper so just go aisy ahead darlint see what can find out be month of sunday about aither spalpeen for will soon be havin ' daylight upon indade look to a if sky be lightin ' up to east'ard already so have time to spare never fear said will not be moment longer than can help give way gig pas word for bow oar to lay in keep bright lookout ahead swept silently away stroke oar having order to keep eye on boat a long a be possible to see be just reporting to in whisper that have lost sight of when bow man gave word oar said must see something broad on port bow boat head be sheered to port at same moment caught sight of brigantine spar showing up black indistinct against dark sky be not above fifty yard away from have just given word to paddle quietly ahead when voice hailed in spanish ordering to keep off must fire before must reply crash came volley of musketry at tearing up water round boat one poor fellow dropped oar fell forward off seat give way men shouted dash at get alongside before have time to load again other boat will be here to support in moment men required second bidding bending to oar until stout ash bent like fishing rod water flashed from blade in luminous foam sent boat like arrow in under main chain dropping oar seizing cutlass a sheered alongside springing like grey hound slipped from leash at craft low bulwark have be reckoning without host instead of finding crew below comfortably asleep in hammock there be at quarter with gun loaded run out boarding netting triced up in fact everything ready to repel attack be only extremely cautious approach have saved from broadside two of grape people cut slashed at netting in vain attempt to hew passage through be either shot down thrust back with boarding pike who attempted to creep in at port receiving similar treatment time small arm men be playing briskly upon with musket so that at end of five minute found with hand beaten back into boat one of fore aft suffering from wound more le severe come lad exclaimed take slap at must get on deck somehow jones give hoist up on shoulder think can see

into gig went on board to report well mr flinn said skipper meeting at gangway glad to see back safe sound too mr chester shaking hand with how be be hurt ralph a on facing to eastward light fell upon face saw blood upon broken skull sir replied nothing very serious though believe what be news continued skipper see have brought vessel out with be to tell truth sir answered flinn have have time yet to find out what be be spaniard however if be not greatly mistaken will find that brigantine be little better than pirate um said skipper likely enough have look of now what about casualty have suffered much rather severely sir be sorry to say five killed eighteen rather nineteen with mr chester wounded eight of severely be afraid will lose little fisher sir lose little fisher exclaimed skipper why whoever be thoughtless enough to let that poor child go upon so dangerous expedition flinn looked at at of must plead guilty so matter dropped for time surgeon assistant now trundled down over side with tool under arm went on board prize to attend to poor fellow who be wounded mr flinn returning with to arrange prize crew to anchor prize skipper having come to determination to remain in smooth water until wounded have be attended to placed comfortably in own hammock on board frigate in mean time trundled down into midshipman berth bathed wound scalp wound about six inch long in cold water clapped on quarter of yard of diachylon plaster sheet of always took precaution to keep in own chest snatched mouthful so of biscuit cold meat then returned to deck to see if must be of use oh have be looking for sir said captain steward a put head above coaming captain wish to see in cabin at once if please sir be there now polson right then will go down to forthwith away went come in said deep musical voice of skipper in answer to knock entered oh be ralph come in sit down see have be doing little patching up on own account be very bad thank no mere breaking of skin replied will be a good a new in day two hope that be well still have better let oxley look at when be at leisure very trifling wound turn out badly sometimes in hot climate now want to speak to about poor lad fisher be told be in gig with in gig with echoed taken thoroughly by surprise assure captain annesley be quite unaware of then indeed be not aware that have left ship until mr flinn spoke of a being wounded have even seen throughout affair be glad to hear said skipper brow clearing to tell whole truth ralph have be feeling very angry with for when heard that poor boy have gone in boat quite thought must have be with connivance need scarcely point out to must not approve of such child a being allowed to take part in expedition of so dangerous character where must only be in way must be of possible assistance however since say that know nothing about suppose must have slipped down into boat surreptitiously stowed away now a there be nothing particular for to do may a well at moment mr flinn entered sit down mr flinn sit down man said skipper well how be thing looking on board prize by time capitally sir be happy to say replied flinn with beaming phiz wounded have nearly be attended to may begin to transfer at once little fisher seems in somewhat more promising condition now that wound have be dressed others be also doing well a to prize brigantine have heterogeneous assortment of good in hold that cargo alone be very valuable be sufficient to betray character skipper be killed by ralph if understand rightly early in attack mate lieutenant a call swears be privateer however

regular crew disown acquaintance with crew of juanita there be twice a many men on board a be entered in ship book altogether tale be far too flimsy to hold water have doubt be prize crew from juanita that ship crew have be murdered so that have done very good night work think capital said skipper must well be better except for loss in killed wounded let poor fellow be transferred at once if please mr flinn when be stowed comfortably away will shift silver into frigate also then there will not be much fear of recapture lastly will shift prisoner over to frigate then prize will not require such large prize crew then went on deck together went away in launch to effect transfer of killed wounded be long painful business of wounded requiring most careful handling be done at last by end of afternoon watch everything be ready for to weigh proceed to sea again at once did prize being ordered to rendezvous at barbadoes mr vining third lieutenant have charge of san nicolas while juanita be entrusted to carter master mate who have strict injunction to stick close to protect ship weighed in body stood away to southward close hauled on larboard tack frigate cracking on leaving prize to

severe physical suffering nervous system appeared to have completely broken down incessant heave roll of ship distressed almost beyond power of endurance oh chester said to one day if must be on shore believe must get better tire out to lie here hour after hour watching sway of ship then be so dreadfully hot here although stern port be always open what must like be to be on shore in nice large room with window open sea breeze rushing in laden with odour of flower to lie listen to rustle of leaf watch branch of tree swaying in wind with bird butterfly glancing to fro sunlight glittering upon water ca sleep now with tramping of foot overhead creaking of bulkhead everlasting wash of sea sounding in ear believe must sleep then if must sleep feel must get better day two after have said went down to see toward evening at cabin door met doctor just coming out how be evening doctor inquired worse very much worse be beginning to despair of now be light headed question if will recognise be discouraging reply went in found skipper standing by cot holding one dry burning hand in listening to incoherent ramblings of poor lad endeavouring to soothe home scene incident of school day seemed to be uppermost in mind at moment entered soon afterwards thought wandered away to night of attack must go must go exclaimed in anxious tone if be only to prove whether be coward chester spoke very kindly to believe think be afraid will be dreadful know flashing cutlass fierce thrust of pike perhaps fire of grape canister there will be gaping wound blood blood everywhere oh suffering there will be have read of burning unquenchable thirst throbbing quivering of agonised limb upturned glance of unendurable torture how can possibly bear to look upon perhaps may be one of wounded slain if be what then care about pain for can bear be suffering of others dread to see if be killed why will die doing duty be not afraid of death have never done anything need be ashamed of never did anything mean dishonourable have always tried to be kind to one have read bible regularly poor dear mother gave paused little then tear welled slowly up into eye be dying know though none of have said so wonder whether father will be sorry be proud man stern very stern can not remember that ever kissed have never be able to tell whether care for believe doe hope doe at event need not be ashamed of for have proved that be coward mother will grieve for though will break heart oh here violent flood of tear came to poor boy relief sobbed a though heart must break phew exclaimed skipper will never do be too weak to bear be sure run for oxley tell to come at once ralph must stop at cost rushed out of cabin returned in minute with doctor poor boy be still sobbing occasionally be cry more quietly now lying quite still in hammock instead of moving limb restlessly about a have be doctor leaned over cot felt pulse laid hand upon patient forehead be dreadful tax upon already exhausted strength said medico believe in present case have done good rather than harm however will not do to risk repetition of sort of thing so will give mild opiate although must much rather not in present exhausted condition leaned over cot once more with finger on lad pulse gazed long anxiously in pale upturned face a though revolving in mind weighty problem then turning abruptly away left cabin beckoning to follow a be mixing draught in dispensary remarked if can only last out until reach barbadoes believe might save yet be constant motion be irritating wound sapping life when do think will get in to morrow morning if breeze hold replied too late be afraid said companion shaking head patient be in such critical state that few hour more le may make difference between life death to however will not give up without fight mr stuart will watch through night perhaps must arrange to stay with through dog watch must assuredly replied will speak to mr flinn about be sure will excuse very well then be arranged said doctor now run away with draught if poor boy be still agitated give at once if not keep by for present returned to cabin found that little six foot have stopped cry seemed disposed to sleep so put bottle in place of safety whispered to skipper doctor arrangement all right returned remain here must go on deck now will mention to flinn that will not be on deck during dog watch stole out on tiptoe be alone with patient settled in low chair near cot looked out through stern port sun be just setting western sky glowed with same gorgeous colouring have worn on evening of funeral sight reminded of sad incident wondered whether be to have sadder one yet sat for time lost in mournful thought when there be slight stir in cot heard little fisher voice say weakly be that ralph sitting there be so dark can scarcely make out yes be answered cheerfully how be now six foot have have bit of snooze have not believe have be dozing replied seem very weak ralph have scarcely feeling left in leg fancy will not last many hour longer oh nonsense returned what have put that idea into head why will be in carlisle bay by sun rise to morrow then if be strong enough to bear removal can have wish a to going on shore know once there will soon pull round old fellow more rolling knocking about then harry more groaning bulkhead quiet coolness that have be longing for with sea breeze tree bird butterfly tender woman to nurse pet make much of instead of clumsy people only think of why by time to morrow will feel so much better for change that will be wanting to sit up in bed even to turn out perhaps oh replied be far worse than seem to think ralph still believe might pull round even yet if must get ashore well look here said if be to be moved to morrow be of greatest importance that must have good night rest to night so try like dear good fellow to get to sleep again will do feel thirsty rather replied seem to want something different from stuff that doctor have mixed for if must only get little fruit now bit of one of pine brought on board at kingston for instance believe must refresh more than anything else must said then will have be if doctor will allow for now that speak of know skipper have one two pine left be certain will be heartily welcome to do mind being by for minute two while run to doctor speak to about right will be back in second doctor saw objection so soon have splendid pine sliced up held thin piece to poor little sufferer lip refreshed greatly after draught of acid mixture settled down more comfortably than have be at when turned over to doctor at last left cabin there seemed to be slight improvement in condition in early dawn of following morning anchored in carlisle bay barbadoes by noon poor little fisher have be safely conveyed on shore lodged in colonel residence near needham point where must have lady belonging to garrison to nurse be conveniently situated for frequent visit from staff surgeon chapter twenty six good morning work prize of course have not arrived so having seen little fisher comfortably bestowed landed silver at dockyard handed over prisoner to proper authority weighed again that same evening proceeded northward upon cruise when off martinique have fallen into hand in early part of preceding year spoke british frigate blanche steering towards barbadoes skipper came on board astarte in reply to captain annesley inquiry reported that have done nothing since capture of french frigate pique in january on occasion captain faulkner former skipper of blanche most promising officer be killed present captain watkins acting expressed great disgust at state of affair rather cynically ventured to hope must have better luck than have met with nothing worthy of mention occurred until arrived off guadaloupe have made thorough inspection of neighbouring island beginning with mariegalante have looked into point pitre harbour on grand terre without making discovery when one evening while beating up under south side of desirade espied schooner at anchor near shore directly under gun of fort preparation be immediately made for cutting out frigate tacking meanwhile reaching off shore again in order to lull suspicion frenchman may have have a to intention worked up round north east end of island being by time a dark a must be frigate hove to boat properly manned armed be despatched under sail took part in expedition a have shared in other skipper be anxious to give young gentleman a far a possible equal opportunity of distinguishing boat sent away on occasion be first cutter under mr wood second lieutenant second cutter under gimbal quarter master with little smellie to lend hand jollyboat under command of le personage than mr robert summer allowed hour quarter to get down to schooner at expiration of time filled stood after a rounded end of island slipped up a far a fore topmast crosstrees to see if must make out anything of what be going on be perfectly dark quiet to leeward however for first ten minute of stay then saw bright flash third then two more in quick succession presently distant boom of heavy gun came rumbling up to windward ah thought be battery playing upon people expect fire be kept up pretty briskly for about ten minute then ceased shortly afterwards red light appeared inshore of preconcerted signal of success almost immediately after appearance must make out schooner on board be displayed coming out from under land quarter of hour afterwards be to on lee quarter mr wood report be to effect that have got on board without much resistance without casualty that schooner have be anchored so close in under battery that garrison have heard sound of scuffle have upon schooner weighing opened fire upon with effect hulling several time inflicting rather severe injury from splinter upon four of people breaking master bob summer right leg below knee cutting poor old gimbal in two schooner be french privateer mounting eight long six long nine upon forecastle with crew of forty men arrangement be being made for transfer of prisoner to frigate when french skipper sent message begging that before anything else be done might be favoured with interview with captain annesley request be granted be brought on board astarte in gig conducted below into skipper cabin be there for about hour when at length returned to own ship order be sent to mr wood to secure schooner crew below make sail in company with frigate accordingly bore up running round south west end of island hauled up for north east bay in grand terre reached by daylight next morning here fine frigate be found snugly anchored in south east corner of bay in sheltered bight under protection of battery mounting ten heavy gun now came out that frigate french craft of forty gun named l'artemise have arrived at island on previous day hearing of being in neighbourhood have immediately made way to spot where have found whether to be in wait for to hide from must not yet be said skipper of schooner have picked up piece of news have bargained with captain to pilot to place where french ship lay on condition that with ship crew must be allowed to go free bargain be struck skipper insisting however upon total disarming of schooner astarte prize now hove to being still in deep water order be sent on board schooner to flood magazine to throw gun small arm into sea leaving weapon only in hand of master two subordinate for maintenance of proper discipline done people being taken out of schooner captain annesley wrote out challenge to captain of french frigate sent in by schooner then hoisted colour fired gun french frigate battery on shore hoisted tricolour soon afterwards though watched schooner into anchorage saw boat go from to frigate presumably with challenge farther notice be taken of presence frigate remaining day obstinately at anchor in secure position of course everybody on board astarte be on qui vive during whole of day three top be permanently occupied by relay of officer telescope good bad indifferent be kept constantly levelled at noble craft inshore a for captain annesley never left deck moment a long a daylight lasted except to snatch hasty mouthful at meal time day exhibited nearest approach to ill temper ever saw in at length night fell still sign have be made by frenchman dinner have be postponed for hour in cabin in hope that frigate must yet come out when at last hope have be given up whole of officer be invited to dine with skipper at sunset wore round stood away to southward conversation round captain mahogany night be naturally upon one topic only namely how to get hold of frigate captain annesley listened with exemplary patience to be said at last when possible suggestion practicable impracticable have be made said thank gentleman one for very valuable suggestion none of however if may be excused for saying so strike a being so simple a one have thought upon be propose returning during night to spot near where french frigate lie marked particularly to day while be lying off on sending boat crew ashore about hour before daybreak to morrow morning to see what can be done with battery will of course be kept upon tiptoe of expectation night to night anticipating attempt to cut frigate out something of sort toward morning however hearing nothing of being fatigued moreover by night watch will relax vigilance then think perhaps something may be achieved in nature of surprise say surprise because be done must like done without giving frigate alarm battery once in possession be only for five minute heavy gun of so much dislike look may be spiked then will have nothing to do run into bay lay frigate alongside help now what do think of plan capital excellent very thing be verdict everybody applauded to echo a of course in duty bound to do apart from that really be excellent proposal far better than of previous suggestion very well then resumed skipper now a to detail surprise silencing of battery be a must see matter of last importance will need cool steady hand a leader of expedition can not spare many men a be short of complement already have idea that french craft ill disposed a seems to come out to will make gallant defence when go in to for same reason can ill spare of officer under such circumstance who in opinion must be sent to deal with battery there be dead silence for minute then up spake paddy flinn bedad thin said eye sparkling with animation be must like to take job in hand if wos shtorrrming battery be wanted captain darlint since be surprise for own sake that of iverybody else send for know 'd be puttin ' fut in raising end of distorbance before 'd done wid there be hearty laugh at frank speech in skipper joined until tear rolled down cheek flinn said be last man must think of sending upon business besides will want to lead one of boarding party where know will be in element mr wood will also want really see how can well do without mr martin so that now come down to midshipman to tell candid truth young gentleman have great qualm about entrusting so important business to of do say ralph do think must manage so delicate business without making hash of yes sir said believe must at event will undertake to silence battery if care patience will enable to do so without alarming frigate will be done very well then said skipper will conduct enterprise remember that surprise be eminently desirable that spiking of gun be imperative necessity sat little while longer then rising making bow retired in body stood on until within hour half of midnight when wore ship began to retrace step by three o'clock next morning be off spot captain annesley have selected for landing small strip of sandy beach distant about mile to southward of southernmost end of north east bay frigate be once more hove to first cutter be boat selected for service be lowered at four be left ship having on board twenty picked men in addition to coxswain fully armed on approaching shore found to appearance with rock bound coast under lee upon sea be breaking with considerable violence a drew closer in however made out point behind landing place be situate in five minute afterwards slid round projection found ourselves in smooth water with beach close aboard giving boat good way ran well up on sand hand jumped out except two who be to remain in a boatkeepers be then shoved off again two men in charge being instructed to keep bright lookout to be prepared to back in receive at moment notice in event of anything going wrong then paraded small command first repeating to instruction led way up steep slope of cliff be very dark moon what there be of having set nearly hour before by dint of great caution taking time about safely reached top of cliff in about ten minute here hand lay down upon grass while went forward on hand knee over brow of hill to reconnoitre be little time before must distinguish anything black shapeless bulk of land before at length made out something thought be battery at distance of about quarter of mile away at somewhat lower level than spot upon found returning to surprise party moved cautiously forward toward object have seen when within hundred yard of once more left men crawled forward a before to reconnoitre a have drawn nearer to object have seen that be mistaken a to being battery now made out that be block of two small stone building evidently intended for use a temporary barrack for artilleryman belonging to battery officer crept right up to wall of building finding everything perfectly dark silent pushed investigation somewhat farther pulling off boot passed right round building then found that have in first instance come upon rear rounding corner of block be built in form of letter l with point facing inwards at once became aware of presence of two door one in wing of be open from a well a from window feeble stream of light be issuing from position occupied be able to see in through door of smaller building there in couple of hammock lay two figure partially undressed be to say have thrown off jacket waistcoat boot jacket waistcoat lay upon two chair from quantity of gold lace upon rightly conjectured that be officer then ventured to take look in through window of larger room observing precaution to stand far enough away in first instance to prevent light falling upon face so betraying presence to perchance wakeful artilleryman however be perfectly still silent long row of pallet on side of room might have be tenanted by so many corps for movement that made loud nasal chorus however prevented apprehension might otherwise have felt upon subject so far so good now withdrew until considered quite beyond influence of lamp burning in two apartment by bye judged from clearness with burned must have be very recently trimmed in order to ascertain position of battery there be sure enough within twenty yard of only reason why have not seen before be because barrack building be interposed between sank hastily down upon grass to examine structure made out that be sort of redan two face of forming very obtuse angle be composed of stone work masked with sod five thirty six pounder grinned from embrasure in face alongside gun be stacked up goodly pile of shot merlon between embrasure appeared to have be constructed in such way a to form expense magazine for thought must make out door leading thereto magazine proper must not make out in darkness did trouble to look for battery ought to mention be not enclosed at in rear being evidently intended strictly a sea defence have be so busy noting have almost forgotten to look for sentry be sure to be posted somewhere when did at last make out found to very great satisfaction that there be only two of one at wing of battery instead of pacing backward forward a ought to have done be standing with back turned toward gazing out to seaward if indeed be not more than half asleep saw at once that moment be eminently propitious so hurrying back to men who must have wondered what have become of led up to within ten yard of barrack building when made man take off shoe then crept up to barrack wall telling off nine men provided with hammer carefully faced with leather to deaden sound few nail being similarly provided placed remainder of party five at wing of building well within shadow with instruction to seize without noise possible detain one who might emerge from building in event of alarm being given garrison aroused two of men be to rush in overpower officer while remainder be to rally round door of larger room prevent sally until signal whistle must inform that work of spiking be completed when whole be to give leg bail make for beach warned to prevent general alarm if possible at hazard having posted division of party rejoined other man be to spike gun two on wing be in addition to creep up to surprise sentry on wing one be to attempt anything until word must be passed from wing arrangement made at once moved forward noiseless a shadow towards respective point took northern wing while bob hawkins fine steady main topman took other a soon a began to move devoted whole attention to sentry on own wing knowing must not attend to look after other matter also there man still stood motionless a statue from slight movement two made soon saw that be not asleep on contrary wide awake on crept presently be within six foot of at moment one of people sneezed violently man instantly turned right hand man sprang upon on instant while wrenched firelock out of hand assistant grasped unhappy man so tenaciously by throat that be utterly unable to utter sound by sheer strength at same time forced down upon knee laid firelock carefully down upon ground whipping out of pocket handful of oakum marline stuffed thowl pin into fellow mouth effectually gagging fear half choking at same time next lashed neck heel together in such way that must not possibly move then set about spiking gun passing word along at same time distinct clinking notwithstanding leather facing to hammer on right wing told that be going favourably in quarter in minute work be effectually done be extremely anxious during minute for sound of hammer smote upon excited ear like sharp stroke of bell soon ceased however a everything remained quiet at barrack building seemed that clinking have not be loud enough to reach ear of sleeper therein giving sentry on right wing overhaul to see that like comrade be safe immediately withdrew spikers picking up other party in retreat silently made best of way to beach safely reached in about quarter of hour jumping into boat pulled cheerily out to seaward have by time grown just sufficiently light to enable to see frigate looming like seventy four about mile to windward be evidently on lookout for on board for have scarcely shoved boat nose clear of point before saw beautiful craft sweep gracefully round run down toward came a close in a skipper dared bring then hove to in ten minute afterwards be on board boat hoisted up well ralph said captain annesley a went up side touched hat what news have carried out order to letter sir replied have surprised battery without giving slightest alarm to french frigate have spiked ten thirty six pounder mount thirty six eh said thought have look of heavy metal when saw through telescope yesterday why at elevation at so short range must have sunk before must get out again have attempted to go in there without first silencing thank mr chester have performed difficult most important service with equal skill courage will have great pleasure in representing a much to admiral here be feather in cap however have time just then for self gratulation for a soon a success have be made known frigate wore round preparation have be made long before headed at once for north east bay skipper having taken utmost care to keep french frigate shut in night by projecting point of land form southern extremity of bay in order that astarte might be equally hidden from french frigate ten minute afterwards shaved close in round point there lay artemise within dozen cable length of with boarding netting triced up gun run out everything apparently in readiness to receive for moment two presence appeared to be unnoticed then crack went sentry piece one after on board quick short roll of drum be heard beating to quarter hitherto silent craft became in moment astir with bustle animation in meantime astarte conned by skipper in person with old martin master at wheel be put dead away before wind until have run in to within five hundred yard of beach have barely eight foot of water between keel bottom helm be then put gently over to port swept round in long graceful curve during whole of canvas be very smartly hauled down clewed up finally coming up head to wind gradually losing way ranged alongside antagonist distance having be most accurately measured by skipper grappling be instantly thrown secured artemise reserved fire until be fairly alongside when delivered entire broadside tremendous concussion of caused two frigate to sway heavily away from other until strength of grappling lashing be taxed to fullest extent marine on poop at same moment opened upon heavy galling musketry fire by did suffer much loss for main deck port be closed gun being run in entire crew upon upper deck crouching behind lofty bulwark moment that first volley of musketry have rung out away went party of boarder fore aft making way for somehow in spite of netting driving frenchman from end of ship into waist where be so huddled crowded together that very few of be able to use weapon to advantage fought well for first two three minute when found that shore battery remained silent became confused disheartened a easily gathered from ejaculation exclamation at length after really stubborn resistance of ten minute duration threw down arm surrendered prisoner be at once sent below hatch clapped on over after immediate step be taken to remove two ship from somewhat perilous position be that of embayment upon lee shore strong prize crew be placed on board artemise leaving only just sufficient hand on board astarte to work sail then latter set canvas cast off fast grappling canted to southward so close to shore have french frigate be moored so completely within shelter of bight that there be very little room for manoeuvring astarte short handed a be narrowly escaped leaving bone to bleach on rocky point managed however to scrape clear by skin of teeth once fairly outside clear of danger went about hove to on starboard tack to wait for prize artemise have be placed in charge of mr flinn who have selected for first smellie for second lieutenant mr wood acting a first on board astarte mr vining third lieutenant carter be will be remembered absent in prize have taken at roccas a soon a saw that own noble frigate be safe paddy who never liked to lose anything gave order to pas messenger get anchor instead of cutting cable ship be riding by best bower be rather doubtful whether must manage job men however walked manfully up to anchor until cable be straight up down when left capstan bar flew aloft to loose canvas being a fully aware a officer of critical position of ship of liability to drive ashore unless work be smartly executed achieved task in incredibly short time by almost superhuman exertion on part sail be set almost a quickly a though have be fully manned well done lad shouted paddy encouragingly now man capstan bar once more break anchor out at once run straight up to bow if can not get smartly labour will be lost by ship driving ashore play up piper walk away cheerily men piper struck up lively air forget what seaman threw whole weight upon long capstan bar cable strained surged capstan jerked slowly round pawl by pawl at length a heavier swell than usual rolled into bay there be sudden violent jerk capstan yielded somewhat unexpectedly to violent exertion of men rolling two three of over on nose away went rest at run laughing heartily at comrade discomfiture great anchor drew reluctantly out of ground be on topgallant forecastle time superintending operation there a soon a saw cable swinging with heave of ship anchor aweigh sir sang out thank mr chester now put helm hard port man over with smartly have stern way upon be driving in toward shore now pay off trim aft lee headsheets forward there man lee forebraces now swing fore yard board fore main tack haul aft sheet news of anchor yet mr chester stock have just hove in sight sir be well let have up get catted at once if please frigate be now under weigh on starboard tack looking up handsomely to windward of northern extremity of bay having be extricated from exceedingly awkward position mainly by extraordinary exertion of crew new skipper therefore deemed appropriate occasion upon to raise cry of grog ho men soon have opportunity of comparing quality of frenchman brandy with of own more unpretentious rum french cook meanwhile have be summoned to galley be soon busy preparing breakfast for men concocting ditto for cabin be intended to show own officer who by way have given parole that love of art rose triumphant above la fortune de la guerre to impress with conviction that be frenchman only who can cook captain annesley on seeing fairly under weigh filled stood on upon same tack a ourselves at length be far enough to windward to fetch clear of everything upon other tack with ease accordingly went about astarte tacking at same time edged down to within speaking distance of shortly afterwards captain annesley hailed to say that a have fully expected intended to shape course back to barbadoes wished to make effort to keep together after breakfast have little friendly trial of speed when be found that astarte must just spare fore mizzen topgallant sail at two pm on following day anchored in carlisle bay be very pleased to see that vining carter be also safely there skipper got very great credit for exploit of ours a indeed did may a well here state that participators in eventually received naval medal artemise be purchased into british navy under same name command of given to mr flinn mr wood be raised to rank of first lieutenant mr vining also moved step up ratline leaving vacancy for third lieutenant skipper most kindly filled up by giving acting order a astarte have received considerable amount of damage to hull from double shotted broadside of artemise fired at such exceedingly close range be placed alongside dockyard jetty for repair be not until next day have opportunity to take run ashore make inquiry respecting little fisher skipper went together to very great gratification found that poor boy thanks to assiduous nursing have received be doing marvellously well wound be healing in most satisfactory manner have so far recovered strength at time of visit be daily expecting to receive doctor permission to sit up in bed for hour so be exceedingly doubtful however whether poor lad must ever again have much use of right arm in case prospect a far a navy be concerned at least be at end for ever chapter twenty seven loss of juanita fortnight be very pleasantly spent by at island during progress of repair good people of bridgetown vieing with other in effort for amusement ball also upon very grand scale being given in honour by officer of garrison then defect being made good once more put to sea appeared by time to have come to end of run of good luck however for though most assiduously worked entire archipelago not sign of enemy must find at period of cruise having expired bore up returned to port royal where captain annesley be received by admiral with effusion frigate remained at anchor in harbour ten day during hand indulged in little welcome recreation officer attending quality ball shooting visiting at various estate belonging to new made most hospitable kingstonian friend have accepted invitation from mr finnie whose acquaintance have made on previous visit to kingston to spend few day on estate among blue mountain enjoy little shooting on small lake adjoining in indefatigable pursuit of amusement managed to contract severe attack of yellow fever be most kindly carefully nursed through by mr finnie be chiefly owing to unceasing attention under god recovered at be ill for week what with fever relapse terrible prostration followed when at length be able once more to crawl about astarte have be long gone to sea upon sort of roving commission from be quite uncertain when must return under such circumstance time soon began to hang heavily on hand longed for sniff of pure salt sea breeze once more be therefore greatly delighted when on calling at country house of admiral to whom have be introduced by captain annesley following conversation occurred ah chester said admiral glad to see on pin once more have have very narrow squeak of hear indeed have sir replied so narrow be that have coffin ready built for have managed to weather upon yellow jack time however thank god now if must only get to sea again believe must soon pull round completely recover strength ah say so be quite likely old gentleman be silent for few minute then turning abruptly to said have heard that juanita that pirate brigantine astarte took among roccas have be brought to port royal that be putting new foremast in converting into topsail schooner sir have not replied indeed have heard nothing in connection with naval matter for have not yet be a far a kingston umph well be doing so said how do think change will affect believe will be great improvement heavy gear forward must be sure have be detrimental to sailing power especially in sea way to be sure be must have be otherwise then approve of change yes sir certainly replied wondering why on earth so great personage must attach importance to opinion of midshipman ah be glad of returned admiral because since have expressed wish to go to sea again idea have come into head to give to be to say until astarte come in again murmured something hardly knew what by way of thanks to admiral kindly replied there there say word about dear boy annesley have told about if half of what say be true know of one who be better fitted for trust than besides have really nobody else to place in charge if feel well enough have better run down on board in course of day two see how matter be going on now come away into other room have lunch on following morning directly after breakfast started in mr finnie ketureen for kingston reaching wharf about noon chartered that fast sailing clipper fly by night to convey to port royal jabber of black boatman exhilarating sensation of being once more afloat have quite tonic effect upon spirit rose higher higher a tore down past palisade boat careening gunwale to with hissing sparkling foam seething past trailing away in long wake astern when got on board juanita found that have just stepped foremast most beautiful spar be without knot in a straight a ray of light fisher dockyard foreman be on board superintending operation from learned that be intended to make slight alteration in armament of craft for whereas when captured carried four long six of side be now proposed to alter position of port reducing number to three bringing more toward middle waist of vessel mounting three long nine on side instead of four six thus removing weight from two end adding three pound to weight of broadside be also proposed to take away long nine from forward to substitute for long eighteen between mast alteration accorded strictly with own view upon subject be precisely what must have suggested have be asked there have be little talk about increasing height of bulwark be glad to hear have be overruled for must certainly have gone far toward spoiling light jaunty graceful appearance took dockyard people just week to complete proposed alteration during visited craft morning returning to quarter at mr finnie in time for six o'clock dinner on day week after first visit be out of fisher hand a left late that afternoon thought have never seen prettier little craft tall slim taper spar have jaunty little rake aft be encumbered with only so much rigging a be absolutely necessary to prevent from going over side yard though light be of immense spread new suit of sail with have be fitted fore aft have be stretching week be permanently bent only that same morning gleamed in brilliant sunshine white a snow hull be coppered to about six inch beyond water line above be painted cool grey up to rail colour being relieved by narrow scarlet riband along covering board be fancy of admiral that must be made a unlike ship of war a possible in order that might be more thoroughly fitted for destined work between certainly managed to meet wish in respect to perfection for looked in hull rigging more like yacht than anything else on following day store ammunition be shipped on day after called at admiral office for instruction joined ship same evening a soon a land breeze set in proceeded to sea order being to cruise among windward passage for protection of trade suppression of piracy until recalled to look in at post office on crooked island about once month for order keeping close along in under land so a to take full advantage of land breeze be off morant point by midnight when stretched away to seaward finally after being obliged to take to sweep to get across calm belt between terral trade wind stood away to northward close hauled upon starboard tack toward cuban shore weathering in due time cape maysi eastern extremity of island of cuba shaped course for crooked island passage being then able to get small pull upon weather brace to ease off mainsheet foot so bowled along in style filled hand with delight on arrival at crooked island called at post office left letter for admiral reporting progress there be fine full rigged ship lying there when arrived bound for london have be there two day waiting hoping for arrival of man of war under protection of to get safely through passage carried very rich cargo sixteen passenger most of whom be lady a only mounted four small gun carried more than just sufficient men to work ship skipper be willing to lose day two upon chance of getting safe convoy clear of island among there have be of late very daring case of piracy finding that centurion a ship be named be perfectly ready for sea arranged with skipper to sail again that afternoon accordingly did centurion proving to be slow sailer be four day taking out clear of everything when having done so without molestation two ship parted company bore up for regular cruise to southward among various passage fell in with good many ship english pushing through various passage few of asked for convoy of pirate slaver french privateer of must have be game for bag saw nothing at length having made circuit of archipelago once calling at post office on reaching finding order have proceeded so far on cruise a to have arrived off square handkerchief shoal on second round be about to bear up through silver kay passage when toward end of afternoon watch wind suddenly dropped by sun down have fallen stark calm air turned close hot a breath of oven a evening wore on heavy bank of black cloud worked up from to leeward slowly overspread sky gradually settling down until vapour appeared to touch mast head hawsepipe master mate who be acting a master have be very fidgety for time at last what do think mean mr chester said scarcely know what to make of replied have never seen anything quite like before look more like impending thunder storm than anything else may be something very different be about to give order to shorten sail when spoke really think have better returned see sign of wind a yet certainly still a be in hurry must be just a well to be prepared for anything everything can possibly happen what sail will get under well being a remark in sort of hurry think will make precaution a complete a possible by stowing everything except fore trysail staysail let men commence with mainsail a be largest least manageable sail in breeze hand shorten sail sang out boatswain pipe sounded gruff voice reiterated order men who have be grouped together on forecastle discussing singular appearance of weather sprang to station main peak halliard let go man main tack tricing line down with throat of sail round in upon mainsheet now then be there one to attend to peak downhaul be right now roll up sail snugly put coat on in with whole of square canvas forward royal topgallant topsail halliard sheet let go man clewlines clew up cheerily lad haul down stow jib lay aloft there see that stow canvas snugly although be too dark at present for to see what be about thus mr hawsepipe in a authoritative tone a though be first luff of gun ship sail be shortened in considerably le time than have taken to write above description for though be first cruise wherein hawsepipe have be placed in position of actual authority be anything tyro in science of seamanship insisted on everything on board being done a thoroughly well a be possible to do schooner be soon ready for might come night grew hotter hotter still glassy calm continued darkness be so intense so opaque that on placing hand close before eye be quite unable to see stillness of air be such that flame of lamp brought on deck burned straight up down merely swaying trifle with heave of ship upon long sluggish swell state of thing continued until nearly four bell in first watch when startling phenomenon occurred curtain of vapour grew more dense even than have be before entirely precluding possibility of light penetrating from above notwithstanding atmosphere very gradually became luminous with ghastly blue sulphurous light until be possible not only to see distinctly object on board schooner also to distinguish gleaming surface of water for distance on side of three mile so face of men huddled together on forecastle looked ghastly death like in unearthly light hull spar rigging canvas of schooner assumed weird supernatural appearance when illumined by that might easily have be mistaken for cruiser from phlegethon be not about hour after singular luminosity of atmosphere first became apparent before startled seaman have recovered self possession in instant without premonition there appeared at mast head yardarm at jibboom end in fact at end of spar on board schooner globe of greenish coloured light about size of ordinary lamp globe of wavered swayed elongated flattened a ship gently rose fell over glassy sea men be now thoroughly terrified see that tom exclaimed one what d call thing why be davy jones lantern be returned tom right sorry be to see davy jones lantern echoed questioner what mean a light have be h'isted aboard here by real old genuine davy eh be just what do mean then mistake eye there be show of 'em too never seed so many afore in life mark word dick see if something out o ' common happen to here little barkie afore four twenty hour be over head what sort of somethin d 'ye mean tom bo ' asked why harm damage o ' kind replied oracle have heerd say a how when lantern be showed aboard of craft that be sure sign a be doomed ship remembers one time when be in chinee sea in old lord have ' mercy on what be that dazzling blinding flash seemed to set sky sea on fire simultaneous crash of thunder of so terrific character ear rang tingled be stone deaf for few minute afterwards interrupted speaker reeled under awful concussion a though have received crushing blow for minute two felt dazed to verge of unconsciousness then became sensible that hawsepipe be grasping hand trying to direct attention forward seemed too to be anxious to say something for lip be moving rapidly in excited manner looked forward behold there lay foremast with attached over side stump standing about four foot above deck being nothing mass of charred blackened splinter be bad enough letting glance travel forward saw that whole of men on forecastle have be struck to deck by electric fluid hawsepipe surgeon quarter master rushed forward in body to assistance of unfortunate men to ascertain extent of injury raised poor fellow a came to into sitting position against bulwark while surgeon hastily examined to horror be found that four have be killed by tremendous discharge dead men body being in case blackened charred a if by fire while in other case knife coin in pocket be fused into shapeless lump of metal living be carried aft to cabin where surgeon assisted by hawsepipe devoted energy to restoration while quarter master returned to deck to look after safety of ship in meantime terrific thunder storm heralded by first destructive discharge have set in green baleful glare of livid lightning illuminating scene until became almost a light a day while crashing roll of thunder be absolutely continuous so deafening that felt stunned stupefied by there be rain be there wind properly speaking dead calm being only interrupted now then by momentary gust of wind hot a blasting breath of furnace passed over be gone almost before have time to realise presence fitful transient gust of wind came from quarter of compass have never before experienced weather of at similar character have simpson quarter master be equally puzzled a to what to expect heaven be black a ink cloud rendered visible by unearthly bluish green glare of lightning be seen to be writhing working like tortured serpent there be nothing to indicate probable breeze there be plenty of work to be done clearing away of wreck being first task simpson accordingly armed with tomahawk went forward to make commencement simpson began at jibboom end cutting away stay attached thereto working way in while made attack upon shroud backstay intention be to cut away everything in first instance in case of bad weather coming on afterwards to save a much of wreck a must have scarcely begun task when fancied smelt smell of burning for first minute so paid little attention to a air have be for long time pervaded by strong choking sulphurous odour have struck few stroke with tomahawk however when very strong whiff assailed nostril at same instant thin wreath of smoke appeared hovering over fore scuttle dropping tomahawk darted toward opening looking down found place full of smoke appeared to be prevented from rising by peculiar condition of atmosphere lay in simpson shouted to quarter master ship be on fire old fellow with arm raised in act of striking at jib stay turned catching sight of smoke bundled inboard in trice descended to forecastle together found so full of dense pungent smoke that be impossible to remain there moment without adopting precaution of kind to escape suffocation accordingly returned to deck removing black silk handkerchief from throat saturated with water then bound tightly about lower part of face leaving eye only uncovered thus protected once more descended be then enabled to remain long enough to assure that forecastle be not seat of fire a returned to deck up steep ladder detected smoke issuing into forecastle in dense jet through joint in bulkhead together with odour at moment became very strong led to suspect that fire be located in store room saturating handkerchief afresh readjusting upon face rushed aft descended main hatchway here be to say immediately in wake of hatchway there be very little smoke with step forward became more more dense a approached store room heat smoke became so stifling that must only proceed with utmost difficulty at length however managed to reach store room door then heat heavy smoke dull roar crackling of flame gave unmistakable assurance that have found seat of mischief placed hand upon thick planking of bulkhead found to be scorching hot be unable to remain moment where be so intense be smoke heat accordingly returned to deck summoned hawsepipe doctor to assistance informed in few word of new catastrophe rather of unexpected result of original one for have doubt that be lightning have set ship on fire received from in return news that four men have be restored to consciousness have not yet recovered use of limb then at once set about cutting hole through deck into store room hoping that by mean of fire engine hose might yet be able to conquer flame hole be first cut in deck large enough to admit end of hose hose be then inserted packed carefully round with wet canvas where passed through deck so a to prevent a far a possible access of fresh air to fire four then manned engine proceeded with energy to pump water down upon flame have be thus engaged for about quarter of hour lightning raging round while in undiminished fury when in instant down came rain in perfect flood shut port yelled hawsepipe understood in moment object have in view leaving engine went round deck closing port stopping up scupper with piece of canvas so a to prevent water from flowing off deck rain be descending in such copious torrent that in few minute be up to knee in warm fresh water when hose be withdrawn from hole in deck water allowed to stream down into store room dense jet of steam rushed up through hole immediately that withdrew hose packing now have moment in to take look below see what result have attended labour glance at fore scuttle be anything reassuring dense cloud of steam smoke issuing by time from opening a looked smoke suddenly became tinged with lurid reflection of flame darted to opening looking down a well a must through blinding suffocating cloud rushed up in denser volume instant saw that bulkhead be burned through flame already spreading in direction fire engine be instantly started once more hose being time directed down into forecastle for twenty minute played upon fire there rain while rushing down in sheet fast filling deck without result at end of time became apparent that ship be doomed hawsepipe doctor have meanwhile pressed investigation farther aft soon reappearing with alarming news that fire be spreading aft with great rapidity then there be nothing for to take to boat without further delay said set about getting over side forthwith motion being considerably accelerated by increasing loudness of roaring crackling sound of fire dense cloud of smoke now enveloped ship almost unbearable heat of deck flame spread so rapidly that by time have got boat into water with oar sail etcetera couple of breaker of water bag two of biscuit miscellaneous collection of small store from cabin locker heat smoke have become so unendurable that must not remain still moment indeed so sorely pressed be that poor fellow who have be injured by lightning who have be brought on deck time before to save from suffocation be almost thrown over side into boat scrambled in after casting off got out oar pulled a fast a must from ship in minute be blazing from stem to stern notwithstanding still pouring rain pushed off in dead silence having pulled far enough away to be clear of scorching heat laid with one consent upon oar to watch conflagration have be lying thus motionless upon water three four minute when mainmast swayed slowly to fro for moment then fell with hissing splash into water alongside shower of spark shooting up at same moment from burning bulwark have be crushed out by mast in fall be watching remarking upon way in plank of topside be twisting up opening out from timber under influence of tremendous heat when suddenly awful recollection flashed upon pull pull for life screamed have forgotten to drown out magazine not word be needed with one accord oar dashed into water may rest assured that threw entire weight strength into stroke bending stout ash stave a though be pliant whalebone lifting boat clear out of water have not pulled more than dozen stroke before there be violent concussion a though have run stem on upon sandbank schooner side burst apart flaming plank of deck with fitting gun everything else upon soared into air in midst of blinding sheet of flame then came dull heavy roar of explosion black darkness ceased pulling a explosion took place struck powerless for moment at sudden terrible destruction have befallen craft so lately home ark of safety be only when fiery fragment began to fall thickly round that took to oar once more trouble have scarcely yet begun for oar have hardly dipped in water when crash there fell ponderous fragment of one of schooner timber down upon boat literally cutting in two killing poor old simpson on spot boat at once sank from under leaving struggling for life in water hawsepipe be famous swimmer immediately seized doctor who must not swim stroke placed in position of temporary safety upon floating piece of timber have inflicted upon fresh disaster while looked after injured men who probably owing to shock of immersion have suddenly so far recovered use of limb a to be able with very little assistance to gain same refuge now found what have be too busy to notice before thunder storm have nearly worn out occasional flash low down upon horizon long rumbling accompaniment of distant thunder being remained to remind of except frequent gleam of sheet lightning continued to play round horizon behind great bank of cloud into black canopy overhead have now broken question calling for immediate attention be how best to provide for safety clinging to floating timber be safe only a long a remained calm very gentle sea must be sufficient to wash from hold looking round perceived that be at great distance from wreck of foremast thought if hand must only reach might be able to construct from spar attached to raft of sufficient capacity to accommodate in degree of comfort safety mentioned idea to hawsepipe who approved of greatly whereupon left to look after survivor while went to spar reaching be able without much difficulty to form from halliard of various sail other running gear still attached to spar warp long enough to reach from foremast to timber to others be clinging with swam back bending end of warp securely to piece of timber hawsepipe then swam to foremast hauling upon warp soon have rest of party there also hawsepipe undertaking with assistance of others to cut yard adrift separate topmast from lower mast took cruise with warp be fortunate enough after swimming about for over hour to bag half burned hen coop with four dead fowl still therein three hatch remains of mainmast with topmast attached latter spar being still in good enough condition to be serviceable jibboom thing contrived to get alongside foremast without interrupting labour of others hawsepipe evidently knew how to construct raft upon scientific principle foremast took for sort of foundation keel laying two topmast one on side parallel to at distance of about ten foot end of spar be then crossed by lashed to two yardarm of fore yard at end of raft intended for stern to topsail yardarm at fore end formed rectangular staging with lower mast running fore aft through centre staging be then strengthened by lashing jibboom across in middle upon top of hatch hen coop be firmly secured forming small platform upon however there be room for with little crowding topgallant yard with sail still attached be then got on end one arm being lashed to foremast other sustained aloft by mean of shroud stay topgallant sail cut in two diagonally thus treated formed tolerably serviceable leg of mutton sail took so long to do by time have finished day be breaking a sun rose cloud cleared away trade wind once more resumed sway fresh cool breeze greatly reviving exhausted energy while bore at rate of about knot half per hour away from scene of catastrophe chapter twenty eight voyage upon raft have now time to look about to realise position though might easily have be worse be certainly reverse of enviable in first place be upon frail raft well constructed though be must not be expected to hold long together unless be favoured with exceptionally fine weather in next place everything of be possessed in shape of provision be comprised in four dead fowl found in hen coop of water other liquid with to quench thirst have not single drop on other hand island of saint domingo be under lee at distance of about ninety mile if raft must only hold together so long maintain speed at be then travelling might hope to reach land in from two half to three day laid fact before companion directing special attention to circumstance that have to look forward to three day of suffering from thirst also from hunger in minor degree urging to brave endurance of privation if necessary pointing out to that though unfortunately happened to be in one of least frequented of passage there be chance although somewhat slender one of being picked up at hour wound up by reminding even on frail raft be a much under protection of who hold water in hollow of hand a must be be safe on shore at doctor suggestion then knelt down while offered up brief earnest prayer for deliverance felt much more hopeful after short religious exercise went cheerfully about work of examining raft now that have daylight with once more with object of ascertaining whether be possible to make improvement in not examination careful minute though be be soon over came to conclusion that improvement be possible with material at hand that if lashing did not give way weather continued fine have not much to fear hawsepipe have rigged steering gear to raft by lashing piece of deck plank twelve foot long to schooner foremast in such way that half of be immersed in water acted a rudder while other half slanted in over raft served a tiller be in fact rude substitute for steering oar answered purpose perfectly in so far a that enabled to keep raft dead before wind when tried experiment of edging couple of point so to southward of direction in wind blew with view of reaching saint domingo shore a quickly a possible found that speed of raft lessened sensibly that began to drive slightly sideways through water must not in short travel in direction except dead before wind be therefore compelled to rest content with to devote energy to most careful steering so a to run straight to leeward so get greatest possible speed out of steered in spell of two hour rest seeking shelter from sun ray in shadow of sail seaman trying to pas away time a much a possible in sleep a morning wore on heat became very great thirst grew with managed to stave off worst pang by pouring sea water plentifully over other a sat in clothes about noon thought of dinner hungry a by time be scarcely fancied fare be one of dead fowl to be eaten raw of course since have mean of cooking finding that rest be equally a squeamish a in respect suggested be agreed that fowl must remain untouched until felt hungry enough to eat uncooked flesh with relish toward sun down have most unwelcome addition to company in shape of three shark suddenly made appearance close under stern of raft maintaining position at about three yard distance with perseverance be worthy of better cause size of dorsal fin be carried well out of water assured that follower be shark of largest size enabled to form pretty fair idea of what must be fate must of be unfortunate enough to fall be washed off raft keen lookout be maintained during whole of day sail be seen at length sun went down in cloudless sky giving assurance of continuance of fine weather anxiously marked position of luminary when reached horizon saw with heart sick feeling can not describe that be have probably be day sailing course about wsw two point more to northward than have hoped be most serious matter since must throw much farther to westward necessitate going much greater distance probably nearly double before must possibly reach land began for first time to fear that might possibly miss saint domingo altogether knew that if did that might give up for lost a must not entertain much hope of being able to hold out until must reach windward channel even if did might still fail to fall in with ship to pick up in case must have to go on to jamaica must scarcely reach under most favourable circumstance in le than fortnight disquieting thought however deemed prudent to confine to own breast about midnight worst apprehension a to course of raft be confirmed by discovery of breaker ahead knew from position of juanita on previous night must indicate nothing else than that be running down upon square handkerchief shoal of have hoped to pas clear to southward gave raft a much starboard helm a must take after long most anxious time succeeded in just scraping clear of breaker found be occasioned by extensive group of rock just awash sight of rock enabled to identify position a recognised in rock occupy north east corner of shoal be therefore passing a nearly a possible directly across middle of shoal instead of going to southward of a have hoped meanwhile pang of hunger thirst be steadily intensifying with tongue grew dry hard doctor lip began to crack while men must talk of nothing clear gurgling brook sparkling cascade by side of have stood in other day wind have freshened somewhat during night toward sun rise few cloud worked up to windward sight of induced for time to hope that might be blessed with shower passed over without dropping of longed for moisture upon sun once more rose up in unclouded splendour to torture with scorching ray repugnance to raw fowl have by time entirely passed away although upon examination poultry turned out to be rather high one of defunct chicken be torn asunder being divided among with most scrupulous fairness be devoured in incredibly short time ah exclaimed one of men a last morsel of allowance disappeared down throat be most tasty snack a have ate for many long day be pity there ai more of there s'pose wo do to eat up wittals to oncet let be thankful a have have even that small mossel say mate find here fowl bone very sweet picking uncommon answered there be sort of peculiar flavour with disremember to have tasted with fowl bone when have have 'em for breakfast afore there be unquestionably sort of peculiar flavour with share must scarcely have referred to with such gusto a did thought now if must only have washed breakfast down with pannikin of grog remarked third must have ' said a 'd thoroughly enj'yed grog exclaimed first speaker grog be blowed whenever have glass of grog always want on top of so must to day 'd give grog a ever be brewed for one good long swig at spring bubble out from under rock behind poor old mother house on dartmoor be sweet water if like mate 'tai sweeter know than water of trout stream in used to fish with bit of twine bent on to crooked pin when be boy remarked many time a have gone down on hand knee upon rock little bit of shingly bar when have be hot thirsty a might be now drunk drunk until must drink more eye mate be drink mistake so rambled on dry lip smacking with fresh reminiscence knew that sort of conversation must do more harm than good by intensifying feeling of burning thirst from be suffering so cut short by remarking by way lad speaking of fishing can not one of work up one of nail out of hatch into fish hook with knife others meanwhile might get thread out of piece of spare canvas cut off topgallant sail twist up into fishing line sooner said than done poor fellow be glad of something to employ mind finger upon went to work with avidity to carry out suggestion by sunset ordinary three inch nail have be hammered bent scraped down to very respectable substitute for hook while other three seaman have contrived to spin up about five fathom of good strong line hook line however be ever used breeze again freshened during night driving raft along about two knot in hour again uprose sun in cloudless sky divided of dead fowl between on morning there be none of cheerful chat have accompanied previous meal repulsive food be devoured in silence due probably in part to absence of hopeful topic of conversation also doubtless to great extent in consequence of dry sore swollen sensation in men throat for own part throat be in such state that be with utmost difficulty succeeded in swallowing own allowance hawsepipe doctor struck up a lively conversation a must touching probability of soon being picked up embraced opportunity of mentioning casually that in consequence of great amount of easting in wind feared must not reach land quite a soon a have at first anticipated be almost sorry immediately afterwards have mentioned when saw despairing look came into face of fellow sufferer yearning glance upward at pitiless sky showed not faintest fleece of cloud not remotest promise of single drop of pure fresh water wherewith to moisten parched baked tongue throat thirst agony now began to paint effect upon more more palpably hour lip being dry black gashed with deep crack while tongue be dry swollen until seemed too large for mouth skin upon face of companion be burnt parched shrivelled by sun seamed in direction by crack peeling off in many place while eye glowed sparkled like coal of fire with fierce fever consumed shark have stuck to with such frightful ominous pertinacity have number augmented day by arrival of three new comer six of 'em muttered seaman who be steering raft when three new arrival appeared mean a six out of seven be doomed endless day of indescribable agony long night of torment again up rose sun in pitiless cloudless sky oh how fervently longed prayed for overcast sky pelting rain even though be accompanied by wildest hurricane ever blew worst must happen to in case must be drowning prospect of seemed to be bliss compared with slow fiery torment of thirst on day tom mile ned rodgers two of four seaman suddenly sprang to foot with despairing yell plunged over side of raft into sea before be aware of must arrest terrible intention there be frightful splashing in water astern a sea monster fought over prey then be quiet again two of shark have disappeared companion regarded terrible tragedy almost with indifference doctor in weak cracked voice be scarcely audible muttered something to effect that two be happily out of suffering before sunset poor fellow have followed shark have disappeared time during night be awakened by hawsepipe whose trick at helm be aroused by giving feeble shake on shoulder being by time unable to speak raised hand pointed skyward looked up saw that firmament be obscured by heavy mass of cloud held out promise of speedy fall of thrice blessed rain scrambled to foot hastened to arouse two seaman in order that might take immediate measure to secure a much a possible of priceless liquid one of poor fellow be in such weak exhausted condition that be unable to rise other contrived to do so with utmost difficulty lowered down sail mast so a to form with canvas receptacle for expected blessing at length came in sudden squall of wind with few flash of lightning for two three minute poured down almost a heavily a did on night oh how many age ago seemed now when juanita be destroyed gathered round sail drank greedily recklessly of heaven sent nectar filled hat boot only receptacle with then drank drank again a long a drop remained in sail oh how grudged precious drop poured in stream through thin canvas to describe reviving effect delicious draught have upon exhausted frame be impossible strength voice returned to like magic spirit revived felt like new creature re hoisted mast sail into place with comparative ease then with one accord knelt down offered sincere heart felt thanks for mercy have be shown in extremity while raft swept cheerily away before rising blast at almost double usual speed on following day be again favoured with example of ease with almighty can supply want of creature even in such situation a ours for during forenoon shoal of flying fish rose out of water alongside passed directly over raft nearly score being intercepted in flight by sail caught before be able to flop off into water again thought that attempt to preserve must be sure to end in failure by quickly becoming unfit for
