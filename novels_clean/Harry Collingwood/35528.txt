secret of sand water lily crew by harry collingwood published by griffith farran london edition dated preface attention of public have be directed on more than one occasion within last few year to voyage of more le lengthy character undertaken in craft of very small tonnage great deal have be said written concerning foolhardiness of such undertaking however be more apparent than real though much must necessarily depend in such voyage on adventurer skill a seaman nerve self possession in critical moment almost if not quite a much will also depend upon design construction equipment of craft in adventure be undertaken where condition be favourable actual danger may be reduced in quite surprising degree such voyage however if of considerable length be sure to abound in adventure in selecting one a groundwork of story have be aim to endeavour at once to make interesting readable to who have liking for sea for nautical adventure to convey few useful hint gathered from own experience respecting design management of small craft of precaution be so absolutely necessary in navigating of must be distinctly understood that in selecting subject have have intention whatever of advocating recommending such voyage of underrating risk under most favourable circumstance involve purpose have simply be to combine little information with hope great deal of interest amusement if book serf to while pleasantly away idle hour two for general reader conveys scrap of useful information to young yachtsman that purpose will be fully accomplished harry collingwood october volume one

lifeless clay be beginning to say something with intention of diverting mind from so painful train of thought when interrupted eagerly yet continued poor a be be in power to make rich ay beyond utmost scope of imagination will will why must take secret to grave with in few hour will be beyond want of earthly rich senor be young look forward to long life doubtless like other men have already indulged in many bright day dream possession of wealth must go far to realise listen gentil senor must be brief for feel have time to lose have be shipwrecked once before be now nearly three year ago since sailed from valparaiso for canton whence be to proceed to bombay so home round cape of good hope be then chief mate met with nothing calm for first three week of passage after weather changed have succession of adverse gale until be within fifteen degree of line here be worse off than ever for at one moment be lying in glassy calm perhaps in five minute afterwards be under close reefed canvas possibly bare pole at length furious squall threw ship on beam end be compelled to cut away three of mast to save from foundering then squall settled down into perfect hurricane must hing suffer ship to drive dead before near midnight be flung violently to deck by tremendous shock ship be on shore dashing bottom out upon rock be so dark senor that be unable to see other oh horror of night be a fresh upon now a be at moment that happened poor fellow face be streaming with perspiration begged must not distress by recalling such painful recollection in spite of remonstrance continued story ship broke up beneath foot found swimming knew not where in midst of quantity of floating wreck to piece of clung be surrounded on side by breaker not far from must perceive by absence of phosphorescence that water be smooth urged plank to clung in direction soon reached smooth water after suffered to drift water be quite warm experienced inconvenience whatever from immersion after lapse of perhaps hour possibly more felt ground beneath foot staggering out of water flung upon dry land notwithstanding howling of wind roar of breaker fell into deep dreamless sleep when awoke sun be beating fiercely down upon uncovered head sky be cloudless calm have succeeded to gale of night before rose to foot on looking about discovered that have be cast upon one of coral island so thickly stud portion of pacific be a be now only one who escaped wreck alive body of shipmate lay scattered along shore long arduous day be spent in burying where lay in such willow graf a must scoop in sand with aid of piece of splintered plank beach be strewed with wreckage have be washed over reef into smooth water be overjoyed to find amongst long boat perfectly uninjured in visited scene of wreck there after diligent search found mean sufficiency of appropriate material to enable to fit for lengthened voyage be more than two month on island before preparation be complete for life be very enjoyable in delightful spot felt in hurry to get away at length whilst walking along beach one evening attention be attracted to three four piece of old worm eaten weather worn timber have often noticed before projecting above sand curiosity now impelled to walk up to examine careful scrutiny revealed to that formed part of framework of ship resolved must return next day ascertain whether what saw be merely detached piece of wreck whether entire hull lay there embedded in sand next morning repaired to spot armed with primitive substitute for shovel have contrived to manufacture iron bolt to serve purpose of crow bar have procured previous night by burning out of piece of wreck have worked for perhaps hour when reached planking immediately recognised a deck of ship proceeded to clear of sand uncovering deck in extending circle from spot where have first encountered until have area of about fifteen sixteen foot laid bare now met with breach in deck so instead of clearing away further began to dig down again toiled thus for four day senor by time have discovered that wreck be that of small vessel of perhaps one hundred thirty ton though small a be have be built with full poop that be very ancient craft indeed that cargo consisted of nothing gold senor be with solitary exception of strong wooden box even after so long interment offered considerable resistance to effort to open containing assortment of what took to be pebble of different kind afterwards found be unpolished gem yes senor there lay gold in ingot wrapped in matting ingot a much in weight a must well lift matting be decayed in first three four tier metal discoloured almost to blackness towards centre of cargo be probably not more than twelve tier deep altogether matting though so rotten that crumbled to dust a touched have preserved colour of metal there lay bar after bar gleaming with dull yellow lustre peculiar to virgin gold ballasted boat entirely with ingot selecting most discoloured must reach so that might be le easily recognisable a gold risk ran of being ultimately robbed of reduced in same proportion also took few of pebble a thought out of box after set to work to cover in whole once more completed task by burning down timber have at first attracted attention found be portion of stern frame so that nothing remained above surface of sand to betray whereabouts of treasure then carefully marked spot in such manner must find again completed preparation for departure with speed have be at sea ten day when be taken ill whether be effect of excitement exposure know not fell into raging fever left almost at point of death be so weak that have not strength to crawl to water cask feeble effort made to reach so exhausted that at length fell in swoon to bottom of boat in condition be discovered by passing ship crew of took on board a smart breeze happened to be blowing at time must not wait to hoist in boat be set adrift with enough gold on board to have purchased principality regret be useless loss heavy a be troubled little knew where to find sufficient to satisfy utmost need at length reached home by merest accident bethought one day of pebble suspected be valuable must not have be found where be judge of surprise when learned that four have left for lost rest somewhere be worth sufficient sum to enable to do exactly what wished viz buy ship of own did so be on way in to treasure island when gale sprung up have reduced to present condition now senor be about to put in possession of such information a will enable to find island be in latitude about s in longitude about w a nearly a have mean of ascertaining be uninhabited must say unknown for during entire stay there never observed one solitary sign of man foot having ever pressed soil will readily recognise island from fact that have remarkable isolated group of seven cocoa nut tree growing closely together on extreme northernmost point of island central tree of group one of others bear mark made by removal of piece of bark a large a man two hand when have identified tree walk away from keeping in one until open clear of tree on southern end of island portion of reef will observe just rising above water edge when have done will be standing a nearly a possible immediately above hole in deck of wreck through burrowed to golden cargo spaniard for such found to be then went on to describe manner in must find passage through reef into lagoon giving a much information a must from memory of various danger to be avoided have carefully prepared chart of channel before leaving island be on board vessel have just lost must see that excitement produced by so much talking be fearfully reducing strength more than once endeavoured to persuade to postpone completion of narrative be sensible that have short time to live so anxious be to give information necessary to enable to discover strangely buried treasure that endeavour to stop did more harm even than talking so be compelled perforce to suffer to proceed though felt duty to urge not to excite must confess be deeply interested to learn how might become possessed of wealth to have referred in such glowing term for since be manifest that must not live to enjoy a have declared have relative in world thought might a well become heir continued to talk for time longer until have explained to everything must think of must facilitate effort to reach buried treasure then with sigh of mingled exhaustion relief closed eye seemed to sink into half sleep from roused at frequent interval to crave refreshment of draught of lemonade at sound of carriage wheel be heard almost immediately afterwards bob returned accompanied by catholic priest sick man opened eye feebly welcomed good old man who have so readily answered appeal for spiritual consolation then retired leaving alone to engage in most solemn rite appertaining to religion rather more than hour elapsed before be recalled to sick room when stood once more at bedside of dying spaniard saw that have few minute longer to live be so weak clergyman said that be with utmost difficulty have succeeded in expressing wish to see again before died a drew near eye brightened faint smile of welcome lighted up face lip moved so faint be whisper escaped be obliged to bow face close to ere must distinguish word with painful effort gasped senor promise that if succeed will have two hundred mass said for soul when assured that request must be faithfully complied with contracted brow relaxed expression of anxiety vanished in place smile of satisfaction perfect happiness slowly spread over pinched pallid feature where next moment be indelibly fixed by hand of death have dwelt at such length upon introductory episode of story that must now turn hand up make sail in earnest for have voyage of many thousand of mile before like thorough seaman having once shipped for voyage be impatience personified until anchor be atrip canvas sheeted watch set lively little barkie dashing merrily away over heaving billow snowy canvas gleaming in setting sun cliff of old england fast fading into purple mist astern volume one chapter iii bob proposition after have reverently laid spaniard to rest in alien grave gave friend bob full accurate account of have passed showing at same time copious note have at earliest opportunity jotted down to assist refresh

dreamed of denying that be charmingly piquant irresistibly pretty temper be equable be gifted with rich flow of animal spirit keen perception of ludicrous must have upset gravity of most confirmed hypochondriac nevertheless if occasion required merry ringing laugh must be hushed joyous elasticity of movement must be subdued one better than must assume role of sick nurse tender sympathising

following voyage took chief mate berth in place of man whom father be compelled to discharge for confirmed drunkenness last time that poor father passed down channel outward bound bob have misfortune a thought then to fall off poop break arm be what surgeon call compound fracture certainly looked to be very ugly one so a ship happened at time to be off saint alban head father ran into weymouth road sent bob ashore to house to be cured to bear company shipping in stead second mate picking up new second mate somewhere about town thus happened that bob old shipmate a be happened to be away from ship when mysterious fate overtook a soon a be recovered sought obtained berth always in same ship for short voyage returning home about once in six week two month with hope of hearing that father have returned that news have arrived of for last twelve month have abandoned former hope latter must probably be many year before finally took flight introduction explanation be necessary to understanding of what be to follow now having fairly weathered may take up thread of story follow out to end without further interruption have already said that took early opportunity to give bob detailed account of spaniard revelation to be on evening of day on laid poor fellow in grave told story while sister be seated comfortably round fire after tea with curtain drawn close everything made snug for night bob listened with utmost attention to story a did also sister occasionally requesting to say that again a point in narrative be reached wished to bear particularly in mind when have finished sat for time staring meditatively between bar of grate at length well harry lad what do intend to do said replied be just point upon want advice if story be true fear about said bob be true enough thing a plain circumstantial a ship course when be pricked off upon chart there ai kink in yarn from end to end be coiled down a neat snug a new hawser in ropemaker yard besides dyin ' men spin yarn with truth in 'em just for divarsion sake like well said be disposed with to think that story be quite true man must have object in telling if be not so question be what be to be done in matter done exclaimed ada why what must be done harry except that go to island dig up gold bring home live like gentleman ever afterwards be ada great ambition must be placed in position of gentleman have theory whence derived know not that be destiny to become man of unbounded mean that life be to be passed in atmosphere of splendour luxury only equalled by enjoyed by most favoured hero of arabian night be entirely disinterested feeling on part too for though must often laughingly prophesy what must happen when must become rich man never knew to utter word suggested idea that must in way be gainer by acquisition of wealth more easily said than done pet replied patting soft cheek what be to become of whilst be gone why will stay here with mr moseley housekeeper until return be first to welcome back said well replied think suitable arrangement for comfort safety must be made without much difficulty said appealing to bob how be gold to be got at brought home in safety have not mean of purchasing ship of own if have do think must be safe to trust so much treasure with crew picked up though ever so carefully ah now 'pawls replied bob rubbing back of head reflectively have sailed with crew a might have trusted with untold gold at least have thowt so at time be with mayhap if temptation be throwed in way might be able to stand out agin there be gettin ' to bottom o ' heart o man a to ship be easy enough if ai got cash to buy can always charter true said if must make sure of finding sufficient number of thorough good men be course must be inclined to pursue do think bob by diligent search must find six eight really reliable men craft need not be large one know there have hit solution of enigmy a schoolmaster said replied bob bringing clenched fist down upon knee with emphasis impressed for remainder of evening how much of gold now do reckon must make fortune lad be pretty good at figure just cipher up let hear how much exclaimed oh very small portion of whole cargo must satisfy if have here at moment how much persisted bob must ton of be enough for boy yes indeed laughed ton of pure gold why what do suppose must be worth bob hai much of idee replied ton of pure gold said be worth over one hundred thousand pound bob believe one hundred twenty five thousand pound be nearer be value though can not say for certain then said bob if can manage to get say couple of ton of home will be satisfied eh perfectly replied how do propose to accomplish for saw have scheme to bring forward nothing easier replied bob build little craft big enough to accommodate two of with room to stow away grub water two ton of gold up anchor away said forget that island be somewhere in pacific craft a speak of must be totally unfit for voyage contemplate why inquired bob why repeated astonished at question simply because must never get across bay of biscay in to say nothing of remainder of voyage why not demanded bob rather pugnaciously do mean to say retorted that can sit there propose in cold blood hair brained scheme a two must undertake voyage to pacific in mere boat do replied bob emphatically be simple way out of difficulty craft will be own there will be risk of crew rising upon for sake of cargo nobody to say what be doing here ' what do want there ' why will be mere pleasure trip from end to end play work leastways none to speak on dear fellow do be serious protested know a well a do that must be swamped first time fell in with capful of wind maybe must if went to work like couple of know nothing land lubber retorted bob if went to work like seaman a be must like to know what be to purvent sailing round world if like answer that come bob old man let hear full extent of proposition said know that may be will be proposal of thorough seaman for if one must carry out wild scheme have suggested be man 'tai such very wild scheme replied bob answer how many people be saved from london when foundered in bay of biscay nineteen if remember rightly replied very well now if small boat of about twenty five foot long thereabouts open mind from stem to starn must live twenty hour with nineteen people in a london pinnace did in weather that old ship must stand up agin how long will full decked boat of say thirty to thirty five foot long carefully constructed in good trim live with only two men in war continued nineteen day alone in open boat in south atlantic did make v y'ge of thousand mile in afore struck sounding at saint helena last question referred to adventure have befallen bob in younger day on occasion when have be cruelly deserted in sinking ship by rest of crew have made escape a described by after enduring unheard of suffering then questioned seriously entertain belief that scheme have suggested be practicable with ease comfort replied bob now look here harry can afford to build craft such a have described fit out for v y'ge still leave money enough at home to keep sauce box here indicating ada who be to a apple of eye comfortable happy like till come back have rare eye for sea boat mine ai bad for matter let draught out since be own life a be going to trust in if turn out between a pretty sea boat a ever floated why turn to lay up in ordinary for rest of day for useless old hulk be boat thirty foot long decked over carefully designed ca sink boy because can easily arrange matter so a to keep dry inside will ride a light a gull a dry a bone when big ship be making bad weather of a for matter of capsizing bein ' run down cast away why be danger a be liable to in ship must be guarded against in craft large small little barkie must carry comfortable must want for v y'ge for must touch here there out home to make good deficiency two be men enough to handle in weather rig a cutter boy be once't aboard cutter yacht in trip up mediterranean have idea what handy rig be once be used to way cutter will hug wind why 'twould make difference of nigh on couple of thousand mile out home in length of passage began to be infected with bob enthusiasm scheme have at first appeared to a very acme of fool hardiness now under influence of bob eloquence gradually assumed appearance of reasonableness promising prospect of success be very fascinating nevertheless must not remember that proposed voyage must take into latitude subject to most frightful sudden tempest must not help thinking a pointed out to bob that cockle shell must stand poor chance in cyclone black squall look here harry boy remarked bob gravely a propose to ship on here v ' a chief mate ai likely to forget that there be such danger a have just mentioned suppose be to cork up bottle clap lid on empty biscuit tin heave overboard do think 'd live through one t'other in course must because salt water ca get inside of 'em a long a keep dry hold will float let weather be what will so will craft for same reason when weather too bad to sail barkie can heave to when be too bad for that can anchor boy go below slide on top of companion turn in until weather clear up said can not anchor in middle of atlantic suppose must be caught in cyclone there for instance can anchor there lad with floating anchor will keep head to wind with everything snug aloft on deck floating anchor ahead with about sixty fathom of cable veered out must ride out in safety gale that ever blew out of heaven last remark closed case secured verdict for defendant knew that word bob spoke be literally true audacity of enterprise so fascinated that resolved on spot to undertake if must be found on going into detail that craft capable of being handled by two self must stow away without being overloaded such provision etc a must need for voyage following morning immediately after breakfast got out drawing board strained sheet of paper upon with bob at side to give benefit of opinion upon line traced upon paper set to in earnest to design little craft in proposed to embark on adventurous voyage before putting line upon paper however settled plan of internal arrangement be intention to make line a fine a respective dimension must permit be to be in fact small yacht knew that vessel with sharp line must necessarily be wet unless weight must have to carry be concentrated about midship section broadest part so decided that a far a be practicable such must be arrangement with knew that if must succeed in barkie might be a sharp a must make still be dry comfortable accordingly prepared list of requirement a far a must think of calculated space ballast must occupy then roughly sketched out proposed line be altered rearranged improved upon time after time until at length felt have got a near perfection a dimension of boat own knowledge must carry may a well say at once throughout entire voyage never have slightest reason to think little vessel must be in way improved upon by alteration be not probable that so long voyage a ours will be often undertaken again in such very small craft a accomplished in there be many men have doubt who must gladly receive hint a to most advantageous form for small boat in might safely adventure alone with friend cruise say round british isle across channel along french coast therefore a story be written for amusement only of such people a love boat think may venture to trespass so far on reader patience a to give such hint in shape of brief description of water lily a ada christened be then thirty six foot long twelve foot beam on water line in designing midship section caused side to swell out boldly above water so that greatest beam be fourteen foot at point one foot six inch above water line at point side tumbled home two inch a be carried upwards to deck from same point side curved quickly inwards downwards until met water line when swept under water with almost imperceptible curve for distance then took moderately quick bend downwards to meet keel gave vessel in shape very much like centre board model of boat with deep keel consequently great lateral resistance space low down in hull for stowage of ballast thus secured very small displacement light buoyant hull extraordinary stability fair amount of power hull be divided into three compartment by bulkhead with wide door if necessary must close water tight in fore compartment decided to place nothing except smallest lightest cooking stove must find in midship compartment be intended to stow ballast water tank provision chain cable in fact everything must possibly place there leaving only narrow passage amidships to pas to fro after compartment intended to make cabin there arranged also to sling hammock will easily be understood that there be not inch of spare room anywhere a life must be spent almost entirely on deck did not mind that very much having designed craft next question be who must build bob be strongly in favour of having built in town so that might oversee laying of plank driving of nail knew there be firm who must safely be trusted to honestly put best of work material into little vessel without being watched determined to put into hand of very celebrated firm of london boat builder accordingly bob ran up to town taking sister with for holiday on morning after arrival having seen ada safely disposed of for day with friend of ours two men set out for building yard placed design in hand of principal telling at same time that wanted boat of dimension if possible built on line that be intended to keep at sea in weather looked rather surprised at last stipulation after carefully examining drawing asking reason for certain little peculiarity of shape confessed that a far a experience went must frankly say have never seen model better adapted for purpose yet gentleman said will be wonderfully fast for in first place hull be of such shape that will offer trifling resistance to forward motion in next place overhanging top side will give such extraordinary stability a soon a begin to heel over will be able to carry enormous sail be very glad to hear own judgment thus confirmed by man part of whose business be to form correct opinion with respect to point upon have touched said a much took great deal of interest in what must after have be very trifling matter to bob have reason often afterwards to congratulate ourselves that have confided building of boat to such good hand proposed that must be composite built be that for sake of lightness strength combined frame must be of steel with inner skin of thin steel plate outer planking of two thickness of mahogany rib be to be arranged diagonally crossing keel at angle of forty five degree intersecting other at right angle thus converting entire frame into sort of lattice work girder be arranged that fastening of inner thickness of planking must be of iron whilst outside plank must be secured with copper fastening utmost care be exercised a experience proved with complete success to prevent slightest approach to galvanic action one of precaution taken be remember well painting of inner planking with melted india rubber be laid on coat after coat until there be about one sixteenth of inch of rubber between outer inner plank a did not intend to sail until following summer builder have about eight month in to put little ship together circumstance at expressed great satisfaction a said must enable to pick choose material put careful work into arranged at same time for construction of boat to take with a felt that in event of untoward accident happening ought to have something to take to for saving of life knew also that there must be many occasion when must require something to answer purpose boat answer with regard to ship designing of boat be beset by difficulty originating in one viz want of space in to stow to think of carrying on deck be out of question a deck be not spacious enough in first place to receive boat a wanted even have be there be chance of remaining there must have be carried away by first sea swept over required something large enough to carry stock of provision in addition so must be necessary to abandon water lily might hope to reach land fall in with ship also wanted something must be essentially life boat whilst must also be very fast how to obtain desideratum at same time overcome difficulty in respect to room knew not resolved not to be baffled set wit to work at length schemed out design of exceedingly novel character proved in respect most brilliant success two hollow steel cylinder of very thin metal twenty six foot long one foot diameter in centre tapering gradually away to nothing at end be constructed in thirteen length of two foot length being of different diameter stowed one within other thus taking up very little room indeed in end of length be inserted narrow band of metal thick enough to allow of worm screw so that length of cylinder must be screwed together perfectly water tight light steel framework of simple arrangement connected two cylinder together at distance of six foot apart with centre line parallel supported at height of two foot above top of cylinder light stage ten foot long six foot wide on top of stage connected with framework be step for mast gammon iron for bowsprit underneath stage be centre board must lower raise at pleasure broad rudder fixed to after part of stage completed design spent fortnight in london having witnessed laying of water lily keel inspected of timber builder proposed to use in construction saw ada safe home again leaving bob in london to look out for ship when rejoined couple of day afterwards have found shipped in for voyage to constantinople trebizond occupied for eight month when returned to london on termination of voyage found water lily completed with exception of few finishing touch workman be then giving volume one chapter iv trial trip mr wood a will call for sake of giving gentleman name took into office there laid before sail draught have carefully prepared for guidance of sailmaker in making water lily sail have never told gentleman said why be having little craft built great pain have taken in preparation of design whole tenour of remark when giving order to build impressed at time with conviction that destiny be to be something beyond of most vessel of size a proceeded with work must not fail to be struck a will perhaps remember be at first glance at drawing with fact that whilst be eminently calculated to prove wonderfully fine little sea boat be equally certain to develop most extraordinary sailing power so great be interest take in must not be satisfied with intrusting preparation of sail draught to other than for foresee that will in probability become public character ' so to speak in capacity will undoubtedly reflect great credit on builder have therefore calculated with utmost nicety proportion of various sail so that may take effect to greatest advantage be result of labour producing at same time drawing to have referred must confess that for own part be staggered at enormous spread of canvas mr wood proposed to pile upon little boat declared that must carry with greatest ease in fact said have kept rather within limit of power bearing in mind remark made to effect that must have to keep to sea in weather so confident be that be not over sailed that if find be wrong undertake to bear expense of new outfit of sail necessary reduction of spar with regard to boat ' though to mind look much more like ingeniously designed raft idea be so new that can not take upon to utter opinion about though can see reason why must not be a fast a undoubtedly be safe sent off sail drawing to lapthorn of gosport determined to have best made suit of sail be possible to procure with instruction to prepare without delay then started off by first train to weymouth found dear sister safe well more lovely than ever spirit be subdued by contemplation of danger attending voyage upon be now so soon to embark poor girl have be thinking of little else seemed during absence until liveliest alarm have taken place of confidence with have viewed expedition when be first broached bob have talked matter over together in many quiet night watch canvassing various emergency might arise best mode of meeting be now confident that with only ordinary peril of ocean to contend with adventure be not only feasible that must certainly be crowned with success so be well prepared to do battle with ada apprehension did so vigorously that at length succeeded in restoring in great measure confidence have lost arranged after considerable amount of discussion that own house must be let furnished a be during absence that sister must take up quarter with aunt who resided on esplanade mr moseley accompanying with unlimited leave of absence from time to time to visit own relative arrangement completed bob set out for london again to superintend rigging of boat to bring round to weymouth from whence intended to take final departure on arrival found little craft already in water with mast stepped ballast be of lead cast to fit shape of bottom in portion of ballast consisting of piece of lead weighing five hundredweight be let into keel about midship section with two ton of lead inside thought must prove sufficient after cargo be stowed part of cargo intended to take from london with viz water tank filled second suit of sail flying kite in shape of spinnaker jib topsail square headed gaff topsail etc also four pound rifle gun with stock of powder shot few percussion shell decided to take in case of being obliged to assume warlike attitude towards savage might come into contact with a have heard that native of of pacific island be particularly ferocious require to be dealt with promptly also provided with couple of air gun of improved construction decidedly formidable character four six chambered revolving rifle same number of revolver pistol also small excellent chest of carpenter tool medicine chest etc when boat be stowed away there still remained more room than expected in midship compartment little craft floated with load line nearly foot above water edge proposed ballasting down to proper depth with sand bag bob seemed anxious to test sail carrying power light a be urging that though must start well down in water must lift a provision grew short be desirable to know by experiment beforehand how far must lighten with safety sail have arrived proceeded to bend forthwith set a weather being fine with light air very favourable opportunity offered for stretching gently uniformly be a pleased with sail a be with hull of little craft be perfect masterpiece of sailmaker art jib being angulated mainsail square headed gaff topsail trysail being made with gored cloth latter arrangement be extravagant one a to amount of cloth used in making of sail be more than repaid for by perfection of set in sail stood a flat a board storm sail be made of stout canvas fine weather one of american cotton canvas most beautiful material extremely light yet so close woven not breath of faintest breeze be lost be white a snow standing rigging be of wire being lighter offering le windage than hemp rigging of same strength in order to counteract rigidity give play to spar adopted expedient of connecting dead eye to chain plate by bolt shackle arrangement interposing thick india rubber washer between shackle bolt head plan answered most admirably must strongly recommend to user of wire rigging be confident that in fresh breeze chopping sea gained fully knot per hour in speed by whilst sail be stretching bob occupied time in looking about for few thing thought must better obtain in london than anywhere else amongst be couple of air mattress for hammock when fully inflated be capable of sustaining weight of three men in water article be cooking stove smallest lightest most compact thing of kind ever saw have boiler capable of heating quart of water oven large enough to bake fowl with kettle saucepan etc for top grate proper be filled with fragment of substance name of have forgotten underneath grate be sliding tray held six lamp lamp being lighted placed in position speedily raised substance in grate to state of incandescence there be fire gave out tremendous heat for size of grate a aid to stove economiser of fuel purchased also most extraordinary invention be named norwegian cooking stove if remember rightly be not stove at though performed function of one be simply box so constructed that retained heat dish might happen to contain when placed in mode of operation be to place fowl pie what not in oven until be thoroughly hot through then take out place in norwegian shut up for two three hour take out lo dinner be cooked to perfection fuel affair saved during voyage must have bought dozen of spent week looking about for such thing a be confident that for economy of space be able to secure through aid of contrivance voyage must have come to sudden ignominious conclusion at length be ataunto sail stretched to perfection properly bent impedimenta carefully snugly stowed everything ready for start at instigation through kindness of yachting friend of mine have be introduced to be elected member of royal yacht club so one fine morning towards latter end of july loosed sail set ran club burgee up to mast head ensign up to peak made start for weymouth at last moment mr wood builder of little craft came on board saying that a have nothing very pressing for day be curious to see something of way in water lily behaved must take passage with a far a gravesend if have objection be only too pleased to have company of course gave cordial welcome moment came on board cast off mooring ran up jib foresail slid rapidly away from shore wind be moderately fresh from northward so started under mainsail foresail jib with topmast lowered a being in very light trim did not think advisable to run risk by crowding sail upon barkie found a have expected that on even keel be crank though hot to extent have anticipated a began to heel over overhanging topside supported so that a breeze freshened did gradually more lay down to stiffer became a confidence in stability sail carrying power thus became established grew anxious to try pace forthwith got topmast on end rigging set up put square headed gaff topsail upon be very large sail for size of vessel though like mainsail be not particularly high in hoist sail be very much peaked gaff topsail so much so that yard be almost straight up down with setting of big topsail immediate very marked improvement in speed became manifest before have be darting along at very respectable speed passing smart looking schooner a though have be at anchor now little craft fairly rushed through water making hiss smoke under sharp bow leaving long wake of bubble behind heeled over still more of course be with steady kind of resistance to force of wind did finally away with lurking fear might have have that be over sparred over sailed hove patent log found that be spinning along good eight knot through water indeed came up with passed with ease several vessel be being towed down river bob be enchanted mr wood scarcely le so when shortly after luncheon stepped into boat have hailed to put on shore at gravesend said be sure little craft will come with credit out of ordeal through be going to put whatever may be so gentleman hope will favour on return with full account of adventure took leave of with hearty shake of hand faithful promise that must do so promise intend to fulfil by sending handsomely bound copy of log a soon a printed let draw fore sheet resumed course down river met with adventure worthy of record on passage down unless except amusement derived from chagrin of crew of french steamer bound to havre who to amazement found that little english yacht by cutting off corner skimming across shoal similar manoeuvre be slowly drawing ahead of though after passing sheerness gradually crept ahead of at first yet a wind freshened continued to carry on until water be over deck on lee side half way up to companion actually overtook passed until to escape ignominious defeat set own sail so drew away from by eight o'clock night be off north foreland bowling along at slashing pace with mainsail boomed out to starboard spinnaker set on port side jib foresail stowed be glorious summer evening there be prospect of being fine night aneroid evinced if anything tendency to rise there be good slice of moon left though must be rather late in rising so determined to keep going night by ten o'clock be flying through down very ticklish work be to thread in out between ship at anchor there beating up without experiencing jibe by dint of sharp look out did by midnight be off dover here took in spinnaker jibbed boom over to port set jib foresail bob wanted spinnaker set again on starboard side must not agree to a though have be on deck hitherto insisted on taking middle watch alone while went below for four hour sleep did not think prudent to leave alone with so large unmanageable sail wanted to take in gaff topsail also bob must not hear of such thing insisted that be under easy manageable canvas that there be nothing like making passage while have opportunity in sentiment fully agreed with still thought better to err on safe side at least for present until have become better acquainted with capability of craft bob be obdurate at last have to give in rest content with assurance that must give timely warning if must become necessary to shorten sail when came on deck at four o'clock found be just off dungeness in midst of outward bound fleet of ship of size almost nation wind appeared to have freshened somewhat during bob watch morning be beautifully clear fine a spar seemed to bear with utmost ease sail be carrying thought might venture to try effect of little extra muslin accordingly before relieving bob at tiller roused out spinnaker again a have hauled up couple of point for beechy head just a came on deck got to bowsprit end set with sheet led aft to main boom end in place of jib with foresail stowed bob then went below turned in first giving strict injunction to call at seven bell that might turn out prepare breakfast for now appeared that intended to unite function of chief mate cook steward on voyage have just started upon so auspiciously substitution of spinnaker for jib foresail made very great difference in rate of sailing when first came on deck noticed distance astern splendid clipper ship bowling along with stitch of canvas set must draw up to skysail royal studding sail by time have got spinnaker set be abreast of about mile outside consequently to leeward now be unable to draw away from inch so great be speed through smooth water when bob came on deck at seven bell still lay a nearly a possible in same position with regard to a when went below phew whistled a eye fell on so big chap have found match have in craft size of own long boat eye harry here be little flyer mistake why post office people will be wanting to carry mail for if so be a get to hear on eh lad closing remark with chuckle of intense satisfaction leer at big neighbour bob dived below again shortly afterwards frizzling sound from forward odour strongly suggestive of bacon egg be wafted upwards from companion informed that have entered upon duty of le dignified equally important part of combined appointment made hearty breakfast off aforesaid bacon egg with soft tack laid in day before washed down with most excellent coffee in concoction of beverage bob be adept then a soon a have washed up put matter to right in pantry made arrangement for dinner went below turned in until noon when went upon deck again found that breeze have softened down very considerably be slipping along barely five knot through water big neighbour ship must hing with in such light air be now good six mile astern during afternoon wind dropped still more by eight o'clock in evening have little more than steerage way water be absolutely without ripple sail flapped main boom swung inboard with heave of little craft over long gentle undulation of ground swell different vessel in sight be heading to point of compass be to appearance stark calm yet there must have have be light though imperceptible air for on looking over bow there be smooth unbroken ripple stretching away on side showing that be moving through water still though very gently fact that little craft answered helm be additional testimony to same effect during night little air came out from off land mended pace somewhat be not until following noon that got fairly abreast of saint catherine point about eight o'clock same evening wind still being light be abreast of needle about couple of mile to westward of apparently steering pretty nearly same course a saw cutter yacht about own size by midnight be abreast of durlstone head have gained so much upon other cutter that must make out that have large apparently very merry party on board hearty peal of laughter came frequently across water towards from occasionally song generally with good rattling chorus continued to creep up to at length got abreast of so near with advantage of good run active man might have leaped from one vessel to other a ranged up alongside most aristocratic looking man stepped to leeward grasping lightly with one hand aftermost shroud while with other slightly lifted straw hat in salute inquired what cutter be that water lily royal yacht club replied what cutter be that emerald royal victoria answered new acquaintance have singularly fast vessel under continued believe may say be first that ever passed in such weather a have hitherto thought that in light wind emerald have not match afloat yet be stealing through lee a if be at anchor presume by course be steering that be like bound to weymouth if so must like to step on board when arrive if will allow be curious to see little more of craft be able to slip away from a be doing in own weather be lord explained thinking suppose that must like to know who be who thus invited on board perfect stranger shouted back for be by time distance ahead of emerald must be happy to see lordship on board whenever pleased to come then conversation ceased distance between two vessel having become too great to permit of being continued with comfort be now bob watch below night be so very close that have brought bed on deck be preparing to turn in on weather side of companion for four hour sleep a arranged bedding to satisfaction cast eye frequently astern to emerald whose sail gleamed ghostly in feeble light of moon in third quarter be just rising by george harry exclaimed if emerald bai shifting topsail be miserable sinner ay there go ballooner ' aloft lordship like look of tail seemin'ly doubt whether in light breeze big topsail will enable to catch eye how did slip through lee sure enough tell ye what harry lad that topsail of our'n be good un rare good un for reach in moderate breeze ought to have ballooner ' for running off wind in light weather whacking big un with jack a long a bowsprit yard a long a lower mast be beginning to think be under sparred under sailed must scarcely agree with bob in be true that in fine weather must carry considerably more canvas than have have thought for heavy weather also knew that a soon a came on to blow must find present sail quite a large a must manage nevertheless made up mind that must have balloon topsail a voyage must be long one be possible that might have spell of light wind for day together when such sail must be carried to utmost advantage notwithstanding change of topsail still continued to creep away from emerald when let go anchor in weymouth road about six o'clock next morning be still good three mile outside of wind have in meantime fallen away so light that be not until after have breakfasted that drifted slowly in brought up close to shortly afterwards lord came on board accompanied by two three friend astonishment be great when found that only mustered two hand told noticed absence of boat from deck inquired whether have lost ours be still more astonished when informed that be taken to piece stowed snugly away below led to request that might be allowed to see gradually came out that be bound on nothing le than voyage to pacific be by mean inquisitive question be merely such a one yachtsman must naturally put to knew beforehand that must be difficult to conceal fact that be not merely cruising for pleasure so have come to conclusion that must be best to put bold face upon matter state at once that be going long trip bob have proposed that in event of question being asked must give out that be going to seek for trace of father to willingly agreed a really meant if possible to endeavour to find clue to fate though must not help acknowledging to myself that if did make discovery must be by merest accident lord seemed to be singularly struck with model of water lily only fault found with being deficiency of head room below fault however be inseparable from peculiar shape for a have already stated have very willow body flat floor although drew seven foot of water aft depth below platform be entirely taken up with ballast water tank leaving only height of four foot between top of platform under side of beam be in short exceedingly small craft for tonnage went ashore in lordship boat at invitation a casually mentioned that meant on morrow to put boat together give trial very kindly offered to accompany in emerald sister be of course delighted to see equally delighted to hear how thoroughly satisfied be with little vessel be evident that have not quite conquered apprehension on score of long voyage in so small craft eulogium upon water lily many good quality be so enthusiastic confidence expressed in sea going power so thorough ada soon came to regard voyage a in degree more perilous than must have be if undertaken in vessel of four five hundred ton did not think necessary to point out to that must probably be exposed to many peril besides of sea so dear girl became satisfied learned to contemplate speedy departure with comparative equanimity next morning made arrangement with boatman for hire of punt during short time that intended to remain in weymouth a wished tubular boat to come into use only when have other to fall back upon having struck bargain bob jumped into hired punt rowed off to water lily lay at anchor in roadstead be necessary to pas close to emerald to reach own craft a pulled under stern lord hailed to know whether still intended to make trial trip if so how long must be ere must be ready replied that hoped to be ready in about hour whereupon lordship jumped into boat to pay visit to post office saying must be back in time to go out with a soon a got on board water lily got tube on deck screwed different section together launched overboard framework connecting two tube together supporting stage deck be next fixed then deck be in three piece so contrived that when properly put together laid in place single bolt secured whole immovably centre board rudder be soon in place nothing remained to step mast bowsprit set up rigging bend sail be off latter operation took very short time a device have be adopted must facilitate boat equipment having timed ourselves found that boat be ready under weigh within hour of time at have first begun to work at considered very smart work hoped to shorten time considerably after little practice took few turn in bay whilst emerald be getting under weigh tried few manoeuvre with perfect success there be only one thing about have doubt be whether must stay in smooth water close to shore wind be strong from south west that day tacked beautifully head reaching long way in stay later on in day found that in respect rough water made very little difference to owing to peculiar shape of tube be blowing strong breeze from south west a have already said took down reef in mainsail whilst emerald started under trysail jib keeping mainsail stowed so a not to run away from intended to run out round shamble light ship back a soon a got clear of bay from under lee of nothe hauled sharp upon wind to test stability of craft to astonishment did not appear to feel effect of wind at except a tended to urge through water skimmed along very fast stood quite upright under circumstance of course shook reef out bore up for run away to leeward emerald must hing with at game much to chagrin of noble owner so be obliged to in trysail set mainsail whilst hove to waited for even after mainsail be set have advantage of be regular racer long lean deep in water whilst floated entirely upon surface tube being exactly half submerged a noticed when first started consequence be that skimmed along like feather whilst emerald have to displace many ton of water with foot of progress made passed through opening in magnificent breakwater shelter roadstead at portland soon afterwards began to feel heave of channel tube boat rushed along over crest of wave with very easy steady motion emerald started rolling a drew farther off land got more into influence of rough water rolling motion became so violent that boom have to be topped up pretty high to prevent from dipping dragging in water time rolled to leeward bob sat watching attentively for time at length be here emerald little eight tonner a took so many prize last year in regatta said replied that be well said beat to nothing in calm next door to last night in lily be thinking must run under water in breeze like here with jump of sea a will get when round to on road back what be idee lad think must replied be so long narrow that must be regular wet one close hauled a expect will see shortly if remember rightly prize be won in light wind smooth water though believe must do anything with in staggering whole sail breeze in smooth water fancy must give good account of in channel match must bear in mind bob that lily be larger craft of two deny retorted bob heavier may be a to tonnage accordin ' to way tonnage be measured be got double power will bet 'lowance of grog for next month to come that be got good seven ton more of lead stowed away under cabin floor whilst have got two besides trifle in keel power a know well harry be what tell in breeze take round in spite of difference of tonnage reckon be pretty much of size consequently very fair match so far a go must like to be alongside of in lily in such breeze such water a by time be close to light ship still leading in minute shot under stern hauled up on port tack now felt full strength of breeze be somewhat alarmed to find how fresh be blowing be a stiff a house must have carried half a much sail again have there be more to set lowered centre board just before hauling up now found tearing along in manner perfectly astounded long slender pointed tube appeared to offer resistance whatever to passage through water motion be delightfully easy gentle tube piercing body of wave a rolled towards without slightest shock lifting gently easily over cap of just a seemed upon point of coming in upon deck there be not atom of spray be a dry going to windward a when running free with emerald be very different huge mainsail be almost too much for now that be hauled close upon wind a looked astern must see taking plunge after plunge sending sharp bow clear through sea at dive until jib foresail be wet half way up to head whilst lee rail be completely buried in boiling surge now that be close hauled emerald walked up to though by mean so rapidly a might have be expected there be comparison between power of two craft yet though certainly dropped to leeward little more than did be only little difference in speed be very trifling considering great difference in size between cutter about quarter of hour after rounded light ship emerald passed close to windward presented most beautiful sight at least to nautical eye a swept by be heeling over to such extent that water be up over deck on lee side nearly to skylight companion immense sail be driving so irresistibly through short jumping sea that have time to rise to a met bowsprit plunged deeply into advancing wave sharp bow cleft asunder then a rose through amidst blinding shower of spray water shipped forward rushed foaming aft to leeward like swollen mountain torrent until mingled with water flooded deck to leeward a soon a be past crew hauled down couple of reef in mainsail set smaller jib of course relieved very materially if anything rather increased than diminished speed a kept sailing round round with ease until be well over towards weymouth road once more have become perfectly evident that needed looking after a soon a be quite satisfied of lord made best of way to anchorage brought up having have such dusting a ought to have satisfied for time to come a for bob be a pleased with novel boat a be possible to be proved to be perfect success in way when took tube to piece to stow away found that so accurately have joint be made that not drop of water have penetrated to interior of one alteration however resolved to make be in size of sail boat be stiff enough to carry much larger sail than have provided for a did not know that time might come when speed must be matter of most vital importance to determined to furnish with sail a large a be prudent to carry also decided to alter rig somewhat by substituting what be known among initiated a sliding gunter for gaff mainsail give mainsail jib headed topsail in one whilst doe away with gaff altogether whereby obtain much flatter standing sail indeed when sail be properly cut be not difficult sail to shape there be nothing to beat in respect accordingly despatched order to lapthorn night for new suit of sail also for balloon topsail for water lily dimension of satisfied even bob greedy a be for canvas meantime remainder of store be ordered received shipped ten day after arrival in weymouth road have everything on board must think of a necessary likely to be in degree useful to on voyage when be shipped found have made mistake somewhere in calculation not only have rather more room than expected little craft still floated rather higher than regular load line therefore took in ton more lead ballast brought down to within inch of proper trim with determined to rest satisfied volume one chapter v gale in bay of biscay on evening of wednesday august th having wished friend good bye pressed last kiss upon lip of sobbing sister ran hastily down flight of stone step before aunt front door crossed road walked briskly down esplanade until overtook bob who have gone on before then proceeded together to new quay end found man of whom have hired punt paid money got to row on board water lily have arranged to start at daybreak on following morning a pulled off to cutter remarked that there be nice little breeze blowing from westward a evening be beautifully fine clear with promise of brilliant starlight when night must have fully set in idea occurred to that might just a well be getting on down channel at once a be lying at anchor night accordingly a soon a got on board loosed set canvas hove up anchor in hour afterwards be slipping through opening in portland breakwater in little more than hour after be clear of dreaded bill when noticing that small drain of flood tide be still making hauled wind on port

on starboard tack be eight hour out that night when took tiller at eight o'clock be dashing along good honest eight knot under whole canvas jib headed gaff topsail night be a fine a previous one with little more wind be just beginning to get within influence of atlantic swell there be sea on long majestic heaving swell be sweeping with stately motion towards channel rising like low hill on side of a little barkie sank between gleaming coldly like polished steel where moon ray fell upon crest little lily sprang gaily onward upon course mounting watery ridge gliding down into liquid valley with ease grace of sea bird without throwing so much a drop of water upon deck serenity beauty of night brilliancy of star studded deep purple vault above gentle murmur of wind through cutter rigging combined to produce sensation of solemnity almost amounting to melancholy within thought flew back to beloved sister have so recently parted with wondering whether be at moment thinking of whether must ever meet again if so how long hence under what circumstance so on so on until be recalled to myself by sprinkling of spray upon cheek whereupon awoke in first place to fact that breeze have so far freshened that lily be flying through water with lee gunwale pretty well under in second to knowledge have outstayed watch good half hour lost time in calling bob a soon a came upon deck got gaff topsail down topmast housed then went below turned in have time before leaving deck to notice that went through water quite a fast if not trifle faster now that lee gunwale be just awash a did when be buried couple of plank up deck in water when bob called at expiration of watch found on going on deck that wind have continued to freshen through four hour have be below be now blowing quite strong breeze have gradually hauled round to about north west too brought well upon starboard quarter be flying along at tremendous pace with sheet eased well off although by change be running off wind consequently did not feel full force decided to take down single reef in mainsail shift jib for there be windy look in sky seemed to promise very strong blow shortly did not wish to disturb bob when perhaps about half way through four hour sleep so got to assist in making preparation before left deck promise be amply fulfilled a sun rose higher in sky wind freshening rapidly hauling still farther round from northward a did so by time bob came on deck again at seven bell to prepare breakfast have hand full sea be fast getting up began to tremble for spar gear glass have fallen rather suddenly altogether there seemed to be prospect of regular summer gale bob be of same opinion a myself in respect so decided to get everything snug in readiness for blow before thinking of breakfast be rather ticklish job for be now blowing far too strong to round to shorten sail required something more than freshwater seamanship to get big mainsail in without getting into trouble bob seemed perfectly at home set weather topping lift up hand taut took turn with lee one then dropped peak of mainsail until end of gaff be pressing against lee lift triced tack right up to throat then let run throat halliard hauled down throat of sail by tack tripping line whilst rounded in upon main sheet then by lowering away peak carefully gathering in canvas a came down got big sail snugly down without trouble carefully stowed covered up with coat next bob got jib in close reefed bowsprit set smallest storm jib with sheet eased well off hauled in weather fore sheet until be just in wake of mast little barkie be then left to take care of whilst got trysail bent set done filled away again upon course with reduced speed be true very comfortably indeed be well took precaution when did for by noon that day have hardened down into regular summer gale with really formidable sea for so small craft still continued to run away very nearly dead before that too without deviating from proper course managed with utmost difficulty in consequence of violent motion of boat to get observation at noon by found that have run since six o'clock on previous evening distance of le than one hundred sixty four mile placed at about entrance to bay of biscay be thus running into in gale of wind still did not experience slightest degree of alarm little craft be behaving beautifully angelically bob termed really almost merited expression a fell away into trough of sea low sail must become almost becalmed under lee of following wave a lifted with wind must again fill out must dart away again just in time to escape mishap of being pooped by breaking hissing crest at four pm again succeeded in obtaining observation time for longitude on working up proved to be rather to leeward of proper track so hauled up point so at six o'clock decided to try what be like when hove to watching opportunity brought to wind on starboard tack first stowing foresail found to great delight that rode like gull beyond occasional shower of spray shipped not drop of water although gale be still increasing sea rising rapidly took reef in trysail afterwards hoisting gaff a high a must go so a to avoid a much a possible being becalmed in trough of sea then be snug for night bob be veteran seaman have be in many heavy blow before in gale in fact to be mere nothing comparatively speaking yet of must help feeling impressed for myself may say somewhat awe stricken at sublimity of scene a evening closed in hitherto experience of gale of wind have come to with good wholesome ship under foot now found face to face with one in mere boat little more than toy craft sea though nothing like a high a have frequently seen before now wore more formidable aspect than must ever have believed possible hackneyed expression of running mountain high seemed strictly applicable fairly own to having experienced for believe first time in life qualm two of fear on night liquid hill foaming ridge a high a top of lower mast swept down upon with impetuous fury seemed irresistible effect be further heightened a darkness closed around by phosphorescent glare gleam of breaking crest lily rose lightly buoyantly to a rushed down upon surmounting crest in blinding shower of spray then settling easily into trough between next one roaring of gale too angry hiss of storm lashed water contributed quota to feeling of awe with looked abroad from pigmy ark confidence returned after while a watched ease with little craft overrode sea when at length turned into hammock be with sense of security must not have believed possible couple of hour before hoisted carefully trimmed brilliant lamp well up on fore stay a soon a night closed in for be in track of outward bound ship going to southward must one of gentleman come booming down upon before gale during night must be rather difficult to avoid be well that took precaution for le than five passed in bob watch three more in mine one of coming near enough to hail what said be impossible for to hear howling of wind hissing of water so close to utterly drowning word conjectured however that be inquiry a to whether wanted assistance of kind on strength of supposition roared back at top of voice right very comfortable figure in mizzen rigging waved hand noble craft looked like australian liner be carrying topmast lower stunsails swept onward be soon afterwards swallowed up in darkness mist falling in with so tiny craft so far at sea in gale of wind announcement that be right very comfortable must have be rather novel experience for imagine about noon next day gale broke by four o'clock wind have gone down sufficiently to justify in making sail filling away upon course once more did by setting reefed mainsail foresail number jib wind have continued to haul round too be now pretty steady at about north east rapidly smoothed water down so that have comparatively quiet night wind continuing to drop shook out reef next morning at eight bell got big jib small gaff topsail upon evening one following got glimpse of cape finisterre about six o'clock enabled to corroborate position from point shaped course for madeira after splendid run of seven day from lizard eight from weymouth arrived at funchal at half past five o'clock on wednesday evening following that on took leave of dear sister a bob be busy below getting tea be stowing canvas steamer came in with flag flying on taking look at through glass recognised a distinguishing flag of cape mail boat so left everything just a be dashed down below penned few hasty line home giving brief outline of adventure so far taking care not to lay too much stress upon gale whilst be equally careful to do full justice to water lily sea going quality that sister apprehension might be a much allayed a possible a soon a have finished sealed epistle joined bob upon deck to assist in putting novel boat together done pulled on board mail boat where be very kindly received gave letter into hand of captain who promised faithfully redeemed promise too to post on arrival home afterwards found that reported also so that water lily duly appeared in shipping column of various paper yachting friend thus got inkling of success thus far will not attempt description of madeira indeed of other of well known spot at touched place have be so often so fully described in many book of travel have be written that further description at event such description a must give be quite superfluous will suffice for merely to say that bob spent three day stretching somewhat cramped limb in most lovely island discussing route must take to pacific have often discussed question before be with feeling of indifference precluded arriving at definite absolute decision upon matter be now however time that point be settled a must affect course soon after leaving island at event when came to cape de verdes eastern route must be much longer than western felt disposed to adopt in belief that must be favoured with much better weather entertained very wholesome dread of horn notorious cape of storm bob on other hand be for western route be willin ' to allow observed that trip round horn ai like day cruise in solent pleasuring have knowed ship to come round under r'yal stunsails that more than once place be bad enough like many thing not so black a be painted be got bad name that know stick to place to body through thick thin have be round five time twice outward bound three time homeward always have plenty of wind only once did round in reg'lar gale then have lily be there will lay grog for rest of v'yage 'd have made better weather of than old barkie be aboard of be risky know so be whole trip for matter though so far by what have seen of little craft a lieve be aboard in gale of wind a must be in ere ship that ever be launched be cramped for room when have said that have said a man can say ag'in besides see how 'twill shorten v'yage once round horn be there a may say next door to then there be magellan ' if when get down about there thing look promising for trip round outside of everything ram through strait have be through once ugly enough passage be too blowing whole gale there be thousand of place where lily must lie a snug a if be in dock where large ship durse venture for life yielded a generally did in such matter to bob judgment be settled that water lily must brave cape horn with peril on fourth day of stay at funchal filled up water tank made few addition to store among others small stock of famous wine produced by island towards evening stood out to sea again with main boom well garnished with bunch of banana net of various kind of fruit wind at time being light from about east south east with fine settled look about weather lasted for four day ran fairly into trade on third day following just a sun be dipping beneath horizon sighted saint antonio westernmost of cape verde island trade be blowing very moderately a happened weather be a fine a heart must wish with nearly full moon into bargain so be able to carry not only jib headed topsail also spinnaker at bowsprit end under canvas little beauty made uncommonly short mile of tripping along like rustic belle going to first ball fell in with several homeward bound ship of whom requested to report on arrival a well so fine run have from cape de verdes that on morning of fifth day after sighting ran into doldrums region of calm light variable air prevail about line here light duck did valuable service for though wind soon fell so light that became imperceptible to not ripple disturbed glassy surface of water by getting enormous balloon gaff topsail aloft managed to catch enough wind from somewhere to fan along at rate of nearly three knot true breeze be very variable boom being sometimes on one side sometimes on other sometimes square out at least a far a little air of wind have power to project sometimes hauled close in a flaw headed broke off two three point one side other of course in spite of baffling air such good progress did make by two o'clock afternoon be gliding slowly through fleet of about forty sail of vessel be so completely becalmed that be heading in direction utterly without steerage way reported to such a passed within hail of finally about four o'clock ranged up alongside of boarded beautiful little barque of about three hundred fifty ton whose monkey poop saw full of passenger of whom be lady regarding with die utmost curiosity a approached turned out to be from natal bound to london captain perfect gentleman in appearance manner not only promised to report gave hearty welcome on board so cordial invitation to dinner that there be resisting story at least a much of a chose to tell be simply that be taking cruise partly a adventure partly with object of seeking intelligence of father be of course soon drawn out of naturally enough excited liveliest astonishment in mind of hearer soon got over ship excited curiosity on board other ship too for le than four captain lowered boat pulled alongside to learn where pigmy cutter have sprung from little craft be regarded with greatest curiosity admiration especially by lady who be of course good judge of model of vessel of declaring that must be delighted with strong emphasis to make voyage in such little darling of yacht mustered quite strong party at dinner table what with regular party four visiting captain who be also pressed to stay two self very merry one withal contributed to dessert from stock on main boom only who have enjoyed can say what luxury be fresh fruit on line especially when one have be long time on board ship skipper produced unlimited champagne of for wonder still have very fair stock in honour of occasion prosperous voyage success to water lily be drunk over over again that evening kept up until nearly midnight poop being converted into ball room by merely hanging few lamp in mizzen rigging orchestra consisting of one of seaman who played concertina better than ever heard played before since weather being a have described with out sign of change departure from ordinary routine of ship be permissible have doubt everybody on board be glad enough of occurrence gave excuse for breaking in upon monotony of voyage tedious enough must have found for appeared that have already be becalmed five day have not altered position a many mile there seemed prospect of being becalmed five day more for glass be a steady a if mercury have be solid at last visitor made sign of moving captain of other vessel ordered crew into boat be just about going over side on way to small cabin to write hasty line to ada kind host having promised to post letter for immediately on arrival when seaman

must not be where suppose be now will hear have to say then judge for whether must prevent anything happened volume one chapter vi fate of amazon man who in unexpected manner brought intelligence of father belonged to crew of one of visiting captain boat word two of explanation be sufficient to procure delay in boat departure necessary to permit fellow to tell story in order to be little more alone bob who be in few word made acquainted with fact of case seaman went down over side to water lily deck when a soon a have comfortably bestowed ourselves man thus began must know gentleman to commence with be shipped among others on board amazon at canton dysentery be awful bad among crew just at time le than seven be ashore from old barkie bad when left two chap run a soon a got in must

well a soon a matter be arranged yankee take command make greek chief mate watch be divided course altered away go to east'ard on starboard tack with taut bowline everything set a must draw from skysail down one hand be told off from watch to keep look out in cabin steward have order to do everything must for poor skipper have hard time of poor man for when be getting better truth must longer be kept from mate told what have happened news took so completely aback that got a bad a ever again wonder be that did slip cable altogether however managed to hold on to 'em at last fever left be that weak have strength to turn over in berth without help time be going to east'ard about east south east with everything set that spar must bear at last about month maybe five week after mutiny did keep much account of time fetch up standing one dark night upon coral reef before knowed where be there war much sea on happened to touch where there be nearly water enough to float so bumped thumped gradually right over reef into deep water at least about ten fathom on t'other side well be sounded found five foot of water in hold so a there be land of sort close aboard of yankee ram straight on to to save from sinking under when daylight broke found oh sandy beach of small island with reef round space of about quarter to mile of clear water everywhere between reef island cargo be roused out ship examined a well a must be done to learn extent of damage for yankee talked about careening to repair bottom soon found that job be too much for so stayed on island about week fitting out launch pinnace when be ready everything stowed in boat that be thought must want made sail to nor'ard east'ard not however until rest of boat have be destroyed skipper mate made snug comfortable like in tent ashore then be inhuman enough exclaimed to leave poor father sick a be on desert island be better off there than must have be with replied man island be first rate spot with cocoa nut banana lot of other fruit end plenty of fresh water bulk of ship store to draw from be lovely spot lot of shade pure air pretty nigh everything man must want what with store fruit so on must have died have taken away in boat for sun beat down upon awful heat be reflected back from surface of water to extent be nearly roasted well 'd be to sea nigh on to three week be getting pretty short of water though touched at couple of island filled up again on way when one evening there be breath of air blowing sighted sail to nor'ard of be becalmed like yankee take good long look at at least at to'gallants'ls be must see then tell 'd made up mind to have slap at chap during night carefully took bearing dowsed canvas pulled leisurely towards at last when thought be beginning to near muffled oar then paddled on again boat within be length of other pulled for about hour then waited for sign of whereabouts for reckoned must be close aboard of be that dark must see length of nose after waiting goodish spell none of speaking word for fear of giving alarm hears eight bell struck somewhere away upon port quarter have passed so pulled very quietly round just paddled in direction thought be lying in about five minute yankee say see say stopped paddling pinnace be hanging on astern of so must lose one in dark be hauled up men in told what to do ship pointed out to then pulled away very quietly again by time must just make out dim something towering up in darkness knew to be sail in minute boat be alongside on starboard quarter pinnace on larboard quarter shinned up low side before watch on deck must rub eyelid open have turned out to be little yankee brig with cargo of sandalwood be bound to canton of crew joined rest poor skipper first mate among be hove overboard shark have good meal mounted four six have well stocked arm chest so that with arm brought with from old amazon be pretty well off mustered good strong crew too twenty nine altogether counting lascar so a brig be beautiful model soon found sailed like witch skipper decided to set up for pirate at once well gentleman kept stark calm for two whole day after 'd took brig johnson be yankee name edward johnson kept busy during time disguising craft by painting hull spar afresh such like carpenter be sent over starn on stage to fix plank over name on 'd carved lot of flourish such like word albatross be what johnson have re christened by time 'd finished own builder must have knowed after everything be finished to satisfaction call aft tell that 'd be thinking matter over 'd decided to take ship to hong kong get rid of sandalwood there get lot of thing be wanted to complete outfit make fit for good long cruise accordin'ly a soon a breeze sprang up away go never falling in with anything a johnson thought worth while to meddle with way have pretty quick run for brig sailed quite wonderful while be turning over in mind how to get away intended to take first chance a offered a soon a got in johnson be 'cute chap none of be let out of ship more 'n must help then only a knowed must trust at last cargo be out ballast in brig cleared for south pacific everything ready for sailing next morning have chance to get away be beginning to think thing be looking queer with did give up hope for knowed chance might offer at last minute if be ready to take time during night woke up went on deck for minute two found a black a pitch there be soul moving in ship know where anchor watch be stowed away asleep somewhere likely anyhow thought to myself now be chance so without waiting minute climb over bow let quietly down into water by cable a soon a be adrift let tide take for be afraid of makin ' so much a splash whilst be near ship drifted astern for about five minute then struck out have taken bearing did know where shore be saw few light shaped course for after 'd swam about matter of twenty minute found be farther away from 'em than be when started then thought flashed into mind that tide must be on ebb be going out to sea be so took aback that went under did feel like giving up without be obliged so struggled to top of water again then turned over on back to think matter over bit did find much encouragement that way be beginning to think be up with bepecially a be getting pretty tired when heard sound distance away like coil of rope hove down on deck started to swim in direction of sound after perhaps about five minute make out something away on port bow give shout a loud a must sends under again so soon found that game must answer however stretched out a hard a must got alongside there war nothing to take hold of slip past be too done up to sing out again start to swim after when strike head against something turn out to be boat towing astern got hold of gunnel managed somehow to get aboard then down go into bottom of too exhausted to do anything dropped off to sleep pretty soon be only woke up when chap came to hoist boat in craft turned out to be coasting junk bound to shanghai a managed to make out not syllable must understand of lingo of mine 'twould seem blest if very next night be run down by something other never knowed what 't be for have good manner to stop pick up mainmast of junk be knocked out of in smash managed to get hold of lash to just in eye of rigging yard happened to be undermost so have pretty good berth floated about on spar for four day night without bit drop of anything then sens broke adrift knew nothing more of what happened to for time when came to myself found be on board dutch ship homeward bound turned out that passed close to spar seein ' lashed to picked up at least so made out knew dutch there be only one chap aboard thought knowed english lord bless ye gentleman must make top tail of what said managed to make out hows'ever that 'd have narrow squeak of be about by time be able to get about on deck again be well out in indian ocean everything seemed going on right a turned out be wrong for early one morning make land ahead wind bein light dead on skipper hauled sharp up on port tack to try claw off current have got hold of away sagged to leeward do what must at last have to anchor by by breeze freshened be in very ugly berth skipper did like to make move however did have chance to settle matter for ourselves for just about sunset old barkie struck adrift before must get canvas on be in among rock bilged got ashore there bein ' great matter of sea running to make long story short be made prisoner by native what become of rest of hand never knowed may be there yet for can say old chap picked out made sort of servant of on whole have pretty easy time of got to find out at last be somewhere on island of madagascar stayed here nigh on two year reckon at last got chance to steal canoe slip off to small craft be becalmed in offing be luckier than dutchman a got breeze off land about hour after boarded be bound to cape there left shipping very same day in craft now belong to sailing for home same a'ternoon well said a soon a man have finished if story be true see reason to doubt at least be blameless a far a wrong done to father be concerned only question now be whereabouts be island on be left ah sir replied be more 'n can tell did hear johnson mention latitude longitude of once be blest if can remember now be determined however to get clue if possible however faint might be took into little cabin spread chart of pacific on table then got to recall a nearly a must course distance steered by amazon until time of wreck managed to trace a far a north western extremity of new guinea man happening to remember hearing johnson point out land in sight a cape of good hope must manifestly have be headland of name on north west coast of new guinea from point became bewildered remembered passing great many island after sighting headland however be of opinion that average course steered be about south east thought be nearly month afterwards when ship be lost placed scene of wreck on one of island in large group in expected to find treasure island questioned fellow until found have extracted really particle of information be in power to give then after rewarding for information let go a soon a be gone wrote hasty note to sister cautiously conveying to intelligence that have obtained faint trace of amazon fate trace added intended to follow up a far a must having sealed addressed missive hurried up over barque side placed in captain hand then took leave of with hearty shake of hand many good wish on part that might have safe pleasant voyage be time be off for gentle breeze be springing up party be anxious to avail of to utmost extent a soon a have once more got light canvas spread bob instead of turning in a have right to do being watch below came sat down beside began to discus strange story to have so lately listened have enabled definitely to make up mind upon one point will now confess have troubled not little said be proposal to go round horn bob ever since settled upon that route have be thinking of great risk must run by adopting such course really think that for must have hauled sharp up upon port tack a soon a fell in with south east trade now however feel so anxious about father condition must incur double amount of risk if need be in order to reach pacific a soon a possible bob must find before give thought to treasure right be exclaimed bob heartily there be hand upon harry lad treasure can wait may be of greatest consequence to skipper to be found a soon a possible may be ill tormented by parcel of cannibal savage thousand thing may be happening to to make important for to have couple of trustworthy hand like added to crew a soon a may be so shove huzzey nose a straight for cape a will look let get that part of job over a soon a can a to danger of expl'ite will weather somehow little beauty have showed already what can do with couple of prime seaman take man will deny be to handle take word for will carry round a safe a e'er craft float there be thing have be thinking of within last hour continued talked of going into buenos ayres when first made up mind to take route round horn even short detention must now like to avoid if possible want of water be really only cause must compel to call there though confess must like to write line to ada from thence to let know have safely reached so far a to first interrupted bob feel consarn whatever be pretty certain to fall in with heavy rain afore get very far south if wind happens to be light can easily spread one of sail so a to catch water one good heavy thunder shower must fill tank for a to letter why will perhaps have such chance a here that have just have that disposes of second difficulty if get rain before there be splendid harbour on southernmost side of gulf of saint matias hereaway on starboard bow somewhere about two three day sail to south'ard of buenos ayres can fill up water there have be into place once fine snug anchorage be be great relief to for in present feverish state of excitement seemed to that stoppage unless absolutely unavoidable must be more than must endure by time be bob watch on deck felt that must be utterly impossible to sleep if turned in so insisted that must go below instead after argument consented in about ten minute more certain sound arising through companion told that friend be too thorough seaman to be kept awake by excitement found alone at liberty to indulge in new hope have so lately be awakened within breast volume one chapter vii sea serpent breeze though continued light rather baffling at time still held when sun rose next morning on looking astern found that homeward bound ship have disappeared of outward bound craft light heel have enabled to get so far ahead that topsail of nearest be already dipping of course light wind smooth water made exactly kind of weather enormous spread of lighter sail caused little craft to slip through water in quite extraordinary manner whenever must show there be just enough wind to barely ruffle surface of gently swelling ocean yet patent log told be going rather over six knot mainly through persuasive influence of spinnaker gigantic balloon topsail at noon observation showed that be nearly degree south of line began to be sanguine that breeze now have must run into trade in however be disappointed for about sundown wind fell so light that barely have steerage way night long continued same greater part of next day for about sixteen hour considered that did not advance more than knot per hour towards close of afternoon however when came on deck to take first dog watch bob directed attention to appearance of sky in south eastern quarter announcing a opinion that there be look of trade about so proved for breeze gradually freshened drew more round from eastward by eight bell be doing nine knot with nice fresh breeze be doubtless first of south east trade wind for by midnight have so far freshened that for sake of spar became necessary to take in spinnaker balloon topsail to substitute for working jib jib headed topsail even must have be deemed perilous sail for so tiny craft by most person be by time thoroughly acquainted with lily knew that must carry with ease canvas that spar must bear nothing particular occurred for next two day wind held continued to blow with force be for good staggering breeze without much sea kept flying to southward at pace left even impatience reason for complaint on second day after getting breeze passed brazilian mail boat near enough to show number in yacht list to ask by signal to report well next morning be watch on deck until noon bob have cleared away breakfast carefully washing up everything stowing away have be in hammock about hour be enjoying fresh beauty of morning exultant feeling excited by rapid motion picturing to imagination delight with father must welcome appearance of snowy canvas when must heave in sight when vision be dispersed by loud cracking sound like report of rifle from distance away on weather bow looked in direction caught momentary glimpse of distant object whirling in air immediately afterwards sound be repeated stood up to get better view over low ridge of sea at same instant caught sight of what looked like jet of steam rising out of ocean there blow exclaimed involuntarily aloud again up whirled object have before observed again descended again came rifle like report knew in instant now what be unfortunate whale have fallen in with inveterate enemy thresher have be forthwith attacked must plainly distinguish huge creature plunging along at great rate at angle of about forty five degree with course so that be standing in such direction a must take across bow from persistent manner in remained at surface came to conclusion that have second enemy to contend with in shape of sword fish indeed way in began to plunge about soon put matter almost beyond doubt be turning over in mind whether must call bob to see sight when whale with mighty effort flung huge bulk completely out of water to height of must say fifteen twenty foot sure enough hanging to be large sword fish with beak driven deep into muscle about root of persecuted animal tail shouted to bob to come on deck at once for have neared other so much by time have excellent view of combat moreover struck that slight deviation in course of combatant might bring within extremely unpleasant proximity to little lily thought might be prudent to have bob on deck be up in instant not waiting to perform almost superfluous ceremony of dressing there stood so intensely absorbed in interest of exciting spectacle that little craft be almost left to take care of whale have got very nearly straight ahead of by time not more than mile distant bob went forward stood leaning against mast to get somewhat better view suddenly chase bore sharply up dashed away at tremendous speed in exactly opposite direction to have be pursuing before almost at same instant bob shrieked in shrill unnatural tone of voice luff harry luff round with for lord sake oh god down went helm up flew little lily into wind be just stooping to let go head sheet led aft when caught glimpse of bob face white drawn with horror eye almost starting out of head staring fixedly at something apparently broad on starboard bow looked naturally in same direction never to dying day will forget frightful appalling object met gaze at distance of not more than three cable length from rushing through water at speed equal to of railway train lashing water into foam with rapid movement of huge convolution monstrous serpent appeared darting towards wretched persecuted whale vast head fully twenty foot of body towered nearly erect above water believe be not exaggerating nay be within mark when say that remaining portion of body to tail be at least six time length head be shaped much like of python enormous jaw frequently opened disclosed formidable array of strong sharp fang body be of deep dead brown broadly marked with irregular stripe ring of pale stone colour emitted strong musky odour even at distance from be almost overpowering once when be closest to turned head in direction for one dread moment paused seeming to gather fold together a though about to dart upon bitterness of frightful death thrilled through next instant sped on once more at still greater speed before minute passed whale be overtaken ocean be for single instant lashed into semblance of boiling caldron saw rapid whirling movement of creature enormous coil then followed deep bellowing cry of tortured whale crunching sound of crushing bone during minute two have passed since helm be put down lily have be lying to on starboard tack head sheet still remaining fast on starboard side seizure of whale awoke a from horrible nightmare to fearful peril to still remained exposed jammed helm hard up wore craft sharp round on heel until dead before wind when eased off main sheet hurried a fast a wind must take away from spot a soon a have got water lily round be fairly running away from dangerous neighbour with one accord turned look astern to ascertain condition of thing in quarter serpent whale have disappeared doubtless former have sunk with prey to profound depth form usual habitat there to enjoy meal undisturbed well at last exclaimed bob have be knocking about at sea now nigh on thirty year many strange sight good looking eye of mine have looked upon in time here sarpent beat never seed like of thing afore care if never see agin have heern tell of such thing bein ' fallen in with sartaintly never must meet with man a have actually seed beast with own eye put down a yarn for marine seein ' be believin ' have have good look at mistake be quite

credit to account be occasionally published of such appearance at expect that will be believed when make known adventure more than others have be will not alter fact of case almost universal scepticism with announcement of such creature appearance be treated be after not very difficult to account for doubtless inhabit only extreme depth of ocean be probably endowed with mean of sustaining life whilst sunk for long period if not for indefinite time at depth be easy therefore supposing such to be case to understand that may be quite opposed to creature habit to appear at surface at that when doe so will be a indeed have reason to suppose at very lengthened interval then probably only in consequence of unusually disturbing influence opportunity of seeing reptile must necessarily under such circumstance be extremely few be quite possible rather must say very likely that many of visit to upper world have be entirely unwitnessed in present instance for example eye ours be witness of scene so lately took place have be dozen mile from spot must have passed unnoticed even by observation of mankind bob have led to conclusion that race be extremely sceptical a to existence of everything what be well known very true harry lad returned bob reel off just like book therein show advantage of larning know by own feelin how difficult 't be to believe thing man understand seems to to return to practical a have heard poor old skipper say that might a well haul up on course agin now will go look after dinner for will be afraid to go to sleep agin for next fortnight blamed old sarpent will have'nt like nightmare now if so much a shut eye for five minute sheet be flattened in little craft jaunty bowsprit once more pointed southward whilst bob dived below in few minute more thin wreath of smoke issuing from galley funnel betrayed whereabouts occupation suddenly reappeared at companion with serious countenance remarked say harry lad s'pose there be chance of devil with jerk of thumb in direction of weather quarter getting sniff of dinner making sail in chase be there assured that in belief there be strong probability that serpent be at moment perhaps mile deep in ocean banqueting royally on dead whale seeing reasonableness of supposition retired satisfied nothing further occurred day to disturb continued to bowl away to southward a kept canvas good rap full little barkie tripped along good honest nine knot hour weather be a fine a must possibly wish with appearance of being thoroughly settled there seemed to be good promise of making exceptionally rapid passage be eight hour out that night when bob relieved at midnight sky be a clear a bell though there be moon star be shining brilliantly with mellow lustre so peculiar to tropic bob declared be glad to be on deck again for have be tormented watch below by villainous sarpent vision of so disturbed restless slumber that be real comfort to have craft to look after something to occupy mind anticipated such disturbing influence for though candidly confess be awfully frightened at moment effect have passed away almost with disappearance of monster cool freshness of night breeze have induced feeling of drowsiness particularly welcome to man about to retire to hammock in le than five minute be fast asleep when awoke did without being called be surprised to find sun streaming down through skylight still more so when observed that seemed to have gone about during night water lily be now certainly on starboard tack whereas when turned in be on port tack ca be change of wind here in heart of trade thought what can bob be about why have allowed to overrun watch surely old fellow be not afraid to come below turn in hallo bob ahoy what be wrong on deck shouted springing out of hammock just a did so heard mainsail fluttering a though boat have luffed into wind at same moment caught sight through companion way of vacant tiller swinging about gone forward to shift jib thought jumped on deck to lend hand bob be nowhere to be seen good heaven exclaimed what dreadful thing have happened thought of sea serpent for one moment dismissed idea next a being too horrible too unlikely creature must hardly have approached without giving alarm knew must have instantly communicated to at moment eye fell upon main boom missed life buoy kept suspended from in readiness for sudden emergency bob then have gone overboard taking life buoy with that too upon impulse so sudden that there have be time opportunity to arouse lily be indeed hove to a have observed when first awoke be with jib fore sheet to windward probability be then that on bob quitting helm have flown up into wind until head sail be taken aback when must of course most probably pay off on opposite tack remain hove to must necessarily have happened at least four hour ago be now eight o'clock because have bob be on deck at eight bell must of course have called during time boat have be sailing away from not very rapidly be true being hove to probably at rate of at least three knot hour what might not have happened to poor fellow in time be splendid swimmer knew having acquired art on last voyage well able to take care of in water there be very little sea on besides felt pretty certain have life buoy with assistance knew must keep afloat in such weather until worn out with exhaustion from want of food there be other peril than of drowning if attacked by shark what chance have thought flashed through mind whilst busily employed in taking necessary step to return in search of for have idea of continuing voyage without making such search indeed must have be impossible chance of success be not so meagre a might at first sight be supposed in first place knowing how difficult must be to see such object a life buoy even with man in at great distance from so low elevation a deck have taken precaution to have buoy fitted with contrivance for hoisting signal consisted of small bundle of jointed rod must be put together like fishing rod on topmost of be white flag two foot square on buoy be firmly lashed step similar to bucket believe be called in carriage whip be placed when not in use by driver rod taken to piece be securely lashed in compact bundle to buoy bucket be fixture thus if bob have life buoy also have mean of indicating whereabouts too at considerable distance knew pretty nearly in what direction ought to steer in order to take most effectual mean of finding whilst hove to lily course drift be on whole a nearly a possible at right angle to direction of wind only remained then to turn round keep wind directly abeam must be going back pretty nearly over same ground have be traversing since bob went overboard accordingly lost time in getting lily round when once more hove to went aloft to cross tree with glass to see if white flag be visible long anxious scrutiny followed without discovery did not feel very great disappointment at for thought very probable be too far away to discover so small object even with aid of glass once satisfied that be nowhere to be seen quickly descended to deck trimmed sheet flowing away little craft bounded over bright flashing sea stood on for hour exactly when once more hauled fore sheet to windward went aloft with glass again first look be ahead first with naked eye then with glass not speck must discern to break monotony of blue grey of sea except occasional curling foam crest next carefully swept ocean from forward round to windward thinking might have run too far off wind once twice thought detected flickering of something white instantly disappeared again be obliged to believe be only foam of breaking wave be about to descend once more to deck when occurred to to take glance to leeward once more levelled glass swept over surface of sea again must see nothing reluctantly closed slung over shoulder swung off cross tree to go down by mast hoop when eye be arrested for moment by what knew at once to be flag almost a caught sight of lost again a craft be constantly falling off coming up again into wind hardly knew exactly in what point to look for however regained by position upon cross tree levelling glass rather inconveniently on fore side of topmast to clear topsail presently caught again yes there be sure enough about three mile dead to leeward be more must not only see flag also buoy bob in seemed to be waving arm about in most frantic manner making tremendous splashing doubtless thought with view of making position more apparent a of course must see cutter knew must be looking for slipped down on deck quick a lightning triced up main tack just high enough to enable to see under foot of sail squared dead away before wind ten minute afterwards caught glimpse of flag right ahead a boat rose on sea then edged away taking room to run up alongside on port tack with head sheet to windward must now see bob away on port bow time lily rose on top of wave be still to great surprise splashing away furiously now caught sound of voice shouting surely thought poor fellow have not become insane through dreadful strain to nerve have be subjected minute later cause of strange behaviour became apparent dark object of triangular shape appeared moving in narrow circle round spot where poor bob be floating disappearing at frequent interval then splashing became more frantically vigorous than ever be shark be thus blockading bob splashing be resorted to to frighten creature from attacking carefully measured distance exactly at right moment jammed helm hard down hauling in main sheet a did so lily shot into wind just clearing buoy by hair breadth sprang to rigging stooped down seized bob extended hand with mine a came alongside then exerting strength must command fairly jerked out of water upon deck just a shark have apparently made up mind to be no longer denied with such impetuosity did make rush that snout rose good two foot fairly above gunwale have not impetus with jerked bob out of water be sufficient to fetch clear inboard shark must have have after a be got glance into open jaw at six row of teeth remembrance of make shudder to day a shark disappeared with savage whisk of tail poor bob turned to lip quivered convulsively for moment in effort to speak then fell to deck in dead faint two three bucket of water dashed in face glass of neat brandy however soon restored be almost pitiful to listen to poor fellow heartfelt reiterated expression of gratitude for rescue ever since about hour after sunrise be that incarnate devil alongside of exclaimed have be for seeing cutter sail knowin ' a be on look out for must have give in human natur ' must hold out agin that sort of thing for long now feel that weak done up that child might pitch overboard agin if be so minded do believe life buoy came aboard again with bob so unshipped signal staff took to piece made up in bundle once more stopped to buoy slung buoy in old position on boom cutter be still hove to allowed to remain so whilst went forward to see to breakfast bob meanwhile changing wet clothes for dry one hanging former in rigging to dry be still busy over cookery when bob came into forecastle observed say harry there be spiteful devil still alongside with most onchristian longing to make breakfast off of old shipmate will go bail must contrive somehow to put stopper on tormentin purpensities ay ay bob old man replied think may manage to do without much difficulty get one of air gun out of becket whilst look after coffee be just on boil will try virtue of cold lead upon constitution power of gun at same time a soon a must leave coffee got piece of pork out of small harness cask lashed to piece of line whilst bob under direction charged gun done pork be hung just outside taffrail full in shark view not in water lay down on deck with gun ready for gentleman must make rush however seemed indisposed to do eyeing bait longingly keeping at respectful distance gradually distance shortened however finally ventured close under boat stern within about three foot of pork kept gun levelled at aiming at eye now having so close so directly under thought there be little fear of bullet being diverted from proper direction by water so fired lead sped true blood spirted from creature eye with tremendous spring threw backward only to roll over on back with convulsive writhe two ere floated motionless dead so much for bullyin ' honest seaman when have misfortin ' to walk overboard observed bob eyeing carcase with much complacency will feel more comfortable like now know a cruise be over for good walk overboard bob exclaimed surely mean to say walked overboard 't be little else lad will tell ye about whilst be getting breakfast stowed under hatch for will be bound be longing to hear right of story indeed be old fellow so come along below let get yarn breakfast at once be longing for having taken look round to see that nothing be in sight went below seated ourselves at cabin table bob forthwith proceeded with story volume one chapter viii bob dream will maybe remember commenced bob that when came upon deck last night to take watch mentioned be glad enough to be out of hammock away from tormentin dream have of sarpent well be too felt better calmer like minute set foot upon deck a soon a be gone below make comfortable in chair low deck chair in used frequently to sit whilst steering take tiller rope in hand set little craft course by star start thinking how pleased skipper will be when see son old mate turning up fine morning at anchorage doubt not lie just under parlour window got thinking thinking until seemed to a must see old man a plain a can see now coming down between tree with hand held out face smiling joyful like step forward to give hearty shake of fin when of suddent change into infarnal old sarpent at come with eye glaring jaw wide open may take oath harry war long in stay round come like top away scud dead afore wind sarpent mean arter seemed to a faster tried to run le headway made presently be close aboard of there be great rock just ahead of make tremenjous jump to get behind when whack go head agin main boom with force fairly stunned afore must recover lost balance overboard go felt going flung out hand to save naterally by mean managed to get hold of becket of life buoy in course broke adrift from boom came overboard with well did seem to know where be what be doin ' for minute two then cold water revived slip arm through buoy take look round for cutter must have run pretty nigh dead off wind in sleep for must see almost straight to leeward of still standin ' on comin ' slowly to wind be good quarter of mile away from think a how might still have chance of fetching agin if get to luffing into wind losing way so strike out a'ter lord bless ye harry have idea how little hussy slip along until come to be overboard swimming in wake seemed to a though 'd never come to while be walking away to tune of good seven knot at last when rose on top of sea see a be in stay right think harry come on deck missed be comin ' back a'ter ' soon saw a 'd run into wind hove to that most likely be still fast asleep in hammock next tried to cut off by swimming in direction that be heading after about hour hard tusslin ' knowed be use fore reached upon a if be at anchor so give job up lay to in buoy for rest for 'd put out strength in chase be pretty nigh done up knowed 'd miss time in morning that 'd miss buoy too felt sartain that 'd come back to look up so set to work to get signal pole on end flag flyin ' ready for daylight watched little barkie fairly out of sight then began to feel lonesome like will own most oncomfortable thought came into head about sea sarpent strange a may think never give thought to shark thought a day be never going to break agin at last see light up bit away to east'ard got grad'ally brighter brighter presently see sun just showin ' above horizon then felt little bit more cheerful satisfied like for knowed 'd soon be stirring must have back on look out for of course gave good look round a soon a there be light enough to see properly there war so much a gull in sight away to nor'ard east'ard where knowed be sun dazzled eye so must see well 't be just a 'd caught glimpse a thought of peak of lily gaff topsail see about fifty fathom away fin of shark scullin ' quietly along kept pretty still may swear hoping 'd pas not down go helm take sheer way thought be up with ranged up alongside a quiet a please hows'ever just dodged round round off on a if did quite know what be made of expect be flutterin ' of flag overhead a did understand way kept very quiet peaceable for good long spell be beginnin ' to hope must have truck with to cheer up still more see little lily coming back to look for chief mate if will believe harry be of opinion that devil saw comin ' a well a that knowed 'd have to make up mind pretty soon lose altogether for began to swim round now tolerable smart presently make dive 'd made up mind what to do a soon a took to game start splashing hand leg knowed shouting too like fury presently come up again well chap kept that busy have minute to spare when ranged up alongside be that tired out did know how to make splash so much for going to sleep in watch on deck master bob said a mate brought yarn to conclusion ay more shame to must ever have done thing replied greatly crestfallen lay blame of whole consarn from beginnin ' to end on sarpent though amount of sarpents will excuse man fallin ' asleep in watch more especially when have charge of deck well said have be pretty well punished for fault old man at event be well that end well be heartily glad that be so well out of scrape now will insist on going to hammock for rest of day will take care of craft in fact will almost steer in weather so will manage very well indeed only have more dream will cause to jump overboard please for really can not afford to lose poor old fellow be so exhausted that though protested against proposed arrangement must see be glad enough to avail of after feeble attempt at remonstrance yielded to persuasion turned in be quickly in sound refreshing sleep nothing further of importance occurred for several day to break monotony of voyage continued to make good way to southward ten day after crossing line lost south east trade wind ran into light southerly breeze a still have very fair quantity of water on board indulged in good hope of getting rain enough shortly to fill tank up without necessity of putting in anywhere a chance be very great that a got farther to southward must meet with westerly wind determined to stand to southward westward close hauled of course on port tack so must wind come from westward a expected must be in good weatherly position whilst if be disappointed in matter of rain must have land close aboard must run in fill up southerly wind lasted couple of day then veered gradually round to about south west a broke off considerably from course hove cutter about be then able to lie about south by east good rap full wind now freshened considerably have stronger than at time since leaving england except in gale in bay of biscay so that be reduced to double reefed mainsail reefed foresail number three jib under canvas little lily made very excellent weather of though incessant shower of spray threw over necessitated constant use of macintosh whilst on deck found extremely inconvenient from warmth however a have be wonderfully favoured in matter of weather so far have right to grumble if be now treated to few of inconvenience of such voyage a ours though still making very good way be not getting on so fast a have be low canvas heavy sea for craft of size began to get up not permitting to do more than seven knot still be remarkably good work ought to have be perfectly satisfied little barkie have stepped out at rattling pace earlier part of voyage that must not be contented with reduction in speed lasted for five day then about one pm wind suddenly dropped altogether left tumbling helplessly about without even steerage way sky have gradually become overcast air suffocatingly close when went below to look at aneroid found have gone back considerably might mean only thunderstorm might mean something much worse so set to work to prepare for might come mainsail be stowed cover put on foresail hauled down unbent trysail bent reefed stowed to be set not a circumstance might require a turned out be only thunderstorm be regular tropical one whilst lasted rain came down in sheet without breath of wind not only filled tank also available cask can empty bottle have on board a be done long before rain be over though thunderstorm soon passed off bob stripped enjoyed to heart content unwonted luxury of wash from head to foot in most deliriously soft water after roused out dirty clothes have regular good washing day rain lasted about three hour then cleared away a rapidly a have come on leaving air beautifully fresh pure sea beaten down until nothing long lazy swell remained of late breeze refreshed beyond description by soap water bath sun came out again clear strong drying washing in about hour to complete good work nice steady wind from north east sprang up sent bowling merrily along upon course once more with flying kite aloft to woo welcome breeze glass beginning to rise again immediately that thunderstorm be over two night after wind still holding favourable though rather so that spar have a much a must withstanding preventer backstay to bear strain of enormous spinnaker balloon gaff topsail little water lily flying along at a patent log told over thirteen knot dashed past half consumed few charred piece of planking half burnt spar of have appearance of having be short time in water spar be of ship of about thousand ton came to conclusion that be one of melancholy case in good ship after perhaps successfully battling with hundred storm be made to succumb at last to terrible foe to seaman fire ignited by merest apparently most trivial of accident reader will see further on that have too good reason to alter opinion passed wreckage about middle of second dog watch while bob be discussing propriety of shortening sail somewhat for night a breeze seemed disposed to grow lighter rather than otherwise decided to let everything stand for present when bob called at midnight however wind have hauled so far round from eastward that became necessary to shift spinnaker to bowsprit end accordingly did wind have fallen much lighter while be below continued to drop watch when turned out next morning there be barely enough of to fan along at about three knot a sun rose higher died away altogether be a much a must do through day to keep cutter head in right direction must have be wearisome work in tropic have be out of for day be getting well to southward air began to feel quite fresh chilly at night so much so indeed that for last night two bob have found thick pilot jacket very great comfort at last by time that tea be ready lily be boxing compass having lost steerage way altogether so a big sail be use took in stowed away not knowing from whence how strong breeze might next come took good look round at weather then left lily to take care of whilst went below to evening meal over went on deck again to smoke pipe have chat until eight bell may be thought that two men situated a be must soon exhaust available topic of conversation be by mean case bob though have education that pertaining to profession be profound thinker often amused sometimes startled by originality of remark have knocked about world good deal have knack of not only quick observation also of being able to clearly accurately recall what have seen impression thereby produced upon be expatiating on occasion on charm of nature of be enthusiastic admirer subject having be suggested by beauty of sunset have be watching be thoroughly enjoying rugged eloquence with scene have inspired when be startled by long low wailing cry rang out upon still air apparently not dozen fathom from making blood curdle hair stiffen with horror at unearthly thrilling cadence looked earnestly eagerly in direction from cry have seemed to proceed nothing be visible in indeed in other direction sun have set grey of evening be deepening over glassy surface of water there be still light enough reflected from sky to have enabled to see object within sight almost a distinctly a in broad day not object of description must see not even solitary albatross have carefully scanned a far a be possible entire visible surface of ocean have turned inquiringly towards other when once more rang out mysterious cry time apparently close under stern turned unutterably horror stricken in direction there be nothing seaman be a rule a brave a lion anything mysterious unaccountable completely cowes such confess be now case with cry be too sharp loud to have proceeded from distance there be visible explanation of be not repeated third time be happy to say wish never to hear anything like again what be whence came never knew be be to day utterly unable to account for have since be informed that such sound have occasionally be heard at sea by others a well a ourselves never with result of discovery a to origin during next three day have nothing light variable wind calm on morning of fourth day at daybreak made sail directly ahead at time have nice little breeze be going about six knot a neared noticed that be hove to course brailed up topgallant yard on cap when close to struck that something must be matter on board for not soul must see about deck vessel too full rigged ship of about fourteen hundred ton struck a being unusually deep in water there being sea on decided to run alongside board thinking might possibly prove derelict did so accordingly rounding to under stern ranging up alongside on lee quarter having first however taken in gaff topsail lowered topmast so a not to foul rigging a came gently alongside exclamation escaped bob who be standing forward ready to heave line on board jump up side with according to circumstance here be be cursed foul play here by look of harry exclaimed mutiny murder must judge by pointing to scupper of ship from blood have evidently be flowing large semi coagulated gout still adhering to side of vessel about mouth of scupper hole vessel being a have said very low in water have difficulty whatever in boarding springing up side at same moment with end of line in hand good heaven what sight met horrified gaze a leaped down upon ship deck three four twenty corps lay there with blood still slowly oozing in few instance from wound in various part of body wound be mostly inflicted by cutlass pistol shot two of body apparently of officer have head almost severed from trunk gash having be evidently inflicted by keener weapon than ship cutlas body have arm lashed tightly behind back too horror stricken to speak word walked aft bob following entered cabin be on deck from thought groan issuing on entering first object saw be body of young man about four twenty year of age lying close across doorway covered with wound left arm be almost completely cut through long gash have laid forehead open from above right temple to left eyebrow pistol bullet have entered forehead nearly fair between eye blood have evidently flowed copiously from right breast body lay across three others dressed in usual attire of seaman on sofa stretched entirely across after part of cabin lay body of young most beautiful girl night dress torn to shred fair skin disfigured by deep blue mark smeared with blood indicating too clearly that have be victim of most atrocious outrage lastly under cabin table lay body from whilst stood gazing in speechless horror at evidence of diabolical atrocity faint groan issued bob assisted to draw sufferer from under table then saw that be old man grey haired dressed in fine blue cloth garnished with gilt button stripe of gold lace round cuff of jacket doubt master of vessel bob drew corpse of young girl somewhat aside spreading table cover over body reverently to hide naked limb then between placed wounded man on sofa cabin have notwithstanding ghastly appearance presented be scene of wild carouse for table be covered with glass wine spirit bottle broken bottle glass littered floor searched among content of table until found bottle only partly empty from poured out glass of content proved to be port managed with considerable difficulty to get small quantity of wine down wounded man throat skylight be open air coming down through in cool gentle breeze assisted wine in restoring to consciousness opened eye gazed round vacantly for moment so then memory returned burst violently into tear soothed a well a must assuring that be friend that must not leave in minute two recovered strength composure enough to speak thank gentleman thank said time here be very short well meant effort for relief be not only useless also

making position a easy a must for eye fell upon body of young girl once more tear burst forth mingled with prayer for most bitter curse upon destroyer raised one hand to face a though to brush tear away then noticed for first time horror upon horror that finger have be cut rather hacked out at knuckle joint wound still slowly bleeding saw look of compassion said a if in reply ah gentleman willingly must have submitted to be torn limb from limb by demon have spared poor rose darling only daughter after short pause began be about midnight last night that noticed sail ahead of be duly reported there be not very much wind at time did not near until about six bell a closed with movement became so suspicious that ordered arm chest on deck called hand served out pistol cutlass to suspicion be very shortly confirmed for when be within cable length of sheered suddenly alongside about fifty men leaped from on to deck poor fellow gave warm reception be quickly cut down in about three minute pirate have ship immediately began to plunder band of most ruffianly of headed by captain made for cabin seeing that be lost son body lie at door there rushed in here to make desperate stand in defence of daughter poor fellow killed three of whilst severely wounded others be shot down fell exhausted with wound have already received poor girl be soon discovered dragged from berth

broken heart doubtless for even seemed unwilling to stain weapon with blood must that have must have be able so to steel heart a to have slain rather than must have seen did for first bound then placed so must see a soon a found that be dead ransacked cabin turned out locker drank sang until mate suppose of pirate came in reported that everything of value be transferred to brig when leader whom once twice heard addressed a johnson bob started looked at other expressively ordered ship to be scuttled for hand employed on work to return to brig then left cabin about hour afterwards believe left ship can not float ver very much longer will will be gone before voice have be gradually growing weaker weaker a approached end of narrative now failed altogether tore open front of shirt to ascertain if heart still beat now saw that have received in addition to other wound shot through chest there be blood doubt bled internally must detect not faintest flutter of heart so laid gently down on sofa a did so small stream of blood trickled out of mouth sighed heavily jaw dropped seeing that be dead left cabin stepped out once more into bright sunshine noticed that even during short

observed roll once twice slowly heavily stern rose bow disappearing beneath water gradually became almost perpendicular when paused for moment then sank gently out of sight moment that johnson name be mentioned same idea flashed into mind that be same man probably same ship of have so lately heard captain spoke of pirate vessel a brig felt manner of doubt that be albatross so then men men who have showed such base treachery to father be still at large in full prosecution of villainous design not only so be in same quarter of globe a ourselves manifestly at very great distance felt difficulty now in attaching very different much more sinister significance to charred fragment of wreck have lately passed little craft must of course be poor prize to rascal since seemed so to luxuriate in

attempt strait of magellan hove little craft to went below carefully examined chart discussing a did so comparative advantage disadvantage of two route bob have experience of seemed to feel that in present state of weather with wind a be be likely to make quicker passage by going on to southward passing round horn be of same opinion by mean liking intricacy of navigation of strait violent tide sailing direction told swept through accordingly filled away again carrying on notwithstanding still freshening breeze until little water lily seemed alternately to threaten diving to bottom with taking flight altogether into air be nearly blinded by copious shower of spray flew over mainsail be wet to very peak be real pleasure to see ease lightness with boat skimmed over now formidable angry

hauled down mainsail stowed bent set trysail in place single reefed change proved very great relief to little craft sway leverage of heavy main boom having made plunge tremendously whereas now went along without shipping drop of water beyond spray of course still continued to throw over be whilst be busy shifting after canvas that little lily experienced perhaps one of most narrow escape of whole voyage be too much occupied with work to keep very bright look out indeed considered that beyond state of weather there be nothing to demand attention have just completed bending of trysail when away to windward of not more than quarter of mile distant observed large ship running down directly upon before wind under topgallant stunsails lily be almost stationary at time ship be heading a

remainder of day wind continuing still to freshen sea getting up with most fearful rapidity glass fell slowly too there appeared to be prospect of getting taste of quality of weather for cape horn be so notorious a sun set veil of cloud wrack have obscured heaven day be rent asunder in western quarter caught glimpse of great luminary hanging upon verge of horizon like ball of molten copper level beam shot for few moment across broad expanse of heaving wildly leaping water tinging wave crest immediately in wake with deep blood red whilst around elsewhere angry ocean be darkest indigo few ray shot upward gleaming wildly among flying scud then orb of day sank into ocean shooting abroad a did so sudden baleful crimson glare gradually died out in gloom of increasing storm coming night bob stood by side watching wild scene have so feebly described a sun disappeared turned to remarked eye harry what d 'ye think of lad to mind need prophet to tell with afore eye that be booked for reg'lar thorough bred cape horn gale of wind advice a chief mate of here barkie be that make just a snug a know how for depend upon afore morning will have a thorough trial of sea goin quality a be likely to want for many day to come own idea bob replied have seldom seen wilder sunset if doe not mean wind plenty of too weather lore must go for nothing will have to turn to learn everything over afresh ay ay may say that returned same have knocked about too many year at sea to make mistake in reading when natur ' open so plain page of book for a yond so sooner turn to better say will have darkness upon afore be ready for thank god have plenty of sea room so let rouse up that floating anchor contrivance of yourn lad for depend upon if ever lily be likely to need consarn will to night floating anchor will describe for benefit of who may not have seen thing for be most useful affair small craft must undertake long cruise without one ours be formed of two flat bar of iron ten foot in length riveted

a bar be spread open swifter passed set up square sheet of stoutest canvas painted be spread over edge laced to swifter with stout lacing crowfoot toggled through intermediate hole in bar corresponding hole in canvas buoy be then attached to end of one arm to float anchor with sufficient amount of buoy rope to allow to sink to requisite depth end of cable be shackled into thimble of

distended in same way be enclosed in strong net of three strand sinnet net be attached to buoy rope hove craft to whilst be preparing anchor glad enough be when be ready for by time sea be running so high breaking so heavily that be afraid once twice when be caught broadside to that must be capsized let go anchor with only two fathom of buoy rope so a to sink just deep enough to keep head to sea without materially interfering with craft drift a thought must ride easier for such arrangement so proved a soon a anchor be let go got head sail in ran in bowsprit got topmast on deck trysail be close reefed sheet trimmed amidships anchor light hoisted well up on fore stay preparation for night be complete by time be blowing tremendously heavy howling of gale overhead shriek of wind through scanty rigging hiss of foaming water around mingled into such deafening sound that bob have fairly to shout even when close alongside of other to make ourselves heard then began to thunder lighten heavily still further increasing wild impressive grandeur of scene upon gazed in awe struck admiration at one moment must be deep black pitchy night lighted up only by pale unearthly shimmer of foaming wave crest a rolled menacingly down upon gleaming with phosphorescent light anon canopy above must be rent asunder by vivid lightning flash for instant vast whirling form of torn shredded cloud must be revealed with momentary vision of writhing leaping storm driven water beneath illumined by ghastly glare of levin brand stricken into sudden rigidity by rapidity of flash stayed on deck for about hour after anchor be let go watching grand manifestation of power of deity sublime a terrible terrible a sublime then finding that improvement suggested in arrangement that lily rode like cork over mountain billow though occasionally comb of more than usually heavy sea must curl in over bow send foaming cataract of water aft out over taffrail descended to cabin to get supper for by time be quite ready so easy be motion of little craft that when got below found difficulty whatever in boiling water making cup of good strong tea while discussing refreshing beverage few biscuit arrived at conclusion that a have done be possible to do for safety of boat be useless to keep watch through night that must therefore take advantage of opportunity to get good undisturbed night rest leaving sweet little cherub that sits up aloft to look out accordingly a soon a meal be over left bob to straighten up below while went on deck to take last look round see that everything be snug a must be light burning brightly found everything satisfactory except that seemed to be blowing harder than ever however must not help that so went below again closing companion after turned in chatted awhile listened to roaring of gale occasional heavy wash of water along deck finally dropped off to sleep awoke two three time during night once turned out pushed slide of companion far enough back to put head outside night be still a black a pitch be blowing harder if anything than before air be full of spindrift scudwater so pushed over slide again tumbled once more into comfortable hammock very vividly impressed with sense of helplessness in midst of heavy gale also with comparative degree of comfort between deck cabin bob be first to make muster in morning first act like mine during night be to take look out upon deck blowing hard enough to blow devil horn off heard exclaim a thick a hedge precious eye what sea come up take look at harry boy never see 'd nothing like year have be afloat hurrah young un be sort a cutter rose fearfully near to perpendicular in surmounting crest of sea then slid down down down into trough until seemed a though must sink to very ocean bed little hussy behave beautifully be a floaty a gull hal drier than e'er seventy four that ever be launched must be in sea like now what lubber come here with eye sealed up instead of looking before jump up harry quick boy be in mess here mistake be all right will clear a'ter thanks to though for there be not soul ah so be beginning to wake up at last eh here put head up through companion alongside of bob lovely phiz saw within forty fathom of over ridge of sea broad on port beam topmast head of brig a rose together on same sea sail first then hull came into view be not large vessel about two hundred ton thereabouts apparently painted black down to copper excepting narrow red ribbon marked line of sheer be to on port tack under storm staysail topgallant mast be down on deck everything be very trim man o war like on board government dockyard ever turned out such beautiful model a be when first caught sight of be heading directly for a watched head paid off swept slowly down across stern near enough for to have hove biscuit on board ten dozen head peered curiously at over weather bulwark a drove slowly past one man aft on quarter deck officer of watch apparently seized trumpet to hail whether did so not if did what said of knew for at moment sank once more into trough with perfect mountain of water between until lost sight of altogether for moment even to mast head took glass always kept slung in becket in companion way open adjusted ready for immediate use a rose once more into view applied to eye first thing caught attention be name painted on stern be now towards albatross by be unlucky exclaimed blest if might have guessed a much if 'd be in guessin ' humour ejaculated bob honest going merchant ship ai so plaguy careful of spar a chap leastways not such small fry a be pity what be often say where d 'ye find skipper who will be bothered to send down top hamper time pipe up bit of breeze let stand if be word if 'two let blow away ' chap be real good seaman harry man will deny look how snug be got everything hauled taut coiled down neat reg'lar man o ' war fashion will be bound got think clearer idea of tremendous strength of gale by watching brig than did even by motion of own little craft be tossed about like merest cockle shell time that rose upon crest of sea wind took rag of staysail distending a though must tear clean out of bolt rope heeling vessel over until must see whole of bottom nearly down to keel then sharp bow must cleave wave crest in perfect cataract of foam spray away must settle down once more with heavy weather roll into trough well exclaimed bob a lost sight of in driving scud be pretty sea boat be yon brig be blest if little lily beat even at game what say harry ai proving true very word spoke that night when first began to talk about here v'yage indeed be bob answered be a surprised a be delighted at behaviour must never have believed without seeing that so small craft must even live in such weather much le be a comfortable a be like continued a comb of tremendous sea came curling in over bow fairly smothering little craft in foam for moment though came up immediately afterwards shaking feather like duck be afraid one of gentleman will be starting skylight companion for must be very serious matter never fear returned bob confidently bit of windlass mast break force of before reach skylight that idee of yours in having rounded at fore end be capital one turn water off side almost like stem of ship besides bein stronger than square shaped consarn at same time water coming in on deck do good if do harm how be to be pervented have idea said be worth trial can do harm if fails be worse off than be before so saying dived below got out bottle of oil through cork of bored three four hole with corkscrew left cork in to neck of bottle made fast end of about fathom of marline then going forward made fast other end of marline to one of link of chain cable by be riding to floating anchor then sung out to bob to give few fathom more chain a did so hove bottle overboard in about five minute success of experiment became manifest oil leaked slowly out through hole have bored in cork diffusing on surface of water caused sea to sweep by without breaking at if did break be with such diminished force more water came on board have heard of oil on troubled water before at time did so never expected to put virtue to so thoroughly practical test went below got breakfast under weigh whilst discussing meal conversation naturally turned upon appearance of albatross there can be question fear a to being that scoundrel johnson gang of desperado said half hoping to hear bob dispute probability be quite of opinion said be scamp never doubt of noticed name on starn there war name of port where hail from for simple reason that hail from nowhere in particular besides man with eye must tell by looking at craft that be strong handed depend o harry there be too many hammock in fo cbetle for honest trader worst luck be bound same road a ourselves at least be going round horn a'ter get round be not so easy to say what course may steer must hope be on look out for stray spaniard other coming down coast for if fall in with ag'in will have some'at to say to mark word surely suppose man will condescend to give such pigmy a thought do be just what be doing at identical moment be opinion returned bob be not fool enough to suppose be down here somewhere off horn in cockle shell on pleasure trip that be not come down here to trade also know pretty well must have craft big enough to stow away something like paying cargo if be here for one t'other of object will want to know what be here for depend upon wo be happy till be found out so take advice harry if fall in with again let give wide berth decidedly will do so if possible returned may prove such easy matter with so smart vessel a have under foot not in heavy weather certainly said bob give weather in can carry topsail even if be more jib header will say catch who catch can ' why can lay good two p'ints closer to wind than can still keep good clean full square rigged craft can beat in going to wind'ard must be out out flyer mistake must keep bright look out not be caught napping be give everything good wide berth till be pretty certain of what be well said trust will not fall in with again pacific be pretty big place be not so easy to find craft in when know where to look for if do meet with again must do can to avoid hope for best ay ay returned bob hope for best prepare for worst ' be good maxim for man take clear of many difficulty enables to lay course on v'yage of life clean full with slack bowline a for here johnson 'd ask nothing better than to have just out of gun shot under lee with nice breeze not too much sea for little lily then let catch if be man enough for job certainly must not echo wish of bob be satisfactory to find that have such great confidence in boat in ability to escape from albatross so allowed to remain in undisturbed enjoyment of own opinion especially a seemed to afford considerable entertainment went on deck to take look at weather there be sign of gale breaking in fact seemed to be scarcely at height for away to windward looked a dirty a full of wind a ever sea be something awful to contemplate looked of course worse to than must to on deck of large ship even allowing for that be unquestionably running far higher than anything have ever seen before have read somewhere that scientific men assert that even in heaviest gale in mid ocean sea never attains greater height than twenty foot from trough to crest with due respect to science founded opinion take leave to assert that be in instance mistaken intelligent sailor modestly claim to be at least much be a capable of judging height of sea a most scientific of mortal be confident of many of sea watched that morning ran a high a cross tree be trifle over thirty foot above surface of water indeed to satisfy thoroughly upon point climbed so high with utmost difficulty at very great risk of being blown overboard whilst looking over cross tree saw crest of more than one sea rearing between eye horizon so far water lily have weathered gale scatheless there be not so much a rope yarn out of place carried away a there seemed to be greater danger than there have be through night a have taken good look round when aloft without seeing anything went below to enjoy comfort of cabin for on deck everything be cold wet dismal in extreme be anxious to get sight of sun at noon if possible so a to ascertain exact latitude knew be not very far to southward of staten did not know there might be current setting toward in case might find very awkwardly situated looked half inclined to break away two three time during morning a mid day approached became a bad a ever have vexation of seeing noon pas by without so much a momentary glimpse of sun towards evening therefore took advantage of exceptionally clear moment again scrambled aloft took thorough good look round especially to northward there be nothing in sight with be obliged to rest satisfied noticed just about time that sea be beginning to break on board again so concluded that bottle of oil be exhausted accordingly got out having bored hole in cork a have done with first be bent on to cable more cable paid out again rode easier anchor light be trimmed lighted hoisted up went below to tea supper a sailor generally term have found day dreadfully tedious cooped up a be in low cabin meal be most welcome break in monotony sat long over one therefore prolonging to utmost extent when be over turned to cleared up wreck by time that be done be intensely dark before settling down below for night put head up through companion to take last look round bob be rather beforehand with have sooner put head outside than pulled in again exclaiming in awe struck tone look here harry what d 'ye think of looked in direction indicated there upon lower mast head also upon trysail gaff end be globe of pale sickly green light wavered to fro lengthening out flattening in again a cutter tossed wildly over mountainous sea have not appearance of flame rather of highly luminous mist brilliant at core softening off becoming more dim a circumference of globe be reached emitted feeble unearthly light of great power have never seen thing before have often heard of recognised strange visitor at once a corposant lamp of saint elmo a be called by seaman of mediterranean though own sailor call by le dignified name of davy jones lantern what d 'ye think of bein boarded by like of again queried bob in hoarse whisper old davy be out on cruise to night reckon look a though meant to pay visit by h'isting two lantern of hisn in rigging did ye ever see anything like afore harry lad never replied have often heard spoken of old man though certainly be rather queer to look at be easily accounted for have heard said that be result of peculiar electrical condition of atmosphere that electricity attracted by such point a yard arm mast head of ship accumulates there until becomes visible in form be now looking at be light never visible except at end of spar queried bob believe not replied then sail exclaimed bob excitedly pointing in direction of starboard bow looked in direction indicated be too late be on very summit of wave at moment bob spoke be now settling into trough a rose to next sea however not only saw ghostly light also got indistinct view of ship be fearfully close appeared to be at moment sheering away from looked long enough for three masted vessel one mast only be standing evidently mainmast corposant appeared to have attached to stump of foremast have be carried away about fifteen twenty foot from deck thought bowsprit seemed also to be missing be scudding under close reefed maintop sail from sluggish movement be evidently very much overloaded what thought more probable have great deal of water in be more inclined to opinion from peculiar character of motion a rose on back of sea stern seemed at first to be pinned down a be until appeared a though following wave must run clean over gradually stern rose until be considerable height above water whilst bow in turn seemed weighed down a must be case with large body of water rushing from aft forward evidently saw light for faint hail of ahoy came down wind to from in distress want assistance by look of remarked bob poor chap be little of that can give heaven 'arth look at harry a spoke ship be rushing forward furiously on back of sea suddenly sheered wildly to port until lay broadside to crest of sea overtook breaking on board in one vast volume of wildly flashing foam threw down upon beam end a swept over mast declined more more towards water until lay submerged then a gazed in speechless horror at dreadful catastrophe loud piercing shriek rang out clear shrill above hoarse diapason of howling tempest rolled completely bottom upwards then disappeared broached to capsized ejaculated in same breath jump below bob rouse up coil of line whilst get life buoy ready exclaimed after single moment pause to collect scattered faculty in instant have four of buoy ready two of bent on to longest rope end must lay hand on in glorious bob appeared with coil of ratline on shoulder lighted blue light in hand stop be cut end of coil cleared in time two remaining buoy bent on while bob held blue light aloft at arm length for double purpose of throwing light a far a possible over water also to indicate whereabouts to strong swimmer who might be struggling for life among mountain surge to guide to tiny ark of refuge for nearly hour did peer anxiously into gloom in hope of seeing poor soul within reach of such assistance a be in power to afford in vain there be doubt that vessel sucked hand down with when sank into watery grave when at last reluctantly desisted from effort be in act of securing life buoy once more bob cast eye aloft called attention to fact that corposant have disappeared depend o harry quoth lantern did come aboard of for nothing might have meant mischief for exactly for ca always read old davy sign aright see did mean mischief plenty of too for sooner appears aloft than fine ship crew go down close alongside of a soon a bit of work be over away go somewhere else to light up scene of further devilry make manner of doubt be utterly in vain attempted to argue honest fellow out of belief that appearance be portent of disaster for mind be deeply imbued with superstitious notion appear to take such peculiarly firm hold on idea of sailor against superstition of lifelong duration argument reason be of little avail a may readily be believed slumber night after witnessing so distressing scene be anything sound bob be up down between deck cabin at least dozen time before morning be with sense of unutterable relief that a day broke found that gale be breaking also by time that breakfast be over there be sensible diminution in force of wind by noon cleared away sufficiently overhead to enable to get observation not particularly good one certainly sea be running far too high for enabled to ascertain that be at least sixty mile to southward of staten about four pm got very much better observation for longitude found by that drift have not be anything like so great a have calculated must be thought might possibly arise from being in weather setting current there be still rather too much of wind sea to make disposed to get under way that night managed to get craft up to buoy of floating anchor weighed let go again with five fathom of buoy rope be to prevent a much a possible further drift to leeward to take full advantage of current existence of suspected next morning however weather have so far moderated that tired of long inaction resolved to make start once more so shaking reef out of trysail rigging bowsprit out far enough to set small jib got floating anchor in stood away to southward westward with wind out from about west west volume one chapter x chased by pirate weather now rapidly became finer ocean no longer lashed into fury by breath of tempest subsided once more into long regular undulation wind hauled gradually more round from northward too blew warm balmy most welcome change after raw chilly weather have lately experienced once more cracked on sail upon little water lily on morning following that upon filled away upon course finding by observation that be well clear of cape that have plenty of room even must wind once more back round from westward hauled close up stood away on west by westerly course nothing of importance occurred for more than week weather continued settled glass stood high wind be out at about north sufficiently moderate to permit of carrying jib headed topsail day after day flew forward upon course seldom making le than ten knot in hour occasionally reaching a high a thirteen be perfectly jubilant for having rounded cape in safety now considered trouble over ultimate success a certain be fairly in pacific region of fine weather little barkie have behaved so well in gale that confidence in seaworthiness be thoroughly established so that fear of future danger from bad weather be completely taken off mind one morning wind having fallen considerably lighter during preceding night a soon a breakfast be over roused up square headed topsail with intention of setting in room of small one when proceeded to take latter in found that halliard be somehow jammed aloft shinned up to clear sailor if really be seaman not tinker tailor ever go aloft without taking good look round so after have cleared halliard clung to slim spar for minute two swept horizon carefully around sail ho shouted a caught glimpse of royal of vessel gleaming snowy white in brilliant sunshine far away in south western board where away shouted bob broad on lee bow answered still clinging to thin wire topmast shroud what d 'ye make out to be harry lad be next question barque brig answered latter be inclined to believe though be still too far away for mizzen mast to show if have one why d 'ye think be brig harry queried bob canvas look too small for of barque replied a slid down on deck having seen that be possible to see at present then be that albatross again for thousand ejaculated bob in tone of deep disgust be just p'int where might reasonably be looked for made sail long enough afore did a'ter gale have blowed out consequently got good long leg to west'ard of a have be steering perhaps couple of p'ints higher than have for most of time since have overhauled now be come round to go to nor'ard have fallen in with once more be inclined to take same view of matter bob did be true that when once ship pass out of sight at sea can never be sure of exact position afterwards yet under certain circumstance taking direction of wind state of weather a data upon to base argument in conjunction with course vessel be steering when last seen part of world to have reason to believe be bound be astonishing how near guess may be be not unfrequently made a to whereabouts now knew that albatross be bound to pacific when last saw because be then hove to evidently with intention of maintaining a weatherly position a possible have be bound to eastward weather be not so bad at time a to have prevented scudding before undoubtedly must have done under such circumstance making fair wind of at same time there be of course possibility of being mistaken a to craft in sight being pirate brig being by mean unusual thing for vessel a small a be even smaller to venture round cape well said perhaps will be safest bob to assume for present that brig be albatross what under such circumstance be advice of have weather gage d think queried bob be rather difficult to decide at present replied much depends upon of be fastest if be going at about same speed must say will pas extremely close to how be heading harry be next question to northward rather edging down towards if anything thought ay ay chuckled bob ai craft a can stick bowsprit into wind eye like here little barkie now dare swear be jammed hard up upon taut bowline here be going a close to wind a be thread ramping full take hold of minute hal let see what old eye of mine can tell about stranger took hold of tiller bob went aloft with deliberation of seaman who be in particular hurry having reached cross tree stood upon with one hand grasping peak halliard to steady whilst with other shaded eye see see exclaimed be raising fast harry boy in half hour so will see from deck then went a high a yard of topsail clung there for good five minute reading sign seaman see in almost imperceptible peculiarity of rig shape of sail etc having satisfied descended deliberately to deck evidently ruminating deeply now will tell ye what think of matter harry said a came aft seated beside there be familiar sort of look with craft away yonder seems to recognise a some'at have seen afore have moral doubt in world what be that villain johnson although ca be sartain of until get nearer look at have idee that if anything be be got weather gage if so by mean keep even if have to run gauntlet of broadside for minute two once let be to wind'ard in such weather a must fear smartest square rigged craft that ever be launched must lead end of dance then give slip a'terwards when be tired of fun so advice be to luff up a close a can not too close ye know lad let go through spring luff a can get let try what friend yonder be made of a long a be to leeward of game be let get to wind'ard of be ours to do what like with have in mind to take in canvas lie perdu until brig have crossed course be well out of road to northward must still be leaving weather gage saw fully a clearly a bob did advantage of obtaining if possible so on stood boldly lying good point higher than have be before steering yet keeping sail good clean full drawing to perfection wind however be dropping fast by time that sun be on meridian be not going more than five knot made extremely anxious more particularly a stranger proved remarkably fast vessel so much so that still remained matter of doubt of must cross other bob on other hand be delighted beyond measure stoutly avowing that falling breeze be little if anything short of divine manifestation in favour declared ready to stake be possessed of in world if brig must turn out to be pirate actually be staking life on speed a against that of stranger in light wind be already chuckling in anticipation over craft discomfiture be within about five mile of still maintaining relative position of about four point on lee bow when bob served dinner on deck a be custom in fine weather be very busy with viand keeping one eye always on brig however when noticed something fluttering over taffrail next moment flag of sort floated up to peak be at tiller so bob took glass levelling at brig gave more thorough scrutiny than have bestowed upon at hitherto star stripe pennant exclaimed with eye still at tube lord bless for two pretty innocent take for harry there of course know a have got character about at finger end well anyhow wo be behindhand with in matter of politeness therewith master bob dived below returning in moment with ensign club burgee in hand bent to respective halliard ran up one to gaff end other to mast head a have by time finished meal bob cleared thing away muttering something about having plenty to do afore long besides eating drinking colour have not be displayed above minute when four small ball be seen ascending to brig main royal mast head where broke abroad waved lazily out in failing breeze a signal bob at once assumed duty of signal officer by once more taking peep through glass commercial code pennant said then read out flag beneath run down fetch up signal book said did so turned up signal read come under lee wish to speak thank 'ee ejaculated bob not if can help mister johnson reckon 'twould be about most onprofitable conwersation a ever crew of here cutter took part in have got own wholesome plank to walk aboard here when want of sort of exercise though there be not much to boast of in way of room dare say there be more of than 'd find on plank 'd give for parade ground seems to hal a be bringing nearer abeam than be while ago ai so be right bob replied glancing at compass be more than point farther aft than be quarter of hour ago be not possible that be giving needle uneasiness craft certainly have look of albatross be not sure that be after d notice maintopmast staysail harry returned cut like trysail set on stay lead down just clear of fore top into sling of fore yard how many vessel will ye see with sail shaped like yet noticed that be other day there be red ribbon round too in fact be albatross over concluded with glass once more at eye be too evident that bob be right have be hoping that general resemblance of brig in sight to albatross be purely accidental be now within le than three mile of even without aid of telescope certain feature if may so term be recognisable identified beyond question a pirate brig what will do about answering signal bob said let fly a be un answered replied composedly look where be dropping to in quarter of hour will have fairly on lee beam that too out of gun shot unless a be most likely case be got long gun if have be small mark to fire at will soon slip out of range even of that be by time perfectly manifest that might be able to do in breeze have chance with in light air like present entertained strong hope of being able to slip past unscathed when felt sanguine of ability to get fairly away from in chase dead to windward evidently have notion of letting have own way in matter without pretty vigorous protest on part for a be still watching saw brig slowly luff into wind fore sheet be raised for moment flash of flame puff of white smoke darted suddenly from forecastle then saw jet spouting up where shot struck water a came ricocheting towards have aimed apparently so a to throw shot across fore foot fell short by about fifty foot do again lubber exclaimed bob contemptuously apostrophising brig three more such fool trick a will say good bye t'ye without ever having be within range see how long take to pay off ag'in harry very near lost way altogether when 'd have to box off with head yard by time 'd done that must be well clear of well did think man have more sense than to do like of friend johnson evidently saw mistake a clearly a did for fired more until have crept up fairly ahead of just a be crossing bow however have got mast in one by time have drawn considerably nearer brig fell off little not to repeat former error again came flash smoke ringing report here come straight for time mistake exclaimed bob a water jet again marked course of shot scaldings out of road of be got thin skull continued a shot came skipping across water in such long bound a showed be within range well missed added a shot struck water close to bounded fairly over boat passing close beneath main boom foot of mainsail without injuring so much a rope yarn be long gun bob said broadside gun must never reach so far a though be just now in rather warm quarter will be out of range again very soon then think need give further trouble concerning way have got something very like fulfilment of wish expressed other day ay ay be true hal have answered with quiet laugh do own be great satisfaction to that be carcumventin ' chap ' way will warrant be walking quarter deck at minute fit to bite finger off wi vexation at slipping past in style here shot from brig came bounding after offered much smaller mark than before inasmuch a be now nearly dead astern of consequently presented end instead of broadside view to shot shaved pretty close to windward nevertheless striking water for last time just short of taffrail scurrying along ploughing up surface close enough to give pretty copious shower bath of spray ere finally sank just ahead of next shot quickly followed passed almost a close to leeward third came straight enough fell just short of after fired more very cleverly managed call harry said bob a soon a found once more out of range can now take thing quietly a be watch below 'd recommend to turn in get bit of snooze be eight hour out to night lad if breeze must happen to freshen about sundown that chap come after by piper mean that same for be blest if be in stay will need to keep eye open watch be good advice at once proceeded to adopt cautioning bob to be sure to call without delay in event of further complication arising have not be below above two minute when heard voice shouting to to come on deck again wondering what be now in wind sprang up short companion ladder eye at once falling upon brig be now dead astern of heading in same direction a ourselves though not lying so close to wind saw in moment that trouble be not yet by mean over wind have by time fallen so light that be not making above three knot way through water whilst pirate appeared barely to have steerage way in fact canvas be flapping to mast with sluggish roll vessel took over long scarcely perceptible swell friend johnson be evidently greatly nettled at having slipped so handsomely through finger a have seemed determined to have word two with yet whether must for have lowered one of boat be just leaving vessel in chase took glass counted six men at oar besides one two must not be sure in stern sheet be serious indeed for light boat propelled by six good oarsman must go about two foot to one at then rate of sailing must necessarily soon overhaul case appeared pretty nearly desperate seaman never give up whilst there be shot in locker fresh expedient to be tried so directed bob to keep cutter away about three point then lash tiller lend hand to get balloon canvas set topsail be shifted in next to time then got spinnaker to bowsprit end leading sheet aft to main boom after took in jib stopped along bowsprit ready for setting again at moment notice hauled down staysail additional spread of canvas coupled with fact that be running far enough off wind to permit of drawing well made perceptible difference in speed quite knot considered bob agreed with now what be next thing to be done harry inquired a soon a have completed task of shifting sail be very well a far a go yon boat be overhauling at stroke of oar have only postponed pleasure of introduction to chap unless breeze happens to freshen up trifle of see sign just at present have made up mind replied must not be taken bob feel convinced that life must not be worth hour purchase if fell into hand of villain even supposing be to stop short of murder malignity must doubtless prompt to destroy little lily by such act past effort must be nullified future success rendered extremely doubtful must fight robert man now that can no longer run so let get gun up rigged without further delay by time that have ready will be within range think may persuade to turn back yet so be replied bob gleefully 'd always rather fight than run away harry lad at least when be anything like fair match so let rouse up pop gun have shy at gun be a think have mentioned before four pound rifled piece be specially made to order by eminent firm be most beautiful little weapon exquisitely finished be breech loader threw solid shot about mile shell nearly half a far again be mounted on swivel pivot have mean of firmly fixing to deck got out upon deck soon have mounted ready for service bob took tiller desiring to work gun a be not only more practised artillerist than knew also how to handle breech loader have knack somehow of shooting straight have loaded be in act of levelling when bob said suppose be to let chap get bit nearer hal afore open fire have notion that if get well away from brig well within range of little barker there might give peppering afore must get clear of ag'in a must sicken 'em of having more to do with perhaps might be quite onpossible to destr ' boat altogether then there be seven eight good hand wiped off chap book here ai like ordinary enemy see lad be sort of general enemy to mankind more harm can do to more good will be doing rest of world sounded rather like cold blooded barbarity proposal of bob to attempt destruction instead of repulse of boat in pursuit of word said in support of proposition be strictly true indeed such idea have be present in own mind so withheld fire for time at length however be within mile of thought might now fairly commence operation carefully levelled piece accordingly desiring bob to sit well out of line of fire steer a steadily a possible watched heave of cutter pulled trigger line shot sped straight for boat striking water just before reached bounded dear over into sea beyond there be shout from people in boat must see that stretched to oar with doubled exertion straight a must go harry lad rather too much elevation try again boy look smart about too for be giving way a if devil be behind probably be if did know bob returned keep cool old man there be hurry attend to steering of craft will undertake to cool courage for before be very much older ay ay retorted bob keep cool be be getting to be rather ticklish work lad ai be too busy with gun to reply just then in moment fired once more time saw splinter fly from bow of boat one of oarsman sprang from seat fell back into arm of man behind there be moment of confusion with then saw one of men in stern sheet there be two of step along thwart take injured man place looked like fixed determination to come alongside at price so time inserted shell instead of solid shot have before be firing once more after very careful aim little piece rang out again shot reached mark time with terrible effect for shell exploded a passed through boat thin planking fragment continuing flight forward told so severely among crew that appeared a if be more le hurt saw four fall from thwart at event hand ceased pulling whilst three of oar slipped unnoticed overboard unrove spinnaker sheet from main boom before astonished bob knew what be about let go halliard let sail down by run then jumped to jib halliard hoisted sail like lightning now shouted luff may bob let heave craft to finish job for a said bob put helm down whilst hauled jib sheet to windward then sprang aft again to gun by time have taken to oar again there be only two of pulling sure indication of extent to last shot have told be turning boat round to pull back to ship seeing felt compunction about firing on again said so be such soft hearted donkey harry lad retorted bob settle whole lot if can boy will only be so many skulking cutthroat le in world idee be that one of chap a can finish off be one honest man life saved so give of shell boy do seem wonderful persuader small a be accordingly loaded again fired probably from excitement fired too high missile flew harmlessly over boat next time be more careful aiming with utmost deliberation at length pulled trigger line immediately leapt to foot to watch for result shell struck boat stern fairly amidships close to water line there be explosion oarsman appeared to be unhurt almost immediately however one of sprang aft crouched down doing something that must not make out took glass then saw that large gap have be made by explosion of shell through water be doubtless pouring rapidly there be movement among wounded men one man jumped upon thwart waved hat to brig evidently a signal of distress captain have of course be watching time seemed to have conjectured that people be getting worst of for now saw that have second boat in water on taking look at brig through glass observed that have tackle on main yard arm with be hoisting out gun to put into boat be time be off once more bob remarked a soon a saw so shot at friend here then will fill away boat be very much disabled appeared to be sinking gradually notwithstanding effort to keep afloat for be now baling rapidly thought best to make sure of so once more loaded fired shell passed through stern time also exploded there be shrill scream from more than one agonised throat baling pulling ceased altogether man in be wounded if not killed outright satisfied with work of destruction not particularly caring to expose to fire of gun in other boat be doubt much heavier than own toy of weapon filled away once more swayed up spinnaker forward desiring bob to keep just sufficiently away to

that more powder must have to be burned after once more loaded little piece charging with shell a before whilst be doing pursuer opened fire upon miscalculated distance however power of gun for shot fell considerably short of much to bob delight to gave expression by utterance of few remark of such biting sarcasm raillery that must infallibly have still further incensed individual to whom be addressed must have heard too be very glad to see shot fall short for placed on somewhat more equal term than have dared to hope boat be large one probably launch pulled ten oar there be three men in bow working gun coxswain aft steering making altogether fourteen hand very heavy odds then on other hand boat be heavy crew after already long pull must not maintain violent exertion be now putting forth very much longer very trifling abatement in direction must enable to slip away from after moreover a be now within range of gun being rifled threw shot much farther than smooth bore there be possibility of being able so far to disable a to compel to give up chase accordingly levelled breech loader then waited for favourable opportunity to fire at length came shell entered starboard bow of pursuing boat about midway between gunwale water line immediately to great surprise there be violent explosion on board vivid flash of flame darted upward outward side of boat appeared to be violently wrenched apart at junction with stem gun carriage rose heavily in air about ten foot fell with tremendous splash into sea oar men be flung wildly about many of being blown fairly overboard whilst dense cloud of smoke arose for moment hid everything from view when cleared away there floated wreck of boat just awash there too among struggling crew in water darted to fro fin of terrible shark very probably same monster who have so recently feasted on shipmate shell have taken most fearful effect igniting ammunition thus blowing boat to piece at first discharge volume one chapter xi chase

distance from indeed be situated almost in very heart of extensive group of islet known a low archipelago when talking matter over before have decided that be quite possible must be obliged to take somewhat extended cruise among island to examine several of before coming upon one of be in search under circumstance came to conclusion that must be unadvisable to give pirate indication of true destination by steering on proper course a long a be in sight for destruction of two boat with loss of crew must undoubtedly kindle such desire for vengeance in breast of survivor a in likelihood to prompt to go good bit out of way if necessary to get so after long debate careful examination of chart brought on deck for purpose decided to bear away on course a though bound to new zealand took about point farther off wind than have be steering for last few hour did not trouble much about a hoped to give brig slip time during ensuing night accordingly bore away upon course decided on sail be trimmed with utmost nicety then being about time for evening meal took tiller while bob went below to look after kettle brig be by time about six seven mile astern of be steering directly after with apparently stitch of canvas set must draw lashed tiller for moment jumped down below for sextant with returned to deck carefully set by with view of ascertaining just before dark whether have gained anything on on in interim tea being ready bob served on deck whilst leisurely discussed meal talked over chance of dodging pursuer during night unfortunately now appeared to be rather slender for there be not cloud to be seen moon well advanced in second quarter be already visible in deep sapphire of eastern sky ere west have well begun to glow with rich warm hue of sunset to add to difficulty in respect wind again fell lighter ere long died completely away sun went down in calm cloudless splendour golden glory of west deepened into rich crimson then faded into purple from purple into warm grey brief twilight quickly deepened into night moon sweet regent of sky shed soft silvery beam abroad over tranquil ocean while larger star added mellow radiance to beautify scene there be not faintest breath of wind to ruffle mirror like surface of long glassy swell a undulated sluggishly beneath flap of canvas pattering of reef point creaking of main boom occasional cheep cheep of rudder upon pintle served to mark emphasise deep calm of sleeping nature be glorious night night of such exquisite loveliness a be perhaps never witnessed except when far away from land situated a be greatly a admired beauty must rather have witnessed sky traversed by fast flying cloud must gladly have exchanged tender silence brooded around for singing of wind through rigging hissing sound of rapidly following surge walked fore aft on short deck one on side smoking pipe whistling for breeze pausing occasionally to listen for roll of oar in rowlock plash in water for did not know what new trick

streak over surface of water close to be now revealing on horizon spreading gradually abroad on side of point at have first appeared slowly advancing over surface of ocean towards here come breeze bob exclaimed stay on deck few minute longer until can see what be to be order of night see there come away out from eastward brig be already squaring away yard a though felt first faint puff ay continued a took look at through glass there go stunsail boom there go stunsails to boot now rascal will run down to with first of breeze perhaps have under gun before can catch breath of cast loose spinnaker boom old man let get rigged out sail set in readiness for breeze when come if can only get before come within range of believe can walk away from even in run to leeward provided have breeze too strong worked with will reader may be sure soon have huge sail set on starboard side whilst main boom be guyed out to port then went round deck taking pull at halliard where necessary then though heavy dew be falling got up small hand pump hose have provided ourselves with gave sail thorough wetting brig ran down to within about couple of mile of before first faint cat paw came stealing over water towards then balloon topsail filled collapsed filled again spinnaker ceased rustle there be gentle surge a light strain first came upon spar rigging tiller began to vibrate beneath hand long ripple spread out from bow water lily began once more to slip gaily away got bob to give look to preventers in case must become matter of sheer carrying on then sent below a have be day of excitement for

ocean before watch be out have satisfaction of seeing that be certainly drawing away from persevering enemy broad flat model of lily being a favourable to sailing power before wind a deep keel be when close hauled called bob at midnight strictly cautioned to give timely notice if breeze freshened sufficiently to necessitate reduction of canvas if anything occurred rendering presence on deck desirable then dived below flung off clothes tumbled into hammock in twinkling of purser lantern be fast asleep when went on deck again at four o'clock found that breeze have freshened very considerably during watch below under other circumstance must most certainly have taken in spinnaker shifted topsail though have dropped brig considerably still hung most pertinaciously in wake so there be nothing for still to carry on craft must have be splendid sailer for though by time be going close upon sixteen knot have not increased distance from much more than four mile during time have be below nothing worthy of note occurred during watch wind appeared to have reached limit of strength now blew steadily with sufficient force to try spar gear to utmost not quite strong enough to carry anything away continued to increase distance from brig at seven bell called bob who set about preparation for breakfast great be mutual congratulation over meal at now thoroughly established fact fast a albatross undoubtedly be be match for little water lily in ordinary weather a soon a breakfast be over thing cleared away got observation for longitude then went below to have nap desiring bob to call at seven bell might take meridian altitude did so a soon a came on deck with sextant said look there harry what d 'ye think of must call ye when first made out a only wanted hour to seven bell knowed 'd feel bit tired after yesterday ai wonderful sight a spoke pointed away to little on starboard bow stooping down in order to see under foot of spinnaker there beheld what be indeed to wonderful sight away nearly a far a must see upon verge of horizon appeared vast herd school of whale spouting in direction indulging in most extraordinary gambol apparently striving to outvie others in feat of leaping entirely out of water be afraid to make anything like positive statement a to height achieved by of monster really appeared to that few of rose nearly if not quite five twenty foot into air descending again with splash reminded of of torpedo experiment have witnessed when staying for few day at portsmouth be careful to get observation rapidly worked out entered in log after relieved bob at tiller whilst went below to see to dinner a descended short companion ladder turned round observed with comical look say harry hope there ai stray sarpents knocking about in here neighbourhood 'twould be uncommon awk'ard for to have one of chap waiting for ahead that infarnal brig still in sight astarn just a dinner made appearance descried sail about two point on starboard bow be vessel under single reefed topsail heading to southward consequently standing across bow be too far off for to make out anything head of sail from deck a soon a saw resigned tiller to bob went up a far a cross tree to have better look at from thence made out to be barque apparently close hauled on port tack of what nationality might be be yet too far distant from to decide though thought from cut of sail that be english be still standing upon cross tree shouting observation to bob when noticed commotion amongst herd of whale be by time fast nearing bringing glass to bear at length made out three boat pulling towards whale be evidently rather doubtful a to intention of boat though be not saw at once that stranger be whaler that be boat despatched in chase whale came swimming leisurely to windward with boat in hot pursuit what to do be now question with ought most certainly to advise whaler of character of brig must never do to shorten sail deviate anything considerable from course with object must very probably be taken before must accomplish purpose in event must sacrifice without doing others good however a preliminary displayed ensign a boat be coming almost directly towards sheered sufficiently out of course to pas within hail of leader be now running through very thickest of herd be rather nervous work for with single lash of mighty tail one of monster might have destroyed with such cloud of canvas a be carrying deviation from course dared to make be very trifling have luffed for example high enough for spinnaker to jibe craft must probably have turned turtle with if have proved fortunate enough to escape must most certainly have made clean sweep of spar be almost within hail of leading boat when fastened to enormous whale creature dived instantly taking out line at tremendous rate still continuing on original course brought boat close past on starboard side crew sitting with oar apeak water foaming good foot above level of boat bow a be towed furiously along took trumpet in hand a dashed past hailed brig astern be pirate cut adrift rejoin ship a soon a possible boat steerer waved hand made attempt to free from whale feared have not clearly understood though saw men turning to other a though comparing note on communication have made boat steerer shaded eye with hand a took hasty look at rapidly approaching brig two other boat meanwhile be pulling away to southward in pursuit of couple of gigantic whale have separated from rest of herd from pace at be travelling seemed likely to lead pursuer pretty dance be quite out of power to convey warning to be most reluctantly compelled to stand on upon original course dead to leeward presently whale be struck turned sharp round came tearing back over ground have just traversed felt more than half inclined to take a broad sheer a dared out of way did not at like look of a came foaming down towards desire to repeat warning be stronger even than fear of whale watching narrowly a came up directed bob how to steer instant be past bob eased down helm sheered towards boat have in tow stood by with trumpet a before be unnecessary for a came alongside boat steerer sheered way whilst crew rapidly paid out line by mean whale boat speed be so reduced that have time to communicate before passed ahead cutter ahoy hailed boat steerer a rushed along within twenty foot of other what be that said just now brig astern of be pirate replied fired upon yesterday at mid day have be in chase ever since must advise to rejoin ship before come up if possible skipper will need hand on board if range alongside devil ejaculated in reply seem hit anywhere glancing aloft at taper spar snowy canvas showed wound shot hole to vouch for truth of statement no answered only have time to fire five shot at before slipped past to windward escaped untouched hang exclaimed in tone of vexation like to lose fine fish that be fast to will have to let go doubt of how devil be to recall other boat will fire gun to attract attention replied can make signal think most likely to effect object thank returned will be obliged if will then signalled to men who have charge of line gradually reduced speed at ran out finally held fast with extra turn round bollard away boat dashed once more charged gun still remained mounted on deck with blank cartridge duly greasing muzzle to increase report fired crew of whale boat tossed oar on end kept so for few minute until be seen that other boat have abandoned chase be pulling back toward crew of boat be fast to whale be knowing enough not to cut adrift so long a prize towed in direction wished to go a seemed to have started for regular long run to leeward appeared to stand very fair chance of being towed almost alongside ship have be making short stretch to windward ever since first sighted be by time within couple of mile of from motion judged that people left on board to work have heard report of gun have witnessed recall of other two boat perhaps suspected that something be wrong somewhere for be now plainly manoeuvring to close with three of boat a quickly a possible whale meanwhile have be running in direction a to cross barque bow about quarter of mile distant actually ran far enough to enable crew of boat have fastened to to cut adrift when fairly in ship course so that in very few minute after stroke of keen tomahawk have severed tow line be alongside boat be run up to davit so smart be crew of whaler in picking up boat that must have swung main yard moment frail craft be hooked on without waiting until be actually hoisted up barque have scarcely begun to gather way before hand be in rigging next moment be laying out on topsail yard turning out reef although breeze be so strong that half loaded a be be careening almost gunwale to passed close under stern skipper a drew near walked aft to taffrail hailed thank sir for information please report circumstance god know whether will escape rascal waved hand to signify understood must comply with request noting a did so name port of registry of vessel be painted on stern in white letter kingfisher of hull scarcely be past when saw small red flag go fluttering up to main topgallant mast head signal a supposed to hurry other boat back poor fellow be awkwardly situated have be hull down to northward southward pirate might possibly in eagerness of desire for vengeance upon have allowed to pas on unmolested now that barque lay almost directly within path dared not hope for such display of forbearance there be many store on board well found whaler must be most useful to men situated like desperado on board brig must scarcely forego opportunity of making acquisition for sake of continuing to chase craft be indubitably walking away from fast must run out of sight altogether in few hour more unless accident occurred to place within power watched proceeding of two vessel with most absorbing interest a may well be supposed lily be very quickly far enough to leeward of barque to enable to see two boat clear of bow noticed that crew be pulling with might main in about ten minute time be once more shut in by intervention of vessel hull between before must open out astern of barque went in stay having apparently stood on far enough to fetch boat on next tack brig have in interim run down to within about four mile of whaler be still flying along dead before wind with everything set up to topgallant stunsails on side sign have so far revealed on board by must judge of intention of crew by time that have run mile saw whaler main yard once more thrown aback indication that be about to pick up other two boat there now appeared to be strong probability that must have time to hoist in be off again before pirate must approach within gun shot situation became eminently exciting so anxious be that whaler must have chance of making escape that directed bob to let go spinnaker out haul allow traveller to run in along boom in hope that by leading pirate to believe have become necessary for to shorten sail might be tempted after to keep on in chase of instead of interfering with barque must have afforded almost unmitigated satisfaction to have seen continue chase for now felt perfectly satisfied that in moderate weather have heel of albatross close hauled running free must succeed in decoying far enough to leeward to permit of whaler making good escape be willing to trust to future for mean of ultimately shaking vindictive pursuer off in further prosecution of project a soon a bob have got spinnaker in lashed tiller for moment jumped forward to assist in getting in enormous balloon topsail foresaw must have to be taken off craft shortly if wished to save topmast wind being rather on increase rigging already strained to tension of harp string done found time to take look at whaler main yard be just swinging a turned glance in direction then bow fell off until headed about north west men springing into rigging scurrying away aloft to loose topgallant sail one hand meantime laying out on jibboom to loose flying jib away went jolly old craft in magnificent style heading about north west evidently upon best point of sailing crossed stern shutting out pirate brig for moment fully expected that when craft next appeared must see hauled up in chase nothing of kind on came still heading direct for began to hope that plan of luring on to follow be about to prove successful two three minute seemed like age to elapsed then in moment stunsails studding sail a ought more correctly to spell word collapsed fluttered wildly for few second in breeze disappeared royal halliard be let go sail rolled up furled a hauled up to follow barque foresail lifted there be flash puff of white smoke before report have time to drive down to saw shot skipping along from wave to wave a polite intimation to barque to heave to whaling skipper be not man to give up without struggle have studding sail be heading in such direction that brig must not use hers while following seemed that trusted to light trim to enable to get clear gun after gun be now rapidly fired by pirate be not yet within range though be only too evident that must be before very long greatly feared that barque chance of escape be remarkably small in about hour disappeared in north western board when last seen barque be still carrying on with pirate banging away at most perseveringly with long gun thank goodness be shut of blackguard at last exclaimed bob a sail of two craft sank below horizon though be duberous be poor look out for whalin ' chap if poor beggar get caught be small marcy a will have showed unless there be on white livered enough to jine brig to save life skipper johnson wo be partic'lar amiable reckon a'ter loss of two boat crew yesterday two twenty hand told suppose a be man to mind much who have revenge upon so long get what be to be next move lad now be once more alone by ourselves have be thinking about replied expect pirate will trouble head about more now that have lost sight of may will be just a well to provide against such contingency if resume chase will most probably look for somewhere on course be steering when last seen else to northward there be nothing to take to southward so be most improbable direction in opinion in be likely to look for therefore be direction in propose to steer let make craft snug stand away to southward full by at eight o'clock to morrow morning will go about make leg to northward eastward for perhaps twenty four hour will place well to windward in about last spot in world where must think of looking for do think of plan bob fust rate responded that worthy regular traverse about most in out bit of carcumvention a ingenuity o man must invent let set about at once lad by time a have cleared up bit made thing comfortable will be time to see about gettin ' tea accordingly set about making thing comfortable forthwith balloon topsail be carefully rolled up put away spinnaker have only allowed to run in close to mast have hastily secured with stop two ditto topmast housed spinnaker boom be run in unrigged secured then gibed mainsail over stood away close hauled about south east little lily staggering along in regular racing style under whole lower canvas when by right with amount of wind have ought to have have at least one reef down number jib shifted for number however be used to carrying on by time have become so thoroughly intimate with cutter sail carrying power that knew might safely give canvas spar must bear by time that be done gun did not think while to dismount stow away again for present carefully covered over with painted canvas coat sun be on verge of horizon weather having settled appearance with promise of breeze holding good through night end of volume one volume two chapter wreck of copernicus at eight o'clock next morning nothing having occurred during night worthy of record went about stood away about north east on starboard tack wind continued fresh steady averaged quite thirteen knot during whole of next twenty four hour having carried out plan for eluding brig being by time well to windward of spot where parted company with considered might now with safety bear away upon course accordingly did directly after breakfast setting balloon gaff topsail once more getting spinnaker to bowsprit end again additional canvas have effect of increasing speed to fully sixteen knot alteration of course produced corresponding very agreeable change in motion of yacht quick jerky plunge of vessel digging into head sea being exchanged for long easy swinging roll be far more conducive to comfort especially a now enjoyed added luxury of dry deck three day passed utterly devoid of incident except that wind gradually hauled far enough aft to enable to shift spinnaker from bowsprit end to starboard side once more be flying along upon course with wind nearly dead fair stitch of canvas spread that have mean of packing upon little craft with low hull must have presented appearance of snow white pyramid gliding unsupported over surface of ocean on morning of fourth day a came upon deck at seven bell to relieve bob whilst looked after breakfast old fellow said here harry eye be younger than mine what d 'ye make out to be away here broad upon starboard bow looked in direction indicated saw what appeared to be stump of three spar just showing above horizon took glass went aloft a far a crosstrees from coign of 'vantage made out that be lower mast of full rigged ship of considerable size for must see three lower yard with long streamer of canvas fluttering from topmast be carried away close to cap hung over side with topgallant mast yard sail etc still attached great tangled mass of wreck there be signal of distress flying on board so far a must see so concluded that vessel be derelict a must not take very much out of way a be in great hurry resolved to haul up take nearer look at accordingly having advised bob of what have seen of intention took in spinnaker gaff topsail lowered topmast then hauled up for stranger hour afterwards be near enough to make out that be most beautiful craft of about eighteen hundred ton register with very little matter with apparently except have be dismasted doubtless in sudden squall saw one boat at davit be one at starboard quarter have be smashed completely in two by wreck of mizzen topmast in fall therefore concluded that crew seized by unaccountable panic have left be within quarter of mile of vessel when solitary figure of female appeared upon lofty poop sooner saw approaching than waved handkerchief to vehemently to responded by waving hat when seeing that signal have be observed sank down upon lid of skylight seemed to give way to violent flood of tear why damn if look a if mean cowardly crew have be desarted poor thing exclaimed bob with unusual vehemence a noticed that figure never moved a though to direct attention of others to approach look very like replied will soon see will be awkward matter to board however with wreck dangling about to leeward stand by to ease jib sheet up a put helm down minute be hove to on ship lee quarter a near a dared approach young girl for such now saw to be have by time so far recovered composure a to rise up once more approach lee side of deck taking off hat making best bow hailed be alone on board there yes oh yes replied in sweetest voice have ever heard have be quite alone for more than week pray pray go away leave again sir have be nearly mad will die if remain alone here much longer make mind quite easy dear young lady replied certainly will not leave come what may will be very difficult for to get on board with spar swaying about attempt to do so may occupy much time suffer slightest apprehension will get off wreck somehow never fear after remarked half to half to bob believe quickest way out of difficulty will be for to jump overboard swim alongside there be plenty of rope end hanging over side to help on board oh sir exclaimed eagerly indeed must hing of kind there be immense shark down there pointing under counter have scarcely left ship moment since sailor went away be awkward there seemed chance of being able to get on board to leeward whole of ship starboard side being completely encumbered with wreck there be far too much sea to permit of running alongside to windward took careful glance at gear aloft then made up mind what to do ship fore yard be lying nearly square yard arm projecting several foot beyond ship side decided to board by mean of fore brace to windward young girl telling what to do to assist then set about making preparation for leaving water lily in bob sole charge for while took double reef in mainsail took jib in altogether running in jib boom also placed craft under handy canvas for one man to work at same time prevented possibility of jib boom being carried away also got cork fender upon deck in case of unavoidably dropping alongside be then ready to make proposed experiment young girl have meantime made lee fore brace fast have then gone over to windward cast off running part of weather brace threw overboard now hailed again telling what be about to do then signed to bob to put helm up cutter fell off until be dead before wind when gibed hauled again to wind on starboard tack so a to cross ship stern at sufficient distance to insure success of contemplated manoeuvre bob be splendid helmsman must have hesitated about attempting feat be now going to put in practice a slightest nervousness want of tact on part must have resulted in very serious damage to lily if did not actually cause total destruction have full confidence in skill moreover be there not woman to be rescued from position might at moment become one of most imminent peril even if be not so already so a soon a be far enough to windward signed to bob to put down helm round little craft came like top away flew down towards ship weather side going well free with sheet flattened in ready to luff claw off to windward moment have got hold of brace down swept direct for ship weather quarter fair girl standing again upon poop watching motion with most overwhelming anxiety at exactly right instant bob eased helm gently down cutter shot along ship lofty side within ten foot of stood just forward of rigging ready to seize brace moment came within reach in instant have shouting to bob to luff swung off into air made best of way aloft hand over hand have be original intention to ascend to yard arm laying in from thence descend fore rigging to deck pausing for moment in anxiety to see whether bob must scrape dear very cleverly did having kept good way on boat found that aided by roll of vessel might easily swing in upon rail soon managed landing upon deck to find confronted by most lovely little creature can imagine who extended hand impulsively to a exclaimed oh welcome sir welcome thousand thousand thanks for coming to help at such danger too how can ever repay be more than repaid already replied for very slight trouble have taken by happiness of finding in power to rescue from present situation first thing to be done continued be to provide for safety of little craft after will have ample time hope to make suitable arrangement for transferring on board ah lucky thought continued a saw sounding rod line attached to fife rail let see what water craft have in sounded found there be barely two foot of water in hold so be evident that vessel be perfectly tight seaworthy except a to damage aloft bob have by time passed ahead to leeward be now approaching on lee quarter once more waited until be within hail then told to heave to well clear of ship a proposed to cut adrift wreck task thought must manage without very much difficulty when done must enable water lily to come alongside to leeward waved hand in reply fore sheet being already to windward left cutter to take care of herself while seated composedly in deck chair to smoke pipe watch proceeding soon found tomahawk armed with went up mizzen rigging intending to work way forward be hard work single handed by noon have succeeded in clearing whole mass away ship soon drifted free of leaving upper spar confused floating mass upon water a soon a be done got eight inch hawser off top of house forward managed with considerable labour to get coiled down afresh upon poop then bent on heaving line to one end of hawser by mean got to cutter when moored securely astern of ship bob then came on board up rope have lashed to mizzen boom end for accommodation found time to look around a soon a fair hostess saw fairly at work upon wreck aloft have betaken to galley saw from time to time during interval of labour busying in sundry culinary operation now came upon poop where bob be standing announced that dinner be ready adding be sure must stand in need of after hard morning work thanked said before go below permit to introduce name raising hat bowing be henry collingwood be owner of small craft now hanging on astern indicating bob who took off hat made most elaborate scrape be friend well tried shipmate robert trunnion who with will do can to make comfortable on board cutter will stand by to death if need be until have placed in perfect safety fair girl seemed much affected by speech bowing most gracefully in return said name be ella brand have be left alone in ship by what can not believe be dreadful mistake accept hospitality help a frankly a have offered now gentleman that be properly introduced with gay laugh permit to conduct to cabin come pussy last invitation be bestowed upon pretty little playful kitten have be following girl about ship morning when entered cabin a be case in most large ship be on deck found most sumptuous meal prepared other danger little fairy might have be exposed to be quite evident that miss brand have be in immediate danger of starving like sensible girl have obtained access to ship store be evidently well acquainted with most approved method of preparing food for human consumption meal be thoroughly pleasant one for be happy that assistance have come to that have be good fortune to bestow whilst sitting at table sweet little creature gave history recounted circumstance have placed in present position a there be nothing very remarkable in will give in condensed form a have most wholesome dread of wearying reader told that be only child that for last ten year have be resident in canton whither father have proceeded to take possession of lucrative appointment after residence of five year there mother died father who be passionately attached to wife seemed never to have recovered from blow five year more passed away husband followed fondly loved companion dying so ella asserted sobbingly of disease in particular of gradual wasting away result a believed of slowly breaking heart thus found left alone almost friendless in strange land after taking counsel with such friend a father have made have with assistance disposed of everything have taken passage in copernicus to london in faint hope of being able to find friend of mother of whom have heard have never seen mother having contracted what be termed mesalliance in other word love match with one whom friend chose to consider infinitely beneath in social position ship be bound home by way of cape horn having to call at sandwich island buenos ayres on way have gone well until eight day before when appeared ship be struck by sudden squall time during night thrown on beam end dismasted a ella have remained during whole time cowering terrified in berth supposed crew have gone away in boat forgetting in hurry panic a soon a squall be over ship have gradually righted again when went on deck next morning found everything in state of wreck confusion herself pet kitten few fowl in coop only living thing on board story ended bob expressed sympathy for friendless condition repeated protestation of devotion for of be thanked anew so sweetly that must have gone on making promise for rest of day with prospect of such reward at end of be not good at personal description so will not attempt elaborately to describe ella brand imagine petite demoiselle of seventeen year of age of almost fairy like proportion faultlessly formed with most

happy conferred happiness upon who have good fortune to be thrown in society dinner ended bob adjourned to deck to make preparation for transferring fair young guest to water lily so a to be fairly away from wreck again before nightfall a soon a be out of cabin bob observed falling in with here wrack so pronounced word downright providential harry here have fust of very great pleasure of being of sarvice to most charming young 'oman next have chance of filling up store water not afore 't be time too for bethought morning of seeing how tank stood be blest if ai abeost at last drop be lucky there be plenty of aboard here see more water cask about deck than will supply a want think first job have better be to get hose pump under weigh fill up water a'ter can soon strike few odds end into cutter such a will be useful then sooner be off better set to work with will ella coming on deck at moment requested to pack box in readiness for sending over side asking at same time whether must take long replied briskly oh have brought hardly anything with only three large box one small one only chest apiece held bob own stock of clothing considered opulently supplied here be young girl who have brought hardly anything with only such few trifle a must stow away in three large box one small one three large box by way turned out to be considerably larger than of sea chest small one must have sufficed for seaman on three year voyage did not hesitate about helping freely to best ship afforded judging that be highly improbable must ever reach port unless fallen in with taken possession of by exceptionally strong handed vessel even then petty appropriation must never be missed laid in liberal stock of dainty of various kind for especial benefit of lady passenger must never have dreamed of taking on own account also transferred one coop with a many fowl a must conveniently accommodate to cutter made free with very handsome swinging cot found in captain cabin also for passenger use together with good stock of bedding collected together on lee side of deck when everything be ready got cutter alongside with considerable difficulty got over side down on deck bob went on board water lily to receive stow away a lowered down at length be ready only remained to get ella on board shove off have le difficulty with than expected be rather nervous nevertheless seated courageously with beloved kitten in lap in bobeun chair have rigged for accommodation held on tight shutting eye a swung off ship bulwark until felt bob brawny arm receive on deck of cutter then quickly followed fast be cast off wore round stood away once more upon course just a sun dipped below horizon first task be to crowd canvas must muster upon yacht to make up for day delay when ella came up from cabin whither have gone upon exploring expedition expressed greatest surprise little alarm at change have wrought in water lily appearance must not understand said how so small vessel must support towering spread of canvas a now saw courting fresh evening breeze presence of fair guest on board made certain alteration necessary in internal arrangement of cutter left bob at helm in animated conversation with ella whilst went below to effect cooking stove be shifted aft whole of fore compartment be thus left free for accommodation of young lady at once converted into sleeping apartment for by swinging cot there selected part of vessel for purpose a be only one in must be entirely uninterrupted by passage to fro be nice light roomy apartment in proportion to size of vessel there being nothing in having large circular plate of very thick roughened plate glass let into deck above having made place a comfortable a resource permitted returned to deck relieved bob at tiller

companion that two have completely broken ice between a soon a remains of meal have be cleared away want of pet kitten attended to little lady came on deck commenced animated conversation with bob a smoked pipe of peace ella declaring that quite liked odour of tobacco asking thousand question full of wonder that dear little tiny yacht have come way from england be most anxious to try hand at steering thought must do quite well promised must instruct at more favourable opportunity explaining that be just then so circumstanced that none experienced helmsman must be trusted with tiller being more difficult to steer properly when running before wind than at other time look quite easy persisted to hold that handle move much surely must do little be doing used to steer copernicus sometimes never must go straight with be so tiring to keep turning great wheel round bob laughed joyously at quaint speech proceeded laboriously to hold forth on science of helmsman interlarding lecture copiously with nautical illustration sea phrase be so much greek to pupil who listened with open eyed earnestness be most entertaining heard bob with utmost patience attention until have utterly exhausted entire stock of precept when thanked a courteously sweetly a though have understood word of then electrified set off into fit of perfectly uncontrollable laughter by asking in same breath to

with precision bob must not surpass in very short time must steer a well a of be immense advantage when shortening making sail add to amusement derived from incessant lively prattle additional cheerfulness thus infused into daily life reader will agree with think that be lucky day for when first fell in with little ella brand volume two chapter ii miracle by time that fair guest have be on

found must even condescend so far a to acknowledge a relative much le assist in way inclined to opinion that must not there be many circumstance to justify sentiment notably one have occurred short time previous to departure of parent from england father be at time suffering from nervous debility severe mental depression result of over work incessant anxiety to such deplorable condition be reduced that for considerable time be completely incapacitated for work of kind family resource dwindled to low ebb process being materially hastened by heavy doctor bill other expense connected with

that may soon fall in with sandal wood trader in case must have opportunity of returning to china re shipping from thence home hope will responded rather dolefully thought have be very good to eye welling up with tear will never forget know presence must be great inconvenience embarrassment to pray stop interrupted be under greatest misapprehension if suppose presence on board water lily be other than source of most unqualified gratification to crew be evidently quite ignorant of beneficent influence of presence here must never have spoken of a inconvenience departure will occasion keenest regret whenever take place be not that cramped accommodation must occasion very considerable discomfort must rejoice at almost circumstance must necessitate remaining with for rest of voyage

be a good a pantomime to see worthy old fellow chuckled gleefully a fancy conjured up look of surprise knew title on lip must evoke from declare exclaimed ella in tone of great vexation be most provoking there never mind bob dear mean be very kind to must not take notice of foolish speech so really think water lily be not dangerous why then must mr collingwood wish to leave told morning that must be sorry if did so yet seems unwilling to let stay believe little one heard bob answer want ye to go be kind of conscientious scruple a be got into head make talk that a'way between here voice

voice capable of making little craft whole interior ring again must not imagine a light step touched ladder closed eye feeling somehow must rather sweet little thing must not know have overheard conversation just past have scarcely composed feature when stood beside have feeling that be stooping over certainly felt warm breath upon face for instant then seemed to draw back again heard soft whisper of harry then there came light touch upon arm said much louder mr collingwood be eight bell ay ay answered rubbing eye then started to foot little fairy have gone fluttering away forward so took sextant went on deck in minute two reappeared seeing with sextant in hand opened chronometer got slate in readiness for taking time obtained three most excellent sight from worked up longitude have obtained accurate observation for latitude at noon on going below laying off position on chart have satisfaction of seeing that be drawing well in with island that if breeze lasted must be fairly within group by evening next day when announced intelligence to companion be delighted ella especially having seen land since leaving sandwich island declared be age ago last land have seen be staten island though caught loom of land thought did when about abreast of western end of magellan strait be longing for run ashore a have resolved to thoroughly group from end to end if need be for trace of father decided that must commence with eastern end examining island in slightest degree answered to description given of spot on amazon have be cast away little lady guest spent much of time on deck sitting in deck chair within easy conversational range of have tiller favoured with company during whole of first watch being eight hour out that night be unusually silent gazing in absent dreamy manner for most of time far away over tranquil starlit sea softly humming bar two of of favourite song occasionally made one two attempt to draw into conversation fearing be in low spirit answered at random in monosyllable seeing after while have chance gave up next morning when bob came on deck to wash down said bob what be matter with miss brand have idea looked curiously at for moment then said matter nothing a know on what must be matter with little dearie nothing must be matter with answered rather tartly perhaps seemed unusually silent unlike last night a seem pretty deep in confidence thought might know cause ay ay returned do speak pretty free to will allow account for by being old man at least seems to think so if may judge by what said yesterday a to knowing cause of being out of sort like perhaps do perhaps have suspicion pretty strong one be too ai for like of to say word axe question harry lad just leave thing to work out will be all right again shortly take word for be ill do think bob inquired in anxiety ill do look like queried with loud laugh be well enough woman be most oncommon difficult to understand boy only way be to let alone take notice when seems queer now axe question for know anything about what guess ai going to tell what old fellow surmised be quite impossible for to imagine equally impossible to extract from for be a stubborn a mule if made up mind to certain course nothing earthly have power of turning from so with unpleasant sensation that there be mystery somewhere be obliged to hold tongue console with reflection at event must be nothing concerned personally shortly after conversation ella made appearance at head of companion ladder bidding cheery good morning summoned to breakfast a soon a coffee be poured out have fairly commenced meal said if ever have secret to discus mr collingwood must advise to seek other place than deck of water lily sailor appear to have habit of talking loudly in open air be awakened by voice morning quite unintentionally heard much if not of conversation be sorry quiet mood of last night must have given uneasiness hope will be relieved when assure that there be nothing whatever matter with be singularly susceptible to surrounding influence solemn beauty of night excited within feeling of not sadness altogether of gravity almost amounting to have now entirely passed away best plan will be to follow bob advice take notice of varying mood for really have significance have not least idea what be that worthy fellow suspect a being matter with whatever be be quite mistaken for be happy to say be perfectly well in body mind felt greatly relieved at explanation said so ella a though to make up for silence of previous night be rattling away in more lively strain than ever when bob shouted from deck land ho where away queried springing to foot leaving breakfast unfinished right ahead up among cloud by be wonderful answered bob put head above companion there sure enough directly ahead about ten twelve degree above horizon appeared island apparently floating in air be low judging from small grove of tree distinctly appeared of great extent took glass through everything presented wavering appearance a though island upon consisted of infinite number of separate distinct particle revolving in spiral direction upwards called ella on deck to see singular phenomenon for be more perfect example of mirage than have ever before witnessed must have believed possible a continued to gaze upon curious spectacle faint foamy appearance revealed between island still in sky about hour afterwards distinctly took form of flying spray from breaker beating upon reef mirage lasted rather more than hour then faded gradually away how far d 'ye reckon that island be away harry lad queried bob when have finished breakfast be mustered on deck once more really said be very difficult matter to decide by reckoning ought not to see until about three afternoon with wind a be hope will see by time so a to get inside reef to night if look very enticing will stay there few day give little craft overhaul in hull spar rigging miss brand will have opportunity of getting few run on shore meanwhile perhaps little fruit a change of diet reckoning proved correct for about three o'clock afternoon a be sitting aft with tiller rope in hand saw top of cocoa nut tree appearing above horizon a did not wish to disturb bob not feeling sure of being able to lie at anchor night without watch requested ella who a usual be assisting to keep watch on deck to take tiller whilst shortened spinnaker gaff topsail be got in rolled up spinnaker boom run in topped up by time eight bell have struck bob have come on deck be near enough to render necessary to haul up look out for passage through reef at first sight seemed a though be not to be permitted to approach island for unbroken line of heavy surf extended north south to distance of fully nine mile completely barring passing through eastern side of reef began to believe that if channel existed at felt sure there must be one somewhere must lie on western side however did not want to run to leeward if must help for though lily being fore aft rigged be better suited to turning to windward in narrow passage than other class of vessel did not wish to risk boat by performance of such hazardous operation for have heard that channel through reef be of so contracted that there be positively room for even small vessel to tack in many of reach so made bowline in end of gaff topsail halliard went aloft in with intention of remaining there if need be to con craft in have hauled to wind on starboard tack with head to northward water lily be now with fore sheet to windward jogging quietly along towards northern extremity of island kept careful watch on reef close to leeward traversed whole extent to northward without sign of channel revealing so shouted to bob to go round stand to southward again from elevated position be enabled to make tolerably complete examination of island exhibited trace whatever a far a must see of being inhabited appeared to be about six mile in length by about three in width at widest part though coast line be very irregular in place estimated that be not much more than half that width trended about north north east south south west be very low part rising apparently much higher than forty fifty foot above level of sea whilst for most part did not appear to be higher than perhaps ten twelve foot vegetation be extremely luxuriant small grove of cocoa nut occupying very nearly central position on western side of island whilst remaining portion be pretty thickly covered with le lofty tree ground being clothed with deliciously fresh green turf endless variety of shrub narrow strip of clean white sand bordered whole island outside of again extended placid water of lagoon barely ruffled by evening breeze lagoon be a reader will probably know belt of water surrounded island intervening between encircling coral reef on heavy swell expended force without being able to reach disturb still water inside be within mile half of southern extremity of island when detected thin line of unbroken water tortuously threading way across reef extending clear into lagoon mouth must never have be observed from deck indeed from deck of ship for channel entered reef at acute angle surf broke so heavily upon outside overlapping ledge that foam spray be carried quite across narrow opening mingled with broken water on opposite side from elevation must see that there channel be having satisfied a drew down towards that be unbroken decided to run in through have lily be moderately large vessel square rigged must not have be taken through for there be one point about midway across reef where believed passage must not exceed thirty foot in width be at very awkward bend there be so many sharp turning to use shore phrase that square rigged vessel yard must not have be handled rapidly enough to meet frequent quickly succeeding change of direction be very different with directed bob to haul aft weather jib sheet lee fore sheet thus providing for keeping of one of head sail always full to trim mainsail with moderately flowing sheet after might leave canvas to take care of whilst gave undivided attention to helm be soon done bore away in direction indicated look out ahead from deck must have be alarming enough for great a be bob confidence in judgment steady a be nerve must not forbear hailing hope harry shouted that be quite sartain about there passage see nothing ahead anywheres else for matter on bow surf mind ye lad if touch once little barkie will be knocked into match wood may still claw off if there be doubt port hard answered too intent on channel to enter into explanation just then steady steady responded bob stay close to dearie so to be within reach if anything happens mind get knocked overboard with boom ah right see opening water lily shot in past overlapping ledge companion on deck be treated to copious shower bath of spray for few second then began to feel shelter of reef shot along first reach soon approached sharp elbow look out on deck shouted be about to jibe bob stand by to give helm smartly steady starboard now starboard hard ram helm down so steady now port little steady again luff may handsomely not too close now stand by for half board luff let come up luff shake so now hard up so on so on luff keep away then jibing now on one tack now on until after about ten minute of most ticklish navigation cutter shot clear of reef glided rapidly over smooth water of lagoon bob let draw jib sheet stood away towards southern extremity of island soon rounded remaining still aloft to look out for sunken rock might chance to be lying about bottom be quite clear sand being distinctly visible from post at mast head be now on western side of island observed that grove of cocoa nut tree before referred to stood upon border of pretty little bay cove rather for be very small a spot promised very snug anchorage close to shore directed bob to steer for then descended to deck got anchor over bow in readiness for letting go a drew closer to land sail became partially becalmed under lee of tree shrub densely covered southern end of island whilst water be undisturbed by faintest ripple save that streamed away on side of sharp bow a stood forward looking down into clear transparency of cool green depth must discern here there few large branch of splendid coral projecting through sand with multitude of strangely formed fish darting round about in one spot observed what appeared to be small bed of oyster of instantly took bearing resolving to pay visit try for few at length slid gently into little cove bob put helm down cutter luffed into wind a soon a way be deadened sufficiently let run anchor after with one accord bob took off hat gave three joyous cheer be first time have brought up since leaving madeira soon have canvas furled whilst ella busied with preparation for tea bob got boat on deck set about putting together whilst thus engaged companion remarked well harry must say did like look of thing for minute two whilst be running down upon reef outside piloted in in capital style did ye happen to think however how be going to get out ag'in now that be here certainly did replied surely imagine must run in here without being satisfied beforehand that must get out again all right there be time for explanation whilst be aloft just before caught sight of channel through entered distinctly saw one on side of island through must have beaten little craft without much difficulty appeared to have only two reach think might have laid up one of on port tack other on starboard tack a to getting out will be run with wind free way what do think of berth snug comfortable a heart must wish responded with accent of keen enjoyment do hope a will give little craft holiday of day two now be here 'two do of harm really feel a though must go ashore lie down under shade of tree day hing just enjoy rest coolness ease old eye by looking up at beautiful green leaf with clear blue sky peeping between 'em here there have very similar feeling for though island have nothing very specially attractive about to who have looked on nothing sky sea for so long appeared little short of paradise so very readily acquiesced in proposal more so a felt that health must be very greatly benefited by change by time that have boat put together hanging astern by painter tea be ready so after comfortable ablution by way of bringing day work to close seated ourselves at small cabin table discussed meal with luxurious enjoyment of perfect steadiness of cutter of absence of anxiety of kind be quite novelty finished meal by lamplight then adjourned to deck where a be regular custom bob smoked evening pipe only who have endured monotony of long sea voyage can understand pleasure with regarded surroundings compared with of many evening past night have completely closed in deep unclouded purple vault above be thickly studded with star unlike in northern hemisphere instead of glittering spark like cold beamed with deep mellow lustre of softest lamp being clearly reflected in mirror like surface of unruffled lagoon be a believe have said before on western lee side of island so completely sheltered from wind by thick clustering tree shrub covered surface that only faintest zephyr must approach though swept briskly through topmost branch of cocoa nut gently agitating leaf producing soft rustling sound above loud roar of surf beating on reef to windward must be distinctly heard mingling with there issued from shore continuous chirping singing from innumerable multitude of insect swelling shrill high merged into one vast wave of sound completely filled air ten of thousand of fire fly flitted to fro tiny spark gleaming brilliantly against dark background of dense foliage if looked over side for moment saw deep obscurity of tranquil ocean constantly flashing into sudden brightness a long trail of pale phosphorescent spark momentary halo betrayed movement of finny denizen of deep remained on deck until nearly midnight when having observed nothing to excite slightest apprehension a to absolute safety resolved to dispense with formality of watch therefore retired below with understanding that morrow be to be observed a strict holiday by hand volume two chapter iii at close quarter with shark awoke soon after sunrise next morning calling bob in accordance with arrangement made overnight jumped on board boat pulling to opposite side of tiny headland about mile away stripped plunged overboard where swam dived wallowed about in deliciously cool element for good half hour enjoying bath a thoroughly a though be couple of school boy playing truant be strongly tempted to make small preliminary exploring excursion inland after miss ella have solemnly bound down not to do so without so returned to water lily instead wonderfully refreshed invigorated by dip quite ready for early breakfast be to form first regular feature in programme for day a rowed back to cutter embraced opportunity to pas once more over spot where thought have observed oyster bed on reaching peering down in shadow of boat found be right there lay beneath bed of several yard extent of what felt sure be oyster described short circuit round little craft before stepping on board again felt so ashamed of dingy weather beaten appearance that resolved must have fresh coat of paint before went outside again decided must receive next day undertaking to wield paintbrush whilst bob employed in overhauling rigging examining spar breakfast be soon disposed of a be equally eager to stand once more on mother earth then bob providing with few biscuit did same adding few knick knack for fair companion jumped into boat in very few minute reached shore painter be made fast to stem of stout shrub grew close to water edge then bob went straight towards widest patch of shade softest turf must find flung forthwith upon ground asserting that be fixed intention to remain there for rest of day enjoy holiday in accordance with own peculiar notion after few vain attempt to persuade that must find much more pleasant to accompany in ramble over island gave up to own device ella accepting support of arm strolled slowly away step be directed in first instance towards northern end of island path being sometimes over short tender grass with ground be thickly clad at others along sandy beach to be occasionally compelled to diverge in consequence of dense undergrowth through must have be impossible for companion to force way picked up several very beautiful shell on beach ella promised long ramble before leaving island expressly for purpose of collecting few of choicest variety be rather disappointed to find such scarcity of fruit there being none a far a must discover beyond cocoa nut few wild fig latter rather insipid to taste though still welcome change after food have be accustomed to ella very thoughtfully collected little of fruit for bob when chanced to meet with tree bearing fig of superior flavour to average promised that on return must secure few cocoa nut treat to draught of delightfully refreshing cool new milk found walking to be far more fatiguing than have expected after being pent up so long on shipboard think found even more so than companion having have until recently comparatively wide range of ship deck upon to take exercise whilst of water lily must only boast of fisherman walk two step overboard kept sharp look out for fresh water intending to entirely refill tank cask ella be equally anxious for such discovery a gave notice that intended to hold grand wash desiring at same time to make up bundle of soiled linen etc deliver over to of course flatly refused to do assuring be fully equal to task of doing own washing that never must consent to descending to performance of so menial task for what said releasing arm to speak with greater energy not allow to wash few shirt sock for pocket handkerchief indeed must be woman peculiar province to wash clothes men never wash properly either half do else beat to piece whatever may be washing in vain endeavour to properly purify now must let have own way just once please still refused added laughingly seems to to be part of creed that be woman peculiar province ' to do certain thing for men that if be not at hand to do can not be done at at event in satisfactory manner remember urging plea that be woman peculiar province ' to cook a mean whereby to gain consent to taking charge of department very grateful be to for so doing for have enjoyed meal a never did before a to doing washing own can not will not consent to why not persisted woman be created a help meet for man be sure will admit that sex be more thoroughly qualified for performance of certain duty than be man where be distinctly case seems to to point naturally to conclusion that such duty form part of share of work necessary for comfort happiness of race of course must not offer to wash for for if be in large ship with proper servant to do such work in present circumstance see nothing whatever of menial degrading character in perhaps not replied can not enter quite so deeply a do into question can only say that idea be too repugnant for to consent to such division of necessary work ' so please say more about for mind be made up can be a stubborn a bob upon occasion quite believe retorted half playfully half disposed to be angry though consider bob stubborn at always let do like what original character be do know quite admire be somewhat rough unpolished admit be a gentle to a be own dear mamma hold to opinion that man who be gentle courteous to woman be man of sterling worth let manner be a uncouth a may believe that gentleness courtesy to sex be first most distinguishing mark of nature nobility why do permit to be so familiar disrespectful in manner of addressing consider in slightest decree disrespectful replied be much older than be man of far wider experience at event in matter connected with profession long severely tried friendship abundantly justifies familiarity of mode of address dislike formality with one except stranger be very well a mean of keeping at distance dislike have desire to become intimate with be rather formidable barrier to friendship so think responded ella with animation do so wish what inquired hesitated little blushed great deal then apparently with effort replied well wish must exchange formal miss brand ' for more friendly familiar ella be if consider worthy of friendship will indeed replied with very great pleasure if will permit to do so trust that in return will call a love to be called by friend harry very well replied gaily will be a long a be good to displease in way sign of sovereign displeasure will be return to formality of mr collingwood ' chatted blithely on after upon sort of subject be surprised delighted at depth extent of companion information have evidently read much what be more to purpose have selected reading with sound judgment storing mind abundantly with useful fact always have ready for production in support of argument by way of illustration frequently graced conversation with choice quotation introduced in best taste with manner a far a possible removed from anything like affectation pedantry be charmed beyond measure over over again thanked lucky accident have rendered good fortune to be put upon term of such close intimacy with so fascinating little creature at length completed tour of northern end of island returning by way of eastern shore until be abreast clump of cocoa nut tree when struck inland after somewhat tortuous course between thick growing shrub reached beach on own side once more unfortunately for ella projected laundry operation have not be able to discover slightest sign of spring of fresh water anywhere when arrived opposite point where water lily rode peacefully at anchor bob be nowhere to be seen boat still remained moored to shrub a have left so concluded that have grown tired of inactivity have gone off in opposite direction to ourselves for stroll therefore proposed to ella that must rest awhile upon soft velvety turf whilst returned to cutter for piece of rope to aid in ascent after cocoa nut rope be soon obtained returning to shore passed in loose band round trunk of one of tree leaving room in band for introduction of own body by bearing against whilst raised foot then slipping band up tree be easily quickly enabled to reach fruit from selected abundant supply of finest specimen flung to ground whilst thus engaged bob hove in sight when reached ground again reported that having soon grown tired of doing nothing have started away on walk to southward about hour after left have gone to extreme end of island that have enjoyed walk amazingly be excessively tired like ourselves have failed to find fresh water under circumstance poor little ella be compelled to postpone washing day promising that must have necessary time allowed at first suitable island happened to reach by time dinner hour be approaching ella desired to be put on board cutter to make few slight preparation for meal be necessary a soon a have put on board whilst be thus engaged took bob away with in boat to try for few oyster have mean of trawling for estimated that lay in not more than about two half fathom of water considered quite diver enough to reach distance a soon a arrived at spot stripped plunged in taking down with old canvas clothes bag slung round neck soon found that have be deceived by crystal transparency of water into underestimating depth be fully four fathom to bottom together with difficulty experienced in keeping mouth of bag open necessitated four plunge before have obtained bag full there be not time to do more just then so dressed bag be hauled up returned with prize to cutter resolved to commence dinner with course of oyster forthwith proceeded to open task gave very considerable amount of difficulty imagine if can surprise delight when on opening second oyster found that contained several small pearl third be opened also contained several fourth have none fifth on being opened revealed three beauty a large a top of middle finger to be brief be soon satisfied that have stumbled upon bed of pearl oyster about half of bivalve yielding when opened more le pearl greater quantity being small such a be set in ring several good sized pearl be also found one magnificent fellow a large a cherry a may easily be imagined be excitement after proposed that a soon a dinner be over must move cutter down anchor upon bed devote remainder of afternoon to systematic pearl fishing proposition be rapturously received ella declaring that have often read of pearl fishing must very much like to witness operation accordingly dinner be sooner over than weighed stood down to spot under jib having reached cutter be anchored a nearly a possible over centre of bed have hit upon plan by thought of difficulty of morning might be got over a soon a be brought up bob got floating anchor on deck stretched canvas upon rigging out spinnaker boom rope be passed through sheave in outer end of bent to crowfoot of floating anchor thus hung suspended like large tray over water be then lowered to bottom small pig of ballast be got on deck slung to rope end then went below changed dress for old white shirt duck trouser buckling belt round waist to a happened strong sharp sheath knife be attached being now ready to descend looked over side satisfied that floating anchor lay right at bottom in such manner a properly to perform new function a tray then slipped over side into water grasping firmly rope to piece of ballast be attached having well filled lung with air waved disengaged hand bob let go rope ballast draped swiftly to bottom still retaining hold upon sinker with one hand now rapidly shovelled oyster into tray with other a long a must hold breath be satisfied at first experiment that expedient be complete success thrice a many oyster being deposited in tray at one dive a have obtained altogether in morning soon have to rise to get fresh inhalation by hauling up sinker time so a to have benefit of assistance in taking to bottom be enabled to reserve breath energy for work at oyster so successful be that in three descent managed to place upon tray a many oyster a must hold be now hauled up content carefully transferred to cutter deck anchor tray again lowered to bottom operation have be repeated five time with result that goodly pile of bivalve now graced deck have crone down second time on sixth round if may so express when suddenly dark shadow fell upon spot on be at work glanced upward to unspeakable horror saw enormous shark floating motionless within fathom of directly above why did not attack at once must not imagine conjecture that be because lying flat upon ground a be have not room to turn a shark invariably do when seizing prey blood seemed fairly to congeal in vein a realised appalling position must rise to surface in very few second drown where be felt convinced that moment be far enough from bottom to permit of monster making rush must do so suddenly remembrance of sheath knife flashed across brain there be time to hesitate power of endurance be almost utterly exhausted felt must hold breath second two longer so quickly drew knife darting suddenly upwards succeeded in grasping shark with left hand by starboard fin whilst with right plunged weapon to hilt in gleaming white belly extending arm to full length a did so thus inflicting wound nearly quite two foot in length remembering wonderful vitality of shark did not content with thrusting armed hand into gaping wound drew knife two three time rapidly across interior arrangement inflicting such severe injury that in le than minute after rose to surface blood stained from head to foot speechless with exhaustion shark also appeared floating dead within dozen yard of cutter bob strong ready hand be promptly extended to assist in over cutter low gunwale so thoroughly exhausted be that felt utterly unable to make slightest effort in aid of shipmate exertion be obliged to drag bodily inboard where after unavailing effort to stand sank upon deck gasping for breath utterly unable to utter word ella eager face blanched deadly white at horrifying spectacle presented a lay prone at foot once white clothing now deeply imbued with blood thought must have fainted struggled bravely against weakness though must not repress violent shudder thrilled through from head to foot sinking to knee at side gently raised until head rested upon throbbing breast gazing upon face with look expressive of deepest anxiety inquired where be hurt harry be much be in very great pain made powerful unavailing effort to reply when seeing lip move without sound issuing from suddenly lost self control shrieking be dying bob dying tell oh what can do to save burst into overwhelming passion of tear clasping convulsively to bosom sobbed forth wild prayer for mercy mingled with tenderest most endearing epithet ever sprang from heart of passionately loving woman to lip surprised beyond power of expression almost overwhelmed with delight at utterly unexpected betrayal of feeling for must not suffer to continue so having by time somewhat recovered breath gasped out be not hurt ella indeed be not be only overcome for moment with exhaustion pray calm not hurt exclaimed eagerly not injured at thank god oh thank god for be kind sir be like gentleman to permit to be surprised into such expression a have just escaped lip how can ever hold up head again in presence look in face hush ella darling whispered distress entreat have much to say to what have just passed have precipitated matter little retire below for short time calm agitated feeling evening will ask to favour with few minute of society on shore when will enter into such explanation a trust will prove entirely satisfactory have effect of completely healing wounded sensibility why continued cheerily be well rose be already returning to cheek by time have be down once twice more have secured merciful heaven exclaimed in horrified accent do hear aright be possible can be mad enough to contemplate going into water again after having so narrowly escaped from such horrible death must not harry will not if entertain slightest feeling of of friendship for indeed must not bear shock such a have just received must kill pray have little compassion upon enough ella more than enough answered deeply moved henceforward wish be law to since object to going overboard again promise faithfully will not do so now go below dear lie down for short time whilst bob take cutter back to old mooring a soon a be out of sight bob who have stood patiently on one side whilst above denouement be taking place approached extending hand exclaimed now that little beauty have done with ye lad give old friend shake of flipper be right down glad to see ye well hearty dear boy continued with strong emotion saw that doubly everlastingly damned brute range up take berth close above ye to own plain honest truth put ye down a good a done for there war time to do anything by way of warning ye lending ye hand anyways for afore must collect scattered wit saw let go sinker next minute water alongside be like biling pot then seed blood damn if did turn sick queer must see thing just for moment when hauled ye aboard must for life of tell whether be dead alive now let get up few h'isters be like to have cost so dear get away from spot a soon a can be not very long in getting remainder of oyster on board soon afterwards have cutter back at old berth first task a soon a craft be at anchor again be to transfer booty to shore where spread out on large tarpaulin on sand to die method pursued by regular pearl fisher believe be to allow fish to remain until be in advanced stage of decay when pearl be sought for amongst putrid mass felt inclination however for such task moreover did not care to expend so much time a process involved conjectured that fish once dead might be opened with comparatively little difficulty thought that by time overhaul painting be completed oyster must be in fit state for operating upon ella now reappeared on deck somewhat more composed though there be still slight nervous flutter perceptible in movement took advantage of presence on deck to remark casually must now go below change dress cleanse from trace of recent encounter forthwith did when have refreshed with copious ablution really felt very little worse for adventure indeed believe be le discomposed by than of others after tea be over took occasion to remind ella have somewhat to say to requested to accompany on shore take short walk on beach might speak without being embarrassed by bob presence stepped silently into boat in few minute more stood together on strand taking arm offered said now harry what be wish to say to simply replied from nature of occupation have have a may suppose very few opportunity of associating with sex with solitary exception of sister can not say that be intimately acquainted with woman be utter stranger to everything relating to womankind know nothing of characteristic have not slightest idea of how be likely to be influenced by powerful emotion may be that under such circumstance sometimes utter word of be wholly unconscious have not most remote relation to actual sentiment if really be case man of honour chancing to hear such word escape lip of lady will forthwith forget that be ever uttered be prepared to do with regard to word spoken by afternoon ella if wish to understand that have meaning true will dispel brief blissful dream in have dared to indulge for short hour two what right have to suppose have awakened within breast sentiment beyond of merest friendship if may dare to aspire even to especially when take into consideration shortness of time have known have be few day know almost from moment that met upon deck of copernicus new hitherto unknown feeling have animated have grown with hour of life since then without analysing nature have permitted to strengthen until have become part of very life feeling must perforce still continue to cherish whether for weal for woe be for to say a long a life remains in saying that never analysed feeling be stating what be strictly true in dread moment afternoon when unexpectedly found face to face with death in one of most dreadful form companion shuddered violently in terrible moment say discovery flashed upon that feeling to have referred be love most passionate devoted idolising love tell ella tell darling may dare to hope at time in distant future when will have have opportunity of becoming better acquainted with cease harry dear girl interrupted with deep emotion cease pray to agitate with causeless fear why must hesitate after having already given such unequivocal expression to feeling to avow that like have loved almost from first moment of meeting know not whether now at future time will deem heart too easily won if do remember that advantage have be from first on side appeared a deliverer from situation of peculiar trial to young delicately brought up girl of peril nature extent of be better able to realise than be to tell so in judging must not forget to take into consideration give benefit of peculiar circumstance of case whether lightly won not will find dear harry that love be not le sincere loyal on account for never be there truer more devoted wife than will be to if please god to permit to become united saying little darling turned with unaffected confiding simplicity wound soft arm about neck raised sweet lip to mine conversation followed deeply interesting a be to party engaged need not be reproduced here suffice to say that insight thus obtained of ella character disposition amply justified sudden precipitate step have taken that be precipitate must not did not attempt to conceal from that must have be highly imprudent under ordinary circumstance thus to connect by so binding tie a betrothal to one of whose very existence be ignorant short fortnight before be also fully aware after marriage be to very great extent lottery one can never be really certain until after nuptial knot have be tied whether one have drawn prize blank there be woman in whom fresh trait of character be always revealing so that just when think have at last succeeded in thoroughly understanding discover that be just a far off reliable knowledge of character a ever with ella be very different there be childlike openness ingenuousness of manner about quickly revealed to observer not only salient point also finer gradation of character temperament believe have clearer insight into at time thus hastily offered than many men who do same thing after acquaintance of season with such knowledge a be able to pick up by meeting charmer at ball picnic canter in row what not at length returned to cutter where found bob with pipe still between teeth sitting aft fast asleep wished ella good night then roused master bob up whilst smoked final pipe together communicated good fortune to ay ay said a soon a have told may thank jack shark ' for having come upon ye so soon lad be bound to

must not help smiling at characteristic speech of congratulation caution of bob to of course made suitable reply then shaking hand went below tumbled into respective hammock volume two chapter iv lily among breaker next morning be up betimes ella might be removed from scene of dirt confusion cutter must present during day first act be to convey on shore necessary rear material for preparation consumption of meal there being anticipated that one day must suffice for intended to do just then by time that have done so have returned to cutter ella made appearance on deck meeting affectionately then turning to thank bob for congratulation honest warm hearted fellow saw fit to offer on occasion over pulled dear girl ashore forthwith set about seeking for favourable spot where to spread tablecloth upon sward to arrange equipage fire having already be lighted kettle suspended over gipsy fashion from three crossed stick whilst be thus engaged returned on board routed out small stock of paint set to work mixing whilst bob having already washed down inboard busied in casting off easing up rigging preparatory to regular overhaul first thing after breakfast a soon a meal be ready ella came down to beach waved pocket handkerchief signal agreed upon pulled ashore took hasty meal being understood that day must be busy one being desirous of finishing before sunset so a to make start again next day there being nothing to detain to make worth while to prolong stay where then be breakfast over bob pulled back to cutter where at once commenced work in earnest leaving ella to amuse by strolling along shore making proposed collection of shell by dinner time succeeded in finishing painting giving craft not only coat of black from rail down to copper with white stripe ribbon round ornamental groove cut for purpose in covering board also coat of pale stone colour round inside of low bulwark a well a touch of varnish on teak mahogany fitting of deck left free to assist bob in afternoon such good progress did make by sunset rigging have be overhauled lifted mast head examined in eye of rigging new service put on where required everything got back into place again lanyard set up mainsail rebent badly required then have good wash adjourned to shore where found fair companion awaiting with tea ready collection of most beautiful shell to exhibit fruit of day gathering a soon a meal be over everything be transported on board again put in place then rejoined ella who remained on shore have very enjoyable ramble enlivened with such conversation a lover delight in next morning a soon a breakfast be over adjourned to shore once more whilst ella at recommendation took stroll about island bob set to work upon oyster be dead by time of course not only so in such condition that taxed resolution to utmost to go through with task about have set ourselves what will man not do for sake of wealth be true felt sanguine about finding treasure island if account have received of be true there be more wealth there than have mean of taking away with still must not resist temptation to secure comparatively speaking small windfall have come in way so persevered certainly have reason to be dissatisfied with reward when be over found that acquisition amounted to about quart measure full of seed pearl similar measure full of pearl of large size ranging from size of pea to in one instance splendid fellow fully a large a pigeon egg many others being nearly a fine task occupied morning when be finished returned to cutter at once set about taking boat to piece stowing away below done took dinner immediately after bob got canvas set hove up anchor stood away for western passage through reef passage be much wider than one by have entered not nearly so crooked a be just within influence of trade wind trended generally in westerly direction have fair wind through so have difficulty whatever in passing out between reef did under easy sail jetting gaff topsail spinnaker upon craft however a soon a be fairly outside wind be blowing fresh steady from about south east a course be west north west flew merrily away very nearly dead before wind with spinnaker boomed out to port bob took afternoon watch retired below lay down a be eight hour out that night ella remained on deck chatting gaily with bob busying with mysterious bit of sewing soon dropped off into doze nothing of importance occurred for remainder of day during next ella now regularly kept first night watch with whenever be eight hour out many pleasant chat did have together more more reason did see for congratulating upon choice of bride hasty a choice have be now that have have explanation there no longer existed reason for fair girl concealing ardent attachment to many little puzzling peculiarity contradiction have before observed in conduct disappeared found society more charming conversation more frank enjoyable day there be not particle of coquettishness nonsense of kind about made hesitation about acknowledging frankly yet modestly warmth of affection questioned eagerly with utmost interest about father saw with delight that there be already springing up within breast feeling of regard for simply because happened to be father promised with little encouragement to blossom into deep affection in prospect of finding treasure also exhibited interest be nothing in comparison with other on one occasion for example when in speaking of endeavoured to explain to that there be absolute certainty of being able to find that if failed must be compelled of necessity to return to own profession a mean of support replied well harry dear really do hope will find for must be very hard to have away from for many month at time indeed at must reconcile to that if only happen to be fortunate enough to find dear father so might have satisfaction of knowing that when darling be absent from must be with beloved parent be not at insensible to advantage of wealth must see in many little way that be quite sincere in statement often made that must willingly sacrifice chance of securing gold for certainty of discovering father when went on deck at seven bell in answer to bob call on morning one succeeding day of departure from island found that wind have dropped almost to dead calm lily making more than about three knot that there be heavy sultry feeling in air quite different from usual freshness of sea breeze thin almost impalpable vapour be spread over entire firmament like curtain away to eastward heavy bank of dark menacing cloud be slowly rising above horizon glance at aneroid be fixed in companion way so a to be visible to helmsman revealed fact that pointer of instrument have gone considerably back together with threatening aspect of heaven made fear that be about to have very unpleasant break in fine weather have be favoured with since entering pacific like look of thing harry said bob a glanced round at aspect of surroundings that glass there have gone back good inch within hour light flying stuff overhead have sprung from lord know where within last ten minute that bank down yonder seems to to be working about in way be altogether onaccountable look very much a though 't be breeding mischief 'd have ' called ye before lad be only within ten minute that there be be anything out of way about look of weather have threatening look about certainly replied will not waste moment in getting canvas off craft in making snug for may befall leave tiller to take care of bob in with gaff topsail whilst hand spinnaker never mind about rolling up can do by by if have time so be well now settle away peak halliard here let have will lower away peak throat whilst gather in sail now roll snugly up stow securely put cover on whilst get in jib lower topmast be a lively a like bob will have none too much time by look of thing astern now may yet roll up sail get out of way below if be smart do whilst close reef foresail hope that be coming will not last long for be in rather ugly berth here among so many island may not be easy matter to avoid if be obliged to scud a expect will be worked with will in quarter of hour have craft stripped with exception of close reefed foresail topmast lowered time that be working heavy bank astern have be rising spreading over heaven like dark canopy vast mass of vapour of be composed writhing twisting like contortion of wounded snake by time that preparation be complete entire sky be overspread with exception of low strip away on western horizon be rapidly lessening even a looked upon interposition of vast curtain of vapour between sky caused awful semi darkness to fall upon scene be still further increased by presence of kind of smoky mist now filled air rendering everything so obscure that be difficult to see further than mile on side ella now came upon deck to announce breakfast be ready have something else to occupy attention just then fair girl placed arm in mine gazed with in silence at awe inspiring scene wind have died away altogether inky sea exhibited singular alarming appearance leaping into low wave have run in direction presented more appearance of what see on surface of simmering caldron than anything else to can compare suddenly blinding flash of lightning rent canopy overhead simultaneously came cracking rattling crash of thunder directed ella to retire below not to attempt returning to deck unless called her advising also to get breakfast at once clear everything away if wished to save crockery a expected must soon have more of wind sea than wanted then closed cabin door drew over slide well be that did so for at moment there came flash deafening stunning peal then floodgate of heaven be opened rain descended in such blinding sheet that deck be in le than minute full to low rail notwithstanding that there be inch of clear space round craft between bulwark covering board to enable to free rapidly of water lasted perhaps five minute then rain ceased a suddenly a have come on be to compare great thing with small like emptying of bucket of water be deluge whilst lasted ceased a suddenly a must shower from bucket when content have fallen to ground minute two of suspense succeeded then pale primrose coloured streak appeared on horizon to eastward rapidly increasing in size hollow moaning sound gradually became audible in air did not like at be sure something out of common be about to happen desired bob to go forward haul down foresail stow have just done be coming aft again when sung out here come at last harry stand by tiller looked away astern right left far a eye must reach be rapidly advancing widening streak of white foam on came outstripping in speed fastest express train sea in front of inky black whilst behind be a white a milk sat down on deck bracing foot against companion desired bob to do same be well did so verily believe must have be blown overboard hurricane struck fairly astern fully expected to see mast go clean out of cutter whilst foam boiled up over taffrail surged inboard filling deck piling over in truly alarming manner however rigging be first rate stood tremendous strain bravely law of nature asserting supremacy even in wild scene little lily rose shook clear of water have swept in over then away flew at perfectly frightful speed dead before have be of usual model bow must have be forced under by enormous pressure of wind behind must have gone down head foremost sharp a be water line bow curved boldly out above water thus afforded support forward now proved salvation first fierceness of gust lasted perhaps five minute possibly not so much be difficult to measure time on such occasion a then got strength of gale proper thought blew pretty hard off cape horn be trifle compared with sea remained perfectly smooth for simple reason that must not get up top of surge a rose be taken by wind swept off a neatly a must cut flower from stalk with riding switch air be filled completely with scud water rendering so thick that be impossible to see cable length ahead a immediate danger be for present over now desired bob to push back companion slide leaving door still closed however go below get mouthful of something to eat a did not know what call might yet be made upon energy be desirable that must not allow ourselves to become exhausted from want of food a soon a have snatched hasty meal relieved went below in turn when found that ella have contrived to keep coffee hot for a well a supply of cake roll be so fond of making dear girl pale terrified a be took place at table attending to want with true womanly assiduity self forgetfulness earnestly entreated to be allowed to accompany on deck share whatever danger there might be of course must not allow asserting little ungallantly fear that must do good there must only be in way gave permission however to stand in companion way look abroad upon strange scene providing that wrapped well up put on macintosh to prevent becoming through concession gratefully accepted hour after hour flew before fury of gale anxiety increasing with mile that travelled for chart told that group of island lay directly ahead a be then steering knew by reckoning that must be drawing fearfully close to if indeed be not already actually among wind have moderated to certain extent from first terrific violence be still blowing far too hard to permit of rounding to making use of floating anchor attempt to do so must inevitably have resulted in craft turning turtle with have therefore choice to keep scudding sea began to get up too now followed in very menacing manner huge foaming crest rearing high above taffrail threatening moment to fall on board so great did danger at last become reluctantly directed bob to go forward set foresail have close reefed before be stowed upon craft in such weather with only one hand to do work promised to be task of ordinary difficulty bob be man to do if one must set about work with care skill of be master sheered cutter about one point to port to keep sail steadily drawing sheet being carefully trimmed old fellow took halliard in one hand knelt down upon sail cast off stop by be secured then steadied halliard taut sprang to weather side of deck swayed away catching turn under belaying pin moment sail be up almost set by bob careful management be filled drawing without single flap must at moment have insured destruction effect of exhibition of mere shred of canvas be such material acceleration of speed that be no longer in great danger of being pooped on other hand be now rushing with greater impetuosity down upon danger have too much reason to fear awaited ahead indeed have abundant confirmation of fear within next half hour for soon afterwards dashed past extensive reef over sea boiled seethed with terrific violence at so short distance for slight alteration of course when foresail be set must have plunged headlong upon to add to anxiety still continued thick a ever rendering utterly impossible to see above cable length two at utmost on side of so anxious did at last become be on point of resigning helm to bob might go below to consult chart ascertain a nearly a must exact position when suddenly directly ahead appeared wild waste of boiling foaming surf swirling seething leaping high in air where became instantly dissipated in form of dense driving mist glanced wildly to port to starboard vainly hoping must see clear unbroken water on one side other though be already too near breaker to escape far a eye must penetrate dense atmosphere on side stretched remorseless breaker in minute be among on first catching sight of broken water have pointed to companion in ella still stood bob seeing action caught meaning in moment with rather scant ceremony thrust poor little girl head below drew slide close over at same instant thought detected spot where sea be breaking somewhat le madly than elsewhere gave cutter strong sheer to starboard that might enter surf at point being opinion that then lay deepest water have hope of escaping instinct of self preservation asserted a always will prompted to avail myself of even slenderest most doubtful chance in favour cutter heeled violently down burying lee gunwale half deck high in seething water thought for moment that be going over altogether with foresail jibed with loud flap blew clear clean out of bolt rope at same instant water lily plunged wildly into boiling surf braced for shock expected must instantly follow accompanied by crashing in of poor little craft timber did not touch water tumbled on board forward aft everywhere bob be frequently standing waist deep still cutter rushed furiously on effort energy now being directed to keeping a much a possible in part where sea broke with least violence after first half minute so finding that did not strike hope faintly revived within especially a cutter suddenly shot into belt of unbroken water down channel rushed sheering now to port now to starboard a followed winding water becoming smoother with fathom proceeded began to hope that trouble be coming to end when suddenly channel took quick bend to windward without sail upon boat became impossible to follow selecting a before part where surf broke least heavily be fain therefore once again to let little lily drive into white water next moment touched though lightly perilous quarter of mile be run then air being rather clearer saw distance ahead beyond now much reduced surf clear water again there be unbroken barrier of foam between from appearance greatly feared that reef rose everywhere in direction dangerously near to surface there be not much to choose in way of course just then so steered for nearest point of new channel be just congratulating that must reach without touching again when plunged into thickest of foam struck heavily sheered broadside to heeling over so violently that bob lost footing hold together fell into sea to leeward main sheet be lying coiled upon deck under hand threw over to bodily fortunately caught exerting utmost strength succeeded in clambering on board again a did so huge roller came foaming tumbling towards striking upturned side so violently that hove fairly over on beam end whilst lifted clear of ledge to have hung launched into unbroken water to leeward once clear of ledge little craft instantly righted put helm hard up soon paid off swept away to leeward once more be now in good broad channel with comparatively smooth water saw with satisfaction that surf on side of be becoming le le heavy minute five minute might have elapsed perhaps after last struck when saw land looming through haze ahead soon afterwards found clear of reef altogether inside of be floating on comparatively smooth surface of extensive lagoon high land now distinctly appeared ahead of shortly discovered that formed portion of island of considerable size northern end of lay about three point on starboard bow towards point at once directed head of cutter with object of getting under lee a quickly a possible if practicable into berth must permit of careening poor little craft examining into extent of damage directed bob to open companion now a be fearful that ella might have received injury when cutter be hove on beam end to great joy a soon a door be thrown back there be clinging desperately to ladder terribly frightened unhurt a assured beyond few unimportant bruise a neared northern extremity of island towards be steering found that terminated in almost perpendicular cliff of fifty sixty foot in height constituting northern part of base of high hill rising almost to dignity of mountain be thickly wooded almost to summit to very verge of cliff close under be now gliding swiftly along a eye ranged over northern face of cliff have by time opened detected rather singular break in at particular point curiosity prompting sheered cutter little closer to get nearer view of approaching still nearer seemed to that break extended quite to water edge be not until be almost past felt convinced not only that be case that there actually be bay cove of sort inside discovery be made barely in time to enable to jam helm hard starboard just fetch opening through in about five minute afterwards gently slid finding in midst of deep basin of almost perfect circular form so completely landlocked with such narrow artfully concealed entrance that be not until be within biscuit throw of rock felt absolutely certain there really existed passage at basin a have already said be of circular form judged to be about mile in diameter entrance be at most northerly point in circumference at spot a afterwards ascertained by sounding there be nearly forty fathom of water though horn cusp of encircling cliff approached other so closely that must have be impossible to take even small square rigged vessel through without bracing yard sharp fore aft craft of say couple of hundred ton must not have be carried through at at entrance cliff rose almost perpendicularly out of water outside inside terminating in wedge on side from point however gradually widened away in form of gently rising plateau out of two spur of mountain sprang one on side of basin between spur shoulder lay ravine sloped evenly down from level of plateau on side until terminated at southern extremity of basin in beach of fine sand ravine lay of course directly ahead of a entered smooth lawn like surface swelling gradually upwards towards mountain in rear plateau on side formed truly lovely picture under circumstance especially to who have within last hour be battling with stormy sea central portion for perhaps mile in length quarter of width be luxuriantly clothed with freshest verdure be quite destitute of tree beyond limit however whole face of country be thickly wooded cocoa nut banana being conspicuously abundant beach ran about three fourth round basin being broadest immediately in front of ravine gradually narrowing away to nothing at about mile distance on side at western extremity of beach beautiful cascade tumbled over edge of cliff upon low rocky platform below from whence dispersed into sea took glass carefully swept entire ravine with to ascertain whether there be indication that island be inhabited for felt convinced that be so lovely spot must be first selected a place of abode for must see human foot have ever pressed soil felt encouraged to go close in anchor though before doing anything else determined to make voyage of discovery inland settle question a to existence nonexistence of inhabitant if must really prove that have lovely island to ourselves nothing must possibly be better suited to purpose of careening cutter for found by repeated cast of lead that water shoaled with almost mathematical regularity a approached beach on shooting through narrow entrance have found almost becalmed under lofty cliff though gale still howled overhead so having made up mind a to berth in must place cutter desired bob to get jib on under short canvas slid quietly across basin to anchorage bringing up in three fathom immediately got boat out put together a soon a be ready took double barrelled shot gun got bob to put ashore leaving to take care of ella cutter telling that in event of anything transpiring to render assistance necessary must fire barrel quickly one after other not otherwise if distant view of country be attractive be upon closer inspection perfectly enchanting everything having appearance rather of happiest effect of landscape gardening than of unaided effort of nature ground from distance appeared almost too regular for perfect beauty found to be finely broken on side a walked up ravine be constantly recurring elevation declivity ornamented with fine clump of tropical tree besides cocoa nut banana found plantain fig breadfruit pine apple superior in size flavour to have ever before met with large variety of other fruit with name quality of be unacquainted innumerable bird of most beautiful plumage sported among tree few of sang very sweetly for most part sound emitted be quite unlike have heard before saw trace of animal reptile great small none whatever of man walked quite to head of ravine then turned off to right with object of passing round base of mountain after hour walk found that have labour for pain for came out upon edge of cliff on north western side of island now discovered that at spot not only extended for distance to southward swept round northern base of mountain inland rising sheer like wall for quite hundred foot after searching unavailingly for time for point at might be possible for to pas be obliged to give up retrace step reaching head of ravine once more now struck off to left with intention of passing round to eastward walk of about hour during progress be much impeded a have be on opposite side by dense undergrowth came out upon small platform on extreme eastern side of mountain platform terminated on left at edge of cliff ahead gradually narrowed until there be barely room for man to pas not then unless have remarkably steady nerve for on right rose perpendicular precipice on left be cliff edge with lagoon nearly two hundred foot below from present position be now able to see that ledge be only available point of passage from northern to southern side of island unless one chose fairly to scale mountain be convinced must be work of considerable difficulty on account of thickness of bush undergrowth along narrow ledge then proceeded to take way after perilous journey of mile came out upon safe ground once more hour afterwards reached southern side of island clambering with considerable difficulty to top of precipitous knoll obtained uninterrupted view of whole southern side of island extended from point upon stood distance of quite twelve mile running nearly due north south be divided pretty evenly by ridge spur of mountain passed down entire length island varied considerably in width being irregularly shaped somewhat like diamond lozenge with numerous bay creek on western side none on east be well wooded throughout presented magnificent park like appearance have brought most powerful glass with from commanding elevation upon stood now carefully swept entire island a far a range of glass permitted without detecting slightest trace of inhabitant greatly gratified at perfect security promised now retraced step a sun have burst through cloud be by time approaching horizon in about couple of hour found once more on board cutter where be joyously welcomed by companion who have begun to feel very uneasy at prolonged absence of course did not fail to take back with plentiful supply of fruit upon regaled luxuriously after late dinner during gave detailed report of exploration so satisfactory be that companion be delighted when announced intention of remaining there for sufficient length of time to careen examine cutter a must of course necessitate taking of everything movable out of be arranged that must commence work next morning by rigging up couple of tent on shore in to take up quarter until cutter be once more ready to receive volume two chapter v attacked by savage when awoke next morning sun be just appearing above cliff bounded basin on eastern side sky be cloudless trade wind have once more resumed supremacy sweeping in gentle breeze over tree crowned summit of cliff though down in basin only felt mildest zephyr calling bob who be still sound asleep proceeded to deck to enjoy balmy freshness of morning await appearance a soon a joined jumped into boat armed with soap towel directed step to cascade be hidden from present berth by slight projection of face of intervening cliff when arrived at spot found that instead of falling sheer from top of cliff to bottom a appeared from basin to do be arrested at several point in fall by force of descending water be so much broken thought might safely venture to place beneath thus obtain most magnificent shower bath rock upon fell have gradually be hollowed away by action of descending water presented appearance of gigantic willow bowl of nearly thirty foot in diameter brim full of purest crystal water gushed away over western lower edge into sea depth varied regularly from few inch round edge to about three foot immediately under cascade whole formed most princely bath lost time in stripping plunging in when after indulging in thorough ablution ventured upon shower experiment shock be tremendous a much a ever must bear after effect be delicious felt braced strengthened refreshed ready for anything more especially for good breakfast of course found awaiting in due course when returned to cutter a soon a meal be over ella packed up washing be so anxious about put bob ashore latter trudging happily along by side of light hearted companion bearing bundle on shoulder then returned to cutter hove up anchor ran in under jib until gently took ground when set about mooring stem stern to beach with warp made fast to stake firmly driven into sand bob soon returned then unbent mainsail struck topmast cast adrift boom gaff ran in bowsprit unrigged then transporting spar sail to beach rigged up couple of small comfortable enough tent into transferred several belonging such necessary a expected must require during short experiment in camp life at same time availed ourselves of so fine opportunity a be now afforded to thoroughly air spare suit of sail took up entire day to clear cutter of everything ballast included even then be compelled to leave large water tank on board from sheer inability to get out of craft without breaking up deck of course must not think of doing succeeded however after great deal of difficulty trouble in shoring firmly up close to deck beam having first of of course pumped water out left sufficient room to get at ballast though with none to spare with everything out of cutter floated good three foot lighter at once hauled in a close to shore a must come so a to work at if need be without boat simply standing in water next morning ran anchor necessary distance away out to seaward broad upon starboard beam brought cable on board hooked to throat halyard taking good look first of to shore fast be easy work heaving down for first half hour a soon a got fairly down upon bilge obtained idea of how stiff little craft be even without ounce of ballast in hove hove until everything cracked again really be afraid at one time that must either spring mast carry head away altogether succeeded at last in getting past point of greatest resistance without meeting with casualty after came down pretty easily hour half of hard work saw at length with cutter keel out anxious scrutiny of bottom immediately followed to intense satisfaction now saw that have struck on occasion on portion of keel be loaded with lead two dint in metal being distinctly visible one be very trifling other be jagged notch of five inch in depth lead being bent upwards outwards to starboard in kind of lip beyond there be other injury even of slightest kind visible at least on port side copper be a unwrinkled a day be put on hour work with hammer put keel completely to right again whilst busied about bob employed in diligently scouring copper must not be satisfied until have made almost a bright a gold have very great hope that must find starboard side in equally undamaged condition determined whilst be about to make overhaul complete so a soon a dinner be over swung craft hove down again soon have gratification of finding hope confirmed copper on starboard side of course received due share of scouring for sake of uniformity about hour before sunset tackle be eased up little craft floated on even keel once more with slight damage made good everything in a perfect condition ordinary wear tear excepted a when came out of builder hand next day be devoted to thorough cleansing of little craft interior fore aft so favourable opportunity not being likely to offer again until after return to england unless indeed really must prove fortunate enough to find treasure required even now so gave finishing off with coat of paint before leaving for night unscrewed dead light in deck took off skylight top left companion wide open so a to ensure thorough draught through answering double purpose of drying paint removing objectionable odour following day saw a busy a ever getting thing back into place filling up water etc did not strike tent day stronger smell than be quite agreeable still remaining from new paint to fill up time therefore turned to upon fire arm gave thorough cleaning up so that might be in perfect order ready for service at moment notice be up betimes next morning after matutinal bath good breakfast dowsed tent got spar on board in place bent sail put few finishing touch be necessary to make cutter ready for sea once more done be time to see about finding way out from among numerous reef girt island a believed entirely round have come through rather over once be true be in fashion must have be very sorry to see repeated on occasion have choice a have fancy for little craft again scraping such rude acquaintance with rock resolved to take boat make trip in along western side of island in search of safe channel to sea accordingly bob got light spar sail of boat out rigged stepped former bent latter then sat down to early dinner be original intention to have gone away alone ella begged so hard to be allowed to come with have not heart to refuse especially a there be sufficient reason for so doing so consented promising that after exploration be over if time permitted must have ramble on shore on southern side of mountain when must lay in sea stock of fruit at same time bob said must accompany try luck with fishing line whilst ella took proposed stroll to also there seemed objection a cutter be in berth where hardest gale that ever blew must not have endangered safety in slightest decree accordingly a soon a meal be over shoved off instinct prompting at last moment to take one of revolving rifle small supply of cartridge with soon slid out of cove shortly afterwards rounded north western extremity of island be first trial of sliding gunter mainsail upon singularly constructed boat bob be thrown into perfect rapture at truly marvellous speed with propelled craft along water lily be wonderfully fast in smooth water light wind boat must have sailed round round skimmed rapidly along edge of western reef when have run about four mile to southward found good wide break looked a though led out to sea up with helm at once away darted almost dead before wind down through be rather circumbendibus sort of affair somewhat narrow in place though everywhere there be sufficient room to work lily in after run of about hour shot out between two overhanging ledge extremity of showed about six foot above water found ourselves rising falling on long swell of open ocean so far so good now hove about to retrace step noticing a passed in between two ledge have mentioned that rock instead of being of coral formation appeared to be composed of lava like substance then became confirmed in impression have crossed mind once twice before that island be certainly of volcanic origin that mountain have once be crater of active volcano conformation of summit seemed also to suggest for did not taper away to cone appeared to form flat tableland of extent however might perhaps have proved on inspection to be flat appearance of top resulting merely from regularity in height of crater wall in about hour after re entering passage through reef boat grounded gently on beach on western side of island leaped ashore assisted ella to land desiring bob a shoved boat off into deep water again to meet in bay expected must find behind low headland lay about three mile to southward of ella took possession of arm now quite a matter of course without waiting for to offer support together sauntered leisurely along in grateful shade of tree giant plant with be surrounded for first half hour so have eye for nothing varied beauty of nature lay spread before in such luxuriant prodigality form of tree plant be for most part new to be beautiful occasional glimpse of scenery presented through unexpected avenue made glorious by adornment of varied form colour in foliage flower enlivened by presence of thousand of bird of brilliant plumage darting through air like living gem seemed like absolute realisation of fairy land eden time passed swiftly away with in enjoyment of so much loveliness especially a made frequent pause to admire at leisure more than usually bewitching scene be in act of remarking to companion that bob must certainly think be lost in wood when exclaimed in startled voice oh harry there be animal of sort following have noticed bush moving rather strangely behind once twice already did not like to say anything fearing must think foolish nervous instant distinctly saw dark object glide swiftly behind large aloe like shrub with beautiful purple blossom that stood admiring so long animal exclaimed impossible darling must surely be mistaken animal be likely to be on island like how must ever have come here unless provided with wing can not say replied be convinced be not mistaken stay here moment then said will go back see whether creature really be lurking there a seem to think oh harry dear please exclaimed feel so dreadfully nervous though know be very foolish have startled will not feel at ease again until be in boat let hasten forward a rapidly a possible please for can not enjoy walk longer come then said will go on at once since animal be behind have better walk on pace two ahead of now stepped briskly forward companion evidently suffering from violent attack of nervous agitation did not believe have seen anything imputed feeling to rather depressing sense of solitude one be sometimes apt to experience when wandering in thickly wooded locality nevertheless took precaution to glance at rifle satisfy that chamber be loaded also to verify locality of cartridge have proceeded in way perhaps five minute have just emerged from among tree upon open lawn like level of green sward sloped gently to beach there about mile distant when something hissed close past next moment saw arrow quivering in earth few yard beyond savage exclaimed felt blood curdle heart sink like lead for moment a realised dreadful nature of danger to poor little darling be thus suddenly exposed turned abruptly must see sign of living creature near with such cheering word a must find for moment urged ella to hasten step towards open where must be upon more even term with enemy poor child needed urging must have taken to headlong flight have not restrained for felt certain that action must immediately be followed by perfect shower of arrow be savage in force have not advanced dozen yard before felt sharp stinging sensation in left arm be pierced by arrow looked round again foe remained invisible there be nothing for to push on next instant three four more long slender shaft hissed past confirming fear increasing apprehension for companion safety saw be wounded must have stopped to render assistance time be valuable now moment a precious a year must be under other circumstance so only urged to press forward a fast a must without actually running on sped again came flight of arrow one of pierced in fleshy part of thigh whilst two passed through ella flowing skirt happily without doing dear girl injury suffered few moment to elapse then suddenly faced about bringing rifle to shoulder a did so there in centre of path between tree have just quitted knelt savage upon one knee in act of drawing bow be always very fond of shooting have acquired reputation of being good snap shot among rabbit skill now stood in good stead kneeling figure be instantly covered pulled trigger leapt convulsively to foot staggered forward fell upon face have sooner fired than twenty native sprang from cover ran towards seemed thought to have seen fire arm before for advance be made with confidence of who know that enemy have just emptied piece be about to make acquaintance of new terrible weapon of property of be doubtless hitherto ignorant levelling again fired at foremost then quickly turned piece upon one close beside report rang out sharp clear one close upon other savage fell companion paused instant in evident surprise that pause proved serious if not fatal matter to fourth whom immediately afterwards brought down be too much for saw that to stand exposed to view be to court death with yell of disappointed rage sprang back into cover instantly profited by retrograde movement on part of enemy to make push for beach hoping that bob must hear rifle shot especially double report have arranged with on former occasion must be signal of warning call for assistance hasten to rendezvous be now clearly within sight must be a soon a uncovered by extensive screen of bush lay couple of hundred yard on right also reloaded with dispatch emptied chamber of rifle with hoped to be able to keep savage at bay until be fairly afloat once more fight be by mean over yet for have not gone far when shower of at least thirty arrow flew about from point on left showing that savage be following up under cover evidently with intention of heading if possible be wounded thrice by discharge one arrow sticking in back of neck causing greatest uneasiness second lodging in left shoulder third completely piercing calf of leg succeeded in removing of annoyance by thrusting right through flesh breaking off head drawing out broken shaft in neck shoulder be firmly imbedded in muscle found must not remove without sort of surgical assistance ella have fortunately escaped again a soon a have rid a far a must of arrow pressed on once more keeping a much between companion cover of foe a be possible poor girl be nearly fainting with terror made brave effort to keep up spirit really behaved wonderfully well there be now pause of minute two in attack enabled to reach point where be not only nearly out of range of arrow where be also enabled to get clear view of goal passed beyond cover of intervening bush there lay beach with le than fifteen canoe drawn up on be of various size large enough to carry perhaps thirty men others not capable of accommodating more than four six headland have indicated to bob lay about mile on right boat be nowhere to be seen fortunately there seemed to be one left in charge of canoe at once made up mind to take smallest if must succeed in gaining beach push off in finish fight afloat trusting that bob must yet arrive in time to lend aid in effecting escape told ella in few hasty word what intended directing to get into smallest canoe moment reached beach then lie down flat in bottom of hurried forward for increasing weakness occasional swimming of object before sight warned that strength be rapidly failing with blood be trickling from wound have just communicated intention to ella when saw something passing swiftly along beyond low point formed northern extremity of bay knew at once to be head of boat mainsail presently shot clear of land headed well up for very spot where canoe lay savage doubt saw too for shower of arrow be immediately let fly at by time be out of range second shower followed with greater success then with savage yell at least hundred black sprang forth into open apparently determined to prevent escape at once faced round for though be beyond reach of arrow be by mean beyond reach of bullet quickly levelling rifle took deliberate aim calling on ella to make best of way to canoe a did so covered nearest savage fired without lowering rifle from shoulder quickly selected mark in haste eagerness missed hitting man close behind however so that shot be not thrown away then fifth checked rush sixth shot stopped altogether rifle be now empty glanced over shoulder saw that ella be within few yard of canoe have indicated that bob be coming up at rattling pace so suddenly dropped rifle from shoulder turned ran for beach a fast a now rapidly failing strength must permit reloading a ran a expected proved signal for general chase savage rushing after two foot to one uttering most terrific cry yell brandishing club spear sending occasional arrow after be soon unpleasantly informed that be once more within reach of missile one of arrow entering left shoulder piercing shoulder bone second sticking in left arm close to former wound three entering right leg almost simultaneously taking effect about six inch above knee still staggered on however in about two minute more spread out to length of age in exhausting agonising race reached canoe in ella have already placed a have directed have succeeded in reloading six chamber of rifle now turned to open fire upon pursuer once more in hope of checking long enough to get craft afloat a did so whole earth appeared to rock heave about eye became dizzy sight failed so that must see nothing vast dark crowd of savage face scowling upon surging to fro before reeling vision into heaving crowd discharged content of rifle rapidly without attempt at aim then turning flinging now useless weapon into canoe concentrated fast fleeting energy into one supreme effort to launch faintly heard bob shout of encouragement earnestly prayed that might succeed in saving darling felt be lost a cheering cry rang across water threw with weight against light craft be already half afloat braced against stem felt move spear at instant pierced in back effect for moment be to stimulate further with violent effort succeeded in getting fairly afloat saw fancied saw boat within few yard distance bob in with rope in hand ready to heave plunging heavily into clear cool sparkling water gave canoe one final desperate outward impulse at same moment felt crashing stunning blow at back of head million star seemed to dance before darkening eye momentary feeling of intensest agony surged through brain sank insensible into ankle deep wavelet came rippling merrily up to shore ella despairing shriek ringing in ear a last faint glimmering spark of consciousness faded away when consciousness at length returned be accompanied by sensation of almost unendurable agony from numerous smarting inflamed stiffening wound to be added torture of burning thirst be lying completely naked upon scorching sand few yard distant from water edge whither have be dragged apparently for purpose of being stripped of poor spoil of clothing sun now nearing horizon poured fiery beam full upon still further increasing torture from be suffering believe that to circumstance alone be indebted for preservation from death for glowing ray dried hardened blood a oozed from wound thus prevented bleeding to death to great surprise be entirely alone sand around be impressed with numerous footprint from unshod foot on looking more intently about saw that have left in direction of beach canoe be gone circumstance excited within anew direst apprehension for have not slightest doubt that savage be away in pursuit of boat moment dreaded to see reappear to hear triumphant shout proclaiming enemy success moment laden with excruciating mental bodily torture wore slowly away nothing appeared to disturb break in upon solitude surrounded now urged by desire for cooler spot sought to drag agonised frame from burning sand to cool fresh verdant greensward be few yard distant slowly writhing at movement with keenest anguish crawled foot by foot upwards along beach at length after hour of intense torment sank utterly exhausted upon utmost verge of grass covered plain exertion caused wound to burst open afresh now became aware that have received several in addition to inflicted in fight last being doubtless result of wanton cruelty savage delight on part of enemy at finding in power be still a far a ever from mean of slaking burning thirst for there be not drop of fresh water within mile of a far a knew have there be strength be by time so completely gone must not have crawled half dozen yard to save life even to quench that thirst be now to almost worse than death stern stubborn endurance be therefore only resource sank back upon cool grass to await in bitter helplessness death felt must soon come to relief now relapsed into state of semi consciousness thought wandering away from present condition fixing with strange pertinacity upon subject of most trifling import now plunging into vague speculation anon indulging in sort of fantastic fancy a fever began to assume burning sway over tortured frame from state be aroused by hearing joyous shout in tone of bob well remembered voice raising with difficulty only to sink back in utter feebleness caught momentary glimpse of boat in act of grounding on beach in few brief second more ella bob be beside former raising head upon knee gazing into face with expression of fondest pity concern a finger swept hair gently off forehead wet with clammy dew of suffering bob too knelt at side uttering expression of sympathy encouragement expressed a usual with true nautical figurativeness of speech seeing be conscious however speedily changed discourse informed that be necessary must be immediately removed for though have succeeded in decoying whole of savage away in pursuit of boat have led to such distance a to admit of evading returning in search of be still in chase time must be lost in getting away from present spot returning to cutter must again be brought into dangerous proximity with having explained thus far therefore at once proceeded to raise in powerful arm though did so with utmost gentleness agony attending movement be so intense that swooned away when recovered be afloat under way standing off with flowing sheet for headland have mentioned a forming northern extremity of bay ella be seated on boat platform deck with head in lap be bathing face neck with pocket handkerchief wetted from pannikin of water stood by side be supplied from small breaker have brought with a soon a opened eye dear girl bent over asked with tenderest solicitude whether felt better yes darling answered for love of mercy pray give water be dying for want of handed pannikin to bob who immediately filled eye drinking in in eager anticipation cool sparkling drop of precious liquid a gurgled crystal clear out of bung hole of breaker next moment pannikin be drained to bottom be craving for more oh what delicious draught be that to parched burning lip throat surely man who first dreamed of nectar must have be thinking of water clear cool tasted under similar circumstance to in be then placed thirst at length temporarily assuaged ella once more resumed bathing of

here island ag'in such be bob story end of adventure for though remained at island nearly seven week never saw further sign of savage in about month from date of adventure have so far recovered a to be able to hobble about little few yard only at time then began to regain strength rapidly by end of following week be able with assistance of bob strong arm to get a far a cascade morning take bath too helped on wonderfully towards entire convalescence wound have closed be by time so far scarred over be able to dispense with dressing bandage began to talk about making start finally arranging to do so a soon a new moon attained first quarter must be in fortnight be believe on sunday following arrangement bob set off first thing after breakfast to attempt ascent of mountain having discovered a believed spot at active man with good nerve might surmount natural impediment existed near base cautioned to be very careful for sake a well a own for be still too weak to afford very effectual assistance in event of mishap broken limb halfway up mountain side must have be death to just at time ella be of course society for other wandered about lawn like ravine reposed at frequent interval beneath grateful shade of tree in blissful oblivion of passage of time waiting quite contentedly until master bob chose to rejoin faithfully promised must in time for dinner at length however position of sun in western heaven warned that hour named be long past proposed walk a far a head of ravine hoping to meet truant returning walked slowly strength not yet being sufficient to permit of very active exertion by time that reached point aimed at entire landscape be flooded in lovely pinky purplish haze immediately precedes sunset still bob made appearance began to grow seriously alarmed waited half hour then just a sun be about to disappear in purple western wave have made up mind to return to cutter thinking might possibly have passed down ravine on opposite side made appearance to surprise seemed singularly uncommunicative must get little out of beyond fact that have with very great difficulty reached summit found conjecture a to being extinct crater correct thawed little during dinner volunteered information that have seen land far away on southern board nearly quite hundred mile distant supposed have seen loom of land to westward about west north west also to northward be of opinion said that late enemy have come from land seen to southward be bound north touching at island on way on marauding excursion a have be able completely to sweep island in direction from commanding elevation of mountain top have detected sign whatever of nigger in direction with dropped subject adverted to condition questioning solicitously unusually so fancied a to how felt extent of strength where have be what have seen be particularly curious on latter point asked same question so repeatedly that ella made laughing remark forget what upon carefully avoided further repetition of for remainder of evening at least a long a ella be with when at length retired to own tent for night however became more communicative be already undressed in hammock be sitting smoking beside after silence of ten minute quarter of hour during seemed to be ruminating deeply began have something to tell ye lad said knocking ash contemplatively out of pipe a spoke dash ugly old wig if be at sartain ought to say anything about to night seeing a ca do much good might only be upsetting of ye for night head better mine in matter of sort confess must like to have idees upon subject afore sleep maybe will in way mark out course upon idees can travel good bit of way betwixt morning even that much will be advantage gained fact be that have see 'd something a did expect to see whilst be away up aloft there pointing with stem of pipe backwards over shoulder toward mountain sight have disturbed little set thinkin ' good deal indeed said what have seen bob must perforce tell about now for have excited curiosity apprehension not much need for last boy hope believe answered be best perhaps a must know at once so without further palaver albatross pirate brig be inside reef be lying at anchor at very moment in bay where be so near losing number of mess albatross exclaimed nonsense bob surely must be mistaken be not whaler think come in to water said be whaler harry whaler must come so far within group a here island when did ye ever know mistaken about vessel a have given such good reason to remember a here brig knowed minute set eye on firstly by patch in foresail a might have ' noticed last time see nextly by shape of main topmast staysail thirdly lastly by whull look of enables seaman to recognise ship in same way a one of 'long shore folk recognises acquaintance in street when see though may be dressed exactly like score of other people within hail what be more can make pretty near guess a to what be become of whaler that went a'ter when found be to be have for see be got three of chap whale boat to replace two a be expended in little trifle of brush doubt be important news indeed said news provides matter for very serious reflection what do suppose have brought in here bob did see anything by must form opinion yes replied did want of water may be one thing be idee that have come in here to give craft overhaul for 'd sooner let go anchor than out boat one watch pull ashore turn to building hut on green whilst t'other watch sends down t'gallan ' yard mast unbends sail sends down on deck then be likely to make pretty long stay said in case may be discovered at moment that be likely to stay here time will not deny returned bob feel partic'lar oneasy about bein ' discovered be like enough a on 'em may take fancy in head to scale here bit of mountain have made business to give place reg'lar overhaul a'ternoon thing ca be done from south'ard not without ladder be good long un at have found out too that though may get round to t'other side of mountain from here ca get down to level ground beyond never see such place be nothing precipice one atop of t'other there be one place come to one man might defend ag'in just a many a ever like to come a'ter by just standin ' behind sort of wall in cliff shoving of 'em over edge a tried to get round make mind easy on p'int lad ai to be got at except 't be by water reckon will be too busy to spare boat crew to come length of if did be thousand chance to one 'd never find openin into here cove why run past day a brought in here wounded 'd never have found if have knowed just where to look for so be opinion a may stay here quiet comfortable enough so long a have mind to then when be tired of waitin ' can slip out quietly in night nobody be wiser so much for now for idee be come into head ca get rid of noways must be pretty trick to sarve chap if be to take brig carry out to sea under nose leavin ' of 'em here to amuse best way must must be pretty trick indeed replied if be possible at moment can not see how be to be done difficulty in way of accomplishment be too many for only couple of men to overcome be dozen even four might perhaps do must never get out clear of reef by two self besides before must get canvas on must be alongside of in boat even if watch will of course leave on board be overpowered reckon a will keep much of watch aboard where be lying returned bob be a safe a if be in harbour not more 'n mile from beach on lee side of island a to gettin ' out have only to stand to south'ard under fore aft canvas be belief a 'd fetch out clear of reef from where be lyin ' in one tack recollect a told ye that reef dipped a went to south'ard well be opinion a there 'd be water for over by time be far enough south to make worth while to think about heaving of about be road a came in by if be case perhaps might be done then if must contrive to gain possession of boat first of said what be to become of cutter in meantime have fancy for leaving here to fall into hand to speak truth now that have brought so well thus far must like to finish voyage in if thing be attempted at must be attended with utmost risk must only be successful in event of being able to steal on board cutter be not suitable for such service will tell have just occurred to there be just bare possibility of being able to steal on board in canoe dark night set fire to brig then come back here get cutter under weigh be off at once even can only be done in event of there being one left on board at night consider very unlikely that be plan exclaimed bob with enthusiasm burn craft afore eye leave 'em to get off in boat if like not so said if scheme be undertaken at must certainly do effectually take boat away burn brig here must remain prisoner for considerable time at least for island be quite out of route of honest craft perhaps excepted better better still exclaimed bob in high glee now never must have thought of because somehow seems cruel unnat'ral like to burn beauty of craft a there brig be proper plan hal there be doubt of two must take care of brig cutter in anything very finest of weather be better to burn craft beauty a be than villain must misuse to rob murder honest seaman do worse to wife darter curse sha forget in hurry poor young thing a see lying dead in cabin of american ship 'd burn finest craft a ever be launched afore must have chance to commit sich piece of devilish villainy now harry lad mind do here little piece of work have got hold of eend of right coil of idees can see a heart set upon robert trunnion be man a will back ye up in through thick thin there be hand upon get well strong a fast a know how will go aloft there day keep eye upon day long see what 't be intends doing first chance have mark job done now let blow light out get good night sleep upon bob suited action to word in le than ten minute have auricular evidence that a far a sleep be concerned be carrying precept most thoroughly into practice on following morning a soon a breakfast be over bob set off up ravine companion providing with best telescope few biscuit flask of weak grog a be intention to remain on summit of mountain entire day watching motion of pirate unless happened to see anything rendering earlier return advisable did not feel quite so easy in mind a bob did with regard to chance of boat being detached to examine island in such event of cove escaping detection so arranged with that if observed anything of kind be to fly handkerchief from branch of isolated tree grew on small projecting platform near summit be quite visible from cutter ravine be hidden by mountain top from pirate decided that if signal be displayed must convey ella to spot have spoken of on previous evening a capable of being so easily defended must then return to cutter try effect of shell two upon boat if appeared within cove afterwards if need be retire to place of ella concealment make stand there in furtherance of arrangement got bob to show spot found on personal inspection to be fully a impregnable a have declared to be also ascertained a have done that be quite impossible to get round mountain by land then separated bob making best of way up mountain side returning to shore loading a went with finest choicest fruit must find be met about halfway up ravine by ella strolled quietly back to beach together fair companion following example loading with fruit when reached beach set about striking tent got sail spar lighter article back on board cutter a there be now no knowing at what moment might be necessary for to be off task in then weak condition occupied greater part of day getting on board be putting spar in place rigging bending sail by time have finished everything be back into old berth with exception of about couple of canoe load of heavy article might be run on board in twenty minute hour then must be ready to start at moment notice even contrived to take tube boat to piece stow away below though tube gave trouble in getting inboard managed at last by parbuckling up over side with aid of throat halliard of course kept strict watch on tree near summit time signal fluttered from so assumed that be too busy on board brig to make exploration relying on number for safety in case of attack else that exploration might be afoot be being conducted by land at length everything be done that unaided effort must effect then taking ella on shore with in canoe set out for walk up ravine in quest of little more fruit to complete sea stock be rather anxious to take a much of a possible to sea with for have always held belief that fruit flourish best in particular climate if partaken of in moderation be beneficial to health whilst breathing air of climate ella expressed surprise once twice during day at somewhat abrupt manner in encampment on shore be broken up at bob sudden predilection for so unsailorlike amusement a mountain climbing answered carelessly anxious not to alarm dear little girl by acquainting with fact that have unexpectedly acquired such very undesirable neighbour near head of ravine be fortunate enough to come upon banana tree laden with exceptionally fine fruit succeeded in possessing of two noble bunch of banana have arrived at exactly right condition for cutting bunch be a heavy a must well lift having got to ground without bruising of fruit cut strong stake placed with bunch at end fair in pathway knew bob must take on way to beach feeling certain must know why be placed there must bring down with then returned cutting few splendid pine gathering little breadfruit few fig a went paddled back to cutter where ella remained fully occupied with other until be quite dark when just a little fairy be on point of going below to see to tea heard bob hail jumping into canoe soon joined on beach well harry said a drew light canoe up foot two on beach seems that have be noways idle whilst have be aloft there spying into inimy movement hardly knowed what to make of when first found tent struck beost everything gone be glad in one sense that matter be so far for'ard though be sorry in for be greatly afeared have be working hard have tired there be just chance of havin ' hand full of work to night stumbled over here banana a be coming down ravine brought along a s'pose be intended must just so answered now let hear result of day observation have amused a see in getting a many of thing a must back into cutter for felt that in present condition of affair may be imperatively necessary for to be off at moment notice feel very much fatigued be picking up strength rapidly experience of to day have shown that be stronger than really thought be there be few thing still lying about here be rather too heavy for single handed when be on board stowed away can be off at moment so much better returned bob let get few on into canoe to once't whilst be working can be telling what have see 'd from perch up aloft there wo take very long in telling in first place two boat have be right to south eend of island went away full o men landed hand excepting couple of men in boat while shore party be reg'lar beating wood boat paddled slowly back keepin ' close in shore to take shipmate off in case of anything going wrong at least be idee then soon made out that party be working way to nor'ard from camp giving eend of island overhaul see 'd 'em often crossing open country between different clump of tree be able once twice to hear faintly shout to one lot must have made very oneasy have give place such complete overhaul later'n yesterday for seemed to be bent on getting up bit of mountain stood off on way that a though must be beat have to give up at last go back though make manner of doubt a have pretty well decided to come way with boat to morrer finish surwey of island so much for shore gang be back in camp by time if sleep without rocking wo be for want of walking shouting hollering let tell ye lad be joke to be fighting way through thick bush for hour at time a most of chap have be doing blessed hot day now a to brig be opinion a mean to careen just a have done with little barkie have be working like galley slave aboard there day have stripped to lower mast sail be gone ashore for saw 'em lowered over side into boat with same two good looking eye of mine spar be still aboard have be striking out cargo wholesale to mind in most lubberly unseamanlike fashion if have be now must have ' built raft with spar rafted thing ashore have done everything with boat maybe hows'ever be valyable stuff did care to trust to raft be abeost box bale of sort size picking of many good ship cargo will warrant now reckon that a'ter work a lot have got through to day will sleep pretty sound too so be idee that ai likely to have much better chance for playin ' little trick upon than will have to night be a tired a tired can be may take oath upon will sleep without fear of savage for reason that have give island pretty thorough overhaul without findin ' to morrow may be too late for if so be a come way in boat wo do for to be found here chance be that will have to cut run for without doing farthing worth of harm a'ter sail being took ashore knock little plan for carryin ' brig off clean on head even if spar be aloft to set on be not so s'pose will have to burn pretty little craft if be to do anything at now what say ye lad simply be to be attempted must be attempted to night replied reason for doing so be too obvious to need enumeration so will get few trap on board have tea then snatch what rest can between midnight when must be stirring again must give great deal to see brilliantly starlit sky overcast must take thing a find only use greater precaution now think have a much in canoe a will safely carry so let shove off can come back for remainder after tea mind bob not word of before ella trust for returned bob let little dearie turn in get night rest ondisturbed by anxiety on account can slip off quietly at right time without bein ' bit wiser will be soon enough to talk about here job when have done be by time close alongside more be said everything be got out of canoe stowed in proper place then went to tea getting remainder of good on board stowing away immediately that meal be over after bob stretched out on locker below went to sleep whilst ella remained on deck until about ten o'clock be glad when dear girl wished good night left for must not feel that praiseworthy righteous a be proposed adventure be one most seriously involved safety well being closely knit with ours a fortune be must not conceal from that be about to run tremendous risk ignorant a be of what camp arrangement of pirate be wished to have time to reflect calmly upon risk ran best possible mean of avoiding before setting out everything must depend upon whether watch be set on board brig not bob be strongly of opinion that left to take care of herself at night thought otherwise volume two chapter vii destruction of albatross remained on deck until midnight in anxious self communion then slipping off light canvas shoe went below quietly aroused bob instantly arose accompanied noiselessly bare footed to deck have tool implement of kind to hamper sole provision for expedition consisting of couple of box of match with sharp knife bottle of grog considered be that needed confess that heart throbbed little more rapidly than usual a paddle dipped in water light canoe shot away from cutter side be from feeling be at moment leaving perhaps for ever to terrible fate one whom loved more dearly than own life too without one word of farewell rather than from personal apprehension left hastily scrawled note in pencil on cabin table to effect that have occasion to go away for short time hoped to be back in time for breakfast in case must be delayed longer than anticipated be a soon a be fairly out of cove communicated plan to bob impressing upon arrangement in case of contingency requiring alteration in original plan for a soon a be fairly at work everything must have to be done a far a possible in absolute silence did not wish to leave explanation for moment when perhaps single word incautiously uttered might lead to betrayal paddled on close under cliff in about hour reached spot where sandy beach on western side of island commenced here gently grounded canoe laid paddle cautiously noiselessly in lifted craft far enough up on beach to prevent floating away then keeping a much within shadow of tree a must made best of way along beach to low point already mentioned a forming northern extremity of bay have witnessed fight with savage in pirate brig now lay at anchor there be moon at time young crescent having set hour before night be brilliantly starlit though light thus afforded be assistance in one way be very much against in materially increasing chance of detection hour of rapid walking brought to point where thought that by striking inland might contrive to cut short across neck of land forming junction of headland with main so to speak now utmost caution became necessary warned bob to avoid everything have remotest likeness to branch twig of kind sudden sharp snapping of must be sure to attract attention thought though air be filled with chirping of million of night insect of kind at length caught sight of pirate bivouac almost at same instant saw figure rise from ground stretch wearily throw pile of branch upon dying ember of fire showed hard a work of previous day might have be here be one wakeful individual at event among upon kept anxious gaze intently riveted watching motion with closest scrutiny saw walk to outside of circle beyond limit of feeble light from nearly extinguished fire peer earnestly into darkness on side going round circle making same careful inspection outwards in direction lastly walked down towards beach far enough to satisfy that boat must just discern be right when returned flung more wood on fire then sat down close to windward of out of way of smoke filled pipe lighted of course took very good care to conceal effectually whilst patrol of camp be being made embraced opportunity to point out to bob that boat seemed to be anchored at few yard distance from beach excepting small punt be drawn foot two up on sand fire now began to blaze up brightly thought favourable moment to proceed for whilst afforded sufficiency of light to enable to avoid such obstacle a root of tree twig branch of shrub must dazzle eye of lonely watcher effectually prevent seeing anything beyond few yard distant accordingly pulled bob sleeve to attract attention pointing to punt intimated to that must be first object of attack now rose to foot once more stealing a rapidly forward a must taking advantage of little bit of cover offered to pause reconnoitre for moment reached after about twenty minute of breathless suspense half stranded punt to infinite chagrin there be oar in without must hing now commenced hurried consultation in cautious whisper a to what have better be done keeping wary eye upon sleeping camp solitary watcher while whilst be doing suddenly caught sight of pair of short oar knew in moment must belong to punt reared against tree in very midst of bivouac in full light of now brilliant fire within view of watching seaman saw be absolutely necessary that must have oar so pointed out to bob directed to remain perdu whilst made attempt to secure then set off down beach until be far enough away to be able to walk across open into shadow of bush without being seen succeeded in doing once there commenced stealthy approach putting foot carefully noiselessly to ground not venturing to raise one until other be firmly planted in manner contrived to make way onward unobserved at last gained cover behind trunk of tree against oar be standing now took a complete survey of bivouac a must without exposing counting head found that there be fewer than eighty three sleeping pirate within few yard of in addition to man on watch appeared to be just at moment either in fit of deep abstraction doze so without waiting for better opportunity cautiously reached arm round tree trunk grasped one of oar brought round to own side without so much a rustle of leaf emboldened by success now tried for second also succeeded in securing taking oar in hand at once proceeded to retrace step for first stage aimed at getting behind tree stood only about three yard distant soon reached spot on slipping behind trunk taking hasty glance backward be greatly alarmed at seeing pirate on watch on foot looking intently in direction shading eye with hand at once concluded that have be seen waited in breathless expectancy for shout be to raise entire crew upon instead of heard after short pause voice of man in soliloquy close to tree against oar have be placed be damned odd heard mutter must have sworn that paddle be standin ' up ag'in here tree hour ago what hell become of 'em surely none of chap be slipped off to have yarn with old steve wo thank for disturbing of at time o night rousing out from between gun where will lay anything old dormouse be snugly coiled away instead of looking a'ter brig a be dooty will just slip down to beach see if boat be right crouched down behind tree peeped cautiously round bole there sure enough be watchful gentleman sauntering down towards boat allowed to get far enough away to prevent seeing if suddenly turned round then quickly made way along edge of sward keeping within shadow of bush until thought be far enough away from fire to permit of cutting straight across to punt a soon a man be once more out of way achieved before pirate reached beach then stood anxiously watching for what might befall did not fear for bob knew that eye have be taking in everything happened from moment left felt quite satisfied that must not spoil game by running risk of discovery pirate walked quietly on at length reached punt looked into probably for missing oar then turned round walked back again have not advanced dozen pace before saw waving arm violently thought heard stilled cry then fell heavily to ground saw figure bob kneeling over at once started off a fast a must run taking oar with in about five minute stood by companion side have got man down on face be busy lashing arm firmly behind back forthwith assisted between unfortunate pirate be soon so securely bound hand foot that be impossible for to move ca sing out whispered bob for have stuffed han'kercher a far down throat a must get have made fast with turn of own necktie through jaw with reef knot at back of head be safe enough till morning so appeared therefore left with perfect unconcern to fate lifted light boat carried into water until be afloat then stepped noiselessly into bob taking oar whilst sat in stern sheet ready to take possession of other boat be moored at very short distance from beach one of being anchored rest hanging by painter in string astern of bob backed punt gently off until have got hold of painter of anchored boat easily raised there being only small boat anchor attached to end carefully placed in stern of punt in position a to afford secure hold then taking oar apiece pulled noiselessly a quickly a dared direct off shore with whole fleet of boat in tow astern of considered that be safe when have attained offing of mile for thought very unlikely that pirate must then attempt to overtake by swimming only mean of pursuit now have even if alarm be given everything still remained perfectly tranquil continued so until have rounded low point so often mentioned after of course be unable to see anything transpired in bivouac decided to take boat five in number besides punt over to mouth of channel anchor there until must pick up again on way out in cutter then go back after canoe so a to prevent possibility of falling into hand of pirate whilst doing bob volunteered explanation of motif for attacking pirate see 'd done harry observed thought a everything be going right until fool of feller took into head to come down to beach stowed away a well a must under quarter of punt if eye have have ' be choked up with sleep must have see 'd hows'ever did when turned round to go back think must be bad idee to put stop to wanderin ' habit of yourn ' think must be in pretty mess if be to come down ag'in afore 'd got fairly off with there boat almost afore knowed what intended to do 'd crept up behind flung arm tight round neck with knee well into small of back down come tried to sing out minute opened mouth rammed handkercher down throat kept a quiet a mouse so be like to be till morning when reckon will find hisself just about in centre of hobble with here boat gone brig afire fore aft please god d think did right lad excellently replied nothing must possibly have be done better now here be there go anchor now let stretch away a hard a can for canoe have be longer than bargained for over business will have daylight upon before be finished if look sharp now told bob what have heard pirate say that from remark gathered that old steve be only man left on board brig arranged with bob that be to answer in event of said old steve hailing a went alongside directed what to say a bob phraseology be habitually seasoned far more highly with nautical slang than be own must therefore be le likely to be suspected in carrying on of haphazard conversation than soon reached canoe lay just a have left taking in tow pulled away at once straight for brig in hour reached contrary to pirate surmise old steve proved to be pretty broad awake boat ahoy hailed a approached ay ay answered bob be that steve in course be replied that worthy who hell be what do want off here at time o ' night whisht returned bob warningly belay that old sinner there be need to let everybody know a two friend have brought ye off bottle of grog bit of queerish kind of news heave rope end will ye for be that dark hang if can find anything to make fast here boat painter to ay ay answered steve look out here ye be who be ye at ca make out woice damn if can who be that with ye not make out woice retorted bob s'pose ca ai surprised at considerin ' bushel of smoke a have swallered from fire ashore thousand of muskeeters a have flied down throat so be right here be grog old cock steve leaned over bulwark seized grog bob climbed brig side at same instant in moment steve be on back with bob knee whole weight on chest be soon busy securing prisoner with piece of rope be lying about in quantity on deck be quickly done man gagged with belaying pin after made rapid tour of deck cabin forecastle satisfied ourselves that there be one else on board to dispute interfere with action decided to set brief on fire in three place forward aft in midships lost time in making preparation found lot of old sail in locker at fore end of forecastle divided taking away sufficiency to kindle good rousing fire in hold over a soon a have deposited in suitable position a well a over remaining in locker poured few bucket of tar from cask found abroach on deck have fear about craft not burning well for have large quantity of combustible material of sort in hold hastily made a large heap of a must so a to ensure effectually taking fire then went into cabin piled bedding from berth upon floor heaping chair table upon pouring copious libation of tar upon whole then put light to staying long enough to see mass burst into fierce flame when rushed on deck dived into hold whilst bob went into forecastle where quickly kindled respective heap then a quickly returned to deck thin cloud of smoke already poured up through various opening of deck promising speedy effectual destruction to brig so have now nothing to do get away from return with speed to cutter steve be lowered over side into punt bob followed at once pushed off for cove in highest glee at having so successfully carried out daring scheme daylight be just breaking a pushed off by time that entered cove sun be above horizon dropped punt canoe astern sail being bent loose having made possible preparation for immediate start whilst waiting for hour at to set out upon raid be under way standing out of cove in ten minute more bob got big gaff topsail on craft a ran down towards passage kept bright look out for sign of alarm in pirate camp camp must not see of course expected to see men moving about on shore be disappointed for soon descried knot of figure standing upon low point be nearest land to brig watching in apparent stupefaction progress of vessel destruction brig be by time almost enveloped in flame have entire crew be on board must then have done nothing to save be quickly discovered of course great be confusion appearance seemed to excite cared nothing about indeed be part of programme that pirate must know to whom be indebted for present disaster very shortly crowd of men appeared hurrying along beach in direction a bore away for passage saluted with straggling musketry fire more in impotent anger than for harm must do for shot fell very far short when about quarter of mile from entrance to channel hove cutter to hauled punt alongside took out one of oar cast steve adrift from lashing leaving to get ashore to comrade a best might with one oar then filled away once more ran down upon boat took in tow stood out through channel volley of musketry betrayed irritation of pirate at sight of departure loss of boat to bob replied by giving three ironical cheer at juncture ella appeared on deck wonderfully surprised of course at saw be at once called on to explain did so briefly narrating circumstance of bob fortunate discovery of arrival of albatross at island of having watched crew previous day of plan of manner in have be carried out pointing to burning brig a issue of oh harry exclaimed bursting into tear how must run fearful risk only fancy two men venturing into very centre of dreadful people camp without arm too why what must have become of if have be taken really must almost find in heart to be downright angry with can not understand men bit seem of to have be born absolutely devoid of faculty of perception of danger even when be staring in face accordingly rush into midst of sort of peril seemingly with happy unconsciousness that be doing so with heedlessness a to consequence be perfectly bewildering now try to coax harry for really be seriously angry with to think too of being up night weak a be be surprised that be not ill again oh harry with fresh sob how thankful be that be safe did not know anything of until now look grieved darling did not mean what said be very naughty of know be frightened at thought of risk have run how might have ended oh mercy what be that shock a if cutter have struck upon rock dull heavy boom fragment of burning brig be scattered far wide to come pelting down again next minute in perfect shower of charred splintered wood spar rope thousand one other matter usually found on board ship brig powder magazine have blown up heavy cloud of dark smoke marked spot where explosion have taken place when drifted away before fresh morning breeze one two half burnt timber floating on water be remained of albatross ah exclaimed bob who be busy coiling down various halliard etc have be expectin that time past half hour only wonder did happen afore well that be good endin ' to good job well begun reckon chap ashore there may well make up mind to stay where be for rest of nat'ral life for have ship boat stuff to build with reckon there be many tree on yon island 'd be much use in ship buildin yard said think may safely consider career of crime bloodshed be put effectual stop to for time at least unless indeed unfortunate ship must come to island in case must have to certainty ay returned bob be very onlikely chance here island lie in road to nowhere may be year afore set eye on sail again after loses sight of good lookin ' topsail of ourn s'pose wo starve there will lad said there be very little fear of that island yield abundance of fruit a know amply sufficient for requirement have punt will serve to go fishing on lagoon though be too small for of to venture to leave island in so on whole think be quite a well off a deserve be by time clear of reef in open water so went down to breakfast leaving bob at tiller ella be very penitent for late naughtiness a termed be so lavish with endearment to make up for must very willingly have experienced thunder squall day of life to have air cleared afterwards in so agreeable manner when returned to deck bob asked previous to going below to get breakfast what intended to do with boat canoe of be in tow have not thought very much about now that question be put decided to retain canoe altogether be so small so light that thought must easily carry on deck in anything very bad weather ordinarily must tow very comfortably astern if must contrive to keep thought must frequently save wear tear in tube boat where passage of short distance across calm surface of lagoon from cutter to shore be be required must answer purpose perfectly well a to boat of albatross decided to tow fairly out of sight of island then abandon thus effectually precluding possibility of getting back into owner hand prevailing wind there being from about south east must drive boat ever farther farther from island accordingly retained in tow for remainder of day next night cast adrift on following morning be now within two day easy sail of spot have be indicated to a position of treasure island thought naturally reverted to question a to whether treasure really existed not bob feeling utmost confidence that must be found precisely a dying spaniard have described began to entertain grave doubt a to success important conversation in existence position of treasure be revealed be recalled almost word for word note have made at time be frequently referred to certainly everything seemed to abundantly justify bob confidence whilst be quite unable to point to single word circumstance tending to confirm doubt fact be suppose that a drew nearer to goal began to realise more fully vast influence possession of treasure must exercise upon future must have be influenced by feeling that be too good to be true there be so very decided infusion of romantic element into everything connected with affair that matter of fact mind refused to accept possibility that there might be truth in after be young then have now lived long enough seen enough of world to feel convinced that romance enters so largely into ordinary circumstance of life that middle aged man might easily furnish from own experience material for dozen sensation novel believe that novel be ever written be half a sensational a must be minute strictly true record of incident marking life of such man have in mind at moment man whose life occupation have for many year be apparently of dullest most commonplace description to one have appeared to be simply thorough business man punctual to minute almost to second methodical accurate without thought apparently for anything business very conversation being brilliant only on matter connected with business be in short with who know pretty well even with own kith kin about very last man who must ever be supposed to know anything about romance beyond name yet circumstance have revealed to beyond possibility of cavil doubt that man have be hero of romance so thrilling so startling so very extraordinary in phase that must indubitably make fortune of great sensation novelist of day forthwith if gentleman fortune be not already made to return to water lily on evening of day following that on sailed from pirate island found so near reputed position of treasure island decided to heave cutter to for night so a to avoid possibility of running upon outlying reef during darkness bob went aloft last thing after sun have set before darkness closed down upon face of tranquil ocean must see nothing that be able to identify with certainty a land on extreme verge of western horizon saw said something might be island evening cloud especially in fine weather when low down on horizon sometimes assume such form hue that be very difficult for even most experienced mariner to decide whether what be looking at be land merely vapour particularly when land be known supposed to exist in direction in be looking took in spinnaker gaff topsail therefore housed topmast lashed helm lee hauled fore sheet over to windward allowing jib sheet to flow be eight hour in night be so close below weather be so fine that brought hammock on deck turned in there with waterproof rug rigged tent fashion over to keep off dew nothing occurred to disturb tranquillity of night next morning a soon a breakfast be over filled away upon cutter again made sail upon course bob must have be in hammock taking rest in other fashion between breakfast time noon be so anxious to catch glimpse of spot have attracted over so many thousand mile of ocean have led to brave so many danger that must not stay below spent entire morning at crosstrees on look out obtained most excellent observation for longitude about half past nine that morning on working up found that be barely twenty mile to eastward of point be aiming for a have hove cutter about at midnight so a to keep a nearly a possible directly to windward of spot ought to have be at anchor at noon mile after mile be traversed still land appeared rearing above horizon at time arrived for to take meridian altitude also be very capital observation result be that found exactly where island be stated to be situated with land in sight in direction from mast head must confess that in spite of doubt have lately obtruded upon mind felt keenly disappointed a for bob be so chop fallen that have not word to say be not until have carefully gone once more over calculation of day have verified error in chronometer for have made allowance have in short satisfied thoroughly that actually be where supposed to be realised how strongly notwithstanding doubt have relied upon finding island buried treasure so far a primary object of voyage be concerned appeared that have be undertaken in vain have not be for accidental acquisition of intelligence respecting father must now have be without object for further prosecution of voyage excepting that of returning home again a quickly a possible to secure best berth must make up a far a might be for lost time have hove cutter to whilst be taking working up noon observation a soon a have fully realised great disappointment got out chart bob pored over for full hour in endeavour to fix upon one island out of many in great archipelago be most likely to be one upon amazon be cast away however there be so many of must answer equally well to imperfect description have received that be at last obliged to give up revert to original resolution of examining likely place in hope that must be more successful in second search than have proved in first therefore filled away upon cutter again upon course a must take up through thickest cluster of island such be elasticity of human mind before night closed down upon appeared to have almost forgotten everything connected with treasure island thought spoke of nothing chance in favour of against finding of father volume two chapter viii father a sun went down wind fell light did not average more than four knot hour through three night watch be at first afraid that be about to have hurricane a be not usual for breeze to fall so light a have just then in trade glass be high steady weather looked settled so did not shorten sail when sun rose next morning brought breeze up again somewhat fresher with be eight hour out that night consequently be on deck when day broke a morning dawned obscurity of night yielded imperceptibly before approach of great day god became conscious that there be break in level of horizon about four point on starboard bow watching a continued to grow lighter found that be land small low island apparently about nine mile distant be rather surprised at a according to chart be constructed from most recent survey nearest land be fully day sail distant to westward decided to take nearer look at place a must involve deviation from course cutter be then steering must necessitate jibe left helm for moment with couple of turn of tiller rope round head of tiller went forward to take in spinnaker formerly have considered necessary that bob must be on deck when handling large sail practice have by time taught how to work cutter alone so that be now only on occasion of emergency that called other to assist in making shortening sail a water lily drew in closer with land made out that be small coral island with usual encircling reef lagoon seemed to be about two mile long from direction in cutter be approaching be unable to judge of width be soon near enough to distinguish line of surf betrayed presence of surrounding coral reef then called bob to come on deck take helm whilst went aloft a usual to look out for channel when came on deck why harry how exclaimed thought said there be land within hundred fifty mile of last night here be a pretty little spot close aboard of a man need wish to set eye upon went by chart answered that showed clear sea about here can never rely upon chart here in pacific what be clear sea at time that survey be being made may very possibly be dotted with score of such small island a one ahead in very few year have read that coral island form very rapidly one however can not be of such very recent growth for there be full grown cocoa nut upon a well a other tree be surprised that be not shown on chart said a be standing at foot of mast on point of going aloft in few second more be standing on crosstrees examining line of surf ahead for narrow strip of unbroken water must indicate existence of passage through reef a stood thus gaze be arrested by appearance of small object in rapid motion across bosom of lagoon inside reef scrutiny of few second be sufficient to satisfy that be canoe seating upon crosstrees might more conveniently use glass have taken aloft with quickly focussed instrument brought to bear with assistance be now enabled to discern that canoe be craft of about same size a one have towing astern held three person two who wielded paddle be black unless eye strangely deceived third be white man can not attempt to describe extraordinary feeling came upon at discovery can be possible thought that be island upon amazon be cast away be about to have inexpressible joy of seeing beloved father once more so unexpectedly a again have recourse to glass being now somewhat nearer no longer have room for doubt individual who sat in stern of canoe who now saw be steering craft with paddle be undoubtedly white now observed too that canoe be passing through opening in south western edge of reef passage must have escaped notice in then position of cutter have not be for seeing canoe passing through for be broadside on to a be unbroken water be therefore not easily detected turned telescope upon island now saw thin film of light blue smoke a from wood fire rising from among tree there be sign of wreck of description within view if anything of kind existed must be on other side of island canoe be by time in open water saw that be paddling along edge of reef towards bob now made out from deck hailed asking if saw answered that did in uncontrollable tumult of excitement descended to deck directed bob to keep cutter away for canoe for strangely enough thought never entered head that occupant might be enemy ran down below got up club ensign hoisted at peak a blew out in fresh morning breeze saw figure in stern of canoe rise to foot wave hat

recognised with unspeakable joy father hurrah shouted hurrah be be father bob have found after that when little expected to do so thank god oh thank god amen answered bob taking off tarpaulin

anchor a soon a be sufficiently recovered from present excitement to tell intelligible tale will know everything well well so be answered father suppose have better play pilot in navigating seventy four ' of yours through channel what water do draw seven foot aft answered work to perfection so will have difficulty with so much better answered father a will be rather ticklish work keep well to windward robert go closer than forty fathom to southern extremity of surf now dear boy one word more how be sister well quite well be happy to say at least be so when left england little more than

say be quite well returned father indeed have of have day illness since have be on island be quite invalid at time that ship be lost certainly soon recovered thanks to winter care good nursing how did know of being with learned whole story from time of sailing for home up to day of being so shamefully abandoned replied that by merest accident happened to fall in with one of men whom shipped at canton on board vessel boarded on line on passage out here be one with whom must make acquainted dear sir continued a ella fair head appeared at companion then introduced to father briefly narrating circumstance under became member of little crew frankly explaining relation in now stood towards other when have finished explanation father took dear little girl by hand kissed on forehead said few kind word to relieve embarrassment agitation under be evident be suffering have very great satisfaction of seeing that two being in whom be so warmly interested be mutually impressed very favourably towards other soon worked through short passage in reef then stood away to westward rounding southern extremity of island very shortly afterwards moment that cleared point opened western side of island bob shouted ah there lie dear old barkie sure enough look at harry lad be sorely mauled about poor old beauty must still have ' knowed anywheres a far a old eye must see there indeed lay wreck of amazon close to beach about two mile off sorely mauled about be so much so greatly doubted whether bob must ever have identified a old ship have not father presence story have already heard of loss assisted three lower mast be still standing whole of upper work be gone at first supposed that have be used for fire wood until opened up tiny bay somewhat nearer to southward saw small vessel in process of being built on beach have established shipyard here see sir remarked a object came in view yes answered father have made poor progress so far will be of greatest assistance to dear boy robert here since have managed to turn out sweet little craft a cutter will be strongly inclined to pull work to piece begin over again afresh how do mean sir inquired surely imagine that bob built cutter did not returned father then where did pick up be built on thames replied bob have managed to bring out here between father be greatly surprised at hearing a be now approaching anchorage be decided to defer explanation until must have opportunity of proceeding with in straightforward fashion sail be shortened in about ten minute afterwards dropped anchor in pretty little well sheltered bay within couple of cable length of beach in full view of neat little cottage constructed of bamboo stood on lawn of about acre in extent environed with beautiful tropical tree plant winter be down on beach full of curiosity respecting new comer will leave to reader imagination surprise delight with recognised in two of old shipmate two canoe conveyed hand of ashore father after welcoming heartily to dominion a stepped from canoe to beach gave arm to ella with on other side bob winter following arm in arm astern two native bringing up rear at once wended way to cottage where found that winter have prepared sumptuous breakfast in anticipation of arrival whilst discussing meal related at father earnest solicitation whole story commencing with account of wreck on portland beach of tale of treasure island told by dying spaniard then going on to relate how have be induced by belief in story to build fit out water lily sail in in search of treasure mentioning in due course meeting with seaman who have given clue to amazon fate of resolve therefore to search whole archipelago if need be for abandoned one winding up with account of late achievement of destruction of albatross of consequent imprisonment of crew upon island have so recently sailed from great be surprise of father companion a proceeded frequent comment interruption at last got through with then of course became anxious in turn to hear how matter have gone with father winter during long stay where now be have very little to tell replied father in answer to question little must not now be alive to relate for unceasing care attention of friend comrade winter here who refused to save from possible lifetime of captivity on island by deserting commander watched through long tedious illness under god be mean of saving life for happy moment have never quite despaired of being restored to home friend latterly have felt that deliverance might be work of year at first be kept buoyed up by hope of being rescued by passing vessel though have maintained ceaseless watch have never sighted single sail from moment of first arrival here until hove in sight morning chart instrument of description be carried off when mutineer left in boat so that have very remote idea of actual whereabouts must be in very out of way corner of globe a indeed now gather clearly from what have told first work after recovery be building of hut then followed preparation of garden short distance inland from here so that might secure mean of existence a soon a be completed to satisfaction went to work upon building of small vessel appliance be so inadequate to task that progress have be excessively slow a may judge when tell that have be at work now fully two year craft be yet barely half finished latterly indeed have got on somewhat better for two black who a far a can learn from sign few word of english have picked up since being with be blown off own island in gale of wind came ashore here in last stare of exhaustion have be of greatest assistance to in mere handling of heavy weight now that have joined think may make short work of remainder of job be at first disposed to suggest abandonment of half finished schooner for such be on more mature consideration came to conclusion that must be better to finish on many account chief of be that a now mustered seven hand told including black whom must not leave behind must be uncomfortably crowded on board cutter doubted much whether must find room to stow away in so small craft sufficiency of water to say nothing of provision for so large party day be of course declared high holiday on island after mutual explanation have be fully given white of course be proceeded to beach to inspect craft on stock be much larger craft than lily measuring fully thirty ton father winter have given great deal of care attention to design result be very pretty model though line be by mean so fine a cutter be immensely strong owing to fact that be le laborious to build in timber just a be taken from amazon only with such alteration a be imperatively necessary to bring to required shape than must have be to reduce with imperfect tool in possession of builder whole of framing be set up secured garboard two adjacent streak on side bolted to be must easily understand a looked on massive timber how great must have be labour for two pair of hand to bring even thus far forward in addition to there be pulling of to piece in first instance on board parent ship rafting of material down to bay afterwards after taking good look at craft shoved off in canoe for wreck calling on board cutter on way that father winter might satisfy curiosity felt concerning little craft have so successfully traversed so many thousand mile of ocean be naturally delighted at everything saw admired model greatly be nevertheless loud in expression of wonder at what termed temerity in venturing on so long voyage in such mere boat quiet paddle of about hour took alongside wreck lay grounded in about ten foot of water pretty much a have be left by mutineer have difficulty in boarding substantial accommodation ladder having be constructed to facilitate so frequent operation there be not much to see when stood upon deck whole of poop having be removed to furnish material for schooner bob naturally felt deep interest in ship have formerly be floating home a to whose fate have for so long be in state of such painful uncertainty remained on board about hour during ella insisted on having pointed out to exact spot old berth have formerly occupied then returned to shore visited garden have be formed in small natural clearing within about quarter of mile of house here found goodly patch of wheat almost ready for sickle large plot of potato father said grew indifferently well in climate few other english vegetable yam several fruit tree of various kind including very useful breadfruit have be carefully selected a carefully transplanted to present position where have flourished amazingly under not very efficient gardening skill have be bestowed upon by two recluse of animal food there be lack small island being almost overrun by many descendant of three pig dozen fowl mutineer have in unaccountable paroxysm of generosity left behind remainder of day be spent in tour quite over father limited dominion bob winter having however devoted afternoon to rigging up of couple of tent close alongside hut for accommodation of of cutter crew during ramble ella shared though at first wished to remain aloof thinking father might have private matter to discus after so long separation subject of treasure island again came uppermost father seemed to be strongly of opinion that in spite of failure to find really existed that disappointment have arisen in error a to exact position for own part hardly knew what to think must not for moment believe that spaniard knowing to be dying man must tell wanton objectless falsehood have never supposed to be otherwise than in full possession of sens whilst relating story have given position of island definitely on arrival at latitude longitude named have found no land at true there have be certain amount of reservation in statement have given position a near a must ascertain in word to effect allowing possibility of error that error be not likely to exceed few mile thought have island really existed ought to have be able at event to see from mast head when in position ascribed to talked matter over at length for one be quite indifferent to advantage accruing from possession of wealth must make nothing very satisfactory of so at last subject be changed discussed arranged plan of immediate operation father longing for home being thousand time increased now that knew have sent information home of possibility of still being in existence fully shared in impatience a knew that ada must soon begin to feel uneasy if be not already so at long period have now elapsed since must last have heard from of a for winter be portland man story bob told of kith kin fully aroused semi dormant longing to see once more next morning turned to with will upon schooner happened that more material be required from wreck obtaining of rafting of down to shipyard have hitherto be work involving expenditure of much time great labour a until arrival of two black in canoe about six month before father have nothing in shape of boat excepting rude catamaran sort of affair after acquisition of canoe though be of course most useful for many purpose rafting down of timber planking be almost a tedious laborious operation a ever canoe being too small too light for towing purpose usual mode of procedure have be to kedge down everything arrival put entirely new phase upon part of business got out tube boat put together rigged then six men four white two native who be strong active lad manned cutter proceeded to wreck where combined force in taking apart such portion of wreck a thought most suitable for purpose by middle of afternoon two good sized raft be in water lily taking one of in tow tube boat bob insisted on christening a ella other got whole down to bay moored to beach in little more than hour task father declared have usually occupied winter best part of day even then amount of material transported have scarcely be quarter a great a now brought down so great indeed have be additional assistance afforded by two pair of strong arm belonging to cutter crew that considered now have sufficiency of material to plank schooner right up to gunwale know whether have mentioned before not in fitting out water lily have provided very complete chest of carpenter tool so that might have mean of effecting necessary repair to cutter a far a skill must allow now came into play with excellent effect worked in high spirit for be now no longer doubtful question a to whether schooner must be finished not additional strength contributed by bob being found just sufficient to render manageable comparatively easy work have before proved too heavy for father winter alone even when aided by two native may a well now mention be two lad of about eighteen year of age having be treated very kindly from first arrival by father proved very tractable willing altogether very valuable aid in many respect be none of very skilful in handling of tool work be consequently of very highly finished character everything be a strong a wood iron must make within fortnight have contrived by dint of sheer hard work to get schooner planked right up at first have great deal of difficulty with fastening from want of smith smith forge have be greatest bar to father progress ella be mean of helping out of difficulty by suggesting idea think must never have occurred to of men be neither more le than construction of rude efficient smith hearth out of old sheet pig iron obtained from wreck manufacture of bellow from board stout tarpaulin nozzle being made of bamboo inserted into orifice in hearth be packed air tight with clay be clumsy contrivance certainly answered purpose well enough to save great deal of time labour laying of deck be next task took fortnight to do a resolved that everything must be a well done a possible be exclusive of time occupied in fixing combing of hatch fore scuttle cabin companion skylight other opening a got hand in however made more rapid progress in little more than two month from date of water lily arrival hull of schooner be completed in readiness for reception of spar got out of spar of wreck of have be sent down long before by father winter carefully stored up for very purpose month saw spar shaped fitted ready to be put into place have be work of father aided in lifting turning over shifting generally by native bob winter busying meanwhile in manufacture of suit of sail from belonging to amazon rigging be not very trustworthy being manufactured for most part out of old rigging of wreck there have be good supply of new rope also on board a stand by have used in a far a must go in most important part decided to rig craft complete upon stock then launch tow down alongside wreck to take in ballast water tank store etc accordingly did finishing off everything even to bending of sail four month to day after water lily arrival saw caulked seam paid hull painted in short everything ready even to wedging up for launching volume two chapter ix treasure eventful day be unanimously agreed must be observed a strict holiday work except what be absolutely necessary beyond launch being permissible preparation have be completed day before of having worked like galley slave to achieve result a soon a became apparent that launching on day might be possible morning dawned fair serene sky be without cloud quivering leaf blade of grass glittered with diamond like dew drop air be laden with perfume of numberless flower nature appeared in fact to have arrayed in gala attire in honour of occasion bob winter be up by daybreak to dress schooner out with flag of old amazon in addition to brand new burgee red with white border name ada after sister in white letter floated gallantly in breeze from main topmast head need scarcely inform sagacious reader be work of ella skilful finder cutter flag be equally divided between tube boat craft being moored short distance apart in little bay gun have never be dismounted from time of fight with pirate boat be loaded with blank cartridge well rammed down muzzle plentifully greased to create louder report so that schooner might be honoured with salute a took water one of black be stationed on board water lily with instruction to pull trigger line directly saw schooner fairly in motion on way bottle of wine be also slung from schooner stem that ceremony of christening might not be shorn of usual rite occupied two mate until breakfast be ready when sat down to meal in most exuberant spirit a soon a be over proceeded to beach bob climbed on board craft took station forward in readiness to let go anchor a soon a have slid far enough off from land ella took up position under bow supported by father who instructed how to perform ceremony of christening after most approved fashion whilst winter stood by to knock away spur shore second native launched jumped into canoe to go alongside fetch bob ashore a soon a share of duty be performed when have taken station be everybody ready inquired father general ay ay be response ella took bottle of wine in hand winter poised hammer then knock away with will lad exclaimed skipper few lusty stroke brought shore down schooner began to move ella dashed bottle against craft bow exclaiming in clear silvery voice a wine dripped from stem god bless ada send success prosperity took off hat cheered lustily a schooner rushed down way plunged stern foremost into sparkling sea gun went off with sharp bang native gunner instantly with terrific yell sprang over side of cutter struck out for shore with vigour activity that fear must impart to movement schooner clove water smoothly easily a drove astern when once fairly afloat held way long enough to shoot far beyond consort at anchor in bay a soon a speed be sufficiently reduced bob let go anchor have satisfaction of seeing that floated lightly on perfectly even keel a soon a bob came on shore of course joined lent aid in admiring praising own handiwork a be pretty generally custom with mortal though be not so ingenuous in exhibition of actual feeling a be think have very good reason for admiration for craft be more than sightly be decidedly handsome who have put together be after must be remembered only unskilled amateur though think may without undue vanity say that be prime seaman knew perfectly well what constituted handsome wholesome craft be one thing to know quite to make work correspond accurately with idea when have admired schooner to heart content father wished to know whether one have proposal to make a to manner in remainder of day must be spent appeared from general silence ensued that one have on glancing at ella who remained beside noticed eager look in face a though must like to speak be restrained by feeling of timidity what be ella inquired if one have anything better to propose replied think picnic must be very nice must suggest that native be sent on by land with everything necessary to northern end of island opposite poor old amazon of be so soon to see last that rest of take harry tube boat sail in quite round island new comer have not seen very much of a yet stop at point have named of course cordially agreed to though must scarcely help smiling furtively at idea of picnic when life have be sort of continuous picnic affair ever since have be on island though be true pastime have consisted principally of pretty hard work however made remark returned to house proceeded to pack up necessary viand etc to start nigger a bob invariably termed black aid in proposed direction when everything be ready however be found that there be more than have conscience to ask poor fellow to carry willing a be so ella programme be so far departed from a to send by water in canoe instead of by land a soon a be fairly away shoved off in cutter canoe got on board tube boat hauled up grapnel made sail to southward here departure from programme took place for father be curious to see how so singular craft behaved in open water so a there be nice fresh breeze blowing sufficient sea on outside to give fair idea of quality worked out through channel a soon a reached sailed round island outside of everything first of resuming original plan a soon a came inside again father winter be much struck with smooth easy motion with took sea especially when going close hauled to windward short choppy head sea breeze have knocked up having not slightest perceptible retarding effect upon sharp gently swelling tube pierced combing sea absolutely without shock whereas boat of usual mould must have pitched jerked into half blinded wholly wet through with spray be quite a much surprised at stiffness for amount of heel be barely perceptible though be driving through under whole canvas whilst have be in water lily with proportionate amount of sail set must stiff a be have be lying down gunwale under so rapidly did skim along over water too that notwithstanding extra distance traversed beyond originally proposed be in ample time for meal luncheon dinner whichever chose to call be arranged must partake of picnic fashion in open air be delighted to observe that father winter keenly enjoyed short cruise outside be first time excepting when father came out to meet pilot in of have be outside reef that be now fairly at sea with staunch good sea boat under foot seemed earnest of easy escape almost more convincing than fact that vessel in that escape be planned to be made be now actually in water having made tour of island outside inside reef admired many beauty at length sat down to meal in high spirit with appetite enabled to do most ample justice to ella bounteous provision now appeared have be in progress whole of previous day in anticipation of such arrangement a have proposed have noticed unusual flutter in dear little girl manner more than once during morning a well a considerable imperfectly repressed excitement have said nothing to about attributing to have produced so much excitement of feeling among rest of namely important event of launch feeling of excitement still continued to animate strangely enough ella seemed least able of party to control appeared to have effect of agitating nerve considerably moreover seemed to be singularly preoccupied over something answering remark at random sometimes when be not addressed at then flushing up apologising confusedly when meal be over few bottle from small stock of carefully hoarded wine from amazon store be produced at ella especial request four men proceeded to regale assist digestion with fragrant weed chief topic of conversation be of course arrangement to be made for speedy departure from island be decided that on following day hand must employ in getting schooner ballasted provisioned watered be thought that by hard work might be done in readiness for departure at daybreak on succeeding morning father winter two black be to man schooner whilst ella bob be to continue in cutter be of course settled thing that be to keep company a long a be possible also decided upon certain rendezvous in case of being compelled by bad weather to part company at particular part of voyage rendezvous may a well mention be melbourne cape town saint helena saint antonio in cape de verd group madeira when topic seemed pretty well exhausted ella remarked nervously seems then harry that have quite given up idea of making further search for treasure island have not heard mentioned once for oh ever so long fear must think more of replied when story be first told to seemed easy matter to sail direct to spot fact that mistake have occurred somewhere with regard to position have quite thrown out to look for among numerous island constitute archipelago must be somewhat like searching for needle in bundle of hay chance of finding one other must be about equal must say if only held sufficient clue to warrant slightest hope of success must willingly prosecute search be quite sure that returned still very nervously tell story over again perhaps useful idea may suggest to one other of if be gone carefully over once more certainly will said if be only to gratify little one anticipate further result must know then ella gentleman that spaniard who told story be on death bed when confided to asserted that treasure ship lay buried in sandy beach of certain island here in pacific not only gave latitude longitude of island minutely described so that might recognise at once also described certain mark whereby might be able to fix upon exact spot in beach where buried treasure ship lay suppose have fixed upon mind kind of mental picture of island drawn from description given said ella presume be of opinion that must recognise island in moment if saw exactly so answered can see before at moment shutting eye a distinctly a possible there lie about three mile away with surf beating round there in bold relief against clear blue sky stand isolated clump of seven cocoa nut tree on extreme northernmost point of island somewhat like that be sitting under at moment interrupted ella excitedly ye e said certainly somewhat like be curious now never noticed until moment that tree be seven in number if now two of be marked in way somewhat like again interrupted ella a started to foot placed hand upon very perceptible scar in trunk of central tree sprang to foot a one man infinitely more excited even than ella be walked up to tree carefully examined mark there be mistake about bark have be deeply cut away with knife can not for life of say how be that have never attracted attention unless be that wound be now weather stained by mean so conspicuous a have pictured in mind perhaps be in great measure due too to fact that island be on though answering accurately to description given of treasure island be quite unlike picture imagination have conjured up now for other mark exclaimed be on one other of remaining six tree if really be here be again exclaimed ella darting to tree stood on edge of clump again pointing out mark very similar to first of nature of mark too there must be possible doubt seized half consumed stick from ember of expiring fire getting two marked tree in line walked away from keeping in one until saw just clear of tree bush on southern extremity of island small pinnacle of uncovered rock peering blackly out from among snowy glittering surf then drove stick held in hand deep into sandy beach exclaiming here lie buried treasure ship if there be truth in story will soon set question at rest exclaimed bob here two nigger jump into here canoe paddle down to cutter a quick a know how be off a'ter shovel a laid in for here very job explained turning to will be back ag'in in next to time whilst be gone sought obtained explanation from ella of manner in have made most important discovery seemed that have amused by wandering pretty nearly over island whilst be hard at work upon schooner in one of ramble attention have be attracted to very clump of tree number have impressed upon endeavouring to remember what be have heard dreamed connected with seven cocoa nut tree story of treasure have suddenly flashed across mind led of course to examination of tree discovery of mark upon on day one preceding launch of schooner seeing that be disposed to make launching day gala day decided to keep own counsel until arrival of day to let revelation of discovery be made at time a still further to increase reason for rejoicing upon resolution have be based plot for picnic be so delighted harry dear added in conclusion that be who have made discovery can not think what pleasure be to woman to contribute to happiness prosperity of man love beside there be satisfaction of knowing that if wealth have spoken of really lie buried here have doubt that doe will now be under necessity for following up profession must inevitably have involved long separation from be so happy dearest for think must have endured be deeply affected by frequent other evidence of warmth strength of ella attachment to of confiding frankness with revealed believe most conscientiously that greatest gratification derived from discovery of treasure arose from knowledge of extended power must bestow upon to contribute to happiness bob soon returned with couple of shovel springing ashore from canoe handed one to winter began at once to ply other most vigorously exclaiming a did so there be lad now fire away a hard a like there be only few foot of sand between gold enough to make fortin dozen time over so let rouse up have look at without more word two men worked with will soon stood in good sized hole about three foot deep whilst rest of looked on at labour with keenest interest at length winter shovel struck upon something hard announced fact with joyous shout bob however still continued working away without meeting with resistance few more stroke of winter shovel laid bare small patch of damp discoloured planking further proof if needed one of truth of story bob be still digging away a hard a ever presently ceased digging began shovelling loose sand off piece of deck something else have got down to be soon uncovered then saw that be piece of loose plank winter succeeded between in raising underneath lay dark hollow cavity to work went once more in short time three more loose plank be so far uncovered a to permit of being removed accomplished be found that have be so fortunate a to hit at first trial upon hole through spaniard have penetrated to innermost recess of ship creat deal of sand still remained to be cleared away however before must get at gold father be on point of relieving two mate when native who have looked on at operation with great deal of interest intelligence stepped forward said now work though have probably never seen shovel in life before be little awkward at first in handling of soon got into owing of did work a well a of others so kept on spell spell mate nigger party seeming willing that father must share in hard work in about hour half bob shovel suddenly struck sharply upon something harder than wood winter be working under influence of powerful excitement so be not long before have cleared away sand sufficiently to enable to lay hold of drag forth ingot black discoloured almost a rusty iron heavy enough to prove most satisfactorily that be not that metal be handed up at once proceeded to scrape away with strong clasp knife upon surface quickly establishing fact that be indeed precious metal considered sufficient for one day especially a have be agreed that must be holiday so with considerable difficulty at length persuaded two mate to come out of hole rest after violent exertion shortly afterwards good chattel be packed up put on board one of canoe in charge of two native remainder of party embarked in tube boat with gold thirteen ingot in have be brought to light sail be hoisted ran down to anchorage in bay with canoe in tow must be difficult to express satisfaction felt at important discovery to bob satisfaction be peculiarly great for have now accomplished most sanguine expectation have led to hope for in projecting adventurous voyage more indeed for a reader be aware when subject be first mooted have hope of finding father having quite given up a dead next day saw hard at work again not to dwell too long upon matter may be passed over briefly in three day have box of gem a much gold a considered must take schooner be ballasted with taking in a nearly a must calculate twenty ton precious metal be also substituted for lead ballast of cutter aperture in deck of buried ship be then carefully boarded over a before sand shovelled back into place to time wind be left work of completely eradicating remaining trace of labour craft be then fully provisioned watered abundant preparation having already be made on morning following completion of final arrangement craft made sail from island ada leading out through channel stood away to southward westward under stitch of canvas must draw soon found however that in moderate weather water lily must sail round round ada have to take in topsail haul down reef in mainsail to avoid running away from altogether be only when came to double reefed canvas that superior power told sufficiently to produce equality in speed seemed a though everything be to meet with in shape of adventure have befallen on first half of voyage for day after day passed by without anything to distinguish from others after quick pleasant run reached melbourne just in time to catch homeward bound mail to send hurried letter to sister acquainting with agreeable intelligence of double success here have opportunity of acquainting proper authority with circumstance connected with destruction of pirate brig of crew being imprisoned on island afterwards learned that cruiser have be despatched to spot that entire band be captured tried condemned upon mass of evidence be soon collected against hanged here also have happiness of being united to dear girl who have in so many way proved worthy of best strongest love a story excepting that part of related to finding of treasure have got wind sympathy kind feeling shewn towards by warm hearted colonist be such a to convert wedding day almost into day of public rejoicing ship without exception be dressed with flag there be long article in one of local paper headed thrilling romance of sea in story of ella rescue from wreck told with great affect remained at melbourne about week then made sail once more still with favourable wind fine weather until reached cape of good hope did in little more than month when encountered very strong breeze from southward eastward from be glad enough to take shelter behind fine breakwater in bay here again filled up provision water once more despatched letter home by time that have done what wanted gale be over lost time in making fresh start soon got into south east trade a happened to be blowing strong made best of did not attempt to stop at saint helena be fortunate again in crossing line getting little slant of wind carried handsomely across usually calm belt so try patience of homeward bound seaman at spot after remarkably fine passage of thirty nine day from table bay found at anchor in funchal road one of canoe of schooner carried on deck be got out father went ashore to post office where found a expected letter from sister in answer to ours from melbourne poor father be completely unmanned by warmth of affection breathed forth in sister letter to be scarcely le so at delight manifested at safety success warm sympathy with responded to timid message letter have conveyed to from unknown sister hurriedly got in stock of wine once more made sail after baffling passage of fortnight against head wind light air calm reached weymouth bay on most lovely evening in last week of june having accomplished voyage round world with delay in somewhat under eleven month moment that be at anchor one of canoe be got into water father ella be paddled ashore by two native who must now speak english tolerably well have accustomed to use of civilised clothing bob winter remaining on board respective craft night to take care of landed at flight of step at pier end made best of way at once to aunt house sister be there eagerly expecting for appeared that have be on esplanade listening to strain of regimental band have recognised water lily a drew in towards anchorage will pas over in silence rapturous meeting ensued for feeling of be of too deep sacred character for so inexperienced pen a mine to deal with suffice to say that enjoyed on evening one of short season of perfect unalloyed happiness be occasionally permitted even here on earth little now remains to be told succeeded after vast amount of hard work difficulty in turning gold into cash proceeds be equally divided among five white result being a suppose need hardly say magnificent fortune to winter like honest fellow that be immediately married girl who have consented to share uncertain fortune a seaman two black attached a matter of course to father establishment a for bob asserted roundly that gold must be of use value to if turned adrift so became need scarcely say with hearty good will fixture in establishment whole thought be now set on being made sailing
