be hair breadth escape from very dangerous situation collingwood be superb writer with magnificent power of description so be very nice book to read listen to through veld forest by harry collingwood chapter one vague hint of possible trouble blazing midsummer sun of south africa have sunk to within hand breadth of ridge of southern spur of tandjes berg softly outlined in blue forty mile distant on western horizon when edward laurence having taken long afternoon ride round farm to assure that sheep be being properly looked after arrived within mile of home long white one storey thatched house picturesquely perched yonder on mound formed one of southern spur of great winter berg house together with farm of two thousand five hundred sixty acre be known a bella vista be property of father henry laurence ex colonel of th king own regiment of dragoon guard have purchased fifteen year prior to date upon story open having be so severely wounded during battle of waterloo a to necessitate retirement from army retirement of course left without occupation a be then still quite young man being only thirty three year of age a soon a have recovered from wound so far a recovery then seemed possible began to cast about for something to do be at juncture that made acquaintance of miss violet mckinnon lovely daughter of impecunious scottish laird fell desperately in love with a father happened to be strikingly handsome attractive man affection be speedily returned marriage quickly followed to marry under such circumstance be perhaps something of imprudence for father have nothing pension while bride sixteen year junior have nothing trousseau pair turned deaf ear to advice remonstrance with result just mentioned when of course became more imperatively necessary than ever for ex colonel to discover mean of earning living especially a be born within year of date of marriage state of health demanded that occupation chosen must enable to live outdoor life farming at once naturally suggested then in nick of time made acquaintance of mr william arbuckle friend of father in law south african sheep farmer home for holiday man strongly urged to emigrate to south africa take up sheep farming idea powerfully appealed to father from very first upshot be that after due enquiry into detail parent took decisive step father having commuted pension sailed for south africa of course taking with event occurred early in year arbuckle returned to south africa in ship took out at urgent invitation became guest for short time upon arrival at cape warm hearted scotchman kindness did not end there instituted enquiry eventually learned that certain small farm known a rooikop in albany district be for sale dutchman who owned being averse to british rule intending to move up country beyond border of colony farm arbuckle father visited together with result upon urgent advice of friend ex colonel purchased just a stood house stock implement complete did not buy furniture having brought out from england that required also dutchman needed to take up country with to spot where might ultimately establish new home thus party be equally satisfied first thing that father did after entering into possession be to change name of farm from rooikop to bella vista on account of magnificent prospect obtainable from stoep of house faced due south consequently be in grateful shadow day building stood on kopje hill rising out of one of lower spur of great winter berg range of mountain bald summit of towered into rich blue of south african sky seven mile in rear of house rugged slope bush clad for two third of height on left toward east other spur of range gradually lost in wide expanse of gently rolling bush clad plateau extending beyond blue distance to sea one hundred eighty mile away where great kei river discharge into indian ocean similar prospect stretched in front of house ground growing more rugged toward right a spectator gaze swept westward until looking due west from house one perceived in immediate foreground moderately steep declivity running down to spruit small stream having rise high up toward summit of mountain discharging into great fish river seven mile distant on far side of spruit country be flat enough to enable one to catch glimpse here there of great fish river winding southward through plain in extreme distance soft blue mass of tandjes berg spur on hither side of white house of somerset twenty eight mile away might sometimes be seen on clear morning when sun shone strongly upon such very feebly sketchily described be splendid prospect visible from stoep of house a first knew passage of year effected little change save gradual disappearance of nearer clump of bush a father caused to be cleared away in order to furnish additional grazing ground for steadily increasing flock of sheep herd of cattle occasional appearance of new house somewhere in distance a neighbour gradually began to gather in vicinity greatest change of however be that occasioned by erection of own new house for a time went on father health improved so greatly that became a strong robust a ever with promise of ripe old age before moreover began to make money rapidly a flock herd increased a money came in so view with regard to comfort of home life expanded house standing on property when father purchased consisted of sitkammer general sitting room used for day purpose three bedroom amount of accommodation served purpose well enough for first five year of residence upon farm by time father have made very considerable sum of money by annual sale of wool hide one of theory be that money be useful merely a mean by life might be made more comfortable enjoyable therefore planned new much more commodious house built of stone quarried from mountain side within quarter of mile of chosen site filled with new handsome furniture picture piano for mother imported from england at great expense laid out beautiful garden of about five acre in extent round house converting place into perfect miniature paradise also time have arrived when education must be thought of a at period there be school of importance nearer than cape town mother objected to being sent so far away being only child father decided to secure service of private tutor in due time mr john nesbitt cambridge man very fine fellow in respect became member of household to hold indebted for most excellent education for many other thing beside continued education until attained age of fifteen year after remained on a sort of general factotum to father while devoted to management of farm relieving father of hard work so leaving free to enjoy in own way such briefly stated be general condition of affair at bella vista on afternoon referred to at beginning of chapter on day by way attained to age of seventeen year except after building furnishing new house father regularly employed surplus cash in extending area of property improving flock herd by frequent purchase of valuable animal for breeding purpose a have said on afternoon mark opening of remarkable story have arrived within mile of gate in stout picket fence surrounded garden a protection against invasion of predatory animal when horse prince suddenly pricked up ear looking away to eastward whinnied while at same moment rhythmical beat of cantering hoof came softly to ear from considerable distance floating on gentle almost imperceptible easterly zephyr happened to be breathing at moment aroused thus from day dream into have fallen glanced up looking in direction of sound became aware of small cloud of dust gleaming yellow in afternoon sun about mile away to eastward in midst of appeared two mounted figure even at distance identified without difficulty a mr lestrange next door neighbour at fourteen mile away eleven year old daughter nell must have seen recognised at same moment for few second later shout from mr lestrange reached turning prince head in direction pressing unarmed heel gently to side cantered off to meet three four minute later came together reining up a wheeled horse alongside proceeded toward bella vista at walking pace a horse be sweating be desirable that must be allowed to cool off little before being stabled many happy return of day ned exclaimed nell with bright smile a shook hand with see have not forgotten that to day be birthday here be birthday present to handing small parcel neatly tied up in paper also wish many happy return ned remarked mr lestrange reaching across in front of daughter to shake hand with have brought present however so must take will for deed accept nell present a coming from jointly young minx have be working at like trojan for last fortnight so a reward for extraordinary industry have allowed to ride over present be pair of berlin wool slipper made after pattern of old one nell surreptitiously begged from mother when be last at bella vista that reminds to enquire how be at house quite well hope yes thank quite well replied need to ask how nell be can see for that there be nothing matter with of will be tremendously glad at home to see have not have single visitor since last came how long ago be must be quite six week more than answered mr lestrange be two month ago to day by almanac believe have grown since then continued eyeing over how tall be did think of measuring morning to see how tall be at seventeen year of age laughed pater did according to stand just six foot quarter of inch in stocking ay dare say do said although scarcely look be so broad across shoulder what will be when be twenty one be almost afraid to think of replied rather ruefully ride within four pound of thirteen stone now if go on at rate until be twenty one will not be able to find horse fit to carry will have to get colonel to breed one specially for remarked lestrange with loud laugh by way continued talking of horse wonder if happen to have anything must do for nell punch there be getting old little groggy in fore leg came down with other day child have rather nasty spill will not let ride longer than can help have nothing on place suitable for go in much for breeding horse know concurred know have very thing for two year old filly unbroken thoroughbred with making of splendid horse in if care to ride down to vley will show to wo take much more than mile out of way must like nell to have mr lestrange agreeing forthwith made off toward flat where horse be turned out to graze presently have caught filly be very gentle creature quite pet of mine led up by long forelock for inspection be bright bay with very long dark mane tail of course very ragged looking a to coat never having be groomed in life did not matter point be quite unmistakable mr lestrange to say nothing of nell fell in love with on spot then when visitor have done admiring animal turned horse head rode toward house on broad veranda covered stoep of must see father mother latter waving handkerchief by way of welcome to mr lestrange nell quarter of hour later have dismounted at foot of broad flight of step leading up to stoep father mother have descended in order to extend greeting to visitor boy be leading horse away to stable at back usual interchange of greeting having passed learned that mr lestrange daughter have come prepared to pas night with when guest have be taken to room have refreshed after journey gathered on spacious front stoep chatted until dinner be served subject of conversation be naturally rather limited isolated a be in what be then practically wilderness where sometimes happened that several week elapsed between departure of one visitor arrival of like father mr lestrange have devoted to sheep farming conversation therefore turned chiefly upon most approved method of dealing with several disease to sheep be subject best dip to use how to determine precise moment for shearing to secure best quality of wool so on seemed to that through mr lestrange mind be dwelling upon something else something that be anxious to speak about a soon a favourable opportunity must arrive opportunity however did not occur until after mother nell have retired for night for laurences happened to be enthusiast in matter of music mother be not only brilliant pianiste also sang exceedingly well father possessed chamber organ nesbitt owned very sweet toned violin from must extract most wonderful music lastly have learned to tootle fairly well upon flute therefore whenever have visitor be generally required to organise impromptu concert for benefit a be case on evening in question at length instrument fell silent mother nell bade good night retired to room table under veranda having be set out with decanter glass cigar tobacco male adjourned to front stoep for final gossip before separating then be that mr lestrange found opportunity to broach matter a conjectured have be occupying thought evening having mixed glass of grog lighted pipe drew chair close up to one occupied by father lowering voice to confidential tone said look here laurence real reason why rode over here afternoon be not personally to congratulate ned upon occurrence of birthday to ask how happen to be off for ammunition have be wondering whether must spare little well said father think can let have little though not very much for own stock be growing rather low how much do want must let have say twenty pound of powder began lestrange twenty pound ejaculated father in surprise no that certainly can not for think have more than half that quantity altogether dare say can let have four five pound to tide over until can replenish stock if will be of use to thanks very much answered lestrange must not be enough moreover must be depriving must see if can not somehow arrange to send in to port elizabeth for supply nuisance of be have nobody about place whom can trust upon errand oh a to that interrupted father if be so hard up a ned will go in get for be not very busy here just now trip to port elizabeth will do harm why do require large quantity be contemplating up country jaunt what be in wind answered lestrange be certainly not contemplating up country expedition of sort a to what be in wind know very much wish did during last month have heard thing two with regard to native make feel just trifle uneasy thought ought to mention matter to if have not already reached ear said father have heard nothing here what be well said lestrange have heard nothing very definite thus far only enough in fact to render somewhat uneasy just vague hint more than anything else know have be putting two two together therefrom deduce fact that native be growing bit restive at steadily increasing number of white who be coming into country father interrupted with loud laugh be that dear chap exclaimed why have be like ever since came here sixteen year ago there be rumour then that native intended to rise drive into sea nothing have ever come of excepting occasional small raid upon outlying farm driving off of few sheep cattle surely have be here long enough to know that mysterious hint rumour must not be taken seriously yes have returned lestrange to mind thing look bit different just now from what have heard gather that there be somebody whether white man native can not make out look rather like white man who be going round among native urging various tribe to combine together for purpose of attacking exterminating white forthwith pointing out that unless be very speedily done white will get such footing in country that will be impossible to drive out with result that native will be robbed of land driven into interior to perish on point of spear of powerful ferocious zulu now be exceedingly dangerous doctrine to preach to such ignorant credulous folk a be tembu pondos griquas more so since there be soupcon of truth in a be evidenced by increasing number of dutch who be pressing over border in order to escape from british rule time be really inclined to believe that agitation may lead to more le unpleasant consequence not mind that think disturbance be at likely to reach a far a here still one never know be wise to be prepared for worst be reason why be anxious to replenish stock of ammunition a quickly a possible yes quite so agreed father continued who what be authority for statement that somebody possibly white man be endeavouring to stir up native against for own part can scarcely credit such thing a possible why assuming for moment thing to be true fellow must be in direst peril for native must hardly be expected to discriminate in favour must be just a likely to be wiped out in convulsion a of think not said lestrange for take that if such man exists be schelm devoid of kith kin fully prepared to throw in lot with kafir in hope of living safe easy life with possibly may have notion that can persuade to make chief if must succeed in bringing off successful rising against white a to authority well one of totties man named klaas who be rather intelligent fellow have overheard good deal of mysterious talk among boy of late have repeated to although nothing have be said of absolutely definite character remark have repeated certainly seem to point pretty conclusively to fact that something be really brewing moreover in opinion be most sinister indication of native boy be going back home upon one pretext h ejaculated father now be coming to something definite how long have be going on oh not very long only within last few day answered lestrange within time more than half of have gone be mostly pondos griquas by jove pater there may be something in after exclaimed boy be mostly totties a know have have few griquas about dozen until within last few day now be gone two three of without waiting to get pay did not think very much of however for have done same thing before in light of what mr lestrange have just told certainly look bit suspicious yes certainly doe agreed father although after there may really be nothing in at same time will be well to be prepared therefore to morrow will take wagon make errand to port elizabeth believe of store be running rather low so there ought to be difficulty in arranging for trip without unnecessarily alarming mother can complete back load by bringing a much powder lead a wagon will conveniently carry have doubt that friend lestrange here will willingly take half of what bring ay will be glad to get answered lestrange if will take advice ned will not loiter unduly on way if rising be really meditated may occur at moment although believe be exactly what may call imminent be so think must have heard little more about still there be nothing like being prepared in good time in case like be better to be couple of month too early than day too late so be arranged for next half hour be busy discussing question of what precisely must bring out with preparing detailed list of various requirement for wagon journey to port elizabeth be trifling matter distance across veld by road being about one hundred seventy mile occupying best part of nine day way by time that have finished be past midnight went to bed slept soundly for to be quite truthful have very profound belief in threatened rising despite ominous departure of griquas such thing have happened before be constantly happening in fact nothing ever came of although more le alarming rumour be continually arising nobody quite knew how a matter of fact felt quite easy in mind about for be confident that even must rising take place must be suppressed very promptly in case did not believe for moment that savage must dare to penetrate so far into colony a bella vista even a far a triannon while scare trifling unfounded a believed to be afforded excellent excuse for trip to port elizabeth town have not visited for more than six month father having accompanied wagon on previous journey also justified in determination to purchase new rifle one of very newest most up to date weapon must possibly procure rifle have be using for previous six year being flintlock affair worn out at on following morning be astir at even earlier hour than usual for trek ox not having be worked for time be anxious to make good start get well on way before heat of day set in mother expressed surprise at apparently hurried character of expedition when be explained that mr lestrange have run out of ammunition while own stock be running low be at once satisfied for at time hunting be practically only amusement open to farmer be also imperatively necessary that must be amply provided with mean to check increase of more predatory animal in neighbourhood of farm also mother being good housewife be far more inclined to avail herself of opportunity afforded by trip to provide with ample stock of such thing a must only be procured at port elizabeth than be to search curiously for deeper motive for trip than one father have given wagon with light load of skin horn got away early in charge of jan hottentot driver then sat down to breakfast a merry jovial party probably a in south africa that day much of amusement arising from fact that mother nell be continually thinking of fresh commission be to be sure to execute for before leaving port elizabeth pair of keeping so busy jotting down instruction in notebook must scarcely find time to eat drink at length merry meal came to end rose from table adjourned to stoep before piet after rider be walking horse to fro with thunder juno two big hound always accompanied everywhere trailing at heel whining with impatience to be off arrived there commission two be remembered have to be jotted down upon father laughingly exclaimed a finally closed notebook slipped into pocket there will do ned now have better mount ride will not get away at to day goodbye boy remember very kindly to mr henderson such other friend a may see at bay forget new rifle last sally produced quite explosion of laughter at expense for have announced determination to treat to best weapon must find enthusiasm with have dwelt upon achievement must be in power when came into possession rendered most unlikely thing in world must forget to purchase joining in laugh shook hand with mr lestrange nesbitt father kissed nell mother ran light heartedly down step swung into saddle with final farewell wave of hand cantered off down broad path leading to gate with dog bounding along ahead piet mounted upon sturdy grey gelding bringing up rear be glorious morning such a think one never find anywhere in south africa sky overhead deep rich cloudless blue shading away on side to soft warm delicate almost colourless grey at horizon air already warming beneath ardent ray of sun clear pellucid a crystal a invigorating a champagne with fresh clean smell of dew saturated vegetation around on hand stretched brilliant sun kissed picture of rugged mountain slope scored deeply by storm of age deep kloofs precipitous of side shaggy with vesture of dense bush mysterious with broad mass of dark shadow rolling upland dotted here there with clump of timber bush with grazing flock of sheep herd of cattle horse sweeping gently down toward wide stretching bush clad plain through wound tiny spruits like thread of silver hurrying to lose in broader water of great fish river riding at easy canter track across veld being very gentle downward slope way overtook wagon at distance of about six mile from house when dismounting took rifle from sling under wagon tent loaded slung powder horn over shoulder slipped few wad bullet into pocket then accompanied by two dog walked on ahead of wagon toward first outspanning place horse prince following a have be trained to do with bridle hanging loose upon neck have of course ample supply of provision in wagon including shoulder of sheep have be slaughtered that morning mutton naturally formed staple of fare at bella vista when there be buck meat in house be very heartily tired of be therefore on lookout for pauw koraan great small bustard of south africa hoped to get one in time to have cooked for luncheon instead of shoulder of mutton presently when have got about mile ahead of wagon suddenly caught sight of fine koraan on ground about three hundred yard to right front a emerged from behind big clump of melkboem feeding busily bird instantly sighted pausing fraction of second to look straight at took to flight making air throb with harsh discordant cry of alarm a did so be long shot for old rifle be only sighted up to one hundred yard have used piece for six year knew to nicety what must do moreover be now old man may therefore perhaps venture to speak simple truth without being suspected of boasting seem to have be endowed from earliest year with gift of straight shooting be just knack suppose seemed to be able to judge distance accurately by intuition to allow correct elevation windage under most diversified condition so very rarely made use of sight on rifle did ever need to aim consciously just flung weapon to shoulder keeping eye meanwhile upon mark pressed trigger at precisely right instant down dropped quarry have in fact by long practice become dead shot must scarcely remember when have last failed to bring down what aimed at did fail now a bird rose flew straight away from be still uttering alarm cry when pressed trigger down fell stone dead shot clean through body at whip like crack of rifle two dog dashed forward into thick clump of low milk bush into bird have fallen presently reappeared thunder dragging bird along ground by one of leg while juno romped round uttering low sharp yell of delight varied by sudden dash of pretended threat to snatch koraan away from chapter two tragic homecoming in due time first outspan be reached wide vley with small spruit meandering lazily through plenty of rich grass for ox here halt be called for couple of hour during hottest part of day then on again to next outspan be reached about hour before sunset here aversion to mutton again asserted while boy watered ox built camp fire generally made preparation for coming night took rifle accompanied a usual by two dog by piet carrying double barrelled bore shot gun sauntered off in search of something acceptable for supper spot where have outspanned for night be one usually chose a termination of second stage of journey when going to port elizabeth be extensive flat dotted here there with big clump of bush with wide willow depression in ground about mile distant from wagon into same spruit alongside have outspanned at midday found way widened out into broad willow reed bordered sheet of water much frequented by wild duck widgeon goose also favourite drinking place of game haunting immediate neighbourhood felt pretty certain therefore of getting shot at something by ambushing among reed to spot accordingly made way a happened arrived in very nick of time for have scarcely taken up position among reed in situation enabled to command view of good wide stretch of water when saw faint smudge against clear sky southward rapidly resolved into big flight of wild duck heading directly for end of pond near where be ambushed have only time to pas rifle to piet receive from shot gun in exchange when with much quacking flight wheeled proceeded to settle down upon surface of water a did so raised weapon aiming into brown pressed trigger one immediately after other with result that five of duck dropped dead while half dozen fell wounded whole being promptly retrieved by piet dog who dashed into willow water brought ashore eleven bird constituted ample supply for immediate requirement for supper night for breakfast next morning a made point of never destroying wild thing except a matter of necessity forthwith returned to wagon proceeded to pluck prepare a many of duck a needed for supper afterward roasting over camp fire by time meal be ready for consumption soft velvet darkness of south african starlit night have fallen ate meal to accompaniment of usual night sound of veld where water happens to be near soft subdued quacking of drowsy waterfowl occasional honk of belated goose stealthy splashing of buck wading warily into deeper cleaner water clear of rush before venturing to drink mysterious rustling among reed distant call of buck to other in bush sharp bark of jackal blood curdling laugh of prowling hyena occasional roar of leopard whole dominated by incessant noise of million of frog continuous chirr of many more million of insect slept night on cartel be light hardwood frame closely strung lengthwise across with rimpi thin strip of hide slung to framework of interior of wagon under tent serf a bedstead upon if furnished with mattress pillow pair of blanket a in own case be possible to enjoy perfect night rest next morning be astir with dawn while boy prepared breakfast made way down to spruit bathed with dog for company got back to wagon just in good time for first meal of day with appetite to keen edge have be put by fresh clean air of open veld then immediately after breakfast ox be inspanned pushing forward little more rapidly than on first day forded great fish river shortly after noon before outspanning for midday halt in fashion then journeyed day after day quietly uneventfully toward port elizabeth where arrived without mishap during afternoon of ninth day after leaving bella vista leaving wagon outspanned on outskirt of town rode in called in first instance upon certain mr henderson who be friend of ours from received a fully expected very cordial invitation to make house home during period of sojourn in town following day be busy day with for have great many commission to execute by arranging systematically contrived to wipe whole of off list before store closed including even purchase of new rifle have promised be very expensive beautiful weapon very light compared with old rifle for weighed complete including shoulder strap le than six pound have plain blue cylindrical barrel gauged to take half inch spherical bullet with three drachm of powder be fitted with nipple for percussion cap provided with fixed sight for range of one hundred yard two flap sight for two hundred five hundred yard respectively latter being regarded in day a exceptionally long range also with normal pull upon trigger of six ounce be fitted with ingenious arrangement by pressing small lever converted into hair trigger lastly bore name of certain famous london maker alone be guarantee of excellence storekeeper from whom bought have other gun by same maker finally tempted to buy very beautiful double barrel sporting gun a present for father right hand barrel being number smooth bore while left barrel be rifled piece also being fitted for use with percussion cap next day be eleventh day from that of departure from bella vista immediately after breakfast rode out to wagon gave order to inspan accompanied into town where having unloaded hide horn have disposed of at very good price proceeded to load up powder lead other thing have be charged to procure left port elizabeth again on return journey about mid afternoon trekking distance of ten mile on homeward way before outspanning for night of course be on fire for opportunity to try new rifle chance came that same afternoon for when about six mile out from port elizabeth met boer who be trekking in from uitenhage who informed that about mile back have be obliged to abandon one of ox in dying condition sure enough quarter of hour later saw poor beast lying by side of road with aasvogels vulture already gathered about round dozen more be squatted on ground in circle round dying ox while others mere speck in deep blue sky be winging way to from quarter method of new arrival be to maintain lofty flight until arrived immediately above destined prey then must begin to circle slowly downward in wide spiral finally hovering for three four second at height of about twenty yard before awkwardly settling upon ground be chance aasvogel more le in south africa mattered nothing there be plenty of to spare be such disgusting creature have compunction at about abandoning usual rule shooting one two of merely in order to test new weapon very good test afforded too for although downward sailing upon outstretched motionless wing be perfectly steady movement be rather deceptive a to speed movement being circling one be necessary to fire at exactly right instant range must be wrong miss must result decided to begin test by firing at descending vulture at what be supposed to be extreme range of accuracy of weapon namely five hundred yard a be good long distance quite far enough to enable bird to swerve at flash so cause to miss came to conclusion that right thing to do must be to allow vulture to sweep past until be flying away from then pull trigger accordingly loaded piece threw up five hundred yard sight then walked forward choosing particular bird a did so following with eye until judged to be at right distance position then flung up rifle pressed firmly to shoulder covered vulture with sight fired next second saw feather fly great wing flapped once convulsively a smack of bullet reached ear bird turned complete somersault in air fell to ground stone dead to accompaniment of loud shout of wonder admiration from totties needle to say be vastly proud of achievement for be far away longest shot have ever attempted instead of being satisfied with success must need attempt something still more difficult flapping down back sight entirely dispensing with use reloaded weapon determined to rely upon eye judgment alone in other word upon faculty by constant use have become sort of instinct with accordingly selected a mark vulture have be in act of descending apparently alarmed at unusual manner in predecessor have accomplished last part of descent be now wheeling slowly round at height of a estimated fully eight hundred yard above earth training rifle upon followed movement of bird until have wheeled away from when carefully judging amount of elevation required pressed trigger be delighted next moment again to see feather fly to note convulsive stroke of great pinion indicated hit to see ponderous bulk of bird come hurtling earthward be magnificent shot felt be justified in admitting that much to satisfied that even now at beginning of acquaintance with new rifle be a much master of a be of old one must rely upon a implicitly felt that have need to test capability further once more loaded walking to where dying ox be lying with circle of vulture closing in around put foul bird to flight with many croak of protest from at interference placed muzzle of weapon at ear of ox pulled trigger put poor beast out of misery besides saving from possibility of attack by ravenous bird before breath have entirely left body three mile farther on outspanned for night return journey until last stage be a uneventful a outward one have be for first three day met on average half dozen wagon day trekking to port elizabeth from various farm in outlying district after became le numerous after fifth day met more did call at farm at length from bay be few far between although occasionally sighted one in distance to right left of track be following on twentieth day after departure from bella vista about hour after have inspanned for day trek be to end with arrival home shortly before sunset a topped slight rise kopje hill upon house stood swung into view for first time since have lost sight of three week earlier be still at distance with house turning shadowed face to must not distinguish with naked eye happened that upon particular occasion have forgotten to put into voorkissie wagon chest upon driver generally sits telescope usually carried with upon such excursion nevertheless knew that people must be expecting return on day therefore when outspanned about midday instead of lighting only one fire for purpose of cooking midday meal caused three to be lighted at distance of about one hundred foot apart be usual method of advertising impending arrival feeling sure that somebody about house must be on lookout must see three spark of flame column of smoke being by time within ten mile of place at distance be generally able in clear weather to distinguish long white front wall of house standing out against purple shadow of great winter berg range on occasion must not although day be a fine air a clear a usual at time of year yet strangely enough circumstance did not strike a being in least peculiar significant although piet after rider made passing reference to later on in afternoon however when have again inspanned have be trekking for about hour began to dawn upon that thing be not quite a usual at bella vista in first place of flock herd must have be grazing somewhere on plain foothill ahead not horn hoof be to be seen also house looked different have appearance of being not a high a usual must not see grey thatch of roof wall instead of being pure white a have be when last saw be white only in comparatively small patch remainder being brown in place black by time have approached close enough to distinguish a much a that came to conclusion that knew what have happened saddled mounted horse followed a usual by two dog rode forward at hand gallop to investigate there have undoubtedly be conflagration have destroyed house father mother with house boy have in probability gone over to triannon whither doubt stock have also be driven still thought rather strange that have not dispatched boy to meet explain what have happened whither have gone at least left one about place to afford full information on arrival finally concluded that have done latter that lazy rascal be in hut fast asleep instead of keeping watch for a ought to have be doing last thought caused to look particularly for hut then understood thing have be puzzling hut no longer existed seriously alarmed now for destruction of house by fire by mean necessarily involved destruction of hut have stood about quarter of mile from former pressed heel into prince flank urged up rise at best speed fear born of lestrange news on night when have ridden over to borrow ammunition at last gripping heart lest what have then apprehended a just very remote possibility might have actually come to pas a at length drew near enough to observe that massive gate in high fence surrounded extensive garden be off hinge lying flat on ground just inside opening fear increased be still further strengthened when a rode through opening whiff of tainted air like odour of carrion reached nostril then a glanced about with eye prepared to behold knew not what of horror perceived that many of ornamental flowering shrub on side of path leading to house be beaten down withered a though stampeding cattle host of men have swept over while far up pathway even upon stoep of house multitude of aasvogels be squatted motionless apparently gorged while others be waddling slowly heavily to fro dozen pace farther on prince suddenly shied so violently that almost unseated a loud flapping of wing great croaking arose on right fifteen of obscene bird rose heavily into air winged way hundred yard so farther up garden before again settling pathway be bordered from house to gateway with hedge of flowering shrub backed on side by row of peach tree be impossible for to see from path what lay beyond peach tree therefore dismounted throwing rein to ground so prince might not walk away to stable forced way through hedge row of peach tree into more open part of garden there beheld what be by time fully prepared to see what be nevertheless sight revolting beyond possibility of description will not enter into unnecessary detail will simply say that scattered about here there over part of garden lay disfigured remains of sixty seventy tembu warrior be easily identifiable by shape of shield spear general character of war equipment who have evidently be shot down during most determined pertinacious attack upon house other half of front portion of garden presented similar sight whole bearing mute indubitable testimony not only to implacable determination of savage also to resolution of defender yes worst have happened house have be attacked finally destroyed notwithstanding desperate nature of defence put up by inmate now mother father good old jack nesbitt where be to discover answer to momentous question be next task how will find word to describe passion of grief apprehension with set about must go undescribed for there be certain emotion of human heart mind mere word be powerless to portray perhaps be well that must be case for one who have not passed through such experience a mine must possibly understand what endured a made slow way toward ruined house subconsciously noting a went evidence met on hand of protracted stubborn implacability of attack resolute unyielding character of defence savage have indeed succeeded at what cost a made way up through shamble of wrecked garden acquired new impression of invincible courage of south african native have never since have occasion to modify in face of such evidence of deadly resolution on part of combatant on side a beheld round felt that be hopeless to dream of possibility that inmate of house have made good escape at last moment for clearly building have be completely surrounded attack simultaneously delivered on side question be have finally met death on point of enemy spear have fallen alive into enemy hand shuddered with greater horror than ever a latter possibility occurred to for have not lived nearly sixteen year in south africa without hearing something of unspeakable barbarity inflicted by savage upon unhappy being who chanced to be taken alive in battle by better thousand time ay ten thousand time that dear one must perish quickly in heat excitement of fight than that must survive to be carried off to suffer put thought from for felt must go mad if permitted mind to dwell upon yet thrust persistently upon again again a

have happened father have evidently not be taken entirely by surprise there must not have be so many dead savage lying around house have probably obtained inkling of what be toward in time to put building into sort of state of defence possibly have found time to barricade door window from general aspect of thing outside surmised that have somehow contrived to get dozen more of totties into house to assist in defence attack have probably occurred about two three o'clock in morning when white might be expected to be sound asleep from appearance of slain believed that have taken place about thirty six hour before arrival on scene in case attack be unwisely planned from native point of view for be about time of full moon south african night with full moon riding high in sky be almost literally a light a day defender being doubtless on qui vive must perceive first stealthy approach of savage at once open fire upon knew enough about father nesbitt marksmanship to feel assured that time pressed trigger enemy must fall even deadly skill with rifle must not account for many body lying round house thus be brought to conclusion that of totties armed with shot gun loaded with looper slug must have assisted in defence time after time enemy must have charged toward house time after time must have be driven back from stout stone wall barricaded door window by withering volley of lead poured into at close range weak point of bella vista be thatched roof be universal form of covering to farmhouse at day on account of coolness be however easily capable of being set fire to in

remained setting roof on fire then a house be only one storey building must quickly fill with smoke inmate must be faced with alternative of suffocating being burnt to death beneath blazing roof when must fall in yielding to tender mercy of ferocious tembu thought knew of alternative father must choose provided of course that survived long enough to avail of choice did be question merciful heaven if did not what have become of mother frenzied at thought of what fate might be if have fallen alive into hand of savage dashed up front step to stoep clubbing rifle striking out right left at gorged

point where passage leading from rear entrance of building opened upon hall body near front doorway identified a of nesbitt by watch be lying close beside noticed have stopped at twenty three minute after six while other body be quite unrecognisable there be nothing to show how of men have died leaving hall entered dining room moment did so became apparent that have arrived upon scene of last stand of little garrison where final phase of stubborn protracted attack defence have be fought out for room be in terrible state of confusion scattered remains of heavy furniture showing that savage have actually succeeded in forcing barricade gaining entrance evidence being confirmed by presence of nine tembu corps piled up in window opening within arm length of lay corpse that of father still grasping in right hand trusty cavalry sabre have served so well in campaigning day while left held pistol three tembu spearhead in body one of have evidently passed through heart told how have died

house have died of suffocation nowhere in dining room have savage ever succeeded in gaining even temporary footing while general appearance of ruin showed that have not entered after flame have died out indeed doubted whether have even deferred departure until then for must have known at last that nothing must possibly have survived in furnace of flame with white slain house ablaze there be reason why must desire to enter for fire must effectually destroy everything in shape of plunder have driven off whole of live stock that alone must have satisfied know how long remained on knee beside corpse of mother in fire seared bloodstained dining room plunged into very stupor of grief remember be at length aroused by distant sound of cracking whip scream of jan hottentot driver to ox announcing approach of wagon looking about discovered that sun have already set that darkness be fast closing down upon scene then rose to foot leaving ruined house made way down path to where prince still stood patiently awaiting return with dog thunder juno crouching upon ground before flinging bridle over head climbed into saddle rode slowly forth to meet wagon came to at distance of about mile from broken down gate at garden entrance ordered others to outspan where be water ox turn loose to graze then briefly acquainted driver piet after rider with what have happened strictly forbade former to go up to house though there be little need for for doubt whether anything must have induced fellow to go near place after ordered piet to accompany a be intention to ride on to mr lestrange place to see whether have escaped similar visitation if so to beg shelter for night presence help on following day while performed last sad office for beloved dead be now old man for age already exceeds limit allotted by psalmist a length of man life memory of night ride heart breaking burden of grief a stared out unseeingly upon fast darkening landscape allowing prince to find own way travel own pace while dwelt upon harrowing scene have so recently beheld began to realise full extent of irreparable loss will never leave be a fresh to day a be at moment so know will continue to be until die yet keenly a suffered frequently found wondering why did not suffer still more keenly for after have progressed mile two on way sky to eastward brightened presently moon two day past full sailed up over far distant horizon flooding scene with mystic radiance unknowingly reined up to gaze upon entrancing scene yes even at moment with dry sob bursting from aching bosom with dead mother face floating before eye lovely feature placid smiling in death a have beheld only one short hour before with figure of dead father lying outstretched among ash of ruined home body pierced with spear of enemy weapon still tightly grasped in clenched hand sightless eye still glaring defiance at foe must pause to gaze upon beauty of south african moonrise must not understand then be surprised horrified at what stigmatised a callous heartlessness know now that merciful providence have so ordered matter that when human suffering whether mental physical reach certain degree of acuteness partial insensibility set in have known case where men have slept while being subjected to most awful torture such be undoubtedly case with on memorable night sensibility have become so benumbed that have partially lost control of mental process thought broke away at interval to dwell for few moment upon entirely trivial matter one must have supposed must not possibly have have slightest interest for under circumstance yet so be in curious detached semi conscious frame of mind covered fourteen mile of veld lay between bella vista triannon most of at walking pace coming in sight of house about nine o'clock at night chapter three major henderson becomes confidential advisory house at triannon built in sort of elbow formed by one of spur of great winter berg be not visible from direction in approached until one have rounded kopje concealing when one found close upon a drew near to destination became aware of deep ominous silence pervading scene caused to entertain most gloomy foreboding true hour be rather late according to notion of lateness in country district sheep cattle must have long ago be kraaled for night yet even so be seldom that stock settled down to rest so early seldom that among so many animal there be not few restless one proclaiming restlessness by bleat bellow on particular night there be not sound of description to apprise wayfarer that be within quarter of mile of opulent farm a rounded extremity of spur however house swung into view great sigh of relief escaped for there within shouting distance stood building to appearance intact true be in complete darkness that of course might very easily arise from fact that mr lestrange after busy day in open have retired to rest early yet somehow darkness seemed to to be a ominous a silence urging prince to canter dashed forward leaped fence without pausing to take down slip rail reined up at step gave access to stoep then perceived that front door window be wide open struck a being peculiar in extreme taken in conjunction with total darkness in house be wrapped for though of course habitually slept with bedroom window wide open usually closed front door window giving access to unoccupied room last thing before retiring at night therefore moved by sudden return in full flood of anxiety gave vent to loud whoop a swung out of saddle without waiting for reply rushed up step across stoep into house shouting a went mr lestrange mr lestrange where be be ned laurence where be echo of voice be however only reply received have sooner entered hall than perceived that something be very seriously wrong for furniture be disarranged one of chair be overturned so far a must see in semi obscurity appeared that lestrange gun be not in usual place in rack of course never went anywhere without carrying in pocket mean to obtain light therefore without waiting for further development drew forth flint steel presently lighted lamp hung from hall ceiling fortunately still contained fair quantity of oil then removing lamp from frame in hung proceeded forthwith to explore now have light must plainly distinguish surroundings worst foreboding be confirmed for everything in place be disarranged weapon be all gone a well a skin rug usually covered floor several valuable karosses with chair sofa be wont to be draped while various hunting trophy have be torn from wall be gone fearing now indeed quite expecting worst after casting hurried glance about hall made way straight to mr lestrange bedroom there just inside wide open door lay poor fellow clad only in sleeping garb with three ghastly assagai wound in body one through throat have severed jugular vein room too be in terrible state of disorder having evidently be subjected to thorough search for anything might appeal to fancy of savage there have be no fight be perfectly clear surprise have be complete savage have contrived to gain entrance to house in time to massacre inmate before have chance to defend inmate there be none mr lestrange who be widower nell where be be sufficiently intimate with arrangement of house to know be nell room next dash be thither door of room be wide open paused in opening when reached with feeling strong upon must commit something very like sacrilege by entering single glance however sufficed to reveal that shrine of innocent girlhood have already be violated for too like mr lestrange have be turned topsy turvy by savage nell where be instinctively scanned floor of room in search of dead body be not there furthermore must not find slightest trace of bloodstain to indicate that tragedy have be double one only bed be stripped of covering when came to investigate more closely found night robe flung carelessly upon floor none of day garment lying about conclusion to be finally driven be that poor child instead of having be slain in cold blood like father have be surprised in sleep compelled to dress be carried off alive perhaps unhurt by savage poor child poor darling little nell oh if be right in reading of sign what unspeakably awful fate be hers yet yet perhaps might not be so very terrible after be child sweetly pretty child too have heard of case where white girl child have be kidnapped by black carried off by to fastness in wild there to become first pet ultimately 'nkosikaas chieftainess of tribe true be not often that be done there be kind of legend among native somewhere far up in interior there be great very powerful tribe ruled over by white 'nkosikaas while within own recollection young girl daughter of boer farmer have be carried off by bechuana be in like manner said to be still living a 'nkosikaas of tribe if be true there seemed to be no good reason to doubt one must only hope that poor little nell lestrange might meet with worse fate be horrible thing to think of sweet lovable little creature being suddenly awakened out of sound sleep in middle of night by horde of ferocious bloodthirsty savage carried off by perhaps in ignorance of father fate in deadly terror of what be to befall be very fond of nell have grown to regard almost a sister first impulse be to set out there then seek until found never rest until have effected rescue from savage jailer few moment reflection sufficed to convince of utter futility of such mad project two outrage attack upon lestrange own farm clearly indicated that long expected rising of native have at last taken place so suddenly that lestrange at least have be caught unawares doubt whole country be at moment ablaze being overrun by black in overwhelming number mystery to be have not heard so much a hint of actual rising from of folk whom have met on return journey from port elizabeth fact have not done so seemed to indicate that outbreak although in general way expected have be so skilfully managed that after settler have be caught more le off guard so far from being possible for to undertake singlehanded expedition for rescue of nell be liable at moment to blunder upon war party of savage either be slain by forthwith still worse be carried off captive to suffer death by torture indeed wonder be that something of kind have not already happened to a doubtless have to many unsuspecting traveller to attempt alone to rescue nell must be worse than useless must simply be wanton throwing away of life later on might be of service to must only hope that meanwhile worse thing than simple captivity might befall be aroused from sombre reflection by appearance of piet hottentot after rider who more prudent than have approached house with certain measure of circumspection now came to report a in own case sheep cattle have be driven off that trace of of native domestic shepherd have be found presumption being that have taken alarm fled more likely still have be captured carried off a prisoner went round of place with frequently shouting name of one of servant without avail finally came to conclusion that surmise be probably correct now arose question what be to do plight be almost a desperate a must well be for not only be utterly bereft of one of who be nearest dearest to be likewise homeless literally penniless house called home be destroyed horn hoof of father stock have be stolen must probably never be recovered a to money there be none for father instead of banking profit of farm allowing to accumulate have a have already explained habitually spent in improving live stock adding to adornment of house content of wagon have brought up from port elizabeth represented penny of spare cash remaining in house when left on journey true have wagon content a well a team of ox upon must doubtless realise also there be farm be to say land be worth quite handsome sum of money be most unwilling to part with for several reason have be ever so anxious to sell must most probably have proved impossible to find purchaser at moment with native in armed revolt against white there be other matter of even more pressing character than just enumerated demanding attention first of be interment of body of unfortunate friend nell father therefore summoning piet bade seek shovel when have found one set to work to dig grave at certain spot about quarter of mile from house knew to be greatly favoured by nell on account of beautiful view obtainable from there piet reverently laid dead man to rest afterward piling number of large stone round grave placing rough wooden cross at head to mark spot then recovering horse returned to bella vista thoroughly worn out by fatigue horror of past day sought rest in outspanned wagon next morning with grief so bitter that even now can not look back upon unmoved chose site for grave laid beloved dead to rest side by side marking spot a have marked grave of nell father leaving remains of savage to be dealt with by vulture hyena jackal when have done be possible wagon be inspanned with heavy heart wended way accompanied by little following to somerset east where arrived late in afternoon of following day without having encountered anything of untoward character on way there be one farm between bella vista somerset east situate about halfway between latter great fish river when in course of journey house came in sight jumped on prince back galloped forward with view of ascertaining what if anything have happened there upon arrival found farm silent deserted with not so much a dog about place house however be undamaged door window be fastened upon looking through latter perceived that room be empty of furniture therefore concluded afterwards proved to be case that owner have obtained timely warning of rising have hurriedly packed belonging into wagon driving stock before have hastily retired to somerset town of somerset east be in terrible commotion when reached fifty fugitive family from outlying district with stock belonging having already taken shelter there while others be hourly arriving man have story to tell of farm have be attacked inhabitant murdered stock driven off something very nearly approaching to state of panic prevailed for town at time contained only three hundred inhabitant of whom three quarter be woman child moreover lay quite open unprotected on side might easily be rushed by sufficiently strong body of enemy there be few cool head among congregated in town one notable being certain major henderson who like father have held post in british army who at once naturally came to front took lead in preparing place to meet successfully possible attack laager consisting of wagon interlocked be constructed at end of single street that then ran through town inner end of narrow lane giving off main street be securely barricaded thus forming number of cul de sac in if attacking savage dared to venture there must be swept out of existence by defender behind barricade back door window of house accessible from veld be strongly protected by heavy timber loopholed for rifle fire thus when henderson scheme of defence be complete town presented very tough nut to crack for enemy without artillery firearm greatest difficulty appeared be shortness of ammunition consequently arrival with wagon load of commodity be regarded a scarcely le than special interposition of providence then male inhabitant voluntarily placed under martial law under henderson command taking in turn to perform sentry go day night while best mounted among undertook to act a scout riding forth from town daily in various direction in quest of news of enemy returning in evening with such intelligence a have be able to gain daily scouting service proved to be of utmost value for in first place prevented possibility of surprise attack so enabled stock congregated in town to be daily driven forth to graze water also be mean whereby in course of few day be able to gather something like clear general idea of what have happened be still happening in colony thus soon transpired that in eastern province imaginary line drawn from mouth of great kei river through triannon bella vista thence northward along meridian of degree east longitude to zour bergen represented southern limit of savage depredation while beyond zour bergen to north west be unable to learn anything definite on fifth day after arrival in somerset east detachment consisting of two company of infantry accompanied by baggage ammunition wagon under command of captain fletcher arrived from port elizabeth encamped within mile of town in excellent strategic position at once proceeded to entrench strongly there remained nearly week awaiting instruction from general who be preparing plan of campaign while moving toward centre of disturbance few troop at disposal collecting information during week followed arrival of troop received intelligence of several attack upon isolated farm even small village in outlying more sparsely populated district from speedily became apparent that regular troop consisting a did entirely of infantry hampered a be by baggage wagon be altogether too slow moving to be effective in overtaking bringing to action nimble body of savage who be encumbered with impedimenta of description whatsoever excepting weapon shield knobkerrie sheaf of assagai who slept under star quenched thirst at stream runlet crossed path eat came to hand whether chanced to be buck bullock green mealie therefore seemed upon careful consideration of situation that if ravage of black be to be stopped there be only one course to be pursued be to dispatch against force of irregular cavalry composed of farmer hunter transport rider others men who have lived long enough in country to become inured to climate accustomed to method of travel in who must move a independently of impedimenta a savage being mounted a swiftly who being provided with firearm might hope to cope successfully with foe considerably stronger in point of number than there be plenty of such men to be have farmer who have fled from farm to town village upon first news of outbreak transport rider whose occupation have ceased upon outbreak of hostility hunter who be in like case with transport rider few who like have lost everything life at hand of savage speedily banded into troop in case numbering not more than twenty thirty in others amounting to hundred more band under own elected leader subordinate officer corp to attached dubbed somerset east mounted rifle consisted of one hundred seven men under command of major henderson divided into two troop of fifty men right troop under command of captain henry jackson left troop under command of captain pieter van rhyn with sergeant in command of of two squadron composed troop man provided own horse weapon ammunition be not in uniform be volunteer in strictest sense of word for drew pay acknowledged allegiance to man save own officer although be of course fully understood by everybody that be always to be ready to co operate with support regular troop in event of encountering however be exceedingly unlikely at least in earlier stage of campaign for so lightly equipped be that must perform forty mile march day after day with ease be confident that must not only get into touch with must also reduce enemy to subjection long before regular must arrive at scene of hostility although did not substantiate boast achieve ambition in entirety think be justified in claiming that honour of campaign fell chiefly to various body of irregular who so self sacrificingly took field on occasion for be not regular who followed up hunted down so relentlessly marauding band of savage who swept colony like storm wave causing such loss of life property a took colonist best part of generation to recover from be not purpose to write history of kafir war of year for have already be done by far abler hand than mine with fullness of detail leaf nothing to be desired moreover have entirely different although a think equally stirring story to tell will therefore dismiss event connected with service in rank of somerset east mounted rifle with bare statement that during nine month so covered participated in many deeply stirring episode on several occasion found involved in situation so desperate that nothing save steadfastness invincible courage of man present saved from absolute annihilation be not to be supposed that mere handful of men composed of burgher farmer with practically knowledge of military science quite unaccustomed to anything in nature of military discipline must pas through so trying ordeal a cheerfully faced without suffering heavy loss a matter of fact by time that campaign be so far over that regular troop be able to cope with situation government have therefore further need of service somerset east mounted rifle have become reduced to le than original strength yet fortune so far favoured that when at corp be disbanded be one of very few who escaped without so much a scratch to show for nine month service corp be disbanded where have originated in town of somerset east on following day found face to face with exceedingly perplexing problem of future be must be remembered not yet quite eighteen year of age be therefore still young enough to be able to start life afresh be without single relative in world worldly good consisted solely of two thousand five hundred sixty acre of pasture land although be undeniably exceedingly valuable possession likely to increase very greatly in value with passage of year be just then incapable of returning single penny of income true there be sum of little over three hundred pound sterling standing to credit in bank such being proceeds of sale of wagon ox ammunition with have trekked into somerset east upon outbreak of hostility though be far too insignificant sum to be of use in restocking farm rebuilding house beginning life afresh a sheep farmer on ever so modest scale also possessed horse prince who have carried through many wild stirring adventure like have emerged unscathed together with saddle bridle trusty rifle double barrelled sporting gun have purchased in port elizabeth for father little dreaming at time of purchase that must not live to use have said be without relative in world be literal truth be impossible must participate in such campaign a one have just passed through without making many stanch friend boer english of middle aged men who knew perfectly well what be talking about strongly advised to raise money by selling portion of farm by mean of mortgage upon father have instilled into perfect horror of anything savoured of getting into debt while mere idea of selling portion of property have accumulated almost acre by acre be absolutely abhorrent to therefore although have greatest respect for judgment of friend fully believed in financial soundness of advice determined that only in last resort must avail of in resolution be fully supported by major henderson who be a well qualified to advise in such matter a anyone having be in country for over thirty year knowing good deal better than most have farm up under southern slope of tandjes berg upon dissolution of corp be good enough to invite to take up quarter at place while thinking over affair deciding what to do be while be sitting out on stoep of house one night after dinner that conversation occurred that decided course of action ultimately launched upon great adventure while leading into many strange terrible peril be so profoundly to influence whole of after life remember be in very pessimistic downcast mood night expressed opinion that there appeared to be nothing for for to erect sort of glorified kafir hut on land invest money in small flock of sheep shepherd so gradually build up fortune afresh from modest foundation said ex major must not advise to do certainly not process be too slow unless must happen

to utmost capacity with tusk feather get back to coast dispose of load at price must cover expense leave very handsome profit upon outlay of time money continued major unconsciously dropping voice to confidential tone advise to limit energy to programme very far from be undertaking expedition must cache ivory in comparatively small parcel at frequent interval so that might not have trouble of dragging about country must collect on return journey if wanted must push on right into interior up into mashonaland possibly farther still mashonas be queer chap will allow be right if take right way

spoiled everything expedition have originally be hunting trip pure simple must understand have be brilliantly successful have enjoyed magnificent sport lion elephant rhinoceros buffalo giraffe end have filled wagon chock full of ivory skin horn have then found out about gold of course at once threw everything overboard loaded wagon afresh with gold a much of a blessed thing must carry ox drag then what must born idiot van raalte do quarrel with one of indunas about trumpery thing slash man across face with sjambok of course fat be in fire at once be set upon seized bound hand foot with

again to hear man scream so long a live screaming lasted for hour until past midnight must think while be lying there in hut a helpless a baby sweating with horror at awful hair raising sound that pierced ear at length however shriek grew weaker more intermittent finally died away altogether night seemed endless for what with horror seized a lay there listening trying to imagine what be happening excruciating pain of tightly bound limb sleep be impossibility morning dawned at last village awoke hour two later be unbound led forth took to place about quarter of mile away showed something told be remained of van raalte will not attempt to describe to what saw well let pas be full quarter of hour before recovered sufficiently from sickness followed to permit of intelligible

other side of orange river fell in with elephant hunter named king who took care of finally handed over to friend of mine who at time lived in cape town although told king good many other people for matter what happened to in mashonaland how came to be in such terrible plight always omitted that part about gold ned be first only one to whom have ever mentioned must not have mentioned to if have not felt convinced that posse quality necessary to enable to go up there get load safely bring back with chapter four start upon great adventure in privacy of own room night after have parted from major gave most careful consideration to suggestion have thrown out despite gruesome fate of dutchman van raalte at hand of mashonas host have hinted at rather than described project decidedly appealed to be true that possessed personal knowledge of mashonas have idea that in essential must probably resemble pretty closely zulu of whom knew something if so must understand not only treatment of van raalte of friend henderson too a van raalte companion partner also that might be quite possible for white man possessed of certain amount of tact tolerably comprehensive knowledge of nature of south african savage to enter country leave again in safety that there be gold in mashonaland be news to for although have once twice heard general opinion casually expressed that south africa must perhaps day be found to be rich in mineral have never until now heard of precious metal having actually be found felt sure have rumour ever gained currency not even formidable reputation of mashonas must have sufficed to prevent rush of prospector into country such rush have ever occurred for if have news of must have spread like wildfire individual in colony to most remote outskirt must have heard of fact therefore rush have occurred be conclusive proof that friend henderson be sole repository of momentous secret have contrived to keep strictly to year now at last have imparted to be free to go up there if pleased acquire fortune true there be certain element of risk danger in project for there be thousand mile more to be traversed through roadless savage country of little nothing be then known except that be infested by several of most ferocious specie of animal reptile a well a million of even more ferocious native during journey of thousand mile through country almost anything be possible spice of danger attaching to journey appealed to a attraction rather than deterrent must enjoy of finest sport that world have to offer with luck might return wealthy man alone be sufficient inducement there be still stronger one be nell lestrange be so young at time of abduction be so young still that hoped nothing very terrible have thus far happened to be unthinkable that white girl must be permitted to grow up to womanhood among savage be not altogether without hope that during progress of journey might be able to ascertain whereabouts effect rescue with so many strong inducement in favour of henderson suggestion only one comprised in element of danger uncertainty against be not to be wondered at before slept night have definitely decided to act upon major advice undertake journey decision duly communicated to host on following morning over breakfast table thereupon proceeded forthwith to discus detail major be of opinion ought to begin preparation forthwith for season be rapidly advancing be then precisely right time to start upon up country trek for rainy season be over river be low everywhere fordable young spring grass be at best richest on other hand dry season have set in water must day be growing more scarce grass more parched ground harder in word there be not moment to lose if desired to avail to fullest possible extent of advantage of season having agreed upon passed on to consideration of way mean henderson proceeded to jot down rapidly list of various item deemed absolutely indispensable supplementing with much shorter list of further item although not positively necessary must be highly desirable if available fund must permit then estimated cost of several item indispensable desirable be jotted down conclusion be finally arrived at if various purchase be carefully made available money ought just about to suffice for indispensables with possibility that if luck attended one two desirables might also be included be due to friend major to say that when total of original estimate be ascertained found to exceed amount of capital at once offered to advance such further fund a might be needed to complete equipment gratefully yet steadfastly refused to avail of generous offer feeling have right to risk property of then sallied forth proceeded to make purchase beginning with wagon team of ox then proceeding with remainder of item until resource of somerset east be exhausted ammunition be most important item of have early foreseen that must be necessary to send down to port elizabeth for did so therefore instructing dealer to wrap one pound flask of powder separately in waterproof paper pack in half dozen in soldered up tin enclose whole in stout wooden case by mean hoped to preserve effectually entire stock of powder from ordinary accident of travel in country subject at certain season to torrential downpour of rain intersected at pretty frequent interval by river deep enough to flood wagon during passage across case of powder also contained necessary complement of wad percussion cap arrived at somerset east exactly fortnight after dispatch of order for by time remainder of preparation be completed nothing therefore remained to bid numerous friend goodbye make start forthwith suppose be hardly necessary to state that when discussing forthcoming expedition with various friend carefully abstained from mention of word gold major let be understood be going to try hand at elephant hunting a business many be valuable hint received from one a to spot where must be most likely to find biggest herd last ember of war be still smouldering in north eastern district of colony when be ready to start everybody be of opinion that be quite quiet in north therefore instead of striking eastward working north along low land between drakensberg range sea a have at first intended decided to strike right away north at once between tandjes berg great winter berg mountain across zour bergen so over orange river right through very heart of what be now known a orange river colony transvaal be then practically unknown wilderness behold then trekking out from somerset east about ten o'clock on certain glorious mid october morning accompanied by brand new well loaded wagon drawn by team of sixteen salted ox be to say ox immune to terrible lung sickness be bane of south africa driven by jan former hottentot driver who with piet former after rider have contrived to pick up living in somerset east during war now also with piet be more than willing to re enter service accompany to uttermost part of earth if so might please dog thunder juno also formed part of train having found home with piet during absence at war also in addition to prince there be two other horse one being fine sturdy iron grey basuto cob named tempest other very useful chestnut named punch have purchased chiefly for piet use when must arrive in elephant country remaining member of retinue be bantu boy named 'ngulubi about sixteen year of age who acted a voorlouper leader of front span of ox of team trekked at moderately easy pace to start with doing on average about twenty mile day contriving during first four day of march to outspan night in vicinity of farmhouse where in accordance with custom of country obtained hospitality for night after however farm became more widely scattered be obliged to content with cartel in wagon to be perfectly truthful found far more comfortable because more cleanly than of bed have slept in on evening of eighth day about hour before sunset successfully forded orange river outspanned on northern bank by time ox be actually going better than at start be in harder condition be glorious evening sky cloudless heat of day over there be just softest breathing of cool refreshing air from upstream country low lying along margin of river rising very gently a swept away northward presented just combination of rich grass land bush seemed to promise abundance of game about mile upstream from outspan river broadened out be rush fringed in such fashion a to suggest almost certainty of wild duck therefore while boy outspanned attended to cattle took from wagon double barrelled combination of rifle smooth bore have purchased for father year before in port elizabeth accompanied by two dog set out for little walk upstream partly for enjoyment of walk partly in hope of securing something little more appetising than buck meat for supper keeping closely along river margin walking slowly with dog close at heel soon became lost to everything entrancing beauty of evening perfect peacefulness quietude emphasised rather than broken by gentle gurgle ripple of river along bank soft sigh rustle of wind among reed while swift change of light colour flooding landscape a sun sank rapidly in western sky afforded picture surpassing loveliness of there be word to describe unconsciously halted that might better be able to watch wonderful play of prismatic colour upon bosom of river upon gently swaying reed along margin upon broken ground ahead in emerald mantle of lush grass dotted here there with broad clump of bush upon gently swelling contour of distant hill blushing rosy red in evening sunshine for space of perhaps ten minute stood spellbound conscious of nothing surpassing loveliness of god handiwork a manifested in scene before then suddenly be jerked back to realisation of more prosaic side of thing by outburst of loud bellowing seemed to proceed from farther side of low ridge about hundred yard ahead getting into motion again hurried forward to ascertain what be matter for there be note of mingled anger terror in bellowing told plainly enough that creature be in trouble not far away be not one of own ox be right in plain view from where stood grazing contentedly close to wagon in charge of umfaan be domesticated ox of kind for there be farm anywhere within sight wagon excepting own moreover sound be too deep powerful to issue from lung of domestic animal obvious inference therefore being that bellowing proceeded from wild buffalo so indeed proved for upon topping intervening ridge beheld splendid buffalo bull fifty yard away standing breast deep in river struggling violently uttering bellow after bellow except when for moment two poor beast head be dragged under water saw at once what be matter brute have wandered down to river to drink a most animal do at eventide plunging rather too deeply into water have be seized by muzzle by crocodile be now despite frantic struggle being slowly dragged into deep water where of course must presently be drowned become prey of fierce saurian now wild cape buffalo be distinctly vicious creature easily angered ready to fight upon slightest provocation be indeed with perhaps exception of rhinoceros many who know intimately must not even except latter most dangerous animal in africa therefore to be let carefully alone by people who be not looking for trouble in present case sympathy be with buffalo for fight did not seem to be fair one advantage be on side of crocodile therefore in order to even matter little decided to take hand in game forthwith started at run for scene of action arrived not second too soon for when reached spot buffalo notwithstanding immense strength desperate resistance have offered have be dragged slowly forward through yielding mud until be submerged mid shoulder deep while head being held under water be already half drowned resistance decreased moment nevertheless be still making gallant struggle occasionally contriving to raise head above water secure gulp of air notwithstanding fact that in order to do so have practically to lift entire weight of crocodile foot more of course upon occasion crocodile head be lifted at least partially out of water far enough to disclose brute merciless eye happened second two after arrival upon scene when quick a light tossed weapon to shoulder sighted reptile left eye pulled trigger be enough bullet penetrated to creature brain great jaw slowly relaxed grip with smothered bellow may may not have indicated relief great bull swerved round staggered out of water up bank fell in heap just a reached crest where lay panting heavily moaning with pain a blood gushed from lacerated muzzle for moment a stood to reload rifle be more than half inclined to put bullet into poor beast brain so end misery upon reflection decided that must be rather unsportsmanlike to take advantage of helplessness therefore determined to give chance went upon way leaving to recover if must when retraced step about hour later brute have vanished though have probably not gone very far resuming walk reached spot for have be making just in time to secure shot at flight of teal a bird arrived in what be evidently night quarter be fortunate enough to bag two half brace with returned to wagon lighted on way by ray of newly risen almost full moon on following evening after long fatiguing day trek over broken continuously rising ground outspanned close to basuto village inhabitant of welcomed arrival with such extreme cordiality felt sure wanted something from later on after have dined be thinking of retiring for night suspicion be verified a be custom when native be inclined to be friendly headman of village half dozen others came out to fraternise with boy incidentally to share evening meal a usual consisted to large extent of buck meat now at time of write basuto possessed firearm therefore have to depend chiefly upon pitfall similar primitive contrivance for supply of meat except upon very rare occasion when succeeded in working up to pitch of extravagance a to slaughter ox consequently meal of flesh formed part be few far between knew that white man follower must always get meat in abundance therefore when white man passed through country might occur upon average twice year always made point of inviting to supper a in present case knowing that white man understanding custom must be sure to provide wherewithal for abundant feast a eat talked for kafir be inveterate gossip in way white man might sometimes acquire item two of information of real value to now have given boy instruction to avail to fullest extent of opportunity must offer to make cautious enquiry among native with whom might chance to come into contact with object of gaining clue to whereabouts of nell lestrange for knew that white child must not be spirited off into wild without good many native acquiring inkling of direction in have gone therefore upon occasion like present be custom of piet after rider ably seconded by jan cunningly to lead conversation round to subject of recent war then listen intently to be said helping conversation along where needful by artfully framed question two tactic followed on evening in question having taken walk out on veld to enjoy beauty silence of prospect under silver flooding of moon returned to wagon with pleasant sense of coolness fatigue be about to begin preparation for night repose when piet tottie after rider rose from place among others round fire approached baa said basuto headman of village must speak with will say that ear be open yes answered let come hither speak freely accordingly piet having signified that be graciously willing to accord audience 'ngaga approached halted at distance of six foot from flung up right hand sonorously uttered salute then stood motionless awaiting pleasure s ' bon literally see 'ngaga replied must have speech with then say on ear be open baba father began savage be at least forty year of age while be only eighteen thy child be in trouble therefore there be great rejoicing in village when mafuta nyanga witch doctor morning announced that white man be on way with fire weapon must be with before nightfall said stop interrupted before speak further tell how mafuta came to know be on way believed that entry into basutoland be unknown be wondering whether must be better for to see moshesh in kraal whether must suffice for to send messenger with gift perhaps can tell doubtless king will be glad to see thee at kraal cautiously answered man especially if news go forward thou hast done child service if thou wilt do that service will see that news of doe go forward to king ear ensuring thee welcome very well said will gladly do what may lie in power therefore say what be thy desire will consider matter thou hast not yet told how mafuta came to know of presence in basutoland saw man yesterday perchance one of belonging to village saw wagon from afar hastened to spread news nay answered 'ngaga man saw thy wagon from afar brought news of thine approach to village mafuta be great nyanga perchance saw vision of thine approach in magic smoke how must know be not good for mere ordinary mortal to enquire too curiously into doings of nyangas reply at once powerfully aroused curiosity for perceived that 'ngaga be referring to strange occult power with witch doctor be credited by white men who have be thrown into most intimate contact with native have heard many extraordinary apparently well authenticated story told respecting alleged power of nyangas to visualise distant happening to foretell coming event to discover whereabouts of lost article to read thought of men lay bare most cherished secret also to inflict upon enemy loss suffering even death have doubt that many of strange story to have listened have originated in very trivial ordinary circumstance have be magnified distorted into weird supernatural happening by superstitious credulity of original narrator there be others of equally weird unaccountable character have be told by hard headed intelligent unimaginative men a having come within scope of own personal experience seemed to indicate that nyangas really possessed power denied to great majority of fellow men moreover must be remembered by sceptical that who have ever be intimately associated with african savage be fully agreed that be gifted with certain strange uncanny power quite incomprehensible to white man a be indubitably demonstrated during last zulu war when native exhibited intimate knowledge of certain event notably disaster to british troop at isandhlwana within hour two of occurrence several day before news became known through ordinary channel of communication now taking into consideration such fact a be common knowledge yet be quite inexplicable by most profound student of ordinary science one be inclined to ask if such thing be possible to ordinary savage why must not other still more extraordinary power be possessed by among who have inherited secret handed down to by others who through many generation have made sole business of life to study what for want of better term be pleased to designate occult confess be not of who will believe only what be able to understand upon what principle therefore will say will believe certain thing although understand will not believe something else for same reason now be keenly interested in subject of nyanga alleged power for variety of reason two of will think justify in determining to put to test now have opportunity one reason being simple curiosity other desire to obtain information a to whereabouts of nell lestrange therefore said to 'ngaga very well let that matter pas be about to tell that there be trouble in village of kind can cure be not so even so 'nkos ' answered 'ngaga trouble be leopard have lately taken up abode yonder pointing to spot about mile distant where great granite kopje towered sixty foot above general surface of ground forming hill of about three four acre in extent haunt cave in rock continued 'ngaga come night to village stealing chicken killing dog cattle last night even entered hut carried off two year old child from sleeping mother side have tried to kill beast be too wise for for while be watching for in one place go round by way effort thus far have be in vain so to day consulted upon matter after have heard have shut up in hut for a long a take sun to travel that far through sky indicating arc must represent about hour came forth said that white man 'nkos ' must arrive at village to night must undertake to free of beast will do for o father be very wary will not allow to approach within length of spear cast can not escape fire weapon will be that if slay 'ngaga will send forward messenger to great one moshesh announcing thy coming to kraal taking with tale will cause great one face to smile upon thee very well said be willing to do what can for thee thine o thus will do thou shalt to night station two men in place from can watch path leading from leopard den to village will be that if beast show one man will hasten hither to wagon with news while other remains to watch if need be follow thus will know where to find leopard will come slay with fire weapon if beast remains in den night then will go up in morning slay there be plan good be good answered 'ngaga will go even now to village send out two trustworthy men to watch do thy bidding man flung up hand in farewell salute before turning to leave stopped stay 'ngaga said have not yet finished speaking with thee will slay beast despoils village carry off young child in return village must do something for be engaged upon certain quest if mafuta be a great nyanga a thou believest to be may be that can help therefore if kill leopard mafuta must to morrow exercise magic to find out for what want to know 'ngaga seemed suddenly disconcerted stood silent for full minute more apparently plunged in disquieting thought then spoke deprecatingly 'nkos ' said how will answer thee mafuta be strange wilful man impatient of authority distrustful of stranger moreover love not white men therefore may well be that will refuse what thou dost ask of yet seemed not displeased to day when knowledge of thy coming be revealed to may be that will consent know not how will act may be that if now will refuse whereas if ask to morrow when thou hast slain leopard will consent what wilt thou have do father leave until morrow answered then if refuse thee will see perhaps will not refuse good agreed thy decision be wise one for mafuta be of who like not to bind by promise go now to find send out watcher sala guhli farewell saluting savage swung round upon heel strode away thereupon climbed into wagon having carefully examined weapon satisfied that be loaded powder well up in nipple retired to rest be about hour after midnight when jan awoke baa murmured shaking gently by shoulder there be befaan boy who bid tell thee leopard be abroad making down toward village that if will come quickly will have good chance to kill beast right replied drowsily a sat up on cartel began to feel about for boot find tinder box jan light lamp minute later lamp be lighted proceeded hurriedly to get into clothes then taking rifle instructing jan to follow with double barrel emerged from wagon to find well grown basuto lad of about eighteen year of age impatiently waiting to guide to scene of action well befaan said so leopard be abroad whereabout be be somewhere on other side of ridge 'nkos answered lad came out from behind krantz entering long grass disappeared brother yonder be watching movement if hasten may cut off before reach village see there be brother can see head shoulder above ridge be waving to hasten looked in direction toward lad pointed moon be high in heaven almost overhead in fact entire scene be flooded with white ray before ground rose slightly to ridge about one hundred yard distant past lay depression through small stream ran while beyond stream ground rose again in long bush clad slope swept away into extreme distance grey mysterious forming background of scene foreground nearer distance be brilliantly illuminated by cold ray of moon rendering object within quarter of mile almost a distinct a though be midday clearly defined against ghostly grey of grass clad ridge must see head shoulder of savage white moonlight gleaming upon ebony skin a waved arm signalling to way ' way whispered guide excitedly leading way toward lower edge of depression walking fast followed with jan bringing up rear five minute of quick wading through long dew saturated grass carried over ridge much lower down than where watcher be stationed depression be scarcely deep enough to be termed ravine lay before here paused moment to reconnoitre seeing nothing moved rapidly forward again aiming for small clump of bush stood solitary at distance of about fifty yard from wide open space leopard must need cross on way to village behind three posted to await arrival of brute for position be excellent one in respect bush being between spot where supposed leopard to be while what little wind there be blew from direction toward in front stretched wide open grassy space with stream trickling through midst have scarcely settled behind bush when basuto guide gently touched on arm silently pointed between branch toward spot where grass seemed to be swaying little more strongly than soft breathing of wind alone must account for looking intently presently perceived that peculiar swaying motion of grass be stealthily progressing across open space a though something hidden by tall growth be cautiously moving there apart from peculiar motion of grass however nothing be to be seen be not surprising since growth down there be breast high little farther on where village herd have be turned out to graze be not so long ox be there now at far side of patch of short grass lying down asleep in charge of couple of boy herd seemed to that mysterious movement in grass be progressing toward presently one of ox suddenly flung up head seemed to sniff air for few moment then with low moan rose to foot switching tail from side to side movement aroused rest of herd who in turn scrambled to foot stood switching tail facing same way namely toward spot where have observed suspicious motion of grass motion have ceased now for nearly quarter of hour stood there tense waiting watching then suddenly detected anew curious quivering swaying of tuft though so slight be that for at least couple of minute must not be sure that sens be not deceiving at length however movement grew sufficiently pronounced to convince that leopard be once more creeping forward few minute later reached spot where grass have be kept comparatively short by grazing of herd next instant caught merest glimpse through shortened herbage of moving something knew must only be back of crouching animal of sort sneaking toward now fully awakened herd throwing up rifle tried to imagine entire animal from little of saw aimed for spot among grass pictured a being just behind shoulder pulled trigger sharp crack of rifle broke in upon stillness of night with startling effect heard thud of bullet instantly followed by savage snarl ended in moan a smoke drifted away caught momentary glimpse of great tawny black spotted form writhing convulsively in air from death spring then collapsing inertly where fell jan basuto uttering yell of delight instantly started to run in upon fallen leopard stopped with reminder that beast might not yet be dead exchanging weapon with hottentot proceeded to approach with due caution spot where lay need not have be under apprehension for when came to saw that animal by way be biggest leopard have ever seen have be shot clean through heart be stone dead chapter five mafuta basuto witch doctor on following morning when turned out walked down to river to bathe debouched little from direct road in order to take peep at dead leopard by daylight carcass having be left where have fallen a approached place saw that piet jan two hottentot be already busily engaged upon task of removing skin observed that be looking a thought very much annoyed little apprehensive be not long in discovering what be matter for a halted beside piet held up first two front paw then two hind paw of beast when instantly saw to intense annoyance one of claw have be removed therefore a trophy skin be quite useless of course knew that be common practice among kafir claw of lion leopard being worn by a potent amulet converted into muti be to say medicine be implicitly believed by to impart quality of courage to one who take have be foolish enough to think that having solicited to destroy enemy for must have regarded carcass a sacred from mutilation have not done so however that ended matter for knew that must be quite useless to make fuss about not soul in village must ever admit least knowledge of theft while be taking breakfast about hour later came up from village to express hearty thanks of rest of inhabitant for service have rendered by destroying leopard when have chatted for hour so have accepted present of yard of brass wire handful of parti coloured bead cotton handkerchief gorgeously emblazoned in red blue green yellow said 'nkos after left last night went to hut of mafuta be permitted to enter told nyanga that have undertaken to slay leopard have be troubling after have spoken many word concerning greatness of boon must thus confer upon ventured to mention that be desirous of consulting in relation to certain quest have undertaken think that if must go now with to mafuta hut perhaps taking with a gift handkerchief such a nyanga must be willing to grant request think so said then in case let go extracting from voorkissie handkerchief distinguished by particularly startling combination of colour tucked into belt in such manner that must not fail to attract attention set out for village accompanied by 'ngaga who understood proposed to act a sort of sponsor for to introduce personally to great man nyanga hut be a be generally case built at little distance in present instance about quarter of mile from village proper standing quite by close to stream close under shadow of great clump of bush apart from circumstance there be nothing to distinguish from rest of hut being of usual beehive shape constructed of closely interwoven wattle thickly thatched with reed grass having entrance so small that be necessary to bend double stoop low in order to pas through also be windowless only illumination of interior being derived from such light a came through low door consequently when one first entered such hut contrast between obscurity of interior glare of blazing sunlight outside produced impression of profound darkness only passing away a eye gradually accustomed to gloom after one found somewhat to one surprise that there be light enough to see everything with very tolerable degree of distinctness a 'ngaga preceded into hut heard low murmur of greeting pas between someone else told that owner be at home then followed stood upright in what be to eye inky blackness s ' bon see white man said deep resonant voice from depth of darkness yebo yes mafuta answered that being usual interchange of salutation between native white when former esteem equal of latter stood blinking striving to penetrate obscurity gradually darkness melted into sort of sombre twilight by imperceptible degree grew stronger presently saw be in hut sole furniture of consisted of pallet raised about foot from floor covered with rich karosses skin rug one observed being made entirely of leopard skin on one end of pallet be seated man of perhaps forty year of age wearing keshla head ring mucha apron made apparently of monkey skin man shield sheaf of assagai stood close at hand against wall of hut ponderous knobkerrie hung just overhead slung by loop of rimpi hut contained nothing to distinguish from that of other native confess that first feeling be one of disappointment for have never before be in hut of nyanga have be led to believe by who have must see sort of strange weird looking object if ever happened to penetrate to interior of kafir witch doctor owner seemed to read disappointment in eye for laughed softly a waved hand indicating emptiness of hut need thing for be looking belungu said magic be different from of other nyangas much more potent a mayhap will see for be seated continued waving toward other end of couch a for 'ngaga having brought belungu task be accomplished may depart so while deposited upon pallet bade somewhat ceremonious farewell vanished through opening into blazing sunlight without then mafuta began to talk to about journey incident such a be that have thus far marked confess be astounded at intimate knowledge of matter displayed of course knew that boy might have very possibly have spoken of to 'ngaga other basuto during gossip round fire on previous evening yet man mafuta seemed to know more about detail of than be likely to have transpired during conversation be probably of exceedingly desultory general character yet even be not so surprising a knowledge displayed of twofold object of journey knew must not have acquired from boy because even be ignorant of that actually knew being that journey be ostensibly undertaken for purpose of collecting ivory without questioning at upon subject nyanga made clear to that be fully aware of fact that one great object of journey be to get gold rather than ivory yet even said be not that seek upon journey important a be that must find yellow metal white man value so greatly be even more anxious to find something else be not so so anxious be to find that although doubt be power have come to to see if can help be true admitted fact that know so much of most secret desire intention incline to hope almost to believe that can help do think can may be belungu may be answered white girl still life be well for last night took trouble to seek for find where be can not say for place be strange to having never seen with bodily eye fairly gasped with amazement for be first time nell lestrange have be mentioned since arrival in village be not who have spoken of savage to whom even bare fact of existence might be supposed to be unknown unless unless who originally carried off have chanced to pas way yet even then tell shouted seizing nyanga by arm rather roughly be afraid in excitement what do know of how long be since saw who be who carried off gahle gently white man gahle returned mafuta snatching arm out of grasp know nothing of 'ntombi save what saw last night came hither to procure help to find such help a can give will be yours a told know not where be for never saw place with bodily eye will show to so that if ever come to place may know will that satisfy objected if be able to show place surely can tell name of in direction must travel to reach nay belungu can not do answered mafuta power be not so great a can show person whom desire to see must rest with to note that person surroundings so carefully must ever arrive at place will recognise again perhaps by describing to others may be able to find someone who have be there who recognising from description will be able to tell name where be very well then said do what can to help mafuta will be for ever obliged to muchli good exclaimed mafuta sit where be do exactly a bid rose from seat groped among thatch of hut for moment presently produced small circular object about size of ordinary coat button be a brightly burnished a surface of mirror placed upright on floor of hut in position that while in deep shadow strongly reflected light entered through doorway right into eye dazzling to extent for few moment must scarcely bear to look at presently however that feeling passed away be able to gaze upon without discomfort now said mafuta look steadfastly at never removing eye from for moment see what happens thus saying man went squatted upon heel in centre of floor began to chant in low monotonous voice certain word meaning of must not comprehend for few minute nothing particular seemed to happen disk continued to shine strongly in midst of deep shadow mafuta low monotonous song went on then so gradually that knew not when change began lost consciousness of everything except gleaming disk sound of mafuta voice from semblance of word have passed then disk seemed slowly to fade out of sight mafuta voice died away to silence found seemingly standing upon gently rising ground with native village of such dimension that deserved rather name of town about quarter of mile distant on left front first thing particularly observed about place apart from exceptional size be that be built in shape of circle be entirely fenced in with strong high palisade there be gate in fence nearly opposite number of people mostly men be coming going through gateway be splendid specimen of south african savage look a must must discover nothing either in cast of feature in trapping by to identify town be built upon top of slope on stood about quarter of mile distant from noted rather remarkable kopje thought must surely enable to recognise place if ever must chance to set bodily eye upon be perhaps seventy eighty foot high at summit measured a nearly a must guess about two hundred yard long be hog backed in shape be strewn here there with great tumbled mass of dark coloured rock among grew few straggling bush most remarkable thing about particular kopje however be that notwithstanding close proximity to town appeared to be haunt of innumerable vulture forty fifty of be perched upon rock at moment landscape on unknown savage town be set be of usual south african type namely gently undulating hill retiring one behind other into extreme distance until toward west got bearing from sun of course merged into what might almost be termed mountain while eastward land stretched away in vast plain soil be densely covered with long thick grass be already beginning to look bleached parched here there for want of rain scattered pretty thickly over country be usual patch of bush on right land fell away to spacious flat thousand acre more in extent upon vast herd of cattle be grazing through stream thirty foot in width gently meandered a stood noting detail three young girl emerged from main gate of town two of being dark brown while third be white nell lestrange recognised dear child instantly although have altered greatly a thought for better since have seen last be talking laughing gaily with companion be glad to see for indicated that be well happy yet even a thought flashed through mind fell silent for moment look of sadness clouded face be bareheaded barefooted garment wore being sort of frock apparently modelled from have worn while at triannon made of peculiar kind of cloth nature of must not recognise instinctively stretched out hand toward strove to call name sound passed lip to intense disappointment found must not move trio passed about hundred yard distant distinctly heard voice must not catch word spoke otherwise might possibly have recognised language thus gained clue to locality although just a be passing before nell looked straight in direction even paused for instant immediately went on again casting single glance back over shoulder then continuing on way until disappeared beyond clump of bush near river with disappearance whole scene vanished found back in mafuta hut with disk still gleaming brightly out of deep shadow mafuta still squatting on heel in centre of floor well white man said a came to have seen aught have said feel bound to admit that be possessor of most extraordinary power mafuta yes saw 'ntombozaan a said seems to be happy in enjoyment of excellent health what now want to know be where be surely there be not so many big kraal scattered about in kafirland that one have just shown must be difficult to find what did look like belungu demanded mafuta what did look like repeated be not that quite unnecessary question to ask mafuta must have seen everything saw otherwise nay interrupted mafuta saw nothing do know what saw excepting that willed to see 'ntombi tell everything that beheld maybe can help to find place thereupon proceeded to describe minutely entire scene a have beheld big town with hut to number of two thousand more symmetrically arranged within circle of stout high paling kopje close by with scattered pile of rock interspersed with straggling clump of bush vulture great plain with herd of grazing cattle beside stream in short feature of vision a vividly recalled when have finished mafuta sat for several minute ruminating deeply at length however looked up shaking head said white man have never seen place describe otherwise be sure must recognise kopje with rock aasvogels must alone suffice for identification that kopje be doubtless place where criminal be executed presence of aasvogels seems to indicate size general importance of place lead to believe that be where king sits what king know not of one thing however can assure be not moshesh place well said that at least be something to know for be one place le to trouble about be help can give be help can give repeated mafuta surely be much be not belungu have seen place with eye of mind seen a plainly a if have beheld with bodily eye will remember what look like will be able to describe minutely to others a go upon way will have opportunity to speak of to others yes come to that eventually will meet with one who will enable to find thanks very much said that be most comforting thing to know since say that thing will happen quite believe will after exhibition of power have already given will accept a gift from added producing brilliantly marked handkerchief from belt offering to nyanga thanks answered man taking handkerchief depositing upon pallet now continued think will do well to proceed without undue delay to moshesh kraal have already dispatched messenger apprising king of presence in country if ask permission to pas through hunt in great one will doubtless give especially a have rendered people service of slaying leopard have be preying upon king be jealous of own authority be apt to resent intrusion into country without permission first asked also be little distrustful of white man whom suspect of desire to steal black man land therefore present before a early a may be thanks mafuta will do a say farewell may prosperity attend said a took leave sala guhli farewell belungu replied kafir following out standing by door of hut see much trouble many danger before thee be of good heart for thou shalt overcome two day later arrived at king kraal be near mid afternoon when halted wagon ordered jan to outspan at point about mile from kraal immediately dispatched piet with message to effect edward laurence englishman have arrived at kraal for purpose of personally soliciting permission from king moshesh to hunt in pas through country for purpose might crave majesty acceptance of certain present might be granted favour of early audience then opened voorkissie proceeded to select present must offer for savage king acceptance gaudily coloured handkerchief more particularly brilliantly hued article of costume have from time immemorial strongly appealed to taste of untutored savage have kept fact prominently in mind when purchasing good intended to use a present for purpose of barter therefore among other thing have bought several cast off british uniform of various description being designed especially for presentation to several savage monarch with whom expected to be brought into contact so now after due consideration drew forth drum major scarlet tunic stiff with tarnished gold braid regimental button shockingly soiled otherwise very much worse for wear pair of ditto blue trouser with gold braid running down outer seam naval lieutenant cocked hat in inserted bunch of cock tail feather infantryman white leather belt with bayonet sheath small round shaving mirror in metal frame have cost sixpence if remember rightly made up whole into neat bundle in readiness for moment when must be summoned to royal presence then proceeded to take particular note of capital of basutoland be place of considerable importance consisting of about thousand hut enclosed like place of vision in very strong high palisade rendered unclimbable by having upper extremity of paling trimmed into long sharp point be built upon summit of low knoll be rectangular in plan covered area of about twenty acre of ground be about must discover concerning in meantime since palisading be much too high to permit of seeing anything inside after absence of nearly hour piet returned with information that have be detained at outer gate of kraal while message be conveyed to king that during detention have be subjected to pretty severe cross examination by induna chief respecting purpose of journey destination so on finally message have be returned by king that when be ready to see must send for meanwhile be to remain where be not attempt to enter kraal confess be trifle disappointed at reception regarded a distinctly chilly have afforded little insight into king character trusted that personal interview coupled with sight of resplendent drum major tunic rest of outfit must arouse feeling of greater geniality in breast of savage autocrat so hung about wagon for remainder of day waiting for summons did not come nevertheless although king did not condescend to manifest undue eagerness to see be not exactly left to pine in solitude for several of inhabitant of town came out to gossip with boy while le than three indunas suffered curiosity to overcome dignity so far a to pay informal visit ask countless question for must be remembered that at time of be now writing be very unusual for white man to cross border of own territory into wild one of men who on occasion spoke to have only once before seen individual be amusing to note rapid change of manner in men a conversed with upon first approach began to question with certain curt abruptness easily interpreted a being intended to convey idea that visit be more le of official character while eye be wandering hither thither taking in detail of dress equipment a well a wagon content be not very long before began to enquire what be use of other of course answered question a fully a must not only so also exhibited few of gewgaw hinting certain of might become own property before long although did not then offer present for acceptance being contrary to savage etiquette to do so before king have be interviewed propitiated be of course intensely interested in gun be full of amazement when bowled over carrion crow at distance of six hundred yard with rifle bullet did not hesitate to hint plainly that nothing must possibly be more acceptable to king than gift of one of fire weapon explained however that fire weapon be very powerful very dangerous magic subservient only to white man dared not allow of even to touch one lest must turn upon slay be quite a profoundly impressed by exhibition of power of burning glass several of have taken precaution to include in stock when saw kindle fire with assistance must find word in to express adequately wonder admiration be more than probable that upon return to kraal found mean to convey to king ear impression of wonder white man have revealed to for have scarcely finished breakfast on following morning when messenger arrived at wagon with intimation that king moshesh commanded immediate presence before at once arose unarmed accompanied messenger with piet in close attendance bearing parcel containing present designed to offer for majesty acceptance a approached open gate in palisade number of people men woman be passing in out of whom regarded curiously few of men saluted with upraised right hand exclamation for most part seemed undecided whether to regard a friend enemy therefore preferred for moment to maintain attitude of neutrality immediately inside gate there stood guard of twenty men fully armed with shield assagai knobkerrie under command of induna here be stopped for induna seemed indisposed to allow piet to accompany explained that be body servant that bundle bore contained present designed for king acceptance whereupon be somewhat reluctantly permitted to pas on naturally be sooner inside gate than began to look about first thing struck be admirable arrangement have be made for defence of place in case of attack for while top of palisade be on outside about fifteen foot above surface of ground on inside have be backed up with earth forming platform about twelve foot wide just high enough for man of average height to see between sharpened point while at height of about four foot above level of platform there be continuous row of slit about eight inch high by two inch wide about nine inch apart obvious purpose of be to afford occupant of platform opportunity to thrust with spear at foe attempting to scale palisade from outside without unduly exposing approach to summit of platform be obtained by continuous flight of rough step cut in earth all along face next foot of step be road of about twelve foot wide then came outer row of hut between next row be road about eight foot wide there be four row of hut running entirely round enclosure inside of again be palisade equally a strong a high a first a in case of first palisade also have single gate guarded by twenty fully armed men under command of induna be permitted to pas through second gate unchallenged having done found in open square of about five acre in extent near far side of be seven hut house

person belonging to royal family especially invited by king chief witch doctor king own bodyguard consisting of one hundred specially picked men under command of induna who also filled office of chief adviser prime minister to king at moment of entrance not person be visible in square except guard at gate few second later twenty soldier under command of very splendid looking officer emerged from one of building took up position on side of chair hewn out of solid block of wood draped with magnificent lion skin kaross stood dozen pace in front of itunkulu men be finest looking body of savage warrior have up till then ever seen one of being quite a tall a far more firmly knit than while chief be truly magnificent man standing at least six foot two on bare foot with limb frame of hercules be dressed in leopard skin muchas with bracelet armlet garter anklet of cow tail wore keshlas man carried long shield three throwing assagai in left hand while in right held stabbing assagai with terrible double edged blade about six inch wide eighteen inch long commanding officer be similarly armed in addition to leopard skin mucha wore leopard skin cloak necklace of lion teeth claw headdress made of bead ostrich feather man of twenty one savage warrior showed upon person scar of many wound carried with pride of bearing forbade to display slightest sign of consciousness of presence chapter six moshesh king of basuto minute later curtain of reed matting that hung in doorway of itunkulu be thrust aside man came forth be slightly above medium stature trifle lighter in colour than average basuto be much more simply attired than officer of guard clothing consisting simply of leopard skin mucha lion skin mantle assured dignity of carriage expression of arrogant pride upon well formed feature must of have sufficed to tell that man be none other than moshesh king of basuto nation even have guard not given royal salute by raising stabbing assagai aloft in right hand a thundered out word bayete a for have not remotest notion of kind of salutation majesty must expect from therefore contented by standing at attention in military fashion giving military salute action be certainly very expressive one seemed to meet with royal approval for king acknowledged by slightest possible uplifting of right hand a seated in chair guard formed up behind then gazing at steadfastly for moment said s ' bon umulungu then without allowing time to make stereotyped reply continued for what purpose have ye come hither into country have business in far north said to reach destination be necessary for to pas through thy country therefore have come hither to offer present to ask thy permission to pas through thy country hunt therein au commented king in tone of displeasure like not if give thee leave to travel hunt in basutoland others of thy countryman will claim same privilege will end in so many coming that there will be room left for people be not same apprehension caused tembu pondos griquas to arise unite in attempt to drive white man into sea be said apprehension be quite unjustified english have thought no desire intention to steal land of black man own land be amply large enough for need kafir must not believe therefore treacherously arose swept down upon white man land attacking isolated farm murdering inhabitant own parent died upon spear of griquas have black men gained by treachery nothing have lost everything thousand of have perished in war of retribution have provoked end of be that by way of further punishment a warning to others white man have seized land driven out of ejaculated king again so have heard tell thee again white man that like not if be a thou sayest that thine own land be large enough for thy need why hast thou not remained there why comest thou to country because answered a have already said have business in far north to get there must need pas through basutoland what be thy business in far north demanded moshesh have right to know since thou sayest that necessitates passage through country think not said nevertheless will tell thee since matter be secret when southern kafir took up spear to drive white men into sea father farm be one of last attacked slew parent burnt down house drove off cattle leaving with only sufficient mean to buy wagon ox weapon to undertake hunting expedition land remains be mine have not wherewithal to put fresh stock upon therefore nothing remains for to hunt ivory so procure mean to purchase fresh stock also be hoping to find gold most of be anxious to find white 'ntombozaan who be captured carried off by kafir ou ejaculated king now begin to understand at first feared that thy business be to spy out nature of land in country so that if be found suitable thou other white men might come in try to take from since thou dost indeed merely desire to pas through give thee free leave to do so more readily that learn thou didst help people by slaying leopard be troubling be well o king thank thee said now in acknowledgment of thy friendliness ask thine acceptance of certain present beckoned piet to approach with parcel forthwith proceeded to open trouser be on top of parcel a unfolded turned about showing off gold braid saw king eye begin to glisten for finery appeal quite a strongly to savage a doe to child took garment in hand inspected gold braid narrowly seemed more than half inclined to insinuate into article there then dignity rose superior to strain upon heavy a be with sigh handed trouser over to captain of guard to hold for then with suitable flourish displayed drum major tunic in bravery of soiled scarlet tarnished gold lace a turned about to exhibit varied splendour even iron discipline to guard be subjected so far broke down a to elicit from low wao of admiration a for king did not attempt to conceal delight even forgetting so far a to direct induna attention to beauty for several minute continued to fondle coat seeming quite unable to allow so precious thing to pas out of own hand at length however created diversion by producing belt bayonet withdrawing latter from sheath explaining that be used a sort of rapier also received due meed of appreciation royal glance still clung fondly to tunic therefore produced cocked hat with plume of feather putting upon own head for moment to show how ought to be worn then handing to king who immediately clapped upon own pate kept there finally produced shaving mirror of king at first seemed somewhat afraid pronouncing bekulu betagati great powerful magic when have succeeded in making thoroughly understand what be be a delighted a child sitting in chair intently studying own countenance for several minute then bursting into rapturous laughter when first acute spasm of delight at seeing own physiognomy reflected in mirror have passed suggested to king that if must like to try on new garment must be very pleased to instruct a to proper method of getting into offer instantly accepted must have donned clothes there then in presence of guard if have not whisperingly hinted that must be much more effective to get into in privacy of own house then reappear en grande tenue majesty immediately recognised force of thereupon retreated to interior of itunkulu taking clothes with there in feverish haste proceeded to array under direction by miracle garment fitted almost a though have be made for for be at time still young man have not yet begun to put on flesh poor man must have felt horribly hot uncomfortable in unaccustomed rig for perspiration literally streamed from matter be about to appear before eye of faithful subject at least portion of bodyguard who must not fail to talk about matter to rest of people apparelled in unimaginable splendour trifle a little discomfort from excessive heat be a nothing compared with sensation expected to produce really when at length be completely rigged in tunic trouser with cocked hat on head belt about waist drawn bayonet in hand appearance although just trifle incongruous to critical eye be well calculated to produce profound impression upon unsophisticated subject a be evidenced by note of admiration rang unmistakably in ecstatic shout of bayete with guard greeted upon reappearance strutted up down compound for few minute showing off fine feather called chief induna to instructed man in presence be to be permitted to go wherever pleased in basutoland stay in country a long a pleased kill a much game a chose then dismissing rather abruptly retreated to interior of itunkulu a afterwards learned sent for wife that might behold in unaccustomed bravery have be lucky enough to make exceedingly favourable impression upon king be perfectly evident by what magic intelligence must instantaneously become disseminated among people know not yet so be for while upon approach to town have be quite exceptional for native to salute upon departure from man met punctiliously gave 'nkos ' a passed in le than hour after return to wagon induna arrived from town accompanied by couple of native leading pair of superb basuto pony stallion mare unbroken a present from king a basuto horse be far away finest horse in south africa pair presented to be exceptionally fine animal of kind gift be exceedingly valuable one although being unbroken anticipated plenty of trouble with before must be of use to may say here that in anticipation be very agreeably disappointed for although be a wild a deer when first brought to took in hand forthwith by dint of patience making pet of soon have so docile that must come at call within month have backed after valuable a be for breeding purpose be not of very much use to personally being scarcely up to weight nevertheless frequently rode for hour two just to keep in training to ease other horse little be coal black called respectively jack jill not very high flown name perhaps exceedingly handy there be good deal of singing dancing going on in town night rumpus being so great that be well on into small hour before subsided sufficiently to allow to get to sleep on following morning learned through boy piet so great have be king gratification at result of interview with that have given ten from own private herd a feast in celebration of arrival anxious to press forward upon journey anxious also to get away from moshesh kraal while relation be so exceedingly cordial sent message to king early upon following morning requesting permission to depart instead of receiving gracious assent to request be somewhat perturbed to see moshesh splendidly mounted attired in new rig out accompanied by ten dozen indunas about thousand of troop mounted filing out of gate heading straight for wagon for to be quite candid south african savage be little uncertain in mood man who be to day in high favour may a likely a not find staked out on ant heap to morrow to die awful death of ant in revenge for unknown unintended offence upon arrival of cavalcade be quickly reassured by cordial tone of king greeting respect with indunas saluted presently moshesh informing that be about to hold review of own especial regiment of lifeguard invited to accompany witness evolution of course be very exceptional display of royal favour although be anxious to press forward upon journey there be obviously nothing for to accept king invitation with good grace outward sign of gratification at same time must not avoid suspicion that there must be something behind such signal mark of favour presently got inkling of what be when a piet led up horse saddled ready for to mount king said be told white man that posse wonderful fire weapon with can slay at distance far beyond to strongest of warrior can hurl assagai be that truth be truth o king said must like to see king intimated that must whereupon directed piet to bring rifle together with powder horn belt with pouch containing bullet wad percussion cap be already buckled round waist upon receiving weapon held up for majesty to look at keeping however in own hand did not suit moshesh at must need handle therefore rather unwillingly must confess offered gun to first taking care to remove cap lower hammer down on to nipple for piece be loaded be particularly anxious that accident must happen unobtrusively however a deed be done action did not escape sharp eye of king turned upon quickly with demand why did do white man because said holding up percussion cap be very powerful magic obedient only to white man without fire weapon be a harmless a stick with fire weapon be deadly not to be handled with impunity by anyone rightful owner therefore since wish to see rifle take into own hand must need remove magic else must turn upon do serious hurt possibly slay au ejaculated king regarding rifle doubtfully not offering to take into own hand like not take away will not touch thing be more dangerous than leopard robbed of cub yet must fain see what can do therefore bring with thee white man may be that a go may meet leopard lion buck for thee to slay nay said be not likely that of beast thou hast named will show in open in presence of so many men horse nevertheless will take rifle for even though beast must show may be able to shoot bird two so saying swung into saddle accepting king invitation to ride beside proceeded at gallop with thousand bodyguard thundering along in rear watching opportunity be not long before contrived to set rifle to half cock replace cap on nipple without attracting king attention way lay along what at beginning be simply very willow depression between two low ridge a proceeded depression rapidly became deeper ridge higher until by time that have ridden mile be sweeping through ravine with high steep bush clad slope rising to right left of slope terminating about mile farther on in couple of lofty perpendicular rocky cliff six hundred foot high about three hundred foot apart forming sort of natural gateway to circular basin about three mile in diameter floor of be perfectly level clothed with long lush grass still looking quite fresh green with only few small widely scattered clump of bush here there explained king a dashed through natural gateway at head of galloping regiment be exercise ground where bring regiment from time to time to exercise in tactic of war very excellent place be for such purpose agreed a eye took in wide area of level unbroken ground there be room enough here in to fight battle of quite respectable dimension what be moving object yonder interrupted eagerly a gaze be arrested by group of ten dozen dark dot moving slowly among long grass at opposite extremity of valley surely must be buffalo be greatly mistaken be not mistaken be buffalo have marvellously sharp eye white man returned king then flung up hand galloping regiment came to sudden halt reining in sweating horse so sharply a to throw animal back upon haunch at same moment also reined up then king called indunas round instructing one of to take fifty men with ride round outside of basin until reached only other exit from valley block so that buffalo might not escape through while second induna be also to take fifty men block exit through have just passed thus rendering escape from valley impossibility for a king now informed surrounding cliff be everywhere vertical so that animal save perhaps baboon must possibly enter leave basin except by one other of two natural gateway in cliff now white man said king turning to with sparkling eye pointing toward buffalo there be opportunity kill two three of with fire weapon then will see how basuto hunt buffalo very well said will see what can do will have to get very much nearer to than be at present for even fire weapon will not kill at distance a demanded king then how close must get before will kill oh said perhaps one sixth of present distance of buffalo king be evidently disappointed to learn that there be limit to range of rifle for moment seemed inclined to regard somewhat contemptuously without wasting further word upon so very ineffective weapon proceeded to issue order to other indunas in obedience to regiment divided into two one half riding to left other to right stringing out single file close in under shadow of overhanging cliff where quickly became so inconspicuous a to be practically invisible then accompanied by body of twenty picked men who spread out in open order in rear king advanced toward buffalo at slow walking pace fortunately happened that wind be blowing across basin directly from buffalo toward consequently be long while before brute became aware of presence indeed have arrived within about three quarter of mile of before betrayed sign of uneasiness even then be toward upper end of valley not toward that attention seemed to be directed be bulangu party that scent said king referring to squadron of men whom have sent round outside basin to bar upper exit sure enough minute two later whole herd swung round began to move toward moment that occurred of course caught sight of at once came to halt tossing head impatiently lashing flank with tail emitting low moaning bellow of annoyance after short pause however accompanied by display of many indication of rapidly increasing anger herd again began to move toward first at walking pace rapidly merged into trot till finally whole herd broke into gallop a induna bulangu party appeared at far end of plain now said to king a herd rapidly approached within range will show what fire weapon be capable of doing watch old bull who be leading herd see what happens perhaps have better dismount for horse be unused to fire weapon when shoot may possibly swerve suddenly throw nay answered king will not dismount for now that have warned will know what to expect will not be taken unawares gathered in slack of single bridle tightly gripped animal between knee sat prepared for whatsoever might happen herd meanwhile have approached to within about eight hundred yard of be thundering straight in direction at somewhat ungainly nevertheless rapid gallop with head down tail up giving vent to low angry bellow a came be riding prince upon whom knew must absolutely depend therefore instead of dismounting turned to right with touch of heel slight pressure of rein very nearly broadside on to approaching herd flung rifle up to shoulder be rather long shot at eight hundred yard even buffalo coming head on present comparatively small target especially when grass happens to be breast high nevertheless got sight to bear dead upon centre of bull forehead about halfway between horn eye watching for proper moment pressed trigger flash report of piece be immediately followed by sound of fierce stamping plunging close at hand out of corner of eye saw that king high mettled stallion be fighting hard to break away make bolt for then just a bull stumbled recovered finally turned complete somersault heard loud thud of bullet on thick skull knew that shot have got home w u ejaculated king giving vent to long drawn expression of amazement yena chiele be hit fire weapon be indeed bekulu great magic beast fell dead a though smitten by lightning can do again white man be merely chance will see said a rammed wad down upon fresh powder charge slipped bullet in after a set trigger to half cock saw that powder be well up in nipple therefore slipping on cap setting trigger to full cock again levelled piece bowled over leading buffalo be enough exclaimed king soberly wonder that conquered tribe who rose against if be armed like now child continued throwing up hand a addressed little body of immediate follower show white man how basuto kill buffalo herd have originally numbered eleven nine of be still upon foot with vindictive fearlessness be chief characteristic of cape buffalo charging straight down upon party at word therefore from induna who be in command of contingent nine of warrior flung away shield casting assagai gripping single bangwan stabbing assagai with of be also armed drove heel into horse flank dashed forward to meet bellowing foe to see nine men fearlessly charge rushing herd be distinctly thrilling sight for none knew better than implacably savage nature of brute be about to contend with deadliness of peril to be so light heartedly exposing yet not one of manifested slightest disposition to shirk encounter possibly knew that to perish upon horn of buffalo must be preferable to punishment surely awaited must disgrace king by showing fear in presence of white man if rider scorned to exhibit fear horse be animated by such scruple for when have approached to within about two hundred foot of charging buffalo low fierce grunting bellow blazing eye sharp threatening horn of latter seemed to strike such panic into suddenly a though by concerted arrangement wheeled sharply round despite rider utmost effort bolted ignominiously in direction have by time succeeded in recharging rifle slipping on fresh cap raised piece to shoulder held ready to shoot upon instant dared do so without risk of hitting basuto for tragedy seemed imminent moshesh who be now with difficulty restraining own mount from bolting stopped wait white man watch enjoined a word passed lip saw nine warrior throw very cleverly from back of bolting horse wheel round a upon pivot dash back until be immediately in path of furious buffalo seemed now to have marked down a destined victim little body of men of whom king formed part in twinkling of eye warrior have selected one buffalo in particular a own especial foe have planted with uplifted bangwan square in brute path while buffalo promptly accepting challenge responded to with fierce bellow savage flourishings of terrible horn three breathless second later leading buffalo with head lowered slightly turned to allow of more effective thrust of sharp upturned point of murderous horn be upon antagonist caught breath sharply fully expecting to see man impaled at least tossed high in air instead beheld a splendid exhibition of courage alertness a think have ever witnessed for man firmly standing ground to very last fraction of second sprang nimbly to one side at precise moment when a seemed point of horn be about to be dashed into naked body then a great beast thundered past within reach of hand down flashed formidable broad bladed bangwan with so sure strong stroke that buffalo crashed headlong to ground dead with fierce heart cleft in twain in like manner perished seven of companion ninth buffalo wreaking revenge for death of other eight in peculiarly ghastly manner precisely how tragedy happened none of knew for chanced that attention be concentrated elsewhere at moment sharp shrill scream of mortal agony sounding out on hot air apprised that something untoward be happening glancing quickly in direction from sound proceeded be horrified to see that one unfortunate warrior have somehow failed to avoid buffalo charge be now writhing transfixed on one of horn of great brute next instant flung poor fellow high in air then with savage bellow swerved came thundering straight toward king where sat on horse close together watching exciting scene be being enacted before startled cry from induna commanding squad be at moment in special charge of king person caused eleven men who have until now sat quiescent upon horse to fling hastily to ground dash forward to protect monarch there be time for buffalo be within dozen yard of must see that have singled out moshesh a particular object of attack attracted doubt by majesty scarlet tunic king might of course have escaped by promptly wheeling horse galloping away pride self esteem must have suffered mortal wound have be driven to flight in presence of white man although there be certain quality in hurried glance to right left seemed to tell that meditated something of sort rather than stand ground take chance fortunately have reloaded rifle minute two earlier now saw opportunity to render king important service by sparing ignominy of flight therefore flung up piece pressed trigger buffalo enormous most formidable brute stumbled fell dead literally at horse foot that be well done belungu exclaimed king with just faintest suggestion of feeling of relief in tone of voice be marvellously well done for thy quickness sureness of eye hand must have be overthrown basuto might have be obliged to choose king betala to induna let see to yonder clumsy fool who allowed buffalo to catch if be not dead let four of thy men make litter carry back to kraal induna saluted beckoning to four of men proceeded in person to examine unlucky wight who have be gored such examination be scarcely necessary for even from where sat be apparent that unfortunate man injury be of such dreadful character that survival be impossible few minute later betala returned to report that victim be quite dead be well commented king briefly let carrion be moved out of way let regiment form up be put through evolution whereupon at word from induna man dismounted uncoiling hobble rope slipped noose round one of ankle of corpse attached other end to horse girth mounting galloped off toward edge of plateau dragging body after until be removed to sufficient distance to be quite out of way of manoeuvring troop when be abandoned to become prey to jackal vulture meanwhile troop be recalled formed up in centre of plain where king critically inspected while at invitation rode beside feel bound to say that seldom have seen finer body of men savage civilised after be not to be greatly wondered at seeing that a king own special regiment of bodyguard be naturally very pick flower of entire nation inspection occupied about quarter of hour at conclusion regiment a whole be put through number of movement executed very creditably then be divided into two equal part be marched to opposite extremity of plateau when faced about charging down upon other engaged in very realistic sham fight lasting for best part of hour resulting in quite number of casualty several of men being unhorsed sustaining more le serious injury after regiment re formed returned to kraal at gallop party being detailed to remain behind bring in injured at more sober pace soon found that moshesh like other savage possessed full share of vanity be quite unable to conceal also be evident that be inordinately proud of regiment be not above fishing for compliment upon therefore dutifully did what be manifestly expected of immensely gratified majesty by being a complimentary a possibly must be without unduly straining truth when be said done have very shrewd suspicion that while moshesh might perhaps be credited with genuine desire to show honour by inviting to witness review of troop be principally animated by craving for own glorification incidentally be glad to seize occasion a affording early opportunity to exhibit before people in magnificence of new toggery chapter seven strange occurrence in wilderness about hour after sunrise on following morning again presented before king with request that be permitted to continue journey be very cordially received by majesty who again thanked for service have rendered on preceding day by slaying buffalo so saving from ignominy of flight almost equally unpleasant alternative of submitting to be charged by brute in privacy of itunkulu be much more expansive than have be on previous day in presence of indunas unhesitatingly admitting have be compelled to accept of above mentioned alternative must have suffered serious loss of prestige in eye of own people informed that upon return to kraal on preceding day have given instruction that body of men must be dispatched to bring in carcass of slaughtered buffalo have be done now made offer that if pleased must have skin carefully dressed skull horn preserved so that might take whole back with to civilisation a trophy upon return of course thanked for exceedingly generous offer gladly accepted so far a three buffalo killed by be concerned therewith parted upon very best of term king according full permission to go where pleased in country remain in a long a chose kill game have mind to while made majesty inexpressibly proud happy by presenting with burning glass showing how to kindle fire by mean then ceremonial visit being at end returned to wagon ordered ox to be inspanned resumed journey ensuing fortnight be spent in progressing slowly northward through part of basutoland lie between machacha mountain range what be now known a caledon river hunting way although sport such a be be good enabling to bag five lion eight leopard three splendid specimen of rhinoceros although buck of kind buffalo be plentiful enough to have enabled to fill wagon with skin horn have desired to do so sport be not kind desired be out after elephant basutoland be not elephant country therefore at end of fortnight crossed headwater of caledon entered what in after year became orange free state still later orange river colony thence passing between two mountain range later received name of witte roode bergen struck wide expanse of level open country through stream flowed in northerly direction along left bank of trekked for full week not only for sake of water richer grass growing in immediate vicinity of stream also because if there be game in neighbourhood be sure to be found within easy reach of water here got first slice of luck potting brace of elephant of magnificent tusker a well a rhinoceros three giraffe seven cock ostrich in perfect plumage then crossing wilge river two day later klip river entered country now known a transvaal klip river being a matter of fact headwater of vaal now found in very hunter paradise for country be literally swarming with game of almost description consisting of eland gemsbok springbok reitbok antelope of kind often in herd numbering several thousand also that curious looking beast gnu of now got first glimpse troop of quagga zebra giraffe rhinoceros lion leopard ostrich hippopotamus crocodile in river still very few elephant so shy that be only with utmost difficulty succeeded in securing three within first fortnight after crossing klip river during time although enjoyed splendid hunting did not meet with single adventure worthy of record met very few native while whom encountered be either very friendly disposed on one hand on other too shy to come near saw several very curious sight one two of may perhaps be excused for recording for instance about week after crossing klip river found striking northward across tract of practically level country dotted here there with herd of various kind of game took little notice of beyond moving leisurely out of way when seemed to be approaching rather too closely for liking piet be a usual riding forward about mile ahead of wagon on lookout for ostrich elephant spoor when sighted troop of great bird be seeking two mile ahead of immediately in line with range of curious flat topped hill be distinctive feature of south african landscape away to left about quarter of mile distant be small kopje about two hundred foot high consisting of outcrop of rock side of although almost perpendicular be so rough that believed might be easily climbed a summit of kopje promised to afford excellent spying place from to observe movement of ostrich turned horse head toward approached at gallop reining up at base upon arriving at foot of kopje at once saw that might be scaled without slightest difficulty for not only be rocky projection so bold rough a almost to amount to step on southern shady side of hill be face that approached multitude of tough fern like plant be sprouting from interstice affording excellent hold for hand therefore dismounting handing horse bridle to piet bidding remain where be in shadow of rock took rifle in one hand with small very powerful telescope always carried when out after game slung over shoulder proceeded to scale kopje reaching summit without difficulty found a have expected that lofty perch afforded magnificent outlook over plain in direction ostrich whose movement particularly desired to watch be now in plain view with aid of telescope must not only distinguish cock from hen must also perceive that plumage of former be in very pink of perfection in addition to ostrich there be several other exceedingly interesting object sight clearly distinguishable from summit of kopje of hint be obtainable from level of plain below for instance upon removing telescope from eye after exhaustive study of movement behaviour of great bird allowed gaze to travel over surface of grassy plain immediately before presently became aware of solitary antelope of specie be quite new to grazing at distance of two hundred yard from base of kopje creature be about size of bushbok be dirty white in colour carried pair of horn about two half foot in length slightly curved enormously thick at base strongly ridged for about length thence sweeping smoothly away to point a sharp apparently a of bayonet most curious thing about however be that coat be long thick like of goat apparently very much finer more silky be speculating upon possibility of capturing domesticating few specimen with view of testing commercial value of hair when suddenly animal ceased feeding threw up head twitched long ear nervously to fro proceeded to sniff air anxiously turning head hither thither a did so finally faced right round almost broadside on to stood motionless very erect with body seemingly braced in readiness to bound away upon confirmation of evident suspicion that enemy be somewhere in immediate neighbourhood knew that suspected enemy must not possibly be for be dead to leeward of animal therefore proceeded to reconnoitre with view of ascertaining whether danger be threatening from other quarter presently became aware of certain suspicious looking movement of long grass about hundred yard distant suggestive of presence of animal of kind approaching antelope cautiously along sort of wavering serpentine course when first discovered movement creature caused be at such distance that be completely concealed among long grass even from elevation occupied minute later be able to catch occasional glimpse of darkish grey body thickly dotted with irregularly shaped spot of lighter grey slinking toward antelope still remained perfectly motionless expectantly watchful course pursued by approaching creature be such a gradually to bring into full view from where crouched on summit of kopje at length made out to be also animal hitherto unknown to about size of half grown leopard of very similar build shape except tail be only about foot long thick of uniform dimension right to extremity ear be tufted like of lynx indeed in general appearance greatly resembled lynx excepting that be very much larger be very interesting to watch progress of little drama be tragedy be rapidly unfolding almost at very foot be curious to see what step threatened antelope must take to provide for safety for be certain that creature be fully conscious of fact that danger threatened why did not seek safety in flight a most creature of antelope specie be wont to do did subtle instinct warn flight must prolong agony that superior endurance of approaching enemy must cause to be run down brought to bay sooner later that best chance lay in facing danger now before strength must be worn out by prolonged exhausting flight apparently such instinct conviction must have possessed for antelope remained standing motionless a though carved out of stone only sign of life betrayed being continuous quivering of nostril occasional slight twitching of forward pointing ear while enemy slunk sinuously toward foot by foot like cat stalking bird at length must be destroyer arrived within about twenty foot of quarry at distance suspected that animal be able to obtain at least occasional partial glimpse of other when halted seemed to be gathering together for sudden rush while antelope still stood a though rooted to spot why did not latter take to heel run wondered be that creature be paralysed with terror so unable to make effort to save thought not for must detect sign of terror indication be in favour of conviction while antelope be undoubtedly fully aware of close proximity of enemy be alertly watchful for next movement on part of latter attitude aspect be in nowise suggestive of feeling of dismay on contrary idea conveyed to be that of reckless temerity yet surely poor misguided beast must never be so foolish a to imagine that stood slightest chance of victory in event of fight be not allowed very much time to ponder question for after pause of about dozen second lynx like creature made sudden lightning like dash at motionless antelope fully expected to see go down instantly with formidable fang of enemy buried deep in throat not so however for a lithe spotted form darted through grass antelope rose from ground a though shot into air by powerful spring descending fair square upon enemy back four sharp pointed hoof digging viciously through spotted hide extorting scream of mingled rage pain from astonished assailant then so quickly that eye must hardly follow movement second vigorous leap landed antelope fully twenty foot away while power expended in leap sent screaming snarling enemy rolling sprawling helplessly in grass well done antelope thought now be chance to make clean bolt for before enemy have time to recover from amazement not bit of evidently very last thing that antelope contemplated be flight for sooner did hoof touch earth than swung round like lightning facing toward adversary while latter picked up with four little stream of blood trickling down side proceeded afresh to attack again crept up to within short distance of waiting antelope paused suddenly dashed in again antelope leaped into air alighted upon enemy back inflicting four fresh wound with stabbing hoof sprang away spurning snarling foe with such violence once more be sent sprawling in grass performance be repeated eight ten time until at length became quite evident that antelope be getting very much better of fight for thus far have not received single scratch while enemy back be punctured over with wound although none of be very deep be bleeding freely in aggregate be probably very painful be clear that matter be fast nearing point at grey spotted beast must be more than willing to regard fight a drawn battle for bout left le willing to continue fight plucky little antelope evidently disapproved of half measure be determined to press matter to definite conclusion for when antagonist began to betray disinclination to continue fight no longer waited for onset boldly advanced leaping hither thither with astounding rapidity leap landing nearer enemy until latter be compelled in self defence to continue at length moment arrived when feline lay moaning snarling covered with blood unable unwilling to continue combat then antelope after approaching enemy by usual bewildering series of leap bound stood for several second meditatively regarding finally plucky little beast seemed to come to conclusion that decisive moment have arrived for suddenly placing head between fore leg so that long powerful horn pointed straight at opponent body hurled violently forward like bolt shot from catapult sharp bayonet like horn buried deeply in grey spotted blood smeared body a prolonged yell of agony rent air antelope turned complete somersault over antagonist staggered to foot bewildered unhurt force with final stroke have be delivered having be so tremendous that horn have disengaged by simple process of tearing two ghastly slash in fearfully lacerated carcass of now defunct enemy then after satisfying by sight smell that nothing further be to be feared from victim conqueror bent head resumed grazing a calmly a though nothing have happened extraordinary combat took twenty minute to reach unexpected conclusion then there being nothing to detain longer on summit of slope descended rejoined piet where be patiently awaiting within shadow of rock remounted rode forward appearance at once putting plucky little victor to precipitate flight have mind to secure skin of conquered lynx like creature not only a curiosity interesting memento of rather remarkable occurrence also because of interest to zoologist upon return to civilisation when presently found carcass proved to be so terribly mauled that saw must be impossible to remove pelt otherwise than in fragment so abandoned idea went after ostrich succeeded in securing two full grown cock of troop with result became richer by about ten pound worth of most magnificent plume have ever seen few day later route at time lying through hilly country became question whether must enter long ravine divided range of hill ahead trusting to possibility of being able to pas through emerge at other end whether must be necessary to make rather wide detour round one other extremity of range route through ravine must suit best from point of view provided that did not prove to be cul de sac because led straight in desired direction appeared to be tolerably level also must probably save nearly forty mile therefore ordered jan to outspan upon arrival at mouth of ravine while piet rode on ahead to reconnoitre taking rifle with a usual a well a two dog thunder juno range of hill lying in front of be about twenty mile in length running almost due east west ravine be purpose to explore pierced a nearly a might be in middle running practically north south even at first glance be impressed by remarkable character of place for ravine irresistibly suggested idea at time in more le remote past giant have taken shovel measuring about quarter of mile in width with gigantic tool have cut gap right through range most singular feature of case however be that although gap be undoubtedly there although vast quantity of material must have be removed in order to create there be nothing whatever to show what have become of material floor of gap be quite smooth level unencumbered by boulder debris of kind rocky side be absolutely vertical rising in centre to height of very nearly three thousand foot height maintained for about mile before started to dip toward far end small patch of wait bit other thorn bush sparsely dotted floor of ravine gorge about halfway through there be little grove of mimosa in midst of caught fleeting indistinct glimpse of certain moving thing piet declared be giraffe now have not yet shot giraffe be rather anxious to obtain really good must be nearer truth to say exceptionally fine specimen therefore hastily taking cover behind nearest clump of bush proceeded to approach creature warily until have arrived within about mile of then detecting certain sign of growing uneasiness among attributed to possibility of having sighted moving figure dismounted leaving piet with dog horse well sheltered behind big clump of bush took rifle set off to complete stalk through long grass alone on foot reckoned upon being able to manage without very much difficulty for wind be blowing from west right across ravine while giraffe be upon eastern side be to southward of therefore knew that ought to be able to get quite close to before must wind while grass be tall enough to enable to approach unseen nevertheless although be stalking with utmost caution using wind to guide only raising head to reconnoitre at rare interval with exercise of greatest care be annoyed to observe that uneasiness of quarry be rapidly increasing have ceased to feed be standing at attention with ear switching quickly to fro head continually turning way that a though scented danger of sort must not determine character more important still from direction be coming began to fear that before must get near enough to put in decisive shot must stampede must lose altogether sure enough be precisely what did great bull giraffe evidently leader of herd animal have finally fixed upon a own particular prey suddenly tossing up head breaking away up valley in long lumbering ungainly canter instantly followed by rest of herd be not only intensely annoyed also greatly puzzled at behaviour on part of great long legged long necked creature for must not believe that flight have be result of carelessness on part while stood watching rapidly increasing distance between became aware of curious dimming of atmosphere along top edge of cliff on western side of ravine while be still wondering what might be low murmurous rumbling sound gradually evolved out of faint sigh of breeze over grass through foliage of bush sound a listened rapidly developed into beat of innumerable hoof mingled with bleatings barkings of veritable army of buck of various description then knew that dimming of atmosphere along summit of western cliff be due to cloud of light impalpable dust swept along before great migrating army of game crossing mountain range probably on march in search of water waited to see what must happen when vanguard of army must reach edge of cliff have not very long to wait dust cloud rapidly thickened low rumbling beat of hoof on hard dry soil of hill crest quickly increased in volume until became like thunderous roar of surf upon rock bound shore mingled with continuous cry of countless host of animal herded together under influence of mysterious powerful influence presently advance guard of great army appeared against skyline on edge of beetling cliff almost immediately opposite where be standing first solitary eland then three gemsbok closely followed by seven eight hartebeeste then small troop of quagga upon heel of came herd of fifty klipspringers advanced right up to edge of cliff halted abruptly staring down into ravine below then wheeling sharply to right left threw up head with characteristic cry of dismay took to heel galloped furiously along very edge of cliff in evident effort to escape pressure of great army in rear a first arrival wheeled sped terrified to right left others appeared in increasing number suddenly realising danger sought to escape following in footstep of vanguard while others faced about strove to retreat along way by have come soon became evident however that escape be impossible for even a stood watching effort front rank of main body appeared great compact mass of animal extending fully mile along edge of cliff although be evident that front rank now realised that danger threatened in front be trying to hang back pressure of vast multitude in rear be irresistible foot by foot be pushed forward until in few second be gazing at awful spectacle of hundred of helpless animal being thrust over cliff edge falling to death more than two thousand foot below while air throbbed vibrated with cry of terror be terrible experience to stand there helplessly watch unfortunate creature pouring over cliff like water of cataract to listen to cry a found being irresistibly thrust forward to death to see long rapidly growing pile of dead stretching along foot of cliff there be several variety of animal in great migrating army be being so disastrously wiped out of being of kind set wondering by what extraordinary accident must have become entangled among such incongruous companion for example tightly wedged in among herd of blesbok saw full grown lion forced over cliff only way in must possibly account for presence of beast be upon assumption that have be following herd in springing upon victim have become so closely involved that have found impossible to make way out again have always stoutly maintained that animal posse power of communicating with other what witnessed now only tended to confirm in belief for after thing have be attempting to describe have continued for ten minute suddenly came to end remainder of army have evidently halted for although cry from above still created tremendous volume of sound indicating that innumerable multitude of animal survived up there on top of cliff thunder of trampling hoof have died down to almost nothing while animal instead of being thrust helplessly over edge advanced thereto in little group gazed down into ravine then retired again when have continued for few minute sound of hoof again became audible now hoof be retiring instead of advancing in space of ten minute have become inaudible creature have retired to seek safer road elsewhere then emerging into open beckoning piet who also have quitted cover to join walked over to foot of fatal cliff to examine more closely ghastly pile of carcass lay there by time arrived air be already darkening with vast flock of vulture be gathering to feast thus bountifully provided for lion have seen come hurtling over precipice in company with herd of blesbok happened to be lying in position must get at without very much difficulty determined to have hide if upon examination must prove worth taking accordingly upon arrival of piet clambered up on mound of dead dying animal until reached spot where lion lay doubled up in heap partially buried beneath carcass of animal have fallen on top of be quite dead spine almost other bone in body apparently being broken skin be uninjured so far a must see piet therefore seized one of great fore paw with long pull strong pull pull together contrived to drag clear roll down to bottom of heap to quickly followed proved to be magnificent beast quite young full grown in perfect condition with most formidable set of claw fang smooth glossy hide of rich deep tawny hue splendid mane of so deep tint a to be almost black altogether be specimen well worth having quickly stripped of hide taking also head deposited in close proximity to ant nest in full assurance that industrious little creature must clear skull of particle of flesh in course of few hour then leaving piet to clean skin prepare for packing sprang into saddle taking rifle cantered off down ravine to explore remaining portion of ascertain whether a conjectured there be mean of egress at far end found that a have anticipated ravine gorge passed right through range of hill gave access to open country beyond that route be quite practicable for wagon throughout entire length that by making use of must save distance of about forty mile equivalent of two day trek having satisfied upon point turned horse head proceeded to ride leisurely back to wagon intending to pick up piet lion skin on way have returned about three mile along ravine allowing prince to proceed at own pace with bridle hanging loose upon neck when be aroused from reverie into have fallen by low whinny from horse a suddenly flung up head twitched ear forward directed glance toward point distance ahead to left knew at once that have sighted scented something glancing in direction indicated became aware that be approaching enormous flat boulder have attracted attention two hour earlier on outward journey because of immense size impossibility of accounting satisfactorily for presence just where be now boulder be remarkable for quite reason for whereas when first passed flat top be perfectly bare perceived that in interim have become scene of feverish activity troop of quite hundred monkey seeming to have taken possession of there be of course nothing very extraordinary in strangeness of matter consisted in fact that be hard at work apparently in concert with troop of brother down below who seemed to be rushing to fro between rock adjacent clump of thorn bush touch on bridle brought prince to halt then produced telescope brought to bear upon busy party when perceived to amazement that gang of monkey who be rushing to fro between clump of bush boulder be engaged in collecting dragging to rock great number of branch of thorn be passing up to comrade upon surface of rock that in turn a seemed to be constructing scherm hedge of thorn working in such feverish haste that life might have be depending upon speedy completion behaviour of active gang of simian be so extraordinary determined to wait see thing out therefore remained where be at such distance that presence must not be likely to disturb alarm kept telescope focused upon with result soon began to realise from behaviour rapid a be movement monkey be nevertheless taking considerable pain to preserve silence noticed that none of attempted to drag thorn after through grass branch be carried at arm length overhead when be passed up to on top of rock be not permitted to scrape grate against surface of rock be carefully held away from although be evident that of monkey got more le severely pricked during process also observed that monkey who be actually engaged in construction of scherm laid bunch of thorn in place with elaborate care a appeared to with quite amazing skill cunning ten twelve minute after have come to halt scherm be finished then came end to silence monkey have be at such pain to observe during progress of work for with completion creature set up sudden chattering howling shrieking distinctly reached even at distance of good half mile with outbreak of clamour hand beat precipitate retreat from surface of rock arranged in circle round down below at sufficient distance away to enable to see anything might happen on top of boulder what asked must happen up there why have monkey taken trouble to construct fine scherm why in name of fortune be exerting to create such terrific row answer be not long in coming for a sat there intently scanning scene through telescope saw head about six foot of body of enormous python upreared from inside scherm appearance being greeted by yell of delight from monkey caused prince to snort stamp with excitement saw huge reptile up rear still further attempt to get out of scherm must not do so without crawling over hedge of thorn moment that body touched recoiled immense jaw gaped open tongue flickered in out must in imagination hear angry hiss a plainly a must hear howl of derision defiance with monkey greeted appearance then understood believed understood whole thing python doubtless have lair somewhere in immediate vicinity of boulder flat top of be probably favourite basking place troop of monkey perhaps gambolling about on face of adjacent cliff have chanced to see huge snake lying asleep upon rock instantly seizing opportunity to take enemy at disadvantage have with diabolical ingenuity hastened to enclose creature in circular fence of thorn from now seemed that must find impossible to escape for saw make several attempt at various point around circumference of scherm upon occasion when essayed to crawl over thorn shrank back baffled by innumerable sharp point everywhere met at length after have watched unavailing effort for about quarter of hour cantered up to rock putting monkey to flight amid chorus of angry protest after careful survey proceeded to climb to top taking precaution to carry rifle with now found that scherm constructed of small branch of formidable thorn thorn being nearly three inch long sharp pointed a needle be about waist high yard in thickness ten yard in diameter completely hemming in great python who be now wideawake rapidly circling interior of prison in atrociously bad temper vainly seeking spot through might force way escape monkey have evidently known quite well what be about instinct observation have taught once completely surrounded by ring of thorn creature must not possibly escape because effort must result in self infliction of so many severe wound that must rather remain prisoner than persevere be precisely what be happening moment that in attempting to crawl over barrier python ponderous weight be thrown upon encircling fence long sharp thorn pierced in twenty thirty place already a circled inside enclosure be leaving broad trail of blood behind emitting powerful sickening musky odour only endured with difficulty creature glared at murderously time came opposite in frantic circling of scherm once made determined effort to reach thorn be too much for finally when be at length convinced that must not possibly escape levelled rifle sent bullet crashing through enormous head instantly thereafter beating hasty retreat from top of rock in order to avoid terrific threshing of convolution now in death agony sent thorn flying in direction chapter eight exciting day by time that piet got back to wagon be within hour of sunset therefore decided to remain for night where be grass being good outspan situated within mile of considerable stream of water with must lose touch upon entering gorge since river turned eastward immediately opposite spot where be outspanned although decided not to move wagon until morrow be not disposed to remain personally inactive for have observed that about two mile to eastward river flowed through slight depression have thus become converted into water vley wide sheet of willow water where thought not improbable that might find few widgeon to afford welcome change from buck meat have now become almost continuous fare moreover have begun to break to saddle two pony moshesh have given have already advanced so far in matter of education that must allow to mount regarded present a favourable opportunity to give jack stallion little gentle exercise therefore instructed piet to shift saddle from prince to jack taking double barrelled sporting gun few cartridge mounted cantered away along river bank with thunder juno two dog bounding gaily along on hand with jack pulling hard upon snaffle doing utmost to break away for be so fresh a to be almost unmanageable good brisk five mile gallop over veld to farther extremity of vley however somewhat calmed exuberant spirit when at length dismounted youngster be placid enough to be quite willing to follow at heel with bridle resting loosely upon neck to stand still when be allowed to trail upon ground sun have already vanished in haze of regal purple hanging low along western horizon when at length managed to bag three brace of widgeon have be hoping for with neatly strung together by foot slung across jack shoulder in front of saddle be just preparing to mount canter away back to camp when looming monstrously through thin grey mist be insidiously rising from veld beheld long procession of enormous form gradually resolving out of fog wreath about mile away vague shapeless a be vast ghostly object knew at once that must only be elephant coming over veld to great pool to drink bathe at once determined to ascertain if possible how many of there be for estimated that there must already be between twenty thirty in sight while others be momentarily emerging into view from out veil of mist therefore instead of mounting thus rendering more conspicuous than be already remained on foot headed for nearest clump of bush with jack two dog following at heel intention being to conceal following behind convenient screen thence observe movement note number of approaching elephant have scarcely advanced thirty pace when there arose sudden commotion in long grass almost under foot terrific uproar of angry grunt squeal rent evening stillness sounder of hog consisting of boar three sow upwards of score of half grown young have be lying in grass rose to foot dashed noisily away sudden violent disturbance startling jack to extent so completely upsetting equanimity that flung up head swerved away before must grasp bridle with squeal of consternation took to heel dashed off full pelt in direction of distant wagon while two dog wild with excitement went off in chase of pig leaving to own device to be left like alone on foot in strange country good five mile from wagon with darkness of moonless misty night already gathering about be just trifle awkward perhaps for be hungry tired five mile walk through long grass must be something beyond joke with river to guide on one hand hill on other must not very well miss way while a for pony must probably return to wagon dog must certainly find a soon a be tired of chasing pig so shouldering gun stepped out toward clump of bush for be bound presently took up position within heavy shadow where must be pretty effectually concealed while must at same time observe movement of elephant luckily be still so far away when disturbance caused by pig occurred that have taken notice of came steadily on led by enormous tusker presently made way well into deepest part of pool where after drinking stood for time spraying body with water spouted from trunk did best to count before entire herd have arrived upon scene have fallen quite dark so that what with darkness fog constant movement of animal found task utter impossibility came to conclusion that from what must see hear there must be nearly quite hundred of then a stood motionless invisible in deep shadow of clump of bush soft swishing sound in long grass grew increasingly frequent round in misty starlight caught frequent sudden glimpse of indeterminate form gliding ghost like toward water be evidently recognised drinking place for most of game in neighbourhood at length when have be standing there for about twenty minute two pair of lambent orb loomed up through long grass thunder juno came wriggling apologetically to foot having apparently made way back to spot where have deserted tracked thence by scent have by time seen wanted to see rather that be possible to see therefore with low murmured call to two dog set out to walk back through misty landscape to wagon taking star for guide since fog have by time become so thick that be difficult to distinguish anything beyond hundred yard distant in direction fortunately have walked little more than mile when shout in piet high pitched voice reached ear presently guided by shout in reply hottentot hove in sight mounted upon tempest leading errant jack by bridle latter having galloped straight to wagon a have fully expected must half hour later rode into camp without further adventure first thing in order after arrival be of course dinner found quite ready when rode into camp piece de resistance consisting of widgeon have shot piet have found still hanging across pony withers when master jack arrived in camp have have sense enough to hand over to jan to prepare then after dinner elephant gun rifle be brought forth from wagon thoroughly cleaned by light of camp fire while be being done piet anxiously discussed programme for doings of morrow finally settled upon more le definite plan made arrangement necessary for carrying into effect after fire be made up ox be driven in tethered to trek tow a precaution against possible attack by lion hand turned in night passed uneventfully quietly save for constant barking of jackal baboon occasional cry of leopard roar of lion have by time grown quite accustomed to such sound a be not in least disturbed by even dog disdaining to take slightest notice of except when author approached within certain fairly well defined limit thunder juno seemed to have mutually agreed be too near then indeed guardian must respond with low warning growl if offender drew still nearer rapidly merged into deafening clamour of savage bark effectually aroused everybody on night in question marauder gave wagon wide berth probably there be sufficiency of game near water hole to supply want without necessity for to approach hateful blaze of camp fire rest be undisturbed with appearance of first gleam of dawn in eastern sky however three black crawled out from underneath wagon made up fire afresh fetched water from river proceeded to prepare breakfast for piet have agreed upon wisdom of getting upon spoor of elephant a early a possible in order that greater part of travelling might be done before heat became oppressive be about quarter to seven o'clock when having breakfasted completed final preparation piet swung into saddle started for water hole at easy canter jan instruction being to follow with wagon until must reach certain signal must leave behind be to be intimation that have trekked far enough must outspan until received further order piet be mounted on punch chestnut thoroughly steady reliable animal carried provision for expedition ammunition elephant gun while rode prince carried other half of ammunition rifle a well a stout double edged hunting knife wore in sheath attached to belt thunder juno accompanied a usual like sensible animal that be trotted quietly along close to horse heel saving strength for what be possibly to come later instead of wasting a in younger le experienced day by dashing hither thither in exuberance of spirit over utterly unnecessary extent of ground going at easy pace reached farther extremity of pool in about three quarter of hour at once picked up spoor of elephant without least trouble be very difficult to form close estimate of number of animal in herd by examining spoor be certain that herd be very large one inspection of footprint left in soft soil about margin of pool showed that there be several animal of gigantic size in spoor led away to eastward in direction from have seen herd approaching on previous evening passage of so many heavy animal have trampled long parched grass so flat that trail be a plain a road to follow proceeded along at easy canter have be progressing in fashion for about three hour have covered twenty mile of perfectly flat country when observed that character of scenery ahead be changing scattered clump of bush through have be riding giving place to forest tree of various description imparting quite park like aspect to scene here came to halt for purpose of setting up mark be to give jan hottentot driver signal to outspan for piet be strongly of opinion that herd of elephant must be found somewhere in forest ahead browsing upon small tender shoot of tree sheltering from sun beneath leafy shade done looked to weapon satisfying that be in order for immediate use then again proceeded along trail time at walking pace trail continued to lead straight toward forest when have proceeded about mile farther spoor showed that herd have gradually scattered of animal seeming to have halted for time to feed while others have swerved off to right left a though to enter forest individually instead of in compact body be thus enabled to pick up spoor of particular animal coming at length upon of elephant of extraordinary size determined to follow did so right up to outskirt of forest here dismounted leaving horse with bridle trailing on ground where must easily find again where be not likely to be sighted by elephant continued to follow on foot spoor of big beast that be after led deviously with many twist turning toward deepest part of forest when have be following for about three quarter of hour be suddenly halted by sound of distant swishing cracking of branch caused to conceal hurriedly behind bole of big yellow wood reconnoitring from coign of vantage found that animal animal by sound be made be still invisible therefore continued with utmost caution to follow up spoor of elephant be tracking dodging from one tree to pausing behind a reached to take observation being careful to make sound a threaded way through underscrub until finally reached spot where peering out from behind trunk of big baobab be able to catch occasional glimpse of enormous grey mass moving slowly among tree while sound of swishing snapping branch crackling of undergrowth a creature moved from time to time occasional low grunt of satisfaction told how near be to quarry luckily too for wind be in exactly right direction be to say be blowing from elephant toward so that instead of scenting caught occasional whiff of peculiar odour emanated from extreme deliberation with animal moved proved conclusively that thus far have not slightest suspicion of presence unfortunately foliage be so dense that be only occasionally that must get even partial glimpse of then be of such character must not tell with certainty what part of body be looking at therefore after very brief low whispered consultation with piet decided to make rather wide circuit toward part of forest for creature be heading having chosen favourable spot patiently to await approach accordingly did fallen trunk of tree half buried in dense undergrowth affording perfectly ideal ambush have scarcely settled comfortably therein when violent swaying of underbrush warned that quarry be approaching next instant scrub parted right left point of two enormous tusk protruded from swaying tangle of leaf creeper in drawing of breath head fore quarter of biggest bull elephant have ever seen came into view for moment huge beast stood looking about then immense trunk swung upward point twined tightly about unusually leafy twig there came slight snapping swishing sound a twig be torn from parent branch next instant stem leaf vanished down cavernous throat then a ponderous trunk swung downward again beast uttered grunt of enjoyment pressed trigger of elephant gun barrel of have levelled over bole of fallen tree minute two earlier there be flash blinding puff of white smoke a forest resounded with crashing report answering crash close at hand proclaimed fall of great beast then a smoke gradually drifted away saw that animal have flung convulsively forward at impact of bullet now lay stone dead just on other side of prostrate tree behind be crouching for several second after echo of report died away there be perfect silence in forest not leaf seemed to stir bird to twitter even very insect ceased chirring a though be wondering what have happened then almost a though at given signal forest resounded with loud trumpetings of alarm crashing of heavy body through undergrowth a rest of unseen herd began to move restlessly angrily hither thither seeking source of sudden disturbance remained where be crouching in ambush for quarter of hour more listening to gradually subsiding disturbance waiting for possible appearance of one of great pachyderm in tiny clearing where dead giant lay although several passed at great distance saw none of at length when silence again reigned cautiously emerged from hiding place pushed way up wind still deeper into recess of forest breathless perspiring profusely with exertion of worming way through undergrowth have progressed about mile when away on left apparently only few yard distant suddenly heard loud blowing sound followed by several grunt next instant big cow elephant with calf at heel burst through intervening growth came charging toward with blazing eye uplifted trunk thrust straight out in front of fortunately have just stepped out from behind cover of big mahogany a doubted whether beast have actually sighted thrust piet back behind tree instantly followed working round bole a elephant advanced so a to keep between whether not have winded can not say be of opinion that must have done so be that a may continued furious charge actually grazing other side of tree behind be hiding a passed in instant have disappeared again leaving broad trail of trampled undergrowth broken sapling behind for ensuing five minute remained where be fully expecting irate beast to return in search of hearing nothing more of resumed way about quarter of mile farther on became aware that elephant be not far distant for away ahead of there be sound of heavy movement accompanied by good deal of grunting then suddenly angry squeal pealed out upon startled air immediately followed by violent clashing of tusk furious trumpetings tremendous commotion generally olifants fighting baa excitedly whispered piet in ear now de time for come on quick baa get close up to 'em never see then get bofe right be boy returned come along can not be very far ahead pushed on not troubling very much now a to whether not made noise for forest be fairly ringing with squeal trumpetings of contending beast presently caught occasional fleeting glimpse through interlacing foliage of twisting rushing body a moved hither thither be not yet near enough to see distinctly therefore forced way few yard farther until peering through tangled undergrowth obtained tolerably good view of little clearing of about acre half in extent in midst of two gigantic tusker be circling round other looking for opening occasionally rushing in with lowered head to plunge already ensanguined tusk into other body kneeling down among underwood in position must get clear view of amphitheatre without running much risk of being seen found gnarled stump of creeper afforded very convenient rest for heavy double barrelled elephant gun roughly levelling weapon awaited favourable opportunity to fire few minute later came two huge beast drawing apart a by common consent to recover breath like two immense statue stood about twelve foot apart motionless save for heaving flank great twitching ear trunk of upraised thrown back over head a though to be out of harm way saw that be bleeding freely from several ghastly looking wound moment be a favourable a must be at likely to get for be standing practically broadside on to therefore glancing quickly from one to other to determine precise position of vital spot for intended to aim levelled sighted weapon pressed trigger then with lightning movement of barrel shifted aim again fired second report followed first at interval of scarcely second heard loud clap clap of bullet a struck then thick veil of powder smoke enveloped for few second must see nothing while still waiting for smoke to disperse heavy thud told that at least one of animal be down moment two later a smoke gradually thinned dimly saw second standing with leg wide apart swaying little trembling violently for space of time in one might have slowly counted ten great brute stood thus then a uttered low moan mighty limb suddenly collapsed too sank to ground with thud seemed to make very earth tremble at precise moment there again broke forth same kind of uproar of alarmed trumpeting swiftly moving heavy body have followed first shot sound be time of such character a to indicate clearly that herd have be thoroughly alarmed effectually stampeded therefore after waiting five minute so until forest be again silent have become quite clear that none of animal be coming in direction left hiding place taking careful note of spot where two great tusker lay proceeded to retrace step toward place where have left horse found placidly grazing springing into saddle started on back trail to meet wagon intended to outspan for night close to outskirt of forest that might not have far to carry ivory when have cut out on morrow proceeded at foot pace since there be need for hurry have travelled distance of three mile when borne faintly to ear by gentle breeze be blowing behind heard peculiar yapping howl told that pack of wild dog be in full cry somewhere in rear being curious to learn what kind of animal be hunting looked about for spot whence unseen might witness chase increasing loudness of cry told be coming way spot be found close at hand in shadow of big clump of thorn bush within few yard of margin of small stream evidently tributary of river flowed mile two farther to westward have scarcely established in place of concealment when beautiful zebra mare accompanied by foal appeared coming toward at trot circumstance taken in conjunction with laboured action of animal clearly indicated that be in very last stage of exhaustion indeed fugitive have only gone few yard past when mare stumbled heavily recovered with difficulty then with scream marked extremity of terror despair crashed heavily to ground where after ineffectual effort to scramble to foot again lay flat on side panting heavily with tongue protruding a mare fell foal pulled up short beside stood with lowered head leg wide apart trembling so violently that action be visible even to nearly hundred yard away by time yapping sound have become so loud that knew pack must be close at hand moment later swept into view thirty so in number a sighted prostrate zebra with foal standing beside yapping changed to howl of exultation caused mare again to make ineffectual effort to scramble to foot while foal hobbled away yard two returned to dam when saw that be unable to rise be rather pathetic sight to see two beautiful animal awaiting destruction at fang of dog moved suddenly by sense of pity pressed heel to prince flank calling piet to follow rode forward into open at sight of two mounted figure advancing to bar progress pack suddenly pulled up in bunch stood panting with tongue lolling out foam dripping from jaw for wild dog doe not love to meet man especially white man at least in daylight a pack bunched together uncertain whether to continue advance to retire evidently very strongly impelled by sight of fallen zebra to do former offered target so tempting that be quite unable to resist leaping lightly from saddle ran forward pace two sinking upon one knee levelled rifle fired right into thick of bunch range be only about four hundred yard while sharp whip like report of piece be still echoing along side of range of hill in front of heard clap of bullet a smoke drifted away saw that one dog be down dead while second be struggling feebly on ground third with broken leg be making welkin ring with howl of anguish at flash report of piece eight ten of dog in rear of pack wheeled sharply round with tail tucked tightly between leg beat hasty retreat along back trail uttering sharp yelp of terror a went remainder of pack stood ground staring at a though wondering what new kind of animal must be who have power of slaying from distance there be one big gaunt brute however apparently leader of pack who kept flaming eye fixed upon zebra a smoke of discharge cleared away saw slink out from rest of pack in crouching attitude with bared fang a though meditating dash at gasping mare gun quick ejaculated to piet who retained saddle sat motionless a statue watching intently at word held out to loaded elephant gun received from empty rifle in stead moment later heavy piece roared out death message big brute who have separated from rest of pack sprang with convulsive twist into air fell stone dead now said a sprang into saddle unclip one of stirrup piet will see if can not beat off brute with stirrup iron a spoke word urged horse to gallop unclipping off side stirrup a went charged right down between pack zebra wheeling upon dog a soon a have cut off from mare foal then swinging loose stirrup round head thundered down upon discomfited pack uttering loud yell a went brute stood irresolute for few second longer presently when wheeled directly toward turned tail bolted by way that have come yelping with fear a went be determined to inspire with wholesome feeling of terror now that have begun therefore a soon a have overtaken rearmost member of flying pack checked horse just sufficiently to keep pace with then proceeded to belabour brute soundly with stirrup iron howl of anguish to belaboured one gave vent serving to add wing to foot of rest chased howling mob good two mile by time member be crazy with fear then drew rein feeling convinced that must give further trouble then turned cantered back along way by have come a approached spot where zebra mare have fallen saw somewhat to astonishment that poor beast still lay where have left with foal standing over smelling at licking face then occurred to that possibly might be able to capture foal therefore spoke word to piet pulled horse back to walk a sound of approaching hoof reached ear mare made scrambling effort to rise succeeded only to sink again to earth with moan while foal threw up head galloped stiffly away few yard then returned standing close to prostrate parent head gazing at with enquiring eye ear pointed forward nostril twitching upper lip slightly raised revealing teeth in somewhat threatening manner at distance of about seven eight yard reined up dismounted moving slowly with deliberation in order that might frighten animal a little a possible then throwing rein to ground walked quietly up to pair stood looking down at mare who still lay upon left side with limb stretched stiffly out side heaving with slow laboured movement tongue hanging from mouth glassy eye rolling in socket breath coming in heavy gasp be dyin ' baa remarked piet dyin ' of tiredness thirst ' have run long long way when too tired to get up at sight of yes there be doubt about poor beast be at last gasp unless something be quickly done to relieve must assuredly die piet be wearing soft wide brimmed felt hat of sufficient capacity to contain about three pint of water to retain without very much leakage for several minute while there be stream within twenty yard of spot where stood be possible that might yet save beautiful creature life if bestirred quick piet exclaimed come to river with fill hat with water must do what can for poor brute must like to capture tame if possible baa never do answered piet don know that zebra can never be tame so have heard altogether believe said at event mean to try so hurry black rascal in le than five minute be back with dripping hat still nearly full of water a knelt down by head of mare held hat close to gaping nostril poor beast smelt water uttered sound might be best described a sort of gasping whinny then raising head with effort plunged muzzle into hat sucked up content with indescribable eagerness allowing head to sink back with something sounded like sigh of contentment when hat have be emptied then piet dashed off to river procured second supply zebra also drank meanwhile colt have be making desperate effort to get share of water have kept off with difficulty mare being obviously in greater need now that have given a much a deemed good for for moment turned out attention to colt administering to two hatful of water absorbed with eagerness that quite equalled that of mother then perceiving that little chap gratification at ministration seemed to have quite conquered fear of might have originally entertained walked over to where horse be standing detached from piet saddle long rein of twisted raw hide that usually carried with for use in case of emergency while hottentot went off to fetch further supply of water then having obtained rein returned to colt who stood quite still a approached murmuring caressing word two to quietly lifted hand gently patted neck flinched somewhat at first touch did not attempt to run away presently when piet returned with more water seized opportunity to slip end of rein round little fellow neck knot while be drinking did not much like feel of rein round neck at first tried to shake off no longer shrank from touch allowed to pat neck even pull ear gently operation appeared to enjoy greatly then while continued to handle colt piet again turned attention to mare gave further drink when after few minute made effort to rise be time successful for several minute must only stand with difficulty trembling violently not attempting to move at juncture chanced to slip hand into jacket pocket when came into contact with half dozen small sweet biscuit for have rather weakness have slipped into pocket last thing before leaving wagon have then entirely forgotten fancy seized to offer one of to colt smelt at for moment two then somewhat hesitatingly closed teeth upon began to masticate evidently liked for having swallowed thrust forward head a though asking for more whereupon produced second at once accepted then offered third holding far enough from to compel to advance step two in order to secure did next offered fourth in same way a moved forward so did compelling to follow few step before let have at same time putting gentle strain upon rein round neck by mean successfully coaxed little creature into submitting to be led when have fairly got going mare followed at first moving stiffly with difficulty uttering small whinnying sound a though entreating colt not to leave with yard of progress movement became le difficult by time that have traversed quarter of mile animal be walking with comparative ease following quite contentedly especially colt who continued to beg for biscuit until have exhausted limited supply meanwhile piet who clearly understood what be endeavouring to do returned to where have left horse followed with in curious fashion at length met wagon joining force arrived at spot where planned to outspan for night have little trouble with captive when first met wagon of being somewhat startled by hideous yell rifle like whip cracking wherewith jan urged forward ox few more biscuit hastily obtained from wagon restored colt equanimity not to dwell at undue length upon incident have scarcely further trouble with of prize colt very rapidly developing perfect amenability while mare although le tractable never attempted to desert offspring be becoming quite tame when tragedy unhappily overtook chapter nine arrive in mashonaland whole of next morning be devoted by to task of cutting out ivory from three big tusker killed in forest exceptional size of elephant may be judged from fact that weight of ivory taken from amounted in aggregate to four hundred forty seven pound then about two o'clock in afternoon inspanned ox trekked in north easterly direction with range of hill cut through by curious gorge about quarter of mile on left drakensberg range of mountain towering aloft on right fifty mile distant trekked until within hour of sunset by time have rounded north eastern spur of range of hill passed northern extremity of gorge struck river about one hundred twenty yard in width flowing northward on right bank of outspanned for night two day later trekking northward along course of last mentioned river arrived at junction with limpopo on farther side of lay goal mashonaland here again outspanned while piet went on prospecting tour in search of drift by mean of wagon might be safely taken across leaving wagon spare horse zebra in charge of jan hottentot driver with strict injunction that be to take utmost care of captive treat with greatest kindness piet set out at daybreak former mounted upon punch while rode prince a usual taking with elephant gun rifle with sufficiency of ammunition for provision for four day dog thunder juno accompanied a matter of course be on right southern bank of mighty stream followed closely mile after mile anxiously scrutinising foot of turbid flood for sign indicative of sand bar extensive enough to enable to transport wagon to opposite bank although found le than four shoal in course of first day search three of extended le than halfway across river while fourth proved to be quicksand in narrowly escaped losing horse saving at last only by skin of teeth after nearly hour hard strenuous labour occurred about three o'clock in afternoon when at length be once more safe on solid ground be horse a well a men so utterly fagged out that there be nothing for to off saddle for remainder of day in order to recover good night rest however completely restored enabled to resume search on following morning experience on morning of day be simply repetition of of previous day except profiting by experience took care not to allow to be trapped in more quicksand began to fear that search be going to be much more protracted one than have anticipated shortly after midday arrived at spot where on opposite side of river river about hundred yard wide discharged into main stream at point also limpopo widened out until be fully quarter of mile in width combined effect of two circumstance being formation of numerous eddy so much slack water that soil held in suspension by two stream be here afforded opportunity to settle form shoal extending right across main river with maximum depth of water over of barely four foot shoal thoroughly tested on foot on horseback with result that found to be ideal crossing place having satisfied a to next business be to arrange for dispatch of piet a ambassador into mashona country have be considering matter very carefully during past two day recalling to mind friend major henderson have told with regard to experience among mashona advice that have given finally determined that most prudent course must be to send piet into country absolutely empty handed with message to effect desired permission of king to cross border traverse country visit at place hunting trading with people on way be at first somewhat undecided a to whether not must entrust piet with present for king finally decided that must be better to wait until must obtain audience with majesty then personally hand gift otherwise for aught must tell to contrary sable monarch might seize gift then do away with poor piet in horrible manner while if tottie went empty handed there must be inducement for king to destroy rather there must be prospect of gift to deter from doing so therefore upon following morning after charging man with message making repeat over over again to until there be possibility of forgetting sent across river on foot with provision that have left then riding prince leading punch to whose saddle have securely strapped elephant gun stock of ammunition set out accompanied by dog on return to spot where have left wagon upon arrival found jan tottie driver in great tribulation appearing that have be beset by lion during second night of absence that brute have killed no le than three of ox zebra despite utmost effort of 'ngulubi bantu voorlouper while two other ox have died through eating tulip poisonous plant have too late discovered grew in profusion in immediate neighbourhood of outspan furthermore appeared that four of other ox have suffered severely from same poison have be saved by prompt administration of decoction made from root of plant be serious news because have promised piet that must find outspanned at spot where have parted knew not how soon might return therefore be very desirable that must reach that spot without delay after considering matter therefore finally decided to cache ivory have with abandon pelt go forward to rendezvous with nothing in wagon save truck have brought up with a present for trading ammunition remains of stock of provision by time be becoming pretty well depleted did arriving at arranged meeting place three day later without suffering further loss be well on in afternoon of tenth day after piet departure when turned up again dusty leg weary somewhat footsore otherwise not very much worse for wear reported that country be pretty densely populated kraal being very extensive dotted over country at interval of in case not more than twenty mile apart first kraal at arrived being within ten mile of river bank described mashona a being very fine race of people almost if not quite equal in physique to zulu of much more suspicious unreliable character than latter apparently exceedingly averse to intrusion of stranger nevertheless upon stating nature of mission have be passed on from kraal to kraal until finally have arrived at gwanda place town of king lomalindela appeared be situated among rather curious group of mountain five day march from river lomalindela seemed have received envoy with very considerable display of austerity have submitted to most rigorous cross questioning luckily tottie have nothing to conceal be therefore able to tell perfectly straightforward story a piet believed have not only allayed monarch suspicion have also aroused in very lively curiosity to see white man wonderful fire tube slew from afar result of mission be therefore on whole quite satisfactory king having not only accorded permission to enter country kill game in also entrusted messenger with invitation to to visit at gwanda remain there a long a pleased being case river having fallen nearly foot since piet have first arrived at ford seized favourable opportunity safely transferred wagon other belonging to mashona side of river upon afternoon of day of piet return following course of stream to attributed formation of ford piet informed led direct to gwanda outspanned for night six mile to northward of limpopo next day continued trek shortly before noon arrived at first mashona village on route be place of importance containing about thousand hut of usual beehive shape somewhat larger than usually built by zulu with entrance large enough to enable man to pas through by merely bending body instead of having to go down upon knee village be circular in plan be protected by solidly constructed stockade built of stout tree trunk driven deeply into ground with slight outward slope stockade being about sixteen foot high on outside with top of pile sharpened to render unclimbable there be four gateway in stockade giving access to two principal street crossed other at right angle intersecting in centre of village at point there be spacious open square where public business of village be transacted where village sport be held did not enter village outspanned at distance of about mile from eastern gate cattle have scarcely be turned loose to graze under guardianship of 'ngulubi voorlouper when headman of village accompanied by dozen minor dignitary followed by ten woman bearing basket containing preternaturally skinny fowl egg green mealie cob sugar cane calabash of milk emerged from village advanced upon wagon men be unarmed presence of woman with basket content of be of course present to showed that visit be to be one of ceremony compliment therefore with piet assistance at once proceeded to unpack one of bale of truck withdrew therefrom article proposed to present in turn have hardly completed preparation when little party arrived have opportunity to study first mashonas have ever seen men woman be finely built well proportioned best friend must not conscientiously pronounce handsome unattractiveness be further increased by expression of countenance seemed to be compounded of suspicion craftiness greed cruelty saluted respectfully enough however offered present then sat down at invitation squatting upon heel in usual native fashion while sorted out gift intended to give consisted of bandana handkerchief two few yard of gaudily printed calico few yard of copper wire handful of mixed bead to of woman from grin of appreciation of recipient concluded that be well satisfied then with inquisitiveness of lower type of savage began to question not in straightforward fashion covertly by roundabout process with view of discovering motive for journeying so far from own people whereupon told frankly be hunter trader seeking for ivory gold did not seem to understand what meant by gold until spoke of a yellow metal shine when polished showed ring wore whereupon nodded head in comprehension shortly afterward rose returned to village about hour later headman three others came back to wagon bringing with number of rough shaped nugget of dull ruddy yellow gold looked a though might have be crudely smelted out of quarried ore wanted to trade with for bead printed calico quantity brought amounted to about twelve pound avoirdupois altogether estimated to be worth between six seven hundred pound sterling fixed exorbitant value upon metal have acceded to demand stock of trade stuff must soon have be exhausted of course gold be worth far more than entire stock of truck when purchased latter have quite reckoned upon being able to obtain for a much gold a must possibly load upon wagon still have notion enough left to supply present must probably find necessary to make therefore a soon a visitor pointed out to what required in exchange for gold laughed at waved away proceeded not too hurriedly to repack treasure result be what have anticipated intended refused to leave wagon gradually reduced demand until finally obtained whole of gold for about two yard of calico bandana handkerchief four yard of copper wire handful of bead even price explained be far higher than must possibly afford to give in future fully anticipated that result of transaction must be to bring out remainder of villager with proposal to barter such gold a might posse although so many of turned out that by sunset estimated that man woman child in village must have visited wagon saw more gold that day for very good reason for afterwards appeared that headman have spent busy afternoon going round village buying up particle of gold must lay hand upon doubtless with much profit to on following morning while be inspanning ox turned up accompanied by couple of woman bearing between nearly sixty pound of gold detained more than two hour while haggled with over sale of have by time come fully to understand that gold possessed absolutely value for people except a plaything for child result be that when at length bade man goodbye gave order to trek fellow be glad to let have whole at own price secured upon very favourable term be now in high feather for have already secured from one village alone more than seventy pound of gold estimated must be worth close upon four thousand pound sterling if must do so well at only one village might not achieve by time have traded away truck already in imagination saw back at bella vista with house rebuilt furnished in luxurious style land amply restocked plenty of money in bank a well ala little guessed what lay before be just a well perhaps that did not otherwise must not get ahead of story with head full of pleasant vision imagination busily employed in construction of chateau en espagne proceeded upon journey travelling over undulating country ahead manifested disposition to become hilly still closely following course of stream until about noon arrived in midst of what in distance have appeared to be cluster of curiously shaped kopje now proved to great surprise to be ruin thickly overgrown with vegetation here curiosity being powerfully aroused at so unexpected sight being also time to outspan called halt while piet busied in preparation of midday meal took rifle sauntered off to examine ruin proved to be very much more extensive than have imagined for when came to inspect at close quarter found that structure have at first attracted attention formed very small part of whole greater portion of building having be razed to level of ground large heap of rubbish foundation being now remained with exception of ruin above mentioned of town village have originally covered more than hundred acre of ground be to ruin have originally arrested attention that now chiefly devoted entirely forgetful of fact that meal be awaiting at wagon remains found to be extraordinarily interesting for have not be among ten minute before became convinced that be work of people of far higher intelligence than mashonas that must indeed have be built by race having pretension to civilisation for while wall be for most part built of dry rubble masonry lintel doorpost be of dressed stone most remarkable circumstance of be in many case adorned with sculpture in low relief of character strongly resembling have seen portrayed in picture of egyptian ruin for example there be figure of men ploughing with ox driving laden ass leading by horn antelope be perfectly recognisable a oryx springbok others leading baboon leopard giraffe dog lion elephant human figure with head of bird lion ram figure of sphynxes with human head head of ram figure be not by mean rough effort of uncultured savage on contrary be distinguished by precision of line delicacy yet firmness of touch artistic beauty must only have resulted from very high state of civilisation culture building appeared to be mostly circular in plan ranging from about thirty to fifty foot in diameter with wall averaging three foot in thickness one more of being surrounded by outer wall approximately elliptical in plan of five foot in thickness there be five of structure still standing in sufficient state of preservation to render recognisable at distance a building great many more precise number did not trouble to ascertain of nothing foundation remained prowled about among intensely interesting remains for several hour until close upon sunset in fact examining striving to puzzle out origin then made way back to wagon where found piet jan rapidly working into fever of anxiety about prolonged absence earnestly debating propriety of instituting search for so profound be interest curiosity aroused within by remarkable mysterious relic of lost forgotten civilisation that when piet awakened on following morning with early cup of coffee enquiry whether be pleasure that ox must be inspanned determined to devote at least few hour to further examination issued instruction accordingly then a soon a have breakfasted ordered piet to take sporting double barrel while carried rifle with two dog accompanying set out to complete inspection beyond finding of elaborately sculptured stone sarcophagus took liberty of breaking open contained mummified human body several earthenware utensil decorated with exquisite painting one of appropriated carried away discovered nothing further be worthy of particular mention about two o'clock in afternoon inspanned resumed journey hour later however at distance of three mile from ruin arrived opposite hill of solid rock four hundred foot in height about mile long in face of observed what at first took to be mouth of cave looking at more closely presently perceived alongside great mass of debris curiosity again got better of calling halt walked over to proceeded to examine at close quarter with result soon convinced that cave accompanying mound of debris must be nothing else than ancient working while upon entering opening extended inward downward for distance of nearly mile discovered evidence enough to prove that working be that of extraordinarily rich gold mine visible gold showing everywhere in worked face of rock at once idea seized that if must contrive to ingratiate sufficiently with lomalindela majesty might be induced to grant concession to work mine so place in possession of wealth beyond dream of avarice thought at first possibly might be identical mine from gold in wagon have come close examination of working at length convinced that rock have remained untouched for age then occurred to that perhaps dead forgotten inhabitant of ruined village have so recently left might have be miner now with mile of progress country became more broken hilly at same time more open park like great mass of bush scrub with have so long be familiar giving place to tree of handsome appearance noble proportion growing for most part singly occasionally in clump of from three four to dozen two while occasionally clump magnified sufficiently to justify term of wood even small forest moreover grass be in place profusely dotted with beautiful flower while where tree grew most thickly be often enwreathed with parasitic growth if be not actually orchid very strongly resembled bloom abundantly bore being of most remarkable often most beautiful shape colour thus broken character of country with accompanying feature of swelling hill scarred here there with foaming rivulet ravine gorge hemmed in overhung by lofty tree garlanded with flowering parasite intermingled in place with luxuriant shrub of bore leaf of such curious shape brilliant colour that might easily have be mistaken for flower with bird of strange form gaudy plumage flitting hither thither be most agreeable change from characteristic scenery of south africa be beautiful very fertile country taken a whole nearer that drew to gwanda more forcibly be fact borne in upon a also be further fact that mashonas be very powerful nation so far at least a number be concerned for kraal at arrived be bigger more important in way than one preceded evening of sixth day after have crossed limpopo found outspanned upon left bank of stream have be closely following from moment of passage of river with lofty flat topped mountain range fifty mile long on left hand springing from plain close to opposite margin of stream on right two enormous mountain twenty mile apart from peak to peak remarkable for exceptional height estimated at fully fourteen thousand foot a well a from fact that be identical not only in shape also apparently in size altitude in shape be almost hemispherical to add to similarity bore on very summit protuberance very much resembling in appearance beehive shaped kafir hut much larger being probably quite two hundred foot in height top of remarkable mountain be covered with snow for distance of about two thousand foot from summit very beautiful looked blushing soft delicate pink in last ray of setting sun ground between two mountain took to be pair of long extinct volcano range on left rose steadily therefore somewhat retarded progress when continued trek on following day about two o'clock in afternoon reached summit of slope saw before valley basin roughly circular in shape twenty mile in diameter hemmed in on side by hill of be lofty enough to be snow capped on summit in very centre of valley lay kraal place of lomalindela king of mashona nation be immense place far exceeding in dimension biggest native kraal have ever yet seen be circular in plan like other mashona kraal have passed on way also like be intersected by two main road street crossing other at right angle in centre of kraal one road running due north south while other ran east west of road be about two half mile long with great gate at extremity pierced in high strong circular palisade completely surrounded kraal at point where two main road intersected in centre of kraal be widened in such manner a to form great square about one hundred sixty acre in extent doubtless being spot where business of ceremonial character be conducted that such business be impending shortly afterward became aware for during descent of wagon into valley be overtaken passed by regiment after regiment of warrior decorated in full war paraphernalia induna of one of informed that general muster be proceeding in preparation for annual festival be to be held on day after morrow during remainder of day beheld almost continuous stream of armed men converging upon town not only by way of road along be travelling also from pass in mountain round valley when wagon have arrived within about mile of southern gate of town be met by official who bore formal message of welcome from king with intimation that majesty must see on morrow officer also indicated certain spot about mile outside south gate near bank of stream where suggested must outspan wagon explaining that king be of opinion must be more comfortable out there in comparative seclusion than in overcrowded town opinion with own completely coincided opinion be strengthened to absolute conviction when a sun sank behind western mountain soft tropical night settled down upon valley ear be assailed by perfect babel of sound emanating from town even at distance of mile rendered sleep almost impossible what must have be like to be lodged in midst of storm focus trembled to think din above hinted at be kept up until preposterously late hour that be not until early in morning of following day finally fell asleep with result that rather overslept when piet brought usual cup of coffee at same time brought intimation envoy have already arrived from gwanda with message from king to effect that majesty be now prepared to grant interview did not hurry however rose dressed with more deliberation than usual for experience be that savage even although savage happens to be king respect white man in direct proportion to time that latter keep waiting therefore directed piet to inform messenger be not yet ready to receive must do so a soon a have partaken of breakfast kept men required six of appeared to bring king message about hour then condescended to interview sending back with intimation be about to select from among treasure certain article intended to offer a gift to majesty that when have done so must so far honour a to call make presentation in person delivered message with aloofness dignity of manner must muster be gratified to observe that be not without effect upon king envoy who accorded salute of 'nkos upon departure then a soon a be gone unpacked bale proceeded to sort out set aside gift intended to offer for majesty acceptance by dint of little artful questioning have contrived to gain information that king lomalindela be man of about own stature build kept information in mind when selecting gift assumed that a in case of king moshesh military uniform must prove most acceptable gift must possibly offer savage monarch upon examining stock in trade discovered that possessed complete uniform of sergeant of hussar tunic pelisse trouser boot combined shako with red white horsehair plume complete sabre upon trial seemed to fit pretty well if perhaps just shade tight therefore decided upon together with length of two half foot of brass chain end of united by split ring to attached one of small circular shaving mirror to added dozen little brass box full of mixed bead last being intended a gift for king favourite wife then putting whole in parcel entrusted to piet care mounted prince accompanied by trusty hottentot henchman on foot set out to traverse short distance between wagon gwanda arrival of white man in mashona country be evidently quite unique event exciting utmost curiosity in mind of inhabitant indeed subsequently learned that thing have never happened since memorable visit of friend major henderson partner van raalte consequently be only very few of older men who have ever beheld white man before for a rode along at foot pace with piet respectfully walking in rear whole way be lined on side by thousand of men woman child who have turned out for express purpose of beholding such astonishing spectacle appeared being rendered more extraordinary by fact that horse be unknown to mashonas not one of save half dozen so elder above mentioned have ever so much a heard of mounted man therefore slow progress be marked by continuous volley of au uttered with hand held over mouth indicative of utmost astonishment awe same sort of thing only in very much more marked degree prevailed inside town one of inhabitant of appeared to have made point of turning out to witness arrival rode right up through main street of town a far a great square of have spoken a occupying centre there finding that entire square be lined with troop in full panoply of war from surmised that visit be intended to be regarded a state function dismounted still carrying trusty rifle turned horse over to care of savage who seemed to be more than half afraid of animal then with piet following close at heel passed through gap have be hastily made in line of troop found in great square in presence of king lomalindela chapter ten find in exceedingly awkward dilemma king a to whose identity there must be possible mistake be seated in very centre of great square upon sort of throne precise shape material of must not make out for be entirely hidden by immense magnificent kaross of lion skin formed up in semicircle behind around be about hundred warrior arm accoutrement of whom be of so elaborate splendid character at once judged rightly a afterward turned out to be chief since king be seated in exact centre of great square there be still space of nearly four hundred fifty yard separating when passed through line of warrior therefore for moment must only take in general effect of group very imposing be for with exception of half dozen elder one of chief be in very prime of life ringed of course standing fully six foot in height one of bearing scar of many battle a perceived when drew near evidently men who knew not meaning of word fear in respect worthy of be king whom a approached saw to be man apparently of about thirty five to forty year of age splendidly proportioned probably quite a tall a tallest of chief although must only judge height approximately since be sitting down unlike warrior however be naked save for usual mucha apron of monkey tail round loin superb leopard skin kaross over shoulder be also unarmed save for bangwan stabbing spear with enormous blade held carelessly across knee a approached did not like expression of countenance indeed that of of mashona seemed to to be compounded of craftiness treachery ferocious cruelty moreover majesty seemed to be in anything good humour perhaps have kept waiting rather too long for a approached near enough to note expression upon feature observed that brow be contracted into heavy frown there be certain glitter in eye that by mean liked however if chanced to be striving to daunt by scowling look be important that must be made to understand that have by mean succeeded therefore walking slowly with dignity must assume marched straight up to looking fearlessly in eye halted about ten foot from giving military salute remarked in bantu tongue greeting lomalindela king lord of mashona edward laurence one of mighty english race salute thee see thee white man of unpronounceable name answered king somewhat ungraciously ye desired audience of have given say now therefore why have ye come into country what want ye now have permitted to enter nay o king retorted beyond what have already given namely permission to hunt in country want little nothing except permission to trade with people there be gold in mashonaland be metal so far a have thus seen ye have little use for among own people posse certain value therefore have come bringing with good be prepared to barter for gold among people if will if not matter not can buy ivory with good on way back to mine own land also be seeking young white 'ntombozaan who be stolen from among twenty two moon ago carried off into interior whither know not think can not have be brought so far a yet who know have heard seen aught of such 'ntombozaan o king have not white man be in mashonaland for otherwise must have heard of seen answered lomalindela few stranger who enter country be brought to deal with a will have not be here therefore that part of errand be soon disposed of a to other part of will consider matter at leisure have ye aught else to say to merely to ask majesty acceptance of certain gift have brought with be king pleasure produce blandly enquired expression of covetousness flashed into king eye a nodded replied briefly yes may produce beckoned to piet who a supposed body servant have be permitted to enter great square with at once stepped forward with bundle containing present laid at foot then deliberately with a much ceremony a must infuse into so commonplace act unfastened bundle extracted item of uniform one by one unfolded held up for inspection king regarded garment attentively somewhat wonderingly a held up did not appear to be very profoundly impressed began to fear that great coup be about to miss fire when however came to sword drew from scabbard flourished glittering blade round head made several cut point at imaginary enemy majesty sat upright in chair began to manifest little more interest be that one of white man fighting weapon demanded stretching forth hand for be answered a handed to forthwith proceeded to explain to how be used examined weapon with much curiosity ran thumb along edge remarked that be not very sharp then to unutterable dismay handed back to saying good thou shalt show how be used one of warrior armed with spear shield will fight thee for second two be too dumbfounded to speak knew that savage be subject to queer unexpected turn of thought be development have never foreseen even in most fantastic imaginings be utterly at loss a to how be to deal with extraordinary situation be not be exactly afraid to meet savage in mortal combat for have often done so before be on field of battle when opponent be enemy of race thirsting for white man blood when only choice lay between killing being killed to deliberately engage in cold blooded duel with man against whom have grudge to incur obligation of killing being killed merely to gratify whim of savage monarch be quite matter one to confess simple truth have fancy for yet how to escape dilemma knew not though be forcibly borne in upon that must never do for to betray slightest hesitation for savage king be kittle cattle to deal with to cross even lightest mood may often result in ghastly tragedy therefore more in hope of gaining time than for other reason said nay o king be mere waste of good material to slay one of thy warrior in order to show thee how weapon be used be necessary can make matter quite clear to thee without killing man will do so in due time let now proceed to display remainder of gift hastily diving into parcel produced length of brass chain with shaving mirror attached held up for instant that might see then placed round own neck to show how be to be worn at moment what seemed to to be brilliant inspiration seized began to talk somewhat hurriedly in hope of diverting king mind from idea of suggested duel said removing chain mirror from neck offering to majesty be great magic for enables man to see behold held up so that lomalindela might see reflection of own visage in took doubtingly hesitatingly in hand for there be nothing south african savage dread so much a magic witchcraft low awestricken ejaculation of au escaped at what beheld be not continued magic disk enables owner to see what be happening behind a thus slightly turned mirror in hand a held in fashion that must see face of various chief who stood behind finally proceeded have power of temporarily blinding enemy so giving possessor power over thus a spoke turned mirror in such fashion that flashed ray of sun right into eye of several of soldier lining square who despite awful breach of discipline involved in action incontinently raised shield a dazzling reflection struck eye au ejaculated lomalindela in awestruck tone a handled mirror doubtfully be great good magic for enables man to see enemy who come creeping up behind to blind enemy who assails in front thank thee white man thou shalt show how to use too certainly replied hastily all in good time now lastly behold here be box of bead for thy favourite wife wherewith may adorn king took brass box one by one in hand turned over looked at then calmly drew from lobe of right ear ivory snuffbox about same size substituted therefor one of other box amid low murmur of admiration from chief in rear be good again thank thee white man remarked a placed remaining brass box in hand of one of chief with low murmured order purport of must not catch yes be good repeated turning to what be thing good for enquired pointing to little pile of clothes have replaced in bundle listen o king will tell thee replied in land where white men live there be king even a there be in land also a in land be men undistinguishable from other men save by clothing also a in mashonaland king be soldier chief general of troop be distinguishable from others by magnificence of clothing therefore when decided to visit mashonaland matter of suitable present arose in mind decided must not possibly offer anything more suitable acceptable to king of mashona than garb of soldier such a king wear behold there be au ejaculated lomalindela regarding little heap with new interest be that then garb that king of white men wear even so answered straining truth little be garb of soldier be kind of garb white king wear upon state occasion such a review of troop upon occasion of very great important ceremonial good ejaculated king thy gift come most opportunely to morrow be day of great annual festival in mashonaland when review soldier when witch doctor smell out who be secret enemy will wear then thou white man must show how thing be used for have never before seen anything like assuredly will said will be now king considered for moment then answered in affirmative at same time beckoning to certain chief elderly grey headed man giving order whereupon chief whom assumed to be deep in monarch confidence left place in semicircular cordon behind throne advancing to where bundle lay at foot lifted reverentially bore away to large rectangular hut took to be itunkulu king house at far corner of square whither lomalindela forthwith followed hut be about fifty foot long by about forty foot broad seven foot high to eaves of roof be built of what be known in cape colony a wattle daub be to say wall have be constructed of interlaced wattle work plastered over with mud allowed to dry in heat of sun after roof have be thickly thatched with palm leaf effectually turned heavy tropical rain to country be subject at certain season of year be also pretty effectual protection against scorching ray of sun consequently interior temperature of such structure stifling though frequently be be not nearly so great a of outer air in particular case too doorway unlike of usual kafir hut be high enough to permit full grown man to enter without stooping like other kafir hut be entirely destitute of window only light during daytime at least being what entered by doorway minute two however sufficed for eye to become accustomed to change of light when mine have done so perceived that interior of particular hut be divided by wattle partition into apparently three apartment two in front half other surmised to be sacred to king emposeni harem occupying rear apartment first entered be probably king sitting room for contained nothing low divan like arrangement running round wall covered with rich karosses while through doorway leading to other apartment caught indistinct glimpse of what looked like rough imitation of couch bed also heaped high with karosses king lost time in coming to point signed to attendant chief to place bundle on divan then turned to said now white man teach how to array in garb of white king then said taking up booted trouser be first garment majesty must don explained a best must how be to clothe fact that boot be attached to trouser made assumption of garment somewhat awkward luckily boot be ample in size monarch managed to get foot into without much difficulty then explained how must tuck mucha inside when be done garment drawn up round waist passed brace over shoulder showed how to button trouser be scarlet just little off colour with wear be afraid with broad stripe of yellow braid down outer seam effect be evidently satisfactory to king who walked up down room several time admiring then took up tunic after have explained how be worn induna assisted majesty to get into buttoned down front next attached fur trimmed pelisse to one shoulder adjusted shoulder belt threw brass chain with mirror attached round neck placed plumed shako on head girded sword about waist there stood most grotesque yet withal not unkingly figure fully attired in uniform of hussar effect upon induna be tremendous stood for several second gazing open mouthed upon awe inspiring apparition of king in new strange attire then flinging prone upon ground with hand over eye exclaimed be too much mine eye be not strong enough to gaze upon so much splendour bayete bayete bayete a for king gratification pride be unbounded never before suppose have beheld man so completely overpowered with admiration a old induna if such be effect of appearance upon man with whom be comparatively speaking familiar what might not expect to be result when exhibited in kingly attire to troop swelled visibly with gratified vanity for vanity fear of witchcraft be two overmastering emotion of savage grinned from ear to ear a took mirror in hand gazed admiringly at reflected image of crowned with smart shako nodding horsehair plume finally turned to with question say now white man what think ye do look like white king in respect majesty answered with several mental reservation au be good be very good indeed exclaimed now be white king when enemy behold will tremble heart will melt within a snow upon mountain top melt when glory of sun shine upon courage will fail spirit will wither at sight of even a grass withers shrivels at breath of fire be king silence of few minute followed rhapsody then turned to still prostrate induna kicking gently in rib with booted foot exclaimed rise mapela behold must grow accustomed to sight of in kingly garb for now have will often delight eye of people by wearing say now will go forth instant make glad heart of soldier who be gathered in great square by showing to mapela revolved very important question in mind for nearly minute then raised head answered if o great great one word of humblest of thy servant carry weight with thee must say show not in thy glorious garb until to morrow there be few warrior in square to day so few that be altogether unworthy of so great honour a thou dost suggest moreover must go away babble to others of what have seen much of glory splendour of thy first appearance in magnificent garment must be wasted wait until to morrow o elephant whose tread cause earth to tremble with fear then when whole army be gathered together can see thee at same moment thou shalt reveal in thy magnificent splendour word fail to predict result perhaps thou art right mapela wise one answered king kindly overlooking perhaps not noticing rather lame impotent conclusion of induna high flown speech yes perhaps thou art right rather regretfully there be reason why must not at once show to wife by bone of royal father will there be among who of late have shown tendency to make light of word hold of small account will see what will say how will act when behold a now be therewith lomalindela autocrat of mashona nation lord of life death over nearly million people stalked across room with sword clanking at heel drew aside curtain disappeared behind there followed breathless silence for space of perhaps minute silence deep pregnant almost awe inspiring then there floated out from other side of kaross curtain little shriek in unmistakable feminine tone of voice shriek expressive of mingled astonishment awestruck wonder delight immediately followed by perfectly deafening clamour of exclamation laughter from at least fifty woman if number might be gauged by volume of sound that created amid might be imperfectly caught at interval deep tone of lomalindela voice raised apparently in remonstrance entreaty indignation mapela wise one glanced enquiringly at other methought that even in semi obscurity of darkened interior must detect ghost of twinkle of amusement in old induna eye for own part remember be grinning from ear to ear a imagination conjured up picture of scene be enacting behind curtain shout exclamation laughter remonstrance increased rather than diminished a moment sped presently mapela came to took by arm gently led from itunkulu saying a did so come belungu let go king be man after among woman folk be not seemly that must linger hear more of what be passing yonder once safely away from itunkulu beyond reach of unseemly sound issued therefrom mapela conducted to group of chief still gathered round royal chair introduced to severally individually then discreetly with certain air of mystery hinted to fellow indunas that investiture of great great one have be successfully accomplished with such amazing magnificently splendid result that must be well for to spend night in preparing to be astonished for on morrow must find overwhelmed with wonder admiration finally threw out cautious feeler with object of ascertaining whether perchance have occurred to that might be politic on part to confirm excellent impression have already made by bestowing upon fellow indunas small very small modicum of inestimable treasure knew wagon must still contain to replied that idea be at moment one uppermost in mind that gladly availed of opportunity afforded by king temporary absence to invite to call upon in body a soon a possible to receive largesse then in turn took up parable in humble emulation of mapela engaging frankness hinted that if by chance king anybody else must feel moved to display feeling of friendliness to extent of bestowing upon return present wanted nothing of actual value such a spear shield like must gladly accept a much of useless stuff gold a people might desire to force upon accumulation of gold being one of chief hobby eccentric amusing perhaps even ridiculous well there be accompanied final statement with shrug of shoulder intended must express deprecation of own folly intercepted glance nod of intelligence amusement passed round circle at naive confession of folly on part at moment king shorn of temporary glory with distinct frown of annoyance upon royal brow emerged from itunkulu stalked towards also to secret discomfiture observed that carried in hand sword have just presented to in use of have expressed desire to be instructed began to think have permitted passion for harmony completeness to carry rather too far when included sword with other item of uniform have selected for presentation to king lomalindela resolved there then never again to include lethal weapon of description among gift to savage king flung down into throne with much of petulance of manner be observable in demeanour of spoilt child when temper have be ruffled from surmised that impression produced upon lady of harem by majesty martial garb have fallen short in respect of what have anticipated that in fact not to put too fine point upon majesty vanity have be taken down peg two for be rather sorry because somehow have premonition that resulting soreness of temper must recoil upon for once in way premonition be promptly verified for after scowling round for minute two upon sundry maintaining meanwhile ominous silence king straightened up said sharply now white man have wasted enough time in folly let proceed with matter be discussing when interrupted be about to show how thing call sword must be used will show now mapela choose skilled warrior from regiment that may fight white man may thus be able to judge real value of white man gift white man will be armed only with sword mashona weapon will be shield stabbing spear saluting mapela strode across square to where regiment be drawn up moved slowly along rank critically eyeing man over a did so believed that have succeeded in producing tolerably good impression upon mapela moreover be to interest must not be killed for if must chance to be slain might bid goodbye to hope of obtaining present from began to wonder whether wise one possessed enough mental acuteness alertness to conceive idea of quietly warning warrior whom might choose that there be need for to put up real fight purpose must be served if warrior while feigning to use best endeavour to kill must skilfully permit to disarm unfortunately however mapela must not know what be passing in mind have missed only opportunity have presented for discussing matter with be while king be displaying fine feather to lady might very well happen that old induna animated by best intention in world toward might select foeman whom might deem well worthy of steel for purpose of enabling to display skill before king be most annoying dilemma for peaceably disposed young fellow like with natural aversion to unnecessary strife bloodshed to find in for life of must see way out of king be clearly in mood to listen to argument indeed be evidently very much ruffled in temper in just frame of mind must impel to insist more strongly on having own way must attempt anything in nature of dissuasion therefore must see for be to submit to whim do best to disarm antagonist without hurting by time have thus far considered matter mapela have made choice now approached accompanied by fine stalwart young mashona warrior of five six twenty year of age ringed man whose smooth dark skin be already seamed here there with scar told of more than one hard fought fight whose lithe easy movement indicated that be in very pink of fighting condition halting within pace two of where stood near king mapela saluted said behold o great great one have chosen warrior even a bade be named befuni be son of matanga one of most skilled cunning fighter who have carefully trained son in art of warfare be choice approved looked at proposed antagonist single glance into eye aglow with pride resolution convinced that hope might have cherished regarding mapela supposed desire for escape from ordeal to be about to be subjected have be utterly misplaced cupidity in respect of possible gift if indeed have be animated by such feeling have evidently be swamped by sense of duty to king have a evidently picked warrior well calculated in opinion to uphold maintain honourable tradition of mashona army look movement clearly proclaimed that regarded a chosen champion of entire mashona nation that be fully prepared to lay down life in endeavour to uphold prestige be clear that must have to look well to myself if desired to see light of day moved by sudden impulse to avoid if possible combat however might end must be of possible advantage to turned to king said surely majesty be not in earnest in insisting must fight man in order to demonstrate way in sword have given thee must be used can show thee that there be to show without slightest need for bloodshed a thus permit took sword from king hand unsheathed laying scabbard at king foot approached befuni smiling into man eye to show meant harm now befuni said a halted within striking distance of raise thy spear a though thou wert about to strike through heart man looked doubtfully at then flung lightning glance of enquiry at king latter made sign therefore after moment pause befuni raised spear a have bade now continued in low voice intended only for ear when say strike ' thrust at not too quickly just quick enough to make blow look real strike prompt at word man struck exactly a have told to do without least difficulty parried blow shearing head of spear from haft leaving latter in astonished savage hand see o great one said stepping back turning to king thing be quite simple mere turn of wrist doe thus illustrated meaning by parrying imaginary thrust head of adversary spear be shorn off be disarmed at mercy to be slain not a may choose be there be in need to fight in order to show how sword must be used king glowered at for several second in silence then with scornful laugh exclaimed pah be nothing boy of six year must have done a much made effort to slay thee else thou wouldst not be alive now begin to have doubt of thee white man dost thou desire death that thou hast given weapon of use in time of battle be of use insisted hotly for nearly twelve moon with others fought tembu pondos griquas using similar weapon to be alive day then retorted lomalindela with malicious grin if thou art so sure of effectiveness of weapon let see thee use in real fight mapela give befuni thy spear hark ye if thou canst slay white man even disable thou shalt choose twenty head of cattle from mine own herd will be thine if white man prof to be victor in fight there be still life in thee when be over swear by bone of royal father thou shalt be given to ant thou hearest hear o great great one calf of black bull elephant whose tread shake earth bayete answered befuni lifting on high haft of spear from have shorn head so be in for with ghost of chance of escape very gift rather one item of upon have so confidently relied to win favour goodwill of king have through monarch capricious suspicious nature be instrument by mean of have become involved in duel must almost inevitably end in ghastly tragedy for after what king have said to antagonist there be doubt that fellow must do utmost to kill while in pure self defence also for sake must do best to kill fully understood meaning of king horrible threat to give poor fellow to ant rather than see condemned to so dreadful fate must slay with own hand chapter eleven fight champion of mashona army in obedience to king command mapela left place among fellow indunas stalking across intervening space handed bangwan spear with stout haft about three half foot long to be attached head eighteen inch long by seven half inch wide two edge of be almost razor keen to befuni while be doing whispering few hurried word to prospective antagonist divested myself of jacket handing rifle to piet who while have stood motionless a statue said take hold for piet if must be killed make way at once to place where have left horse shooting man who may attempt to stop rifle be loaded mount ride for life to wagon if be fortunate enough to reach alive with jan have better take horse gun a much ammunition a may have time to lay hand on ride for life back to limpopo on other side of will be reasonably safe after must do best can for yourselves if must be lucky enough to get back home find major henderson tell have happened how died right baa answered piet cheerfully a took coat rifle from will remember that say ai afraid baa be not goin ' to die just yet will beat black nigger right fellow be a black a ace of spade got to do baa be to take care that don ' work roun ' so to get sun in eye be by time befuni be once more armed while mapela have left be wending way back to place among fellow indunas whose eye like of king indeed man in square be now intently watching movement of champion a walked leisurely toward befuni rolling up right shirt sleeve while saw that fellow be watching keenly a cat watch mouse despite apparent unconcern kept equally wary eye upon knowing from tense attitude that might attack at moment a now approached sun be immediately behind mindful of piet advice be determined to keep there if possible although there be disadvantage about arrangement that king with group of indunas be far enough forward on left front to be just within range of vision sudden movement upon part of of be liable to attract attention from antagonist leave open to attack quickly made up mind to dismiss altogether from thought at instant when came to resolution befuni with sudden spring leapt within arm length of with spear upraised in act of striking instantly threw up blade in position ready to parry beyond coming to halt took notice of antagonist movement for have already made plan for fight consisting simply in acting upon defensive until favourable opportunity must reveal keeping back to sun befuni be a quick a to recognise advantage that latter must give did utmost to deprive of by springing first to one side then to other hoping doubt must be tempted to turn face until by repeated turn must contrive to get sun in eye defeated amiable project however by keeping eye steadfastly fixed upon thus reading forestalling intention for have found that eye be one feature of human countenance will not lend to deception thus for several minute danced thither right left opponent continually flashing spear before eye making feint while simply held ready to parry stroke moment must see coming presently came in good earnest for patience of savage be soon worn down came with quickness of lightning flash quick a be intercepted moment saw that be really coming round whirled blade down fell point of spear shorn clean off at junction with haft stood disarmed before for fraction of second stood gazing with dilated eye apparently unable to realise that be beaten then to amazement stooped swiftly snatched severed spearhead from ground unprepared a be for action yet have enough presence of mind to spring back away from well be for did so for almost before must recover from astonishment man be upon stabbing furiously at with spearhead in one hand while with shield in other covered body so sudden furious be onslaught that in spite of myself be driven back half dozen pace while low murmur from onlooker rapidly strengthened to deafening roar of applause encouragement then in parrying unusually vicious stab unwittingly slashed poor fellow across right hand so severely that incontinently dropped blade once more stood disarmed before whereupon driving back by threatening with point stepped forward placed foot upon spearhead do yield admit beaten befuni demanded in low voice yield be beaten 'nkos answered man lowering hand strike now through heart pray thee save from torture of ant wait enjoined briefly then turning to king said shout of applause encouragement having ceased on instant of befuni discomfiture thou hast seen o king although thy chosen champion fought well did best have conquered with weapon of thou wert inclined to think so little art thou still inclined to think lightly of art thou convinced that be good weapon capable of protecting man life in heat of battle nay answered lomalindela be good weapon thou hast proved to be so at risk of thy life thank thee for gift ask now what will give thee in return for wilt thou have gold cattle thou hast to say will be thine for thy gift be good mine will equal answer by good luck afforded very opening that wanted at once replied thank thee great great one take thee at thy word want none of thing thou hast named if thou dost really value gift to thee ask thee to give in return life of befuni man who fought with whom conquered by might magic of sword fought bravely well worthily did uphold finest tradition of mashona warrior against sword have chance must not conquer therefore because be not fault that have be beaten soldier indunas to man will admit that ask to give man life free from stigma disgrace of defeat to repeal sentence that if conquered must be given to ant silence followed bold request of mine be so intensely profound when have endured for minute more at full tension began to suspect have unwittingly committed utterly unpardonable offence that nature be breathlessly awaiting fall of avenging thunderbolt for be not only that man present in great open space seemed tongue tied seemed to be not even drawing breath be a absolutely motionless a so many statue there be not even faint sound of man shifting weight from one leg to other not even scarcely perceptible touch of spear haft upon shield even faint rustle of warrior plume in wind for strangely enough at precise moment even wind seemed to pause in breathing glancing round in vague discomfiture perceived that man in square be staring blankly before right into space fact be a subsequently learned that in preferring request have asked king in so many word to break most sacred oath known to mashonas have risen in wrath plunged bangwan through heart nobody must have be in least degree surprised that indeed be logical sequence for everybody be at moment waiting request must have touched hitherto hidden unsuspected chord in king heart for presently when tension have become almost unendurable lomalindela raised head said in so gentle tone of voice that electrified everybody au white man know not what ask have sworn by bone of royal father that if man be conquered survived fight must give to ant be oath dare not break for otherwise great evil must fall upon house of lomalindela king of mashona doubtless o king what thou sayest be true under ordinary circumstance replied circumstance be not ordinary on contrary be so exceptional that will probably never again occur oath took be taken in ignorance did not know that in taking oath be virtually condemning man to dreadful death for failing to accomplish impossibility did be true white man did not know answered king therefore continued with increasing confidence by law of right equity ignorance of important fact absolves from oath be entitled to break if please ask to break knowing that may certainly do so with impunity because in demanding that befuni must conquer rather sword gave demanded of other warrior must possibly accomplish then ensued tense silence during king appeared to be meditating upon what have said presently beckoned to mapela wise one conferred with in low voice for brief space then turning to said be inclined to believe that what thou hast said a to impossibility of befuni conquering sword be true for mapela informs that chose man because of reputation a most skilled fighter in whole mashona army therefore because of what thou hast said must willingly break oath if must be sure that in so doing must not be bringing evil upon house how can be sure be puzzler with vengeance looked about in perplexity searching earth sky for answer a did so saw far away in northern sky filmy something even a looked resolved into flock of rock pigeon coming directly toward knew from long experience propensity of bird to fly straight felt sure that unless something happened to divert course must presently pas right over head therefore since man life be hanging in balance only must save determined to take chance called to piet to hand rifle then with in hand turned to king said behold lomalindela yonder be flight of rock pigeon about to pas over head if one of must fall dead in square must believe have told truth that may break oath with impunity yea will answered king looking in direction toward be pointing for why must one of fall dead seeing that flight be strong full of life will see said slowly raised rifle bird be flying very high foresaw that shot must be difficult one have accomplished others quite a difficult in time be determined must not fail now therefore holding breath a pigeon drew overhead sighted about six inch ahead of leader pulled trigger low murmured ejaculation of surprise followed report of piece simultaneously with leading pigeon be seen to spring convulsively upward about foot feather two detached from body then wing collapsed down came hurtling through air falling a luck must have within few inch of king foot a though soft thud of body upon ground have be signal up went hand of man present to mouth low au of awe amazement rolled round square like mutter of distant thunder be enough o king be satisfied demanded a stepped forward picking up bird handed to monarch for inspection be enough be satisfied answered king recall oath man life be yours to do a will with thank thee most heartily o great great one answered then turning to befuni said return now to place in rank to friend fought well be through fault of yours that be defeated when be dismissed from duty come to wagon will see what may be done toward mending wound that king sword inflicted upon 'nkos ' answered befuni throwing up hand in salute a swung round upon heel marched back to place in rank a went there gradually arose from assembled troop sound like pattering of rain upon roof caused by drumming of spear haft upon shield beginning so gently that at first be scarcely audible rapidly swelling in volume until became almost deafening when a rapidly subsided into silence did not understand meaning of at moment later on when questioned mapela informed that be method adopted by mashona warrior to express admiration approval appreciation of act of exceptionally generous noble character have be evoked by treatment in general of befuni incident especially by successful intervention to save man from most horrible form of death known among from fact that scowl have vanished from king brow surmised that too be well pleased at final outcome of matter when presently sound of peculiar salute to have referred have died away pointed to rifle in hand said be that magic fire tube kill from afar of thy servant spoke when came hither to crave permission that thou shouldst enter country visit here even so answered offering for examination for have not reloaded knew that however carelessly might handle must do mischief declined to touch saying nay be great terrible magic will have naught to do with thou white man with unpronounceable name art also great wonderful magician for at thy will lightning flash from thy fire tube very bird of air fall dead at thy foot also when thou didst fight thou didst cause sword in thy hand to flash lightning about thee by swiftness with thou didst wield therefore give thee new name henceforth thou shalt be known a chia'gnosi smiter with lightning go now in peace chia'gnosi thank thee for splendid gift thou hast bestowed upon especially for lightning flashing sword a also for saving life of one of warrior to morrow thou shalt sit beside here in great square witness annual festival of mashona nation sala guhli accepting a dismissal saluted wheeling round beckoned piet to follow to place where have left horse at entrance to square have not gone six step upon way when whether spontaneously in response to signal know not up went spear of warrior present in salute great shout of chia'gnosi chia'gnosi rent air to a in duty bound responded by halting for moment raising hand to hat brim in military salute about twenty minute after return to wagon late antagonist put in appearance in obedience to instruction be still in full panoply of war a have appeared on parade have provided with new bangwan stabbing spear with shield war club sheaf of hunting assagai respectfully laid at foot a halted before why do do befuni asked regarding man with surprise because henceforth be thy man o chia'gnosi answered then in reply suppose to look of continued astonishment added 'nkosi spared life king gave to therefore henceforth be man do mean that intend to attach to to become one of servant demanded even so 'nkos ' answered simply said king will never permit that befuni must be very angry indeed with must discover have carried off one of warrior probably must send impi after to eat up nay o chia'gnosi must not for be great one who ordered to come to thee replied befuni gave to thee king doe not go back from word very well in case thou mayst remain glad will be to have thee said now let look at thy hand must see what can be done to heal hurt that sword inflicted upon thee gash seemed to be rather severe one practically incapacitating member for time being took best part of hour to extract splinter of bone bind up wound during time must have inflicted good deal of pain upon poor fellow for perspiration streamed down face like rain yet time sat motionless impassive a statue never moving muscle shrinking in least before have finished with surgery mapela rest of chief turned up in response to invitation to call at wagon to receive gift proposed to distribute among soon gathered from conversation that befuni story be perfectly true that king have indeed given man to a present to distribute gift to nearly one hundred chief proved to be somewhat lengthy business also made pretty severe inroad into stock of truck still have to be done must only hope that in long run generosity must not be without reward treated alike practically so giving man yard of thin copper wire gill measure of mixed bead bandana handkerchief yard of printed calico while distribution be proceeding visitor chatted volubly with still more volubly with other principal topic of interest soon discovered being festival be to commence one hour after daybreak on morrow to last through day well on into hour of succeeding night chief conversed with utmost freedom in presence hearing at outset be too much engrossed in business of distributing gift to pay very much attention to what be said stray word two here there being caught at first at length however began to dawn upon that so called festival promised to be anything rather than festive if have not completely misunderstood trend of certain of remark have attracted attention accordingly pricked up ear began to ask few question then learned to horror that first feature of festival namely smelling out of king secret enemy by witch doctor be more likely to resemble closely orgy of wholesale murder than anything else must imagine ceremony gathered be somewhat a follows witch doctor magician of nation numbering in something over hundred of whom be then in gwanda for purpose of ceremony must assemble at sunset same evening in sort of fetish house there under leadership direction of one machenga head chief witch doctor must perform certain mysterious rite submit to certain mysterious form of treatment lasting entire night be generally understood must enable infallibly to smell out detect individual who might harbour evil thought design against king unfortunate appeared must upon detection be haled forth summarily executed there then learned further that while king put most implicit faith in infallibility of witch doctor especially in of machenga head chief of few of indunas who be then talking to held rather strongly to opinion that selection of victim be not so much result of supernatural guidance wisdom vouchsafed to witch doctor a be at least in case of more important distinguished victim governed rather by machenga personal hatred cupidity few of shrewder observer having noticed year that chosen victim invariably included certain men toward whom head witch doctor be well known to cherish feeling of strong enmity while other victim comprised chief who be numbered among richest men in community law being while property of alleged traitor be forfeited to king half of be surrendered to head witch doctor a fee for detection of criminal mapela wise one be one of strongest upholder of above theory in support of soundness of whispered to see that tall induna yonder talking with two others yes man with necklace of lion teeth be logwane reputed to be most wealthy induna for number of year have paid heavy tribute to machenga thus purchasing immunity from being smelled out during last year have become favourite of great great one presuming upon understand now have refused to pay further tribute to machenga have defied mark word will be among smelled out to morrow think so whispered back if so what will be fate chiele slain answered mapela tersely accompanying word with expressive movement of right hand imitative of man stabbing what notwithstanding fact that be favourite of king demanded incredulously that fact that be highly esteemed by be well known to be absolutely loyal to king will save will see replied mapela exclaimed hotly must be monstrous nothing short of deliberate cold blooded murder do really think that king will permit if must will none of intervene king will permit because have absolute faith in machenga answered mapela a for who be that must intervene to prevent that great great one permit be victim killed there then on spot demanded have chance given to appeal against machenga judgment opportunity to produce proof of innocence none answered mapela be dragged forth executioner take die will see for king have bidden to be present to morrow will not see retorted for will decline to be present nothing will induce to countenance by presence scene of cold blooded atrocity nay friend answered mapela laying hand impressively upon arm must not dream of attempting to evade king command to do so must be fatal to follower for must be interpreted to mean that in heart cherish evil thought against king fear to face ordeal impi must instantly be dispatched with order to eat up yours however disagreeable to may be sight will witness to morrow must on account seek to evade tell a friend because wish well because snake tell that in way how know not presence at smelling out ' to morrow will be mean whereby many valuable life will be saved now be time that must depart have be with long enough sala guhli chia'gnosi until to morrow bear well in mind caution to concluded in whisper then rising made sign to rest of chief who sprang to foot saluted retired in body after reiterating thanks for splendid gift have bestowed upon chapter twelve machenga chief witch doctor of mashona be about mid afternoon of same day when a sat in shadow of wagon tent pondering upon possibility of being able successfully to approach king upon question of concession to mine gold in mashonaland piet informed that certain men whom befuni recognised a messenger from king be coming toward wagon from gwanda five minute later arrived there be six of be laden with good needed not explanation to assure be present from king one bore complete mashona warrior panoply consisting of plumed headdress leopard skin mantle mucha of leopard tail armlet anklet garter of cow tail necklace consisting of about forty gold nugget bored strung upon strip of rimpi shield war club immense bangwan stabbing spear gift be of course to be regarded a logical sequence appropriate return for uniform have presented to majesty that morning there be other gift a well exceedingly valuable one too three of other messenger being bearer of most magnificent kaross skin rug one being made of lion skin one of leopard skin one finest of of monkey skin of specie unknown to black fur being extraordinarily long thick glossy remaining two men carried of leather bag weighing about sixty pound one bag containing coarse gold dust while other be full of small rough nugget of gold two men be also bearer of message of apology from king to effect that since seemed to have liking for gold regretted that have more to offer that a gold be of value in country be not particularly sought after be only occasionally that stray nugget handful of dust be found that content of bag represented casual finding of many year be somewhat disappointing to learn here in gwanda where have confidently anticipated that gold in practically unlimited quantity might be have almost for asking there must be so little yet situation be not without compensation for if native attached so little value to metal that must not even take trouble to hunt for there ought to be more for if must coax king into granting concession so dissembled disappointment handed over gift to piet with instruction to pack away in rear of wagon rewarded messenger who have brought dismissed happy in possession of few mixed bead about past ten o'clock night be sitting in wagon reading by light of full moon for being eve of great annual festival town be in uproar volume of sound emanating from from temporary encampment outside rendered sleep impossible when became aware of figure muffled in great kaross in such manner a to render identification impossible apart from circumstance however there be certain suggestion of furtiveness in movement of figure something indicative of desire to avoid observation that attracted attention from book aroused curiosity seemed to be wandering about aimlessly when have be watching for ten minute became convinced that erratic a movement seemed to be be not without method that method soon saw be causing unknown one man to gravitate slowly surely toward wagon so waited patiently quarter of hour later accomplished masterly movement brought within shadow of wagon s ' bona muntu remarked quietly what be business brings by crooked path to wagon to night au ejaculated mysterious one in confusion chia'gnosi have good eye nothing escape see even little red tick hide on blade of grass if ear be a good a eye will perchance have heard of one named machenga have heard of such one answered cautiously what have heard of demanded unknown have heard that machenga be name of king chief witch doctor replied with still greater caution who be why have come to wagon at time of night be to talk to of machenga machenga be very great man observed visitor next to king be greatest man in mashonaland also be king friend friend of king be friend enemy of king be enemy come to with message from machenga demanded if so proceed ear be open au ejaculated unknown one chia'gnosi be very wise understands understands that when machenga speaks king listens who like chia'gnosi be wise desire king favour do well first to secure favour of machenga piet called come hither open for bale containing handkerchief printed calico also find for plier brass chain article named be duly produced selected two of most brilliant bandana must find added thereto couple of yard of calico printed with tasteful design in crimson blue consisting of alternation of horseshoe running horse carrying head tail very high cut off yard of brass chain to attached shaving mirror a pendant filled brass box with mixed bead arranged whole in tasteful little heap on top of voorkissie then turned to visitor pointing to heap said friend word be word of wisdom see gift take place in hut of machenga saying that chia'gnosi send in token of goodwill say also that have here many other gift equally precious that if king continues to regard with favour grant certain request think of preferring generous share of gift will find way to hut of machenga for instant visitor leaned forward gleaming eye fixed avariciously upon little pile of trumpery spread out temptingly upon lid of chest a did so upper fold of kaross slipped apart caught momentary glimpse of most extraordinary countenance be that of old man so old that head be quite bald wrinkled face entirely devoid of hair deeply sunken eye glowed like of leopard in dark forehead be broad high nose thin crooked like beak of eagle mouth mere straight slit thin lip be drawn back in sort of incipient snarl be expression of face particularly arrested attention for never before have beheld human countenance on unimaginable cruelty boundless rapacity be so clearly strongly written be common ordinary individual at once told there must be one man in gwanda with countenance a instantly guessed truth that visitor be none other than machenga for moment two talon like right hand of man hovered greedily over little display then flashed back be lost in fold of kaross be quickly drawn round head again concealing from view man stepped back pace drew up haughtily with gesture of contempt pointed to gift au exclaimed think ye that machenga craves such bauble a be well enough for child fool machenga accepts only gift of real value such for instance a suggested one of magic fire tube with caused flying pigeon to fall dead at king foot to day answered visitor nay said may not be must be kindness on part to give machenga fire tube for must not know how to use must teach hastily interposed stranger nay answered not so for be thing of magic magic of white man be unlike of black man can black man learn be machenga to take one of fire tube in hand one of two thing must happen tube must refuse to slay at must turn upon machenga kill au white man be not true when speak lie talk a fool exclaimed visitor displaying much righteous indignation know for have seen magic fire tube before many moon ago ay before be born before lomalindela be king two white men came into mashonaland only one of went out again too possessed fire tube one of amaboona boer man who did not go out once put fire tube into hand showed how to use magic lie not in tube in few grain of black powder be poured into round lump of metal be thrust down on top of powder au know though so many moon have passed remember quite well ay remember many other thing also thing happened here long before mashona arrived in land thing happened when monomotapa dwelt here great city of stone brick covered face of country when men dug gold out of rock made into ornament for arm neck ankle of woman what foolishness be thou art talking interrupted angrily for be growing late be beginning to feel tired while there seemed to be sign of intention on part of unwelcome visitor to leave return now to machenga continued describe to gift have set aside for say that if will send thee for to morrow at sunrise will be if want not be well have others for then thou wilt not give one of thy fire tube with supply of magic powder enough of round lump of metal to kill one hundred pigeon demanded visitor will not replied shortly be last word au retorted man very well white man hear thee go may be that to morrow thou wilt be sorry that thou didst refuse so saying wrapped kaross still more closely about strode away into moonlight with light springy step of young man a for be now quite ready for bed therefore undressed turned in without further delay expecting to fall asleep on instant yet did nothing of kind for when stretched out upon cartel found thought dwelling upon mysterious visitor who felt sure must be none other than machenga stolen surreptitiously away from mysterious rite of fetish house in hope of cajoling rifle out of began to wonder whether two white men to whom have referred a having visited mashonaland many moon ago one only of whom went out of country again must by chance have be friend henderson boer partner van raalte also greatly wondered what fellow must possibly have meant by mysterious talk of time before mashonas came to country when be inhabited by people whom named monomotapa who built great city of brick stone worked gold mine made gold ornament for woman pondering thus became little vexed with for untactful treatment of man whom have permitted to leave in distinctly bad temper instead of humouring conciliating a felt persuaded might easily have done however be not altogether without hope that after night reflection fellow might reopen negotiation when must do best to establish friendly relation with if only for purpose of learning little more about mysterious monomotapa ruin of one of whose town have actually seen examined so thinking gradually dropped off to sleep a be not very surprising dreamed wonderful dream wherein found living moving among monomotapa who proved to be very highly civilised race possessing vast amount of knowledge of many thing that modern only guessed at in most vague fashion be plunged deep in midst of most astounding adventure when piet awoke with intelligence that be sunrise that regiment in outlying cantonment be already astir preparing to enter gwanda to assist in celebration of great annual festival enquired whether there be sign of visitor of previous night be told that there be not at information be sorrier than ever for hasty behaviour for be now evident that machenga definitely refused gift have set out for acceptance for savage to refuse gift be tantamount to declaration of enmity must ill afford to make enemy of anyone in mashonaland still le of so powerful personage a machenga chief witch doctor confidential adviser of king be by then too late however to mend matter unless be prepared to make unconditional surrender by sending particular gift that coveted be always unwise in extreme to surrender to demand of savage therefore decided to let matter take course to be prepared a fully a possible for untoward contingency therefore a soon a have bathed breakfasted directed piet first to feed water horse then have brought back to wagon saddle bridle leaving girth loose ready to be drawn tight at moment tie up in shadow of wagon so that if necessary entire party must mount ride at moment notice next have five parcel of ammunition prepared parcel weighing about thirty pound placed in readiness in wagon so that if occasion must arise must snatch parcel secure round waist before abandoning other belonging then have gun loaded placed with parcel of ammunition indicating particular weapon man be to take charge of must perchance become necessary for to make hurried flight for life finally loaded own pet rifle brace of pistol thrust latter in belt carrying rifle in hand mounted prince rode off unaccompanied to be present at festival since according to mapela failure to comply with king command must inevitably result in following being eaten up otherwise destroyed by impi a swung into saddle rear company of last regiment of warrior to enter gwanda be winding snake like through four entrance gate therefore to give time to reach appointed position in great square before arrival proceeded at foot pace with result be last person to enter town immediately have passed in through south gateway massive gate be swung to barred behind while company of fifty warrior drew up across face of closed gate barring possibility of exit to great inward discomposure be careful however not to permit smallest outward indication of inward discomposure to manifest proceeded onward up long street still riding at foot pace wearing a complete air of nonchalance a be able to assume under somewhat disconcerting circumstance during progress through town glanced right left about from time to time saw not solitary man in of narrow lane between hut be evidently congregated in great square in centre of town here there caught passing glimpse of woman two little group of child peering curiously at from interior of hut a passed finally reached junction of square with street be traversing dismounting turned over horse to care of lad of about fourteen directing umfaan to lead animal into shadow of certain hut indicated there carefully hold by bridle until must return then on foot passed through narrow gap in solid phalanx of warrior found in square with mapela waiting to conduct to place have be assigned to from be unwillingly to witness forthcoming spectacle imposing a have be scene in great square on preceding day be a nothing compared to what now beheld for with exception of small open space about one hundred foot in diameter in north west corner of square vast quadrangle be literally packed with warrior in full war equipment regiment after regiment being drawn up in such close order that there be only narrow space of le than yard in width between rank a mapela conducted through serried rank idly wondered what narrow space be for be to learn purpose too soon be glad that thou hast come chia'gnosi murmured companion in ear a made way slowly toward small open space nevertheless say unto thee be watchful hing may by chance anger great great one for be in black mood to day why know not when king frown mean death be thy place indicating stool placed close to king empty throne stand here until king be seated for be not lawful for man to sit until be bidden to do so by king farewell so saying mapela saluted withdrew making way toward regiment of be induna now left absolutely to myself in vast space became acutely conscious of terribly oppressive silence prevailed notwithstanding fact that according to estimate there must have be nearly fifty thousand men in enclosure one of stood straight up staring intently into space immediately in front of moving not so much a muscle scarcely daring to breathe a seemed to mute a figure carved in stone for perhaps ten minute although seemed more like hour to dreadful breathless stillness remained unbroken then faint sound like of sudden breeze sweeping over grass be in reality involuntary sigh of relief from suspense emanating from fifty thousand breast stirred air a curtain veiling entrance to itunkulu king house be drawn aside figure of lomalindela fully clad in hussar uniform sword included appeared for brief space stood there in doorway glowering then doubtless in obedience to signal failed to note spear warrior held in right hand be raised aloft royal salute of bayete bayete bayete pealed out like thunderclap on startled air be silent again for moment king brow cleared ghost of smile flitted across countenance must defy man living civilised savage to remain entirely indifferent to tremendous outburst of homage more intense because of imposing figure majesty cut in new rig out then smile passed scowl returned with glare seemed to be concentrated especially on lomalindela strode majestically forward scarcely deigning to acknowledge salute slowly seated in chair throne a did so company of hundred picked warrior majesty own bodyguard marched out from behind itunkulu under induna in especially imposing war dress ranged in semicircle round immediately behind king person then from somewhere in rear of where be sitting there suddenly came leaping bounding into small open space most extraordinary horrible figure be that of man man who have visited at wagon on previous night presently perceived although did not immediately recognise for dark body be painted back front from head to foot in white in such manner a to represent with considerable skill fidelity fleshless skeleton head be decorated with pair of bullock horn firmly secured by mean of strap round neck wore necklace composed entirely of skeleton human hand have be severed at wrist about waist be girdle of animal teeth claw supporting mucha rather short petticoat made of dry grass from beneath rear portion of dangled bullock tail in right hand carried formidable bangwan stabbing spear notwithstanding great age man who of course be machenga dreaded chief witch doctor capered pirouetted with astounding agility in centre of arena for fully five minute then suddenly dashed forward prostrating at lomalindela foot proceeded to do bonga homage by shouting various title of king exalting majesty to sky a greatest most potent most wonderful most glorious monarch in universe only king in fact worthy of serious mention sort of thing punctuated at interval by thunderous shout of acclamation from troop continued until king satiated with praise put stop to when man after brief interval of silence rose to foot stood staring intently for few minute up into rich blue splendour of cloudless sky then gliding meanwhile slowly hither thither in series of narrow circle turn twist in kind of slow waltz step machenga began song burden of be glory majesty power of king inexpressible wickedness of who presumptuously dared to entertain evil thought of continued for about twenty minute during singer gradually worked up into state of excitement exaltation finally became perfect frenzy under influence of voice rose to piercing shriek while dashed hither thither with display of strength agility fury seemed to incredible finally man collapsed sank to ground exhausted foaming at mouth at same instant out from rear dashed entire company of subordinate witch doctor in number fully one hundred who forming up about prostrate chief began to dance madly round singing weird song of must make nothing except occasional word here there that conveyed particular meaning to men be decorated garbed exactly like chief excepting that instead of bangwan carried slender white wand about twelve foot in length in right hand for period of about five minute terrible being whirled flashed hither thither in bewildering confusion then with precision of highly trained soldier suddenly halted became aware that machenga chief be again upon foot standing in midst then while cloud of dust raised by mad gyration still hovered in air half obscuring company tramp of foot be heard into small arena marched twenty stalwart ten of whom be armed with enormous bangwans while remainder carried heavy straight bladed knife about two foot long six inch wide at hilt tapering away from there to sharp point twenty whom lomalindela grimly condescended to inform be slayer halted on king left just clear of left wing of majesty bodyguard arranging in pair spearman knife bearer alternately a did so then machenga at nod from king raised bangwan immediately satellite began to circle hither thither with slow waltz like movement similar to with have begun own mad dance a moved gradually widening circle until be strung out along face of motionless regiment hummed low weird wordless song be somehow inexpressibly suggestive of vague nameless horror a for machenga after watching assistant for minute two stalked slowly toward king seated at majesty foot where after time seemed to lose consciousness of outward thing to sink into state of profound anxious thought meanwhile general company of witch doctor have separated into unit who be slowly working way along front rank of closely packed regiment pausing occasionally a though in doubt then passing on again to obvious relief of individual before whom ominous pause have be made for little while possibly five six minute matter proceeded thus nothing happened then observed that one of witch doctor have halted with head thrown up be sniffing air like dog have scented game turned head eagerly here there a though trying air seemed to get scent for be seeking then looked square into eye of man in rank who visibly quailed beneath gaze then sniffing again witch doctor suddenly sprang forward thrust face close to of man who seemed to have incurred suspicion after momentary pause a though to make quite sure of what suspected stepped back pace stretching forth wand in hand lightly touched unfortunate warrior on breast with instantly man comrade to right left of seized unhappy wight by arm led forward unresisting to within about ten pace of king for moment king regarded supposed culprit with cold frowning stare then turned toward where slayer be drawn up nodded upon pair of stepped forward stationed bangwan bearer in front knife bearer behind doomed man who stood with hand clenched by side comrade having at king nod taken from spear shield laid at majesty foot then a saw right arm of executioner raised to strike shut eye moment later heard dull sound of blow followed by thud of falling body when opened eye first victim of diabolical rite of smelling out lay stretched out upon face dead with skull cloven bangwan wound must have cut heart in twain be sickening sight there be one redeeming feature about mode of death be at least merciful for slayer have done work so well so quickly that unhappy man must have died instantly with perhaps scarcely pang to mark dissolution be mere nobody just common soldier from rank who have probably never harboured in simple heart single thought disloyal to king machenga be cunning enough to realise that certain number of such unconsidered inconspicuous victim must be sacrificed if must avoid attracting undue attention to fact that holocaust included whose death advantaged pecuniarily a gratification of revenge chapter thirteen kill machenga be expelled from mashonaland after fall of first victim dreadful work proceeded quite briskly witch doctor seeming to feel incumbent upon to display skill zeal by providing at least a many victim a most active zealous of brother practitioner a victim after victim fell sacrifice to a cruel wicked debasing superstition a be possible for mind to conceive so did anger burn more fiercely until felt almost irresistible impulse impelling to spring to foot with pistol levelled at king head insist upon end being put to slaughter yet while knew must hing in way of interposition be a utterly helpless a though have be thousand mile away instead of sitting there within arm length of man who be responsible for for supposing must be crazy enough to obey impulse what must happen why king guard must be upon in second must be hacked to piece by terrible bangwans in drawing of single breath while probably even worse fate must befall hapless follower of course idea be madness act impossibility yet when few minute later saw tall induna logwane mapela friend led forth mercilessly done to death must not refrain from leaning toward king murmuring o king witch doctor be not infallible made dreadful mistake when smelled out that man among subject none be more loyal faithful than logwane why did suffer to be slain king glowered at for moment eye smouldering with suppressed anger then answered coldly white man believed logwane to be that say be mistaken for witch doctor can not err man can hide guilt from have logwane not harboured treachery in heart must not have smelled out therefore suffered to be slain man may think evil of continue to live at moment machenga who seemed to have gradually sunk into kind of trance rose slowly to foot with fixed glassy eye staring straight before began to mutter to in voice pitched so low that at first must distinguish nothing of what said then began to glide slowly round in very small circle perceived presently when faced raised head sniffed air strongly occurred three time upon third occasion detected that for instant fixed glassy stare of eye gave place to lightning like glance of triumphant malignity then knew that entire pose be merely piece of exceedingly clever acting that be more in trance than be when have completed fourth half circle halted at distance of about ten yard from where be sitting with back turned toward proceeded to sniff air still more strongly yes presently exclaimed in voice quite loud enough for king to hear be not deceived smell though skin be white heart be black smell evil thought against great great one lurk deep down in smile of diabolical malice overspread evil face a shook great spear aloft began to dance very slowly singing softly to so be villain be actually going to smell out not if know thought starting to foot a drew pistol from belt levelled at cried halt there machenga halt say thou diest deceiver murderer destroyer of king most faithful friend giver of evil counsel to great great one magic tell that in evil heart of thine thou hast conceived design to slay because when thou didst come secretly to wagon last night refused to give thee one of magic fire tube now will prove thee rascal will show king thou chief witch doctor forsooth art nothing base pretender player upon credulity thou dost claim to be great powerful magician well so be kill if thou canst will be that of two who kill other will be more powerful magician will also be one whose mouth speaks truth meanwhile during interlude brief a be five new victim two of indunas have be smelled out brought forward king intent only upon what be passing between machenga have forborne to give fatal signal to slayer thus little group of victim executioner stood motionless in centre of arena while eye be turned upon chief witch doctor machenga have obeyed imperative command to halt thus unconsciously demonstrating at once that state of trance be merely pretence when ceased to speak further betrayed by answering au chia'gnosi exclaimed so thou too art magician thou dost threaten to kill fool man living magician otherwise can kill else must have died age before thou wert born can will kill thee in despite of thy magic thus do a spoke up went right hand with great bangwan in intent being evidently to transfix by hurling spear at guessed at purpose read in eye quick though be be quicker before have time to gather strength to cast spear have levelled pistol pulled trigger good little weapon barked out a hammer fell through thin veil of powder smoke saw machenga spin round on heel flinging up arm at same time next instant down crashed upon back with small blue hole in very centre of forehead from thin stream of blood began to trickle slowly with lightning like movement thrust empty pistol into jacket pocket transferred rifle from left hand to right at same time wheeling sharply round upon king to see what action if intended to take caught in act of springing to foot at once flung up left hand warningly nay o great great one said very firmly rise not pray thee lest evil befall magic be just now very strong a thou hast seen so strong that can scarcely control if anyone here cherishes evil design against have better forget now instant lest rise up destroy so that be well a king sank limply back into seat now continued raising voice so that must be heard by at least greater part of warrior gathered there in great square king be about to confer together therefore let man move hand foot utter single word for air be full of terrible magic that only can control if be disturbed may break loose when concluded with expressive gesture be meant to convey sort of dreadful thing have satisfaction of seeing lomalindela black skin turn kind of slate colour while lip became dirty blue white for few second king stared stupidly at machenga dead body a though must not believe evidence of own eye then turned to said truly chia'gnosi thou art well named for thy lightning have slain who be a have always known even when oldest living man in mashonaland be boy running at mother heel why hast thou slain chief of witch doctor slew o king answered because be liar cheat betrayer murderer lied to thee cheated thee by pretending that must smell out thine enemy whereas possessed such power smelled out caused to be destroyed logwane one of most loyal faithful of indunas because after heavily bribing machenga for several year in order to obtain immunity logwane refused to submit to further robbery what have done to logwane have doubtless done to many others of majesty loyal faithful subject how knowest thou chia'gnosi demanded king how be to know thy word be true have not proved to thee by destroying machenga retorted thinkest thou that if machenga have be what claimed to be must have slain a to how know snake told never lie if thou dost still doubt question indunas doubtless there be among whom thou canst trust who will tell thee whether logwane be true whether be false to thee king frowningly considered proposition for little finally looking up called mapela to approach mapela said lomalindela when induna have drawn near saluted be perplexed know not what to believe can believe thy word because have proved thee know thee to be faithful true thou didst know logwane intimately tell therefore be loyal to be not there be man in mashonaland more faithful to thee than logwane answered mapela yet machenga smelled out caused to be slain a enemy of mine king reminded do not know retorted old man bitterly if machenga have smelled out too must have be slain although a thou sayest thou hast proved know to be faithful true thank thy snake o lomalindela king of mashona chia'gnosi saw evil falsehood lurked in black heart pointing to dead body of machenga else must many of thy friend among number perchance have died before yon sun sank behind hill king placed elbow on knee buried face in hand for several minute evidently overwhelmed by sense of profound perplexity at length however looked up again still addressing mapela asked think ye mapela that pointing to long array of slain suffered unjustly nay answered mapela be simple induna knowing nothing save art of warfare way in warrior must be trained in order to make good fighter of who be must presume to answer question ask chia'gnosi be young be very wise perhaps wisdom may be able to answer thee ask king turned to thou hast heard question chia'gnosi mapela answer said canst thou tell want to know listen to word o king said last night when moon be so high in heaven pointed to approximate altitude of planet machenga came secretly in disguise to wagon asking for gift knew not then who be did say indeed pretended to be messenger from machenga presently knew for machenga although have never before seen set forth certain gift offered refused demanding a gift one of magic fire tube when refused went away threatening that to day must be sorry have refused then knew that be messenger machenga who have visited knew man for liar cheat thou dost ask whether slain suffered unjustly answer thee that did know none of save logwane send thou ascertain name of other indunas who have died to day by hand of slayer thou shalt find that like logwane be rich men half of whose rich must pas to machenga be men who have incurred machenga hatred let smellers out be brought before thee questioned thou shalt find that be by machenga order that smelled out indunas a for others be necessary that certain number of common people must also die else must choice of indunas have be too obvious by bone of royal father thy word chia'gnosi be word of wisdom will do a thou sayest exclaimed king mapela give order that smellers out be brought before ten minute later subordinate witch doctor smellers out be called together drawn up before king when prompted by mapela subjected wretch to searching cross examination with result that surmise be completely confirmed be not easy to shock savage there must be doubt that when investigation be finished lomalindela be shocked not so much at fact that great deal of innocent blood have be shed that so many of most loyal devoted indunas have be removed must therefore no longer exercise loyalty fidelity on behalf one know better than savage autocrat value of true loyalty fidelity be distinctly perturbed at disquieting thought came crowding into mind be characteristic of that seemed more than half inclined to blame for what have happened on principle suppose for must have known nothing about must consequently have escaped perturbation disquiet resulted from revelation at event when revelation be complete be upon that turned demanding sharply now chia'gnosi having revealed evil reveal also remedy that o great great one be easy replied let there be more smelling out there will be no more mistake more smelling out repeated then how will who meditate evil against be found will not need to be found replied for if such there be rest assured that will betray even a machenga betrayed to repeat let there be more smelling out if man be discovered meditating evil let accuser bring before thee bear witness against if be found guilty let suffer king meditated upon proposition at considerable length asked multitude of question before appeared able to grasp idea fully finally seemed to apprehend plan graciously announced willingness to consider smelling out function be thus brought to somewhat premature conclusion to obvious relief of everybody except perhaps lomalindela troop be dismissed when too hastily assuming that everything be over rose to take leave return to wagon be imperiously ordered to stop upon resuming seat be thanked by king in somewhat perfunctory half hearted way for what have done added that revelation have so upset that found impossible to tolerate presence in country longer therefore begged so to arrange matter must resume journey that same afternoon naturally remonstrated against such discourteous treatment reminding majesty that although revelation be certainly mine evil doing be machenga wound up by saying that so far from expecting to be expelled from country have confidently reckoned upon being granted concession to mine gold in mashonaland be of avail be through that upset have occurred therefore out must go escorted by impi induna of must receive instruction to see did not unduly loiter on way a to gold if wanted that king strongly advised to go to bandokolo country far away to north where must doubtless be able to obtain a much of metal a needed after generously giving piece of valuable advice majesty curtly dismissed with intimation must be prepared to start in equivalent of two hour time take consequence of disobedience upon in turn got angry having told king one two plain truth in distinctly undiplomatic language bade abrupt farewell hastened back to wagon be quite ready to make start even to extent of having ox inspanned by time that escorting impi put in appearance when did be thankful to discover that be commanded by friend mapela au chia'gnosi old chap exclaimed a impi halted saluted with great heartiness so thou art ready be well for great great one be in evil temper face be black toward thee because thou hast spoiled festival therefore will be good for thee to withdraw from before eye a soon a possible way go ye forward backward go forward mapela replied came to country in hope of obtaining gold gold must have therefore be going forward to country of bandokolo where so king tell gold be to be obtained in great abundance wao ma bandokolo exclaimed old fellow in great astonishment know ye aught of bandokolo where be to be found demanded nay answered know nothing of save that country lie far to north that have much gold be true returned mapela then let start for delay be dangerous if linger great great one may change mind not suffer thee to go at yonder be way up that valley give word chia'gnosi a go can talk together if what can tell thee must cause thee to change thy mind can take road back on other side of mountain when have passed through valley paused left for moment while wagon be getting into motion impi be forming up round then when be fairly under way came to side again remarked au chia'gnosi thine arrival at gwanda be well timed for many be still alive who for thee must have lain dead in great square before setting of yonder sun did not say that snake told thou wouldst save many life thou hast done so mark thou chia'gnosi though to day king face be black against thee people know what thou hast done henceforth thy name will be hlonipa among mashona hlonipa mean unmentionable to make man name hlonipa be highest honour that kafir can render bearer for indicates that name be regarded a too sacred too highly venerated to be spoken thus subsequently learned that after departure from country mashona never mentioned chia'gnosi smiter with lightning when referred to spoke of who slew with thunderbolt in other more le roundabout fashion evaded direct use of word lightning well replied to be quite candid with mapela believe be very good thing for mashona that machenga be dead be not sorry that compelled to kill also be glad that king have promised to abolish system of smelling out ' for in first place in least believe in in next be perfectly evident that unscrupulous scoundrel like machenga must only be too likely to use for own vile purpose now let talk about something else tell for instance what know about bandokolo whereabout country be situated country lie yonder answered mapela pointing little to west of north be long way off thou wilt have to cross great river zambezi then travel through wilderness for space of moon half maybe two moon before thou wilt reach for have never be beyond great river many moon ago there came into mashonaland stranger who said that have be one of band accompanying white man from afar who after much weary wandering have arrived in bandokolo country have there died how know not when white man died bandokolo took follower made slave of treating so cruelly that at last man who told thing resolved to escape after waiting many moon for opportunity came succeeded when arrived in mashonaland be so weak ill with fever starvation that after lingering for short time died before died told many wonderful thing about bandokolo said that be little people about so tall indicating with hand stature of about four foot eight nine inch also that instead of being black a be be almost white that live in great house dug out of rock of hillside that men wear clothes made of small plate of gold carry spear shield great knife made of gold that adorn with shining stone dig out of ground that be bekulu great wizard be very extraordinary story mapela said did believe do think that man who told have sick brain imagined thing be not nay who can say returned mapela a have told man be very sick when reached mashonaland think sickness be of body not of mind told thing many time before died therefore believed spent best part of afternoon in cross questioning mapela upon exceedingly interesting remarkable story have told old fellow stuck to text so perfectly that at length be forced to conclusion that what have told be substantially what have be told that if there be falsehood exaggeration in yarn be not who be responsible for outspanned that night at distance of twelve good mile north east of gwanda in most beautiful valley full of lush grass beside stream now much diminished in volume have be following ever since passage of limpopo having shot elephant about hour before arrival at outspan feasted royally that night impi building enormous watch fire squatting round stuffing with elephant meat until must eat more early in forenoon of eleventh day after departure from gwanda reached zambezi at point where by stroke of good luck river chanced to be fordable having got wagon other belonging safely across to left bank immediately outspanned then proceeded to distribute liberal largesse among subordinate officer of impi gave specially handsome present so parted upon excellent term from mashona friend not without qualm of regret of wistful surmise a to chance of ever again seeing later on after meal rest again inspanned trekking few mile upstream rounded shoulder of range of low hill plunged into valley stretching northward with small southward flowing stream running through centre discharging into zambezi upon splendid river now turned back befuni man who have fought by command of lomalindela have afterwards attached to train exhibited slight symptom of regret at parting from friend in returning impi quickly recovered from fit of blue evidently being very fond of animal devoted with zest to task of making friend with horse dog also poor fellow speedily developed most devoted attachment to myself so arousing in piet feeling of profound jealousy disgust only succeeded in dissipating with difficulty after occurrence of several more le serious quarrel between pair during three week immediately followed passage of zambezi route lay through wilderness in for day together never saw solitary human being did not very greatly matter for country consisting for most part of low rolling hill be well watered by stream flowing generally in direction more le north south be able to follow day after day while grass be plentiful of very good quality moreover there be not much bush must have be to extent disadvantage for fact that a advanced game became so tame that have very little difficulty in stalking through long grass during particular period of journey encountered very few elephant big game of kind antelope of various description be abundant so that always have plenty of buck meat in larder then one day scouting far ahead of wagon accompanied by piet befuni dog discovered that be approaching vast open plain where grass be not nearly so good therefore rode back few mile upon meeting wagon gave order for prolonged outspan at suitable spot so that ox be becoming thin from constant work might have few day rest recover flesh in preparation for journey across plain remained at outspan five day when resumed journey have reason to regard time a well spent for a pushed forward across open plain grass became so poor that for period of rest recuperation have allowed be convinced that ox must never have accomplished journey at luckily for when have lost three ox remainder have become little better than walking skeleton reached other side of plain once more came to good grass water here rested again for week on second day after resumption of trek two mountain of almost perfect pyramidal form be sighted right ahead apparently about fifty mile apart on following day flat open plain gave place to undulating country gradually grew more rugged park like a advanced with good grass small detached patch of bush few tree singly in clump scattered thinly here there soon noticed that apart from grass vegetation generally be new strange of kind that none of have ever before seen tree in particular being very curious grotesque in shape a to trunk branch foliage being of almost other colour than green in case tree notwithstanding strange abnormal configuration be very beautiful large heart shaped leaf being of almost conceivable tint of red ranging from palest pink to very deep rich crimson with great bunch of snow white blossom while at opposite end of scale a be there occurred example in trunk branch be swollen knotted twisted into most extraordinary uncouth shape while foliage consisted of long flat ribbon like streamer of dirty brownish grey hue coated with exudation odour of be offensive beyond power of word to express fortunately for last be comparatively rare soon learned to give plenty of room to pas to windward where possible here too saw first of several new strange form of animal life a piet be a usual riding forward distance ahead of wagon suddenly came upon small herd of seven curious looking animal at first mistook for young giraffe a stood gazing at curiously thus permitting to approach within le than hundred yard of observed that while creature bore certain general resemblance to giraffe there be difference most important of be that of size for creature stood at shoulder only about a high a eland neck although abnormally long be not proportionately a long a of giraffe head be hornless of quite different shape from giraffe head lastly colour be deep rich ruddy brown on head shading gradually away along body leg until about fetlock became quite pale buff shot one of have skin to day have be source of great interest also bit of puzzle to several naturalist who have seen who declare to have belonged to animal of have knowledge whatever flesh of creature proved to be very tender juicy boy ate of freely after trying mouthful decided that did not care for meat having very strong peculiar musky flavour found much reverse of appetising then a appropriate wind up to day have be rich in surprise while be looking about for suitable spot at to outspan for night came upon first of bandokolo people rather for be woman came upon be at moment riding through willow depression about mile wide bordered on side by rising bush clad ground be scarcely high enough to be worthy of name of hill with narrow willow rivulet on right have about decided that spot where have reined up must answer purpose quite well when two dog thunder juno who have be following quietly enough at horse heel suddenly ran forward few pace then stood pointing uttering low half yelping half whining noise while a be wont when be puzzled for few moment must see nothing to account for excitement be about to speak to when looking forward suddenly saw something raise in grass remain visible for perhaps dozen second then sink down again be about hundred yard from spot where have pulled up from brief glimpse have obtained almost thought that strange a might be have seen child to satisfy therefore called to piet accompanied by dog cantered forward toward place where strange apparition have appeared chapter fourteen marvel of bandokolo country horse have not advanced more than dozen stride when strange looking object again appeared came stumbling toward then saw that be indeed human being apparently girl of about twelve year of age from stature first thing particularly observed be that skin be kind of brownish white next that have mop of black hair streaming loosely down over shoulder then saw that be half naked for single garment in be clad be in such tattered condition that remained of be few fluttering rag be evident that poor creature be in very last stage of exhaustion for reeled staggered a came toward with outstretched appealing arm presently when be still few yard apart with low wailing cry fell prone lay huddled up in pathetic little heap in long grass while dog dashed forward stood alternately nuzzling looking up to with plaintive whine next instant swung out of saddle bending down raised unfortunate creature in arm when saw to amazement that be evidently full grown woman of very diminutive stature being only about four foot six inch in height moreover be in most shockingly emaciated condition on back be close network of scarcely healed scar looked a though might have resulted from most merciless scourging be in deep swoon having apparently exhausted last particle of strength in endeavour to reach taking off hat handed to piet with instruction that must fill own at brook return to with speed while be gone pulled off jacket wrapped frail senseless form in for saw at once that creature have not be accustomed like native woman with whom have thus far come in contact to go about in such state rag still clung to attenuated form showed that habitually wore clothing there be certain suggestion of refinement in mould of feature led to conclusion that belonged to race of people having claim to be regarded a civilised in own peculiar fashion in short answered in respect to mapela description of bandokolo have gathered from what said that be in sort civilised race be long time before succeeded in restoring poor creature to sens so long indeed that when at length opened eye began to look wonderingly about wagon be close at hand a soon therefore a be within easy hailing distance ordered jan to outspan instructed piet to prepare cartel when latter be ready carried patient to laid upon then having shot buck earlier in day started fire set to work to prepare good strong broth when be ready administered with seemingly good effect for when woman have partaken of spoke word two sounded like enquiry must make nothing of must piet whereupon befuni came forward presently contrived to hit upon kind of bantu dialect woman understood then when have satisfied curiosity a to who be where came from whither be going have assured that be friend that might regard a perfectly safe with informed in turn that be of bandokolo that have be driven out of country border of be then one day march distant for offence be endeavouring to explain when sank back exhausted upon cartel again fell into swoon soon became evident that unfortunate little creature be in most critical condition from combined effect a supposed of fiendish ill treatment violent exertion insufficient nourishment be kept busy night reviving from swoon after swoon in preparation administration of strong broth with to combat terrible prostration be most alarming symptom toward morning however seemed to revive little after absorbing liberal dose of slightly dashed with brandy complained of weariness soon afterward sank into deep sleep from restorative effect of hoped much of course idea of continuing trek day be quite out of question therefore remained where be set jan 'ngulubi to look after ox see that came to harm while piet befuni devoted ourselves to task of looking after invalid though goodness know ignorance of everything connected with leech art be so complete that must hing more than pour into nourishment that must be persuaded to absorb be afraid that be lamentable ignorance of ours be responsible for condition when awoke about ten o'clock in morning for after tossing restlessly upon cartel for about hour suddenly sat up stared about with glassy terrorstricken eye began to mutter rapidly to herself upon feeling pulse found that be throbbing furiously also skin be dry scorching hot in short be evident that be in state of high fever closely bordering on delirium improved matter little by withdrawing cartel from beneath close suffocatingly hot tent of wagon placing on grass in shadow of wagon where soft breeze must play freely upon patient also by swathing head in towel be kept continually dripping wet after about hour of treatment fever so far abated a to permit to talk coherently when told story to following effect name said be siluce be of bandokolo be two hundred twenty five moon little more than seventeen year old father mindula be one of most powerful chief of nation little more than fifteen moon ago used influence to secure what be greatly coveted regarded a very high honour in bandokolo namely position in household of bimbane queen for time went well be happy although bimbane who be so old that man living know how old be be very severe tyrannical cruel to who be brought into contact with then six moon ago met anuti one of captain of queen guard learned to love other four moon passed then in accordance with custom of country anuti presented before queen besought permission to make wife now anuti be one of most splendid men of bandokolo be three hundred seventeen moon nearly twenty four half year old in stature stand full head taller than be valiant warrior clever hunter have royal blood in vein for father father father be son of prince of royal house be said to be tenth cousin of bimbane queen interrupted at point how must that be prince from whom anuti descended must have lived let see yes more than one thousand six hundred moon ago surely queen be not so old a ah be infinitely older answered siluce man know how old be there be record of birth parentage have be queen of bandokolo for unnumbered age oh be nonsense know retorted unless of course record have be very badly kept why in country if man life to be thirteen hundred moon old regard a marvel surely queen can not be older than yes answered siluce indeed be understand bimbane be great magician who keep alive by certain secret art unknown to rest of doe so not only because fear to die also because be persuaded that somewhere in world there be will be man who if can find induce to become spouse will restore to long lost youth joy of life that once knew be great desire of life to find man sooner did see anuti than thought arose that might be one through whom must attain fulfilment of desire by exercise of magic stole heart from induced to wed because protested first caused to be publicly whipped then ordered to leave country saying that at sunrise of following day must send forth hunter to seek for destroy if found knowing that bimbane must keep word fled forthwith smarting from whipping a be made southward avoiding village on way following most lonely bypath must find for just moon have maintained continuous flight living on such fruit other food a chanced to come upon while pursuing way hiding whenever saw man woman scarce daring to rest sleep lest savage beast still more savage hunter must come upon slay now strength have gone hardship of flight have sapped life naught remains for to die glad that be permitted to pas painlessly in hand rather than by of cruel hunter who must drain last remnant of miserable life from by slow torture a unhappy creature uttered last word threw up hand with gesture of despair burst into passion of hysterical weeping made effort to check hoping that thus might gain relief to overwrought feeling instead of happening thought memory have be awakened during recital of terrible experience only increased excitement until in course of hour unhappy girl be fighting screaming in high delirium yet through there be one idea seemed to haunt for later on during comparatively quiet period looked up into face seizing by hand said o wonderful white man great strong be going to masakisale capital of bandokolo will see bimbane take notice will see that on thumb of right hand wear ring in be set wonderful stone shine like sun at eventide that stone be magic stone potent amulet by virtue of be able to do many marvellous thing among others to win heart of men think that be possession of stone enables to prolong life indefinitely if be taken from be to die bandokolo must rejoice for bimbane be cruel tyrant grinding down people making life of many intolerable burden to there have be who have sought to take stone from by power of magic have discovered purpose have destroyed may be that magic will have power over o white man therefore if can take from that stone so deliver bandokolo from merciless tyranny will do promise promise siluce that if can will take stone from answered more to soothe unhappy little creature consuming anxiety must confess than with serious intention at moment of fulfilling promise meant well be glad to see that promise have produced beneficial effect for agitation gradually subsided little later after partaking of more broth sank into slumber uneasy at first gradually became quiet profound improvement be only of brief duration for in little more than hour be again awake raving in high delirium fighting with more fiercely than ever under impression apparently that be hunter who have be sent out to destroy fortunately possessed very fair knowledge of bantu dialect that seemed to understand using did utmost to soothe calm fear effort be worse than unavailing for only seemed to increase terror moreover appeared now to have become raving mad therefore in despair because saw that in struggle with be rapidly wearing out what little strength remained to suddenly released hold upon bade piet befuni do same whereupon sprang from cartel dashed off down valley with speed of hunted deer there be nothing for of course to follow did on horseback with piet dog accompanying proceeded at easy canter taking care to maintain good distance so that might not be conscious of being followed just keeping in sight in fashion poor demented creature ran quite two mile before fell exhausted when came up to where lay found doubled up in long grass apparently senseless moaning pitifully again a on previous day sent piet off to river for water with to restore effort be vain for in le than hour after have come to unhappy girl died without recovering consciousness a soon a be quite sure that be dead mounted horse bidding piet place poor scarred emaciated corpse in arm rode back to wagon procuring necessary tool dug grave in laid poor inanimate body to rest covering well with big boulder from river to protect from ravage of jackal hyena then notwithstanding that be by time late in afternoon inspanned trekked good ten mile up valley for there be nothing that south african savage fear much more than grave knew that nothing must have induced boy to pas night within dozen mile of poor siluce last resting place two day later about mid afternoon outspanned close to headwater of small stream course of have be following for so many day have source in slope of more eastern of two mountain toward have be travelling outspanned at very base of mountain close to margin of rivulet at point have dwindled to width must easily leap across now having arrived at point where particular stream must be of further service to first business before continuing journey must be to find stream flowing northward in direction corresponding generally with desired to pursue accordingly a there still remained to three hour of daylight piet accompanied by befuni who have by time learned to sit horse set out upon short exploring expedition northward spot upon wagon be outspanned be at extremity of south western slope of mountain almost on northernmost extremity of wide flat plain from position looking northward saw that country again presented somewhat broken appearance with high ground to right left something in nature of valley directly ahead valley being obviously place where one must most naturally expect to find water be toward entrance to one wended way with steep slope of mountain shaggy with thickly growing timber of strange form still stranger colour on right a happened be exceptionally fortunate in exploration on occasion for have not ridden more than six mile when issuing from northern slope of mountain base of have be skirting discovered rivulet very similar in character to near have left wagon outspanned upon tasting water found to be deliciously sweet cool moreover stream be flowing northward precisely in direction toward wished to travel followed course of stream for distance of four mile down valley then finding that continued to flow northward showed tendency to increase in volume being fed by other small brook flowing into here there turned horse head cantered back to wagon very well satisfied with result of ride inspanning at dawn next morning easily accomplished trek from headwater of stream be leaving behind to of stream intended to follow before heat of day have fairly set in outspanning at length about eleven o'clock in morning in nicely wooded shady valley gradually widened a progressed with stream on left rising ground on side of here allowed ox to rest graze for nearly three hour resuming journey about half past two o'clock in afternoon a usual piet on horseback accompanied by two dog preceded wagon pace of horse even at walk being so much faster than of slower moving ox that generally managed to find at least two three mile ahead by time that suitable spot for next outspan be reached upon occasion be desirous of exploring route for little distance ahead therefore upon mounting put horse into easy canter soon left wagon out of sight hearing behind proceeding in fashion with occasional rein up to breathe horse found in course of hour half about ten mile from starting point in midst of beautifully wooded park like plain about five mile in width with stream now considerably augmented in volume purling musically over shingly bed on eastern margin of plain high land rising by time almost to dignity of hill still shutting in on hand spot have reached seemed well enough adapted for nightly outspan therefore piet proceeded to mark spot by setting up usual signal be small branch of tree with leaf attached broken from parent stem stuck upright in soil must at once arrest attention of jan hottentot driver upon arrival at spot seeing must outspan even if chanced to be elsewhere when arrived then mounting again resumed journey down valley in search of something wherewith to replenish empty larder at distance of five mile farther down valley secured what wanted having come quite unexpectedly while horse be walking upon herd of black antelope among number of half grown fawn one of managed to bowl over before have sufficiently recovered from surprise to get away having secured prize upon back of piet horse behind saddle proceeded to retrace step leisurely have scarcely covered mile upon backward way when became aware of certain strange roaring grunting sound of kind quite new to apparently proceeding from far side of big clump of bush lay at distance of short quarter of mile on right front curious to learn what must be origin of strange sound turned horse head in direction few minute later upon rounding extremity of clump came upon most extraordinary sight scene be open glade of about four acre in extent bordered by tree among be few specimen of kind described in preceding chapter with weirdly shaped swollen knotted twisted trunk branch long flat ribbon like streamer of leaf coated with vile smelling exudation be not so much glade strange a be appearance with weird looking vegetation attracted attention a what be being enacted in for away toward one edge of be big boulder on top of crouched figure of be woman monkey creature seemed to partake about equally of characteristic of be entirely unclothed whole body be covered with short thick golden brown hair on head being much longer than on rest of body while feature might be described a very human looking for monkey very monkeyfied for human being noticed that arm be disproportionately long a compared with of woman further glance revealed that foot have distinct resemblance to hand great toe looking very much more like thumb be not from however that roaring grunting sound emanated for sat quite silent from two male of own specie who in middle of arena be engaged in deadly combat using hand foot teeth a weapon employed with most ferocious energy gripping other by throat with left hand apparently with twofold purpose of strangling preventing opponent from biting while with right fist battered other savagely occasionally using right foot in endeavour to throw other combatant of whom stood well over six foot high whirled hither thither with astounding agility so completely occupied with other female so absorbed in watching a to be utterly oblivious of presence there on edge of arena partially concealed beneath shadow of tree for several minute fought thus locked together in deadly grip then a though by mutual consent drew apart few pace evidently for purpose of recovering breath glaring ferociously at other meanwhile uttering low deep rumbling snarling growl tremendous energy must have expended during struggle be abundantly evidenced by convulsive heaving of great hairy chest then suddenly rushed at other again became locked in deadly embrace fixing strong fang like teeth deeply in shoulder of other apparently striving to crush body of other in grip of great hairy arm enormously powerful muscle of must be plainly seen working beneath skin to fro swayed still tightly locked together growling snapping at other with such deadly ferocity that in few moment blood be streaming copiously from lacerated shoulder arm then one apparently younger of two succeeded in throwing opponent violently to ground shock seemed partially to stun thrown one for few second of opponent took instant advantage by flinging astride upon antagonist body pinning arm down by kneeling upon gripping throat with hand in throttling grasp soon reduced enemy to condition of utter helplessness then rising heavily somewhat unsteadily to foot conqueror glared about for moment seeming to see what be looking for stooped over insensible foe seized by arm leg lifting above head went staggering across open space toward one of weird looking tree already mentioned into foliage of flung body forthwith to unspeakable horror long sticky ribbon like leaf sensitive a of mimosa seized wrapped about body until in le time than take to tell be so completely enveloped that nothing of be to be seen while leaf of tree be only about fourteen foot high have formed into great horrible tightly compressed mass in seemed to detect for space of minute two sign of internal struggle meanwhile conqueror having thus effectually terribly disposed of foe went reeling staggering over to where female sat impassively upon boulder seized roughly by arm dragged unresisting into depth of wood where soon lost sight of speechless with horror for moment even more at demoniacal ferocity displayed by combatant than at weird ghastliness of manner in fight have ended signed to piet wheeling horse galloped away from scene of tragedy drew rein again until reached wagon be in act of being outspanned then dismounting beckoned to befuni related what have seen asked whether have ever heard of such creature a men monkey that piet have beheld fighting befuni shook head replied in negative have never before be anything like so far north knowledge of bandokolo country appeared be even le than have gained from mapela in course of next day trek passed close to scene of combat for satisfaction of curiosity made point of carefully examining tree into body of vanquished have be thrown leaf be still bunched tightly together observed that mass thus formed be distinctly smaller than have be when last looked upon believed must guess pretty accurately at process be going on within felt very strongly disposed to have tree cut down subjected to examination there be two strong argument against one being overpowering carrion like effluvium tree exhaled while other be piet point blank refusal to have anything to do with attempt on day saw two new specie of animal one being hyena nearly twice a big a have hitherto seen of quite different marking ground colour of skin being very similar to of lion while have black head distinct black mane broad black line running along spine from base of skull to tail alternation of black stripe irregular blotch upon whole of body except under part be white came rather suddenly upon pack of eleven of creature disputing possession of carcass of buffalo with flock of vulture be therefore afforded excellent opportunity to note carefully peculiarity before made off did slowly unwillingly uttering most dreadful maniacal laugh a went other creature be kind of jackal a big a full grown leopard with splendid coat of long fine glossy black fur beast broke cover about fifty yard away from unlike rest of specie instead of beating hasty retreat upon seeing turned promptly attacked with indescribable fury luckily have rifle ready shot brute dead a be in very act of leaping at prince throat be well that did so for upon examining found that be possessed of set of terrible fang capable of inflicting dreadful injury have be afforded chance stripped off hide left carcass to vulture to dispose of did with commendable promptitude a jan subsequently informed when rejoined at next outspan also saw in distance on same day herd of about thirty elephant did not attempt to interfere with a hoped that before long must have something even more valuable than ivory with to load wagon a proceeded country steadily became more broken irregular hill higher more precipitous with frequent outcrop of enormous granite boulder towering cliff of felspar from interstice of sprang strange beautiful fern interspersed with bush bearing flower of remarkable shape most splendid colour tree too grew more closely together stream increased in number many of pouring down face of cliff in form of waterfall dissolved into spray mist long before reached bottom veiling dark rugged rock in soft cloud of delicate vapour reflecting hue of rainbow in short with mile of advance scenery grew more wildly romantically beautiful yet withal there be spot deep narrow glen ravine shut in by towering cliff overshadowing tree where effect be a weird a scene copied from dante inferno in midst of one felt that strangest happening must have excited surprise be in midst of such scene that again encountered gigantic man like monkey subsequently learned formed part of fauna peculiar to remarkable country there be two of time male female be coming toward when sighted instant that caught sight of female turned ran for face of nearest cliff scaled with incredible agility male halted stood ground evidently prepared to dispute passage if necessary to cover companion retreat have fancy for engaging in fight with creature be strange unnatural compound of man beast therefore spoke word to piet reined up whereupon creature after much snarling growling baring of teeth slowly retreated following mate keeping wary eye upon meanwhile until too reached foot of cliff when with parting snarl of defiance climbed vertical face of rock with agility no le extraordinary than displayed by mate chapter fifteen learn interesting particular concerning queen be little after ten o'clock on following morning when piet mounted a usual riding about mile ahead of wagon emerged from narrow winding gorge hemmed in on hand by stupendous almost vertical cliff drawn so closely together that riding though be beside margin of river there be little more than bare room for to travel abreast be not until rounded bend in gorge that knew how near be to end of sight then greeted eye caused to utter shout of delight for before at distance of short quarter of mile be extremity of gorge mere narrow slit between two mighty wall of overhanging sandstone through caught glimpse of open grassy sun bathed plain long rich grass billowing to sweep of fresh breeze wide stretch of level surface darkened here there with rich purple shadow of slow moving cloud promising welcome change from close suffocating enervating insect haunted atmosphere of gorge a background to breezy sunlit scene there towered high into air at distance of ten mile magnificent sweep of lofty mountain rugged broken of outline tree clad to summit gleaming like emerald in strong blaze of morning sun with shout of delight pressed heel to prince rib three minute later piet trotted gaily out through mouth of gorge into sunlit plain to find confronted by troop of fifty of most extraordinary looking warrior have ever seen who have evidently be lying perdu in waiting for behind screen of towering rock formed gateway a be of gorge be little fellow about height of well grown english boy of ten year of age that be full grown men be evidenced by luxuriant beard moustache wore indeed one of leader appeared to be well advanced in year for hair beard be dashed here there with grey be little difficult to judge what natural complexion might be for be deeply tanned by sun imagined must be very little darker than own for be a deeply bronzed a of a must see by glance at own sunburnt hand be clad in uniform consisting of sleeveless shirt looked a though made of white thick silk over be worn kind of tunic of fine scale armour gleamed flashed in sun a though made of gold a indeed afterwards proved to be on head wore plumed helmet of same precious metal leg be bare save for kind of buskin made of leather coloured white reaching to just below knee be armed with short broad bladed sword round target shield finely embossed also made of gold be mounted on zebra trapping of be thickly studded with small gold boss saddle consisting of thickly rolled blanket of soft material strapped over big saddle cloth of crimson silk edged with stout gold cord adorned at corner with tassel of gold bullion there be standard bearer with whose trapping be even richer more ornate than of rank file who bore aloft upon slender lance small standard of crimson silk deeply edged with gold fringe beautifully emblazoned in gold thread with device seemed to be hieroglyphic of sort of must make nothing upon finding thus suddenly confronted with extraordinary array promptly reined horse back upon haunch while with equal promptitude unslung rifle brought to present more by instinct than anything else for of course idea of successfully resisting fifty of even such little fellow a if be evilly disposed toward be possessed of only ordinary courage be absurd chief leader quickly set mind at rest for without moving from place in front of troop threw up right hand exclaimed in rather high pitched voice in bantu dialect with happened to be acquainted nay mighty noble lord slay not with thy lightning pray thee for mean naught good to thee thine pousa captain of queen bodyguard have be dispatched by bimbane deathless one possessor of knowledge reader of secret high mighty queen of bandokolo to bid thee welcome to country to conduct thee in honour to gracious presence be well o pousa thank answered a lowered rifle tell pray how came bimbane to know that be purpose to visit how came to know where must find queen know thing there be secret hidden from answered pousa simply have long known of thy coming reason for at first be minded to destroy thee thy following seize thy belonging then changed mind determined to forbid thine entrance into country now quite recently have again changed mind have decided to receive thee in peace with be who directed how when to come where to lie in wait for thee ay even know that siluce outlawed rebel went out upon dark path from thine arm dickens doe exclaimed in english in height of astonishment nay how can that be seeing that one have passed from to to tell so continued in bantu matter not know answered pousa adding with just touch of impatience do not tell thee that know thing yes answered certainly tell so checked abruptly realising be on point of saying something might easily be construed a offensive will give great pleasure to make acquaintance of queen continued for woman who posse extraordinary gift of knowledge must be very well worth knowing there be one two matter upon be badly in need of reliable information perhaps may be induced to give that information will without doubt if so plea answered pousa continued where be thy house that travel being drawn of ox where be rest of thy follower queen told that there be with thee four black one that wagon call house that travel remaining three of follower be behind answered will doubtless be with in course of few minute will outspan here so that ox may rest in shade of gorge will not direct men to dismount rest zebra will not resume march for about three hour pousa regarded for moment little doubtfully thought then a calmly dismounted turned prince over to piet to be off saddled little soldier gave few crisp order in tongue of be ignorant trooper at once dismounted stripped zebra of trapping hobbled turned loose to graze then men arranging in small party proceeded to open ration sack refresh with meal consisting a noticed of sun dried meat small cake pousa very politely invited to share ration with a just then caught sound of jan shriek to ox cracking of long whip a politely declined inviting in return to defer meal for time join at luncheon invitation eagerly accepted somewhat to surprise confess seeing that little chap must not possibly guess what kind of food must be offered whether must like when be placed before few minute later wagon arrived be outspanned appearance exciting utmost curiosity admiration of bandokolo who now learned have never before seen wheeled vehicle be profoundly interested when endeavoured to explain principle of wheel to be infinitely more interested amazed when befuni having collected quantity of dry leaf stick with to build fire came to receiving from burning glass habitually carried in pocket calmly proceeded to kindle fire with aid a usual being regular practice to economise flint steel a much a possible by never using when burning glass must be made to serve same purpose bandokolo appeared used fire for number of purpose possessed knowledge of how to produce be therefore obliged to conserve by keeping lamp perpetually burning must readily understand that a pousa explained there be occasion when a in time of violent storm heavy rain be put to gravest inconvenience through inability to convey lighted lamp from one place to while be partaking of luncheon for by way pousa displayed great relish after regarding roast deer flesh for moment two rather dubiously endeavoured to pump guest with regard to character disposition of majesty queen bimbane found old fellow rather inclined to be reticent upon subject uneasy when began to question reason being a presently informed furtively in whisper a likely a not queen must be with in spirit listening to conversation that have wish to offend lady by affording information that must perhaps prefer must be withheld despite disinclination to talk however contrived to extract little information from learning among other thing be not first white man who have be permitted to enter bandokolo country one other having arrived when pousa be quite young man died somewhat mysteriously soon afterward be also given to understand that bandokolo generally strongly objected to stranger visiting be indeed in habit of resorting to most drastic measure for preventing such visit at event for preventing departure of unwelcome visitor from country alive a for bimbane what little must induce to say about only went to confirm astounding account of siluce have given confess once twice during progress of conversation very seriously asked whether after must not be wiser on part to turn back there then instead of pushing on farther into so extraordinary country placing in power of so extraordinary woman like to be beaten must not bring to abandon purpose ignominiously after having come so far therefore about two o'clock in afternoon gave order to inspan resumed journey still closely following course of river across open plain pousa rode side by side at head of cavalcade with wagon bringing up rear soon found that apart from anything relating to queen bimbane companion be quite willing to be communicative telling many thing of exceedingly interesting nature with regard to extraordinary country be naturally anxious to know whether gold shining stone be a plentiful a have be led to believe be gratified to learn that be gold indeed being so abundant that be used for purpose where metal be needed bandokolo having learned to harden temper in manner that afforded very fair substitute for steel in proof of showed sword took weapon in hand examined found that be made entirely of hardened gold that have be treated in such manner a not only to posse certain elasticity also to be capable of receiving fairly sharp edge scale of armour be told be also treated in same way be so hard that be impossible to pierce either with sword spear then exhibited hunting knife excited pousa highest admiration also certain amount of apprehension when of set purpose casually mentioned conviction must drive blade through best scale armour that bandokolo must produce shining stone also seemed be fairly abundant have particular use for excepting a adornment stone being admired because of extreme brilliancy with reflected light colour have be trekking little more than hour when suddenly without least warning enormous two horned rhinoceros hove up out of long grass about hundred fifty yard in front of stood regarding doubtfully with little eye gleaming tail switching angrily at unexpected apparition drew bridle a with one accord to await development while quickly unslung rifle prepared for action must not help noticing that pousa viewed creature with considerable trepidation while a for trooper in rear with one accord wheeled zebra with evident intention of making bolt if necessary that must be necessary soon became evident for rhino instead of being alarmed at imposing display of force making scarce be clearly annoyed at presumption in daring to disturb presently lowered head with loud squeal of rage came charging straight down upon whereupon escort incontinently dug heel into rib of frightened zebra dashed off scattering in direction to intense amusement wagon be not very far in rear if rhino be allowed to get past must choose to attack might easily play havoc with diminished team of ox therefore hastily dismounting lest prince despite training must flinch swerve at critical moment so spoil aim raised rifle to shoulder waiting until now thoroughly exasperated beast be within ten yard of fired sent bullet through right eye into brain bowling over like rabbit then quickly reloading rifle quietly waited for pousa to rejoin presently did after re forming scattered command without seeming to be in slightest degree abashed at desertion of approaching with considerable circumspection a stood over fallen brute with prince beside raised right hand saluted a exclaimed truly white lord thou art well named smiter with lightning for beheld flash wherewith thou didst slay fierce terrible beast before whose anger not even bravest warrior of bandokolo may stand thou art a mighty wizard a deathless one for thou canst slay without fighting even a can be true pousa can answered willing to avail to utmost of opportunity have be afforded to display power continued who told thee that be named smiter with lightning who wise one even bimbane queen retorted pousa in tone seemed to suggest who else do suppose can possibly have be not only did tell how thou wert called described thee to told of thy huge stature immense strength how thou wert clothed wonderful weapon from thou dost discharge thy lightning even great black beast thou dost bestride fell into rather uneasy reverie must man be by possibility telling truth story be so astounding so utterly incredible yet be told so simply with such utter lack of straining after effect man made attempt to impress with marvel of tone manner be of one who told of most matter of fact everyday occurrence besides if be not telling truth how must possibly have come to know name have be given by lomalindela king of mashona for be perfectly certain that have have opportunity to learn from of own boy if other thing that have told concerning bimbane be indeed true must be most extraordinary woman endowed with strange wonderful power might be must find rather more than must manage before have done with to admit possibility that might indeed posse such uncanny power led inevitably toward several very unpleasantly suggestive reflection with effort threw off for have already determined to go through with adventure must not allow to be diverted from purpose by thought of possibility however unpleasant therefore roused continued conversation with pousa by describing fight between men monkey awful conclusion asked to tell what must about beast tree must not tell much about what did tell be grim enough for with regard to monkey informed that be well known a most ferocious beast to be found in bandokolo that certain number be captured by mean of pitfall in be permitted to remain until be dead from starvation when be removed to masakisale capital city carefully tended until be restored to condition of normal health strength then be used to test guilt otherwise of person charged with offence of exceptional enormity test being made by setting accused to fight with one more of brute when if conquered be presumed that be innocent naturally enquired whether anyone have ever thus succeeded in demonstrating innocence be not surprised to be answered in negative then asked why if bimbane really knew thing be necessary to subject suspect to test in order to determine guilt innocence to pousa replied that of course test be quite unnecessary for queen must always tell whether not man be guilty to sentence prisoner to ordeal be equivalent to pronouncing guilty ordering execution form of trial be retained since be one of institution of country have existed from time immemorial a to tree into foliage of victorious monkey have flung antagonist be told that like monkey be indigenous to bandokolo that one of most gruesome peculiarity be ghoulish avidity with enveloped unfortunate individual animal in tentacle like leaf forthwith proceeded to absorb victim into tree pousa added be sometimes employed instead of monkey a mean for disposal of criminal truly charming country people thought apparently abounding in most delightful characteristic about hour before sunset reached foot of mountain toward have be trekking through afternoon outspanned on veld at entrance to pas have revealed about hour earlier scenery in pas when entered on following morning proved to be very similar in character to of gorge through have passed on previous day before encountering pousa trooper if anything even more wild gloomy sombre be not sorry when about eleven o'clock emerged from into kind of basin hemmed in on side by hill through centre of basin narrow road ran bordering tiny rivulet have rise somewhere among adjacent hill on hand ground be cultivated maize sugar cane cassava fruit of various kind being among product while far end of basin consisted of pasture land upon herd of quite thousand cattle be grazing there be few people at work in field orchard pygmy like pousa band at sight of hastily retired having be previously ordered a subsequently learned to keep well out of way not intrude presence upon there be sign of building of description when questioned pousa on subject drew attention to large number of almost invisible opening in rocky side of encircling hill told be entrance to cave dwelling of extraordinary people when examined through telescope discovered that reason why opening be so difficult to detect be because be choked with people staring intently out at a wound way through valley far below telescope enabled to discover almost opening however small be decorated with more le carving executed in living rock beneath also noticed little heap of debris have be thrown out by owner when took possession of cave proceeded to enlarge interior according to want outspanned at far end of valley where pasture have be reserved spent night there having made sort of forced march through valley in order to reach grass for cattle forced march by way costing one of rapidly diminishing team of ox on following day passed of extraordinary bandokolo village on day following two more being considerably larger than preceding one while distance between steadily decreased so that on tenth day after pousa found passed through le than five village last two being within three mile of other of such extent estimated of to contain at least four thousand inhabitant if not more now a mile brought appreciably nearer to masakisale capital abode of mysterious redoubtable queen bimbane be no longer possible to keep people at distance have abundant opportunity to study appearance manner dress custom generally feel bound to say that taking into consideration have heard about first impression be distinctly favourable for pygmy though be be a rule perfectly formed colour be so light that soon became scarcely noticeable expression be intelligent by mean unamiable at least in case of woman while a for latter though real beauty might be rare be certainly not entirely absent many of younger one be quite good looking if not actually pretty in matter of attire dress generally worn be admirably adapted to tropical climate in wearer lived that of men consisting simply of pair of tight fitting drawer reaching to just above knee over be worn sleeveless shirt of thick silk confined at waist by belt while of woman appeared to be single garment of thick silk generally white occasionally dyed favourite colour being rich crimson sea green very pale blue apart from soldier sex wore head covering thick hair seeming to afford protection needed from fierce ray of vertical sun sex wore kind of buskin of soft leather reaching to just below knee sole consisting of shaped piece of thick hide stitched on to under part of buskin abundance of gold in country be amply testified by fact that adorned more le with ornament such a belt bracelet armlet necklace made of metal many of woman wearing in addition small plaque boss of hammered gold stitched to hem of dress while others wore kind of coronet formed of hammered chiselled gold in hair rather sinister feature quickly attracted attention be that with scarcely solitary exception men went armed with heavy murderous looking knife of hardened gold thrust into belt diamond also now came in evidence few of woman wearing rough uncut stone set in gold a necklace in belt a adjunct to coronet now too for first time have opportunity to see kind of vehicle in general use among bandokolo consisting of rough kind of sleigh usually drawn by single elephant although encountered here there sleigh big enough to need when fully loaded two elephant to draw horse be hitherto unknown beast among be amusing to note wonder admiration animal excited among people a passed have contrived completely to domesticate zebra seemed to be quite common among although be used exclusively a saddle animal up to present have be afforded opportunity to view interior of rock dwelling of extraordinary people a drew ever nearer to capital must not help feeling impressed by increasing elaboration of decoration of entrance high degree of artistic taste displayed of dwelling indeed seemed to be wholly artificial be to say owner appeared to have chosen particular spot on face of living rock attacking have begun work by hewing out first entrance be usually rectangular in shape ornamented with column supporting sculptured pediment thence proceeding to excavate inward a many apartment a be needed for accommodation of family structure must if executed by member of family alone require many year of continuous labour to complete pousa informed that usual practice be for young man to start house a soon a attained age of two hundred thirty four moon eighteen year leaving exterior ornamentation quite rough to be completed at leisure hewing out central passage to employ others to help in excavating interior apartment adding to number from time to time a need for arose about mid afternoon on eleventh day after pousa detachment have taken charge of reached city of masakisale capital of bandokolo after have already be said with regard to remarkable people reader will not be surprised to learn that be far away most extraordinary city have ever seen heard of be situated in kind of basin about eight mile wide by about twenty two mile long hemmed in on side by precipitous mountain approached through one of weirdest wildest most forbiddingly picturesque gorge that be possible for mind of man to imagine mountain torrent foamed raged over rocky bed through gorge into basin finally discharged into gloomy tarn about two mile wide by three half mile long occupied whole of lower northern end of valley wide straight road ran lengthwise through valley from end to end be intersected at interval of about mile by cross road between whole of valley be under cultivation except for patch of about five mile long adjoining tarn one third of be pasture land while remainder be devoted to raising of hay four crop of be cut year road with intersecting road communicated ran right round valley at base of precipitous mountain slope formed side of basin from other road zigzagged up slope to very summit zigzag road gave access to rock dwelling honeycombing mountain sculptured entrance to be clearly discernible through variegated colour splashed slope variegated colour being due to fact that mountain slope have be terraced from base to summit filled with earth where required converted into garden fruit orchard industrial portion of city be situated at northern end of valley prevailing wind here being from south thus smoke of factory furnace be carried away out of valley at northern end obviated nuisance population of masakisale numbered fully twenty thousand according to pousa afterward have reason to believe that be very far within mark for roughly estimated that there must be nearly number of dwelling in valley must accommodate on average at least four person there appeared to be nearly quite five thousand people at work in field when entered valley assisted by forty fifty elephant seemed to be employed here there in ploughing up land preparing for new crop there be also considerable amount of traffic pedestrian vehicular on various road when news of arrival spread through valley appeared to do with marvellous celerity traffic increased hundredfold at least so that within hour of arrival seemed a though man woman child in valley have turned out to stare at confess be by mean favourably impressed with manner in men at least of masakisale regarded appearance among for if correctly interpreted expression of countenance be made up in about equal proportion of hatred fear while of woman on other hand seemed chiefly to indicate wonder probably at stature for compared with fifty four inch seventy four must have appeared gigantic there be difficulty at in identifying royal palace for whereas most of other dwelling in valley be indicated merely by more le elaborately sculptured doorway hewn out of living rock abode of queen bimbane measured judging by eye alone at least five hundred foot long by sixty foot high whole surface of be sculptured into form of house front consisting of doorway with window opening on side of above two other tier of window opening giving upon wide projecting balcony whole very elaborately decorated with moulding baluster architrave pediment column entablature other architectural feature in style quite strange to yet very handsome impressive representing must say life work of several hundred mason moreover there be banner flying over centre of building consisting of replica upon very much larger scale of borne by standard bearer who accompanied escort remarkable building if indeed may so be called be situated about three mile down valley on western side consequently facing east so that for greater part of day be in shadow while one of window opening be shaded from morning sun by awning of material afterward found be silk arranged in alternate stripe of green white sighted identified at distance of more than mile away when arrived opposite found that a of course might be expected one of intersecting road crossing main road led up to there be difference between particular road others whereas others have cultivated field on side of road be bordered on hand by beautiful smooth grassy lawn kept cut quite close interspersed at frequent interval with great fancifully shaped bed of flower while here there enormous shade tree have be left beneath quite large number of handsomely attired men woman be lounging be of course palace garden when enquired pousa informed that lounger belonged to queen retinue general public being rigorously excluded from upon arrival at point where road leading to palace branched off from main road pousa informed that must now bid temporary adieu to wagon follower being destined to lower end of valley where pasture be situated while by command of queen be to be lodged in palace therefore if must indicate such of personal belonging a wished to have taken to new quarter must see that be duly conveyed thither rather demurred at not caring to be separated from piet upon learning that arrangement have be ordered by queen must not now be altered yielded with best grace must muster gave instruction that spare gun plentiful supply of ammunition must be conveyed to destined quarter with utmost circumspection there deposited chapter sixteen plot thickens separated from wagon thus under further obligation to regulate pace by of slow moving ox now at pousa command advanced at trot along road leading directly to palace a rapidly approached that structure became increasingly impressed by remarkable grace beauty of architectural decoration exquisite detail of forced more insistently upon attention with foot of progress for instance saw now that certain irregularity in surface of wall shaft of column in distance have taken a due to effect of weather be really vast number of small picture sculptured in very low relief representing scene in history of bandokolo many of scene being naturally battle although figure be conventionally drawn vigour of action truth to nature of attitude portrayed evidenced work of artist of mean power have opportunity just then to study sculpture at leisure for pousa be evidently very anxious to complete responsible task of delivering safely within precinct of palace be therefore obliged to content with hasty glance at facade a whole while dismounting resigning horse to care of groom who awaited arrival at foot of broad flight of step leading up to main entrance then accompanied by pousa who also have dismounted ascended step fifty in number be ushered through wide lofty doorway provided with pair of heavy swing door of massive gold panel of be decorated with figure in high relief into cool lofty hall where be received by formally turned over to official whom afterward learned be major domo master of queen household individual very cordially welcomed to masakisale in name of queen bidding attendant bearing belonging to follow led way to rear of hall a soon a eye grew accustomed to somewhat subdued light saw be about fifty foot long by fifty foot high by twenty five foot wide with broad balcony supported by column running round at height of thirty foot from pavement at far end of hall be massive flight of step hewn out of solid rock wall leading up to interior balcony to climbed arrived there be conducted to suite of two room be given to understand have be assigned for use by queen larger room of two be front room looking out upon palace garden be evidently intended for day use while one behind have window derived light from front room from handsome gold lamp suspended from ceiling be combined bathroom sleeping chamber latter room stone floor of be covered with fine matting contained very beautiful spacious ivory couch most luxuriously furnished number of elegant equally luxurious divan immense bath almost big enough to swim in sunk into floor official who have in charge pointed out various matter to a well a very handsome suit of clothing evidently made expressly for intimated be queen wish must wear during stay in country told that by clapping hand must summon servant who have be detailed to attend upon then bowed out left at length to instructed people who have brought belonging where to put satisfied that nothing be missing then dismissing men proceeded to take stock of surroundings apartment assigned to be very spacious lofty cool airy be furnished with degree of elegance luxury be simply astounding especially in view of fact be in part of africa so far a knew one white man have ever visited before from white man have ever emerged felt be fully justified in regarding a very highly honoured then when have completed inspection clapped hand upon appearance of attendant intimated must like bath whereupon man withdrew wooden plug from hole in wall in few minute immense bath be full to brim of bright cold sparkling spring water into at once plunged completely submerging for about minute to amazement consternation of attendant who afterward confessed that feared be bent upon drowning none of bandokolo appeared possessing slightest knowledge of natation use of soap too facility with by aid be enabled to remove dust grime accumulated during day travel be revelation to a be also comb wherewith arranged now much too luxuriant lock bath towel likewise came in for share of admiration thing next to stature most excited fellow astonishment be whiteness of skin where have be protected by clothing compared with deep bronze of face hand having bathed to satisfaction proceeded to clothe in new garment have be so thoughtfully provided for for be indeed grateful for best of own clothes be by time little better than rag new garment consisted of pair of bathing drawer at least be what be like for only reached down to just above knee tunic like sleeveless shirt pair of buskin made of soft white leather soled with ox hide drawer be made quite plain of thick white silk fitted fairly tight to body shirt also be made of same material about armhole hem of there be stitched broad band of crimson silk sewn in beautiful pattern with gold thread thickly studded with small gold boss about size of ordinary coat button bos being beautifully chiselled with flower like pattern in high relief there be also waist belt made of solid gold link fastened together with sort of hinge clasped in front with pair of massive gold sculptured plaque forming very handsome adornment to one person very convenient too for happened to be of just right width to take pistol holster garment fitted a though made to measure to great astonishment when asked langila that being name of new servant how accounted for such extraordinary fact further amazed by saying a calmly a though be most natural thing imaginable that article have be made according to measurement supplied by queen when pushed curiosity farther by asking how majesty must possibly guess so accurately at proportion of man whom have never seen simply shrugged shoulder repeated pousa astounding statement that queen know thing after requested that might be left to myself for wished to give statement most careful consideration to endeavour to fathom that might possibly mean to be possible that extraordinary woman reputed to be old far beyond limit of age usually ascribed to humanity queen of wonderful people hidden away in mysterious depth of africa continent of strange mystic happening be really possessor of gift of unlimited knowledge to plain simple matter of fact briton thing seemed impossible yet pousa have already supplied with proof surely ought to have be convincing to reasonable man have be told that on certain date at certain spot must encounter have done so appearance have be described to description have proved accurate in particular down to most minute detail have even learned fact connected with death of unhappy siluce how have queen informant become acquainted with matter seeing that even fact of impending visit to bandokolo must not possibly have be made known through of ordinary recognised channel of communication be exceedingly disquieting circumstance for if bimbane actually possessed astounding supernatural gift of knowledge practically rendered powerful how must ordinary individual for instance successfully contend with being if contention must ever become necessary decided that contention strife between must not be permitted to become necessary must cultivate goodwill gain friendship if must then all might be well whereas if must be so unfortunate a to incur displeasure well there be use in blinking fact that be powerful enough to destroy have just about arrived at above conclusion when langila appeared respectfully enquired when must be pleasure to eat reminded that several hour have elapsed since have last partaken of meal that despite disquieting nature of recent reflection be hungry therefore intimated be quite ready for meal at moment whereupon disappeared to return few minute later accompanied by dozen servant who quickly deftly prepared table by covering with very handsome cloth of spotless white linen upon placed number of elegantly wrought dish of polished agate heaped high with fruit of various kind arranged with respective leaf most beautiful vase of wonderfully marked highly polished stone full of wine several elaborately chased plate dish of massive gold one of contained little pile of thin flat cake of kind of bread smoking hot then man entered bearing gold dish containing what looked like roast fowl what presently discovered be parrot langila intimated that dinner be served very excellent dinner proved to be for parrot be tender juicy of very appetising flavour perfectly cooked while little cake of hot bread be particularly good then wine be of rich ruby colour exquisite aroma light innocuous a water a for fruit have never before have never since tasted such luscious peach grape elegance luxury kept reminding existed in part of africa utterly unknown to white man whether be novelty of surroundings somewhat perturbing character of reflection contrast between luxuriousness of couch hard cartel upon have reposed for so many month under stifling wagon tent know not sleep be slow to come to on first night of sojourn in palace of queen bimbane when at length visited seemed that have scarcely closed eye before opened again to find that be day that langila be standing beside couch respectfully enquiring whether must please to bathe before dressing for breakfast replied that certainly must whereupon fellow filled bath for few minute later be luxuriously wallowing in cold crystal clear water to towel dry dress be work of minute two then sat down to meal in point of elegance luxury be equal of partaken of on previous evening when have finished langila who be really most admirable servant respectfully enquired what next proposed to do when informed that intended to ride to lower end of valley to see how servant be faring that wagon ox be being properly looked after assured that might rest perfectly easy a to that if be determined upon doing a proposed be wish of queen must appear in public suitably arrayed thereupon vanished presently returned bearing superb doublet of gold scale armour upon foundation of doeskin a soft a kid glove broad belt of massive gold link heavily studded with uncut diamond supporting gold bladed sword in richly chased golden sheath gold helmet wadded lined with silk surmounted by splendid plume of ostrich feather dyed deep rich crimson thus magnificently bedizened presently set forth mounted upon prince who in turn have not be forgotten also proving to be beneficiary to extent of superb crimson silk gold fringed saddle cloth new bridle of kind of velvet dyed crimson heavily studded with gold boss ride to lower end of valley back proved exceedingly interesting for there be novelty everywhere noticed that gorgeous trapping seemed to produce profound effect upon people who now saluted with utmost reverence fact being although did not know at time be dressed in uniform of general of bandokolo army found wagon right remnant of team of ox luxuriating in rich pasture by margin of lake while a for piet jan have plenty to eat work to do be therefore perfectly happy befuni who have developed most extraordinary devotion to gloomily informed that country people be bekulu betagati that did not at approve of being housed in palace surrounded by stranger with mile away quite unable to watch over welfare upon hearing comforted poor fellow a well a must by assuring be not in slightest danger that arrangement be merely temporary at first opportunity must endeavour to persuade queen to allow to come to palace a personal attendant upon return to palace be informed by langila that queen be in apartment have given instruction that upon return be to be conducted into presence that might personally express satisfaction at arrival in country therefore at once proceeded to bathe when be ready desired langila to announce have not far to go for royal apartment be situated appeared in wing of palace opposite to own just on other side of grand staircase in few minute found in royal presence room in queen bimbane received be superb apartment magnificently decorated with elaborately carved column supporting kind of groined roof wall being draped with splendid tapestry worked on silk in gold thread hung with several enormous mirror of polished silver in massive gold frame bracket supporting cluster of lamp on side of stone floor be covered with fine grass matting worked in very tasteful pattern with different coloured grass at far end of room be divan looked a though made of solid gold upholstered in embroidered silk upon divan reclined diminutive figure entirely shrouded in white silk drapery so that only two eye must be seen through narrow slit behind figure stood two handsome young woman gorgeously attired who perpetually waved two enormous fan of ostrich feather to fro over mistress lord chamberlain who took over from hand of langila duly announced forthwith retired noticed that a strode through doorway attired in bravery little figure on divan started gave utterance to faint ejaculation instantly recovered stretching out right hand swathed in silken wrapping exclaimed in low pleasant voice greeting many welcome chia'gnosi have be anticipating moment with much curiosity also with little trepidation for prescience tell that be destined to exercise great indeed vital influence upon future have wondered whether influence will be for good for evil for good trust majesty replied a sinking on one knee placed right hand beneath hers raised respectfully to lip a have said that hand be swathed in silken wrapping so must not see sense of touch told that be small a seemed to painfully thin although did not see hand saw something else be orange ruddy flash of jewel on thumb brilliance of be so great that made manifest even through silken veil in be enveloped immediately remembered potent amulet containing stone shine like sun at eventide mentioned by siluce have besought to take from owner too trust that will be for good chia'gnosi otherwise must never have be allowed to come here answered queen prescience have never yet deceived tell that in will find man who can be true loyal steadfast friend implacable enemy a be determined to make friend be not afraid yet see that in depth of heart be already prejudiced against since prejudice must be removed before friendship can be born tell pray how did prejudice originate first rise sit beside here rose obeyed in confusion for how asked myself must woman possibly read inmost thought a appeared able to do nevertheless seemed to that honesty be best policy therefore answered after seating at a respectful distance from a divan must allow if be indeed prejudiced at against majesty be because of story siluce told ah yes siluce retorted queen rather bitterly died in arm before dying doubt told that bandokolo be cruel wicked people queen be most cruel wicked of did not be told that know thing returned if be true must be fully aware of word that unhappy young woman said ye e e answered bimbane slowly ought to know certainly happens that for at moment when encountered siluce chanced that attention be distracted from for time when at length be again free to visualise woman be lying dead in arm so missed hearing what told can guess have guessed aright have not pretty nearly replied then repeated what siluce have said a to treatment have received cause for treatment ventured to hint according to view of civilised people unhappy girl have be atrociously misused so that be story siluce told remarked queen when have finished now listen to mine judge between be not young woman be indeed old a have already guessed yet when time of mourning for late consort be past many chief noble urged to wed again offered a suitable candidate for position of spouse to queen knew that proposal be made only because of power influence wealth belong to position yet because be woman with woman weakness bandokolo be fickle turbulent people impatient of restraint difficult to govern seemed desirable must choose consort from among many suitor for honour after careful consideration chose anuti one of captain of guard because seemed most suitable for position man most likely to be helpful to in difficult task of government siluce who be one of woman of household have already seen anuti desired a husband although man must have naught to do with when forthcoming espousal of anuti be announced siluce forced way into presence upbraided for robbing of lover sought to slay therefore dismissed from household forbade ever to appear again in presence be anuti who caused to be whipped afterwards ordered banishment because after espousal learned rebuked anuti for cruelty have quarrelled with become enemy u um returned that of course be very different story from one told by siluce be truth asserted queen although doubtless there be who will declare to contrary posse much knowledge chia'gnosi yet know not how be to convince of truth for husband who must verify word resents rebuke have become most bitter implacable enemy doubtless will seek to win over to side by bearing false witness against must must make friend chia'gnosi for never have so sorely needed friend a now when anuti have turned against seek to oust from place become supreme in land be wise with wisdom of white man be warrior come of race of who always conquer therefore if must win to side must certainly triumph in struggle that foresee be at hand tell chia'gnosi how may win to become champion nay o queen answered ask not pray for came here not to take part in quarrel merely to yes know interrupted queen came hither hoping to obtain much gold many shining stone well whether not will become friend can at least help to realise wish will have a much gold a many shining stone a can carry away have many stone already will give order that more will be obtained so that may have a many a desire while a for gold posse be yours for asking what must say by way of reply to such lavish generosity a must thank queen with heart did so yet with lurking dread that might attach to acceptance of gift condition certainly must not assent to without great deal more knowledge than then possessed did not on contrary led to understand that gift be quite unconditional then proceeded to talk of other matter with result that when at length be dismissed left royal presence strongly impressed with conviction that hostess be very much misunderstood maligned woman earnestly desirous of governing unruly people wisely well in face of strenuous opposition on part of clique of ambitious unscrupulous noble of whom most ambitious unscrupulous be anuti husband who seemed pretty evident aimed at nothing short of dethronement death usurpation of supreme power confess felt very sorry for poor old creature although be particularly careful to pledge to nothing be conscious of very strong inclination to espouse cause do what might to defeat machination of powerful enemy readily assented to petition that befuni mashona might be permitted to come to palace to act a groom to prince animal having manifested distinct distaste for attention of bandokolo stableman man presented that same afternoon in response to message sent commanding immediate appearance for nearly week after nothing of particular import happened upon one pretext queen sent for day sometimes more than once to converse with by end of fifth day after arrival have practically forgotten siluce charge against forgotten that be old woman although on occasion of third interview have permitted to see small withered wrinkled old face forgotten everything in fact except have come to conclusion that be most charming delightful interesting a well a most friendless vilely betrayed woman have ever heard of have kept word right royally in matter of diamond having sent goatskin sack full of most magnificent stone while be led to understand that more be being diligently sought for a for gold there be already enough of in apartment to tax strength of diminished team of ox to utmost to draw when must be loaded into wagon on sixth day after arrival in masakisale encountered anuti queen husband while riding from palace to wagon a be daily wont joined when be about halfway down valley riding out from one of side road appeared led to house that be then inhabiting having deserted palace immediately after quarrel with queen approached accosted introducing quite frankly upon learning be on way to lower end of valley asked permission to accompany accorded rather ungraciously be afraid for be by time very bitterly prejudiced against yet a rode conversing together found hard to maintain that prejudice for be a unlike man have pictured a be possible for man to be indeed be amazed at frankness geniality courteousness of manner professed to be rejoiced at opportunity be affording to make acquaintance for thanked very delicately hinted admiration of prowess in killing rhinoceros have attacked escort expressed earnest desire despite suspicion dislike with at moment regarded time be not far distant when must be stanch friend added that there be several of bandokolo most influential noble chief who be anxious to be made known to when received intimation with return to original frigidity of manner turned to exclaimed with almost startling earnestness of manner ah chia'gnosi must that must be persuaded to lay aside prejudice treat friend fairly conception of have be that of man who love justice fairness above thing else must never have be permitted to come hither know that have be sojourner in palace for last five day that have be daily ay almost hourly brought under influence of queen consequently fully understand antagonism to have told story have cunningly played upon sympathy chivalry of character leading to believe that be most unfortunate most maligned persecuted woman in whole world be only version of story swear to that be false know story lip of dying siluce whispered into ear for spirit be with then say that word of be true although know bimbane have asserted contrary think of therefore chia'gnosi ask whether may not have be led by cunning unscrupulous lying old witch to give sympathy to wrong person if be capable of being convinced by truth a believe be can convince must give opportunity if will do tell that will thank for asking to hear what have to say to say be amazed shocked beyond power of expression at possibility have be hoodwinked played with by preternaturally plausible old woman be to put matter very mildly yet slowly conviction dawned upon that might be so suddenly remembered own youth inexperience tale have be told of bimbane unnatural longevity gradually came to realise how easy woman of prolonged wide experience must find to play upon sympathy credulity until have brought to state of mind in must be prepared to believe might choose to tell have indeed almost brought to state of mind not quite still retained sense enough to recognise judgment be not infallible wisdom not so great that might be possible for exceedingly clever person to deceive then suddenly occurred to that bimbane version of siluce incident be entirely unsupported save by own assertion while statement of siluce made with dying breath when might be assumed must have possible motive for telling falsehood be fully confirmed by anuti yes two story differed so completely that one of must necessarily be untrue felt that owed to myself to discover of be be very well for to pretend must not permit to be involved in quarrel with have concern began to realise possibly might not be allowed option in matter that in spite of might be compelled to take one side other if must prove to be case must see to be not inveigled into espousing wrong side therefore when have reasoned matter out in own mind somewhat after above fashion turned to anuti giving hand said be right anuti be entitled to demand that will afford opportunity to set forth version of dispute between queen to bring forward proof of soundness justice of own contention will have therefore make such arrangement a may deem necessary when be ready will be prepared to listen to understand proof will have to be very full complete to be wholly convincing for rightly wrongly have be very strongly impressed with conviction that queen be victim of powerful band of thoroughly ruthless unscrupulous conspirator anuti laughed heartily a grasped extended hand there be need for to tell that chia'gnosi said for know bimbane be fully aware of extraordinary power of persuasion magic be potent wonderful ay even to extent of enabling to persuade that blaze of sunlight be darkness of great cavern whence obtain shining stone yonder sun be day old moon that be young beautiful therefore be in nowise astonished that insist upon proof being complete be fully aware that will have to be so in order to convince promise that will be now word of warning may be that bimbane be cognisant of what have passed between for doubt not that watch movement if so will be fully aware not only that have met of word that have spoken in case chia'gnosi will be in danger if thought that feared danger must express regret for having brought within touch of know that therefore will merely say to be on watch for when peril come will come swiftly without warning will need courage great strength to meet farewell chia'gnosi thanks for courtesy fairness with have hearkened to will collect fact witness when be ready will hear from again farewell chapter seventeen at last learn truth profoundly perplexed quite unable to decide of two bimbane anuti be telling truth rode slowly thoughtfully back to palace surrendering prince to care of befuni sought privacy of own apartment anxious to think over quietly free from distraction what have heard in hope of being able to arrive at definite conclusion with regard to matter also be anxious to learn whether there be foundation for anuti suggestion that bimbane be probably aware of meeting with of what have passed between believing that if such be indeed case queen must assuredly betray knowledge either by speech in manner although have scarcely be back long enough to bathe change into garment usually wore indoors when be invited to join queen in apartment must detect nothing in manner of greeting in subsequent speech to indicate that have least suspicion have spent nearly two hour in husband company there be not slightest shade of difference in cordiality of manner toward not faintest suggestion of uneasiness anxiety a for conversation after informing that have received information from mine to effect that large consignment of shining stone might be expected shortly proceeded to question with regard to detail of past life of appeared to posse quite extraordinary general knowledge finally referred in perfectly natural manner to little nell lestrange asking whether still adhered to original intention of endeavouring to find child upon assuring that certainly did asserted that possessed power to help very materially in search be perfectly willing to afford that help if cared to avail of to replied must gladly do so must feel infinitely obliged grateful for whereupon offered to show there then road must follow upon leaving masakisale in order to reach place where lost child might be found to one who thought somewhat slowly a generally do seemed to be rather rushing matter with anuti warning fresh in mind hesitated for just fraction of second wondering whether perchance might not be subtle scheme on bimbane part to get into power friendly ingenuous look in eye a glanced into disarmed momentary suspicion few second later animated by intensity of desire to learn what might regarding poor nell whereabouts found stretched at full length upon divan with little shrivelled decrepit figure of queen bending over a in obedience to command stared intently at jewel on right thumb held within few inch of eye for perhaps minute gazed at wonderful flashing changing colour of stone seemed to be something between diamond opal then suddenly seemed to be mounted on prince journeying back along road by have reached masakisale with piet befuni beside wagon in rear seemed to be passing spot where have buried remains of unhappy siluce in dream turned aside to examine grave assured ourselves that have not be disturbed back mile after mile travelled until reached certain mountain remembered perfectly well here abandoned route by have formerly travelled striking eastward round southern side of mountain following for several day stream led south eastward then abandoning that stream still journeying south eastward struck stream finally led to broad river somehow knew to be zambezi along left bank of great river seemed to journey for several day carefully noting natural feature of country a went especially very fine fall be not however famous victoria fall discovered by livingstone shortly afterward reached drift enabled to cross river here turned back upon followed upstream smaller river discharging into thus seemed to go day after day week after week until two month be past when suddenly toward close of certain day seemed to find in midst of surroundings dimly remembered having seen before presently dawned upon be looking upon plain mafuta basuto nyanga have shown in vision wherein have be permitted brief glimpse of nell lestrange yes be place without doubt a stood gazing in wonder at kafir at side who have come from know not where informed in reply to question that place be named umgungundhlovu that be great place of dingaan king of zulu nation therewith a man word fixed in memory vision faded opening eye found staring into of bimbane who be still bending over well chia'gnosi said with smile even on withered feature somehow thought very sweet engaging have slept long have seen aught yes said rising to foot have seen way from place to spot where friend little daughter may be found thank most heartily for granting vision be very wonderful wish possessed power to gain such information by mean of self induced dream suppose power lie in ring doe not nay answered bimbane quickly placing right hand behind power be in ring be mean bright thing must do a well then suddenly remembered bright disk by mean of mafuta basuto nyanga have produced vision have witnessed in hut wish not for such power friend continued queen seating upon divan from have risen for while information so gained be sometimes useful be more often of distressing nature many time have thus learned that whom deemed stanch friend be really secret enemy industriously plotting evil against one be far happier without such knowledge therefore make use of gift a seldom a possible now go chia'gnosi for exercise of power have rendered very weary must rest come to again to morrow for although magic have enabled to learn much of what happens in world outside bandokolo there be many thing have never be able to understand until now when have explained to wish to learn can while be here to teach retreated to own apartment more puzzled than ever a to true character of queen for while must not help feeling that anuti be perfectly sincere in denunciation of more saw of more convinced did become that there be frightful misunderstanding somewhere that be in reality true tender hearted generously disposed woman finally called for prince took long ride up valley seeking for light none came when about sunset returned to palace be a much befogged a ever when on following day be again summoned to queen apartment found full of scheme for better government of bandokolo improvement in general of condition of people upon scheme expressed anxious to have opinion a well a suggestion might see fit to offer now felt be altogether top young to set up a authority upon so abstruse subject a statesmanship yet be not quite destitute of idea inclination to express when happened to be strong well defined consequently be not long before be so deeply engrossed in conversation a to be practically oblivious of everything else hence be greatly astonished not to say chagrined when after about hour animated exceedingly interesting conversation suddenly became conscious that have be asleep for second two only seemed to for when wakefulness returned queen be still speaking gathered from speech must not have missed more than at most dozen unimportant word be profoundly annoyed with for if there be one thing upon especially pride be courtesy to woman let be young old rich poor felt that in permitting to lose consciousness even though be for second have be guilty of piece of gross discourtesy to woman whom be daily growing to respect esteem more profoundly respect esteem nay be cold word in to express feeling with be rapidly coming to regard much vilified much misunderstood woman admiration be word much nearer truth sincerely hoped that momentary involuntary lapse of attention have escaped notice presently believed that have for when ventured to look at perceived that be staring into vacancy a people be apt to do sometimes when be expressing view on subject upon feel very deeply conversed together for nearly three hour that morning when at queen dismissed last shred of suspicion raised in mind against by anuti have vanished in stead be conscious of feeling of exalted romantic devotion such a knight errant of old must have felt when went forth to perform deed of desperate gallantry in honour of woman who have won admiration when rode out from palace that afternoon be animated by fervent hope might encounter anuti for longed for opportunity to convince that idea have somehow formed with regard to royal wife be a far from truth a darkness be from light a east be from west a sometimes happens desire be gratified for a rode down valley to pay daily visit to wagon found man obviously waiting for at spot where have previously met upon seeing pressed heel to zebra side galloped forward to meet greeting with same frank friendliness a before well met anuti said have be hoping might see for have several matter of moment wish to discus with will ride with to end of valley will accompany to house let ride to end of valley first chia'gnosi said then afterwards if will accompany to house will feel very deeply honoured right said forward then now anuti wonder whether can guess why be so anxious to have opportunity to converse with think can answered with frank genial smile of have so favourably impressed at former meeting want to prove to that idea concerning bimbane be wrong who regard a do be doing utmost injustice be not that heaven man must be thought reader ejaculated in astonishment how did come to guess oh replied laughingly be quite easy knew that by time next met bimbane must have fully convinced that be wronged grossly maligned woman having thoroughly read character at last meeting be sure that sooner must have done that than chivalry of feeling must urge to espouse cause undertake task of proving to rest of enemy that in regarding a do be doing hideous injustice well now be opportunity to convince if can have convinced tell how did do by way of reply related in detail everything have happened since have last met repeated conversation word for word so far a must recall dwelt at length upon many exalted sentiment lofty aspiration to queen have given expression asking finally how must possibly associate sentiment aspiration with woman of such character a believed that of bimbane to be quite impossible chia'gnosi answered if be sincere in expression how do know that be not demanded hotly how do know that be retorted have only word for have not furnished with shadow of proof be easy for woman man to express exalted sentiment lofty aspiration even though may not feel a matter of fact entertain precise sentiment have same aspiration with credit bimbane suppose will require something more than bare assertion before will believe yet why must doubt believe will tell be because have thrown spell of magic over tell that yesterday cast into trance wherein saw way must follow in order to find captive child of friend by allowing to do that afforded opportunity to get under influence into power to day when fell asleep while be conversing with be simply testing strengthening power over believed that sleep lasted second two believe that may have lasted hour longer during be getting more complete control over when at length aroused from trance simply resumed conversation at point where have broken off at moment when lost consciousness hence imagined a intended must that have be asleep for moment will not believe exclaimed hotly nothing will convince that woman must be so base a to take such dastardly advantage of man a suggest have mischief indeed gone so far a demanded anuti soberly enough now then be very sorry for chia'gnosi very sorry for for in case will never be permitted to leave bandokolo never have opportunity to rescue captive daughter of friend while a for rest of will inevitably be plunged into disastrous civil war in many of bandokolo highest best will be slain probably bimbane aided by will triumph believe when be too late evil have be wrought will discover that have made disastrous mistake rather have be hideously deceived ah shake head in unbelief friend for remember be speaking from experience know that what say be true because be through influence bimbane gained over that constrained to become spouse although loved siluce look incredulous doubtless think that might have resisted have chosen swear to that so complete be power over be absolutely helpless although fully understood enormity of crime be committing be compelling to commit be powerless to resist because must not escape from afterward when foul wrong be done when be irrevocably bound to poor siluce have be driven forth to perish miserably bimbane foolishly relaxed hold upon thinking suppose that knot being tied must not attempt to escape must accept ignoble fate have designed for also think be indifferent because event proved be not man through whom belief be to recover long lost youth beauty took advantage of relaxation of vigilance on part to escape from palace from influence despite entreaty command have steadfastly refused to return hence have be able gradually to shake off influence until now be quite free from tell that never again will have opportunity to recover power over if can help now if be not so completely bewitched a to be incapable of distinguishing between truth falsehood come with for be prepared to submit to ample convincing proof of truth of charge against bimbane very well said will go with for although matter be really concern of mine be anxious to get at truth if only in order may be of assistance in adjusting most unhappy misunderstanding between queen noble for be convinced that be nothing more serious than misunderstanding that little explanation on side will suffice to clear up completely warn anuti not to indulge in false hope of ability to persuade of queen guilt for will need something far more convincing than unsupported assertion to satisfy yet bimbane unsupported assertion have thus far completely satisfied forget that chia'gnosi retorted anuti however continued if can persuade to regard question of queen guilt innocence a open one for little have doubt of ability to make recognise truth much more be said by anuti to same effect a be in main reiteration amplification of previous statement need not be repeated here suffice to say that by time reached house have brought to state of mind enabled to recognise after be just possible might be mistaken bimbane might not be sort of person have allowed to persuade be that anuti friend be at least entitled to dispassionate hearing then when at length reached be dwelling that individual introduced to thirty of most important influential noble chief of bandokolo among whom be mindula father of unhappy siluce one after other men arose related wrong cruelty injustice have suffered at hand of bimbane accompanying statement with proof of so convincing character no longer found possible to disbelieve when at session be over arose stunned astounded horrified furious at thought of danger have so narrowly escaped of falling into hand of vile unscrupulous woman becoming willing deluded tool now demanded a noble rose to depart what be to do be impossible that can continue to reside in palace remain guest of queen yet having come so far like idea of quitting country without at least enough of gold shining stone to repay for toil peril of adventure suppose when announce intention of quitting palace queen will at once conjecture have be in communication with have learned truth concerning will attempt to detain by force think be impossible to surmise what may do answered anuti be however not force so much a persuasion that have to fear for believe that there be man in bandokolo who must be willing to face fire weapon even at bimbane command if venture to return to palace see again rest assured that will bring whole power of influence to bear upon in effort to persuade that have deceived that original opinion of be correct one best know whether have now strength of will to resist beguilement must be safer perhaps not to risk to take up abode here with will send messenger to servant if like telling said decisively a thought that befuni be still in queen power came to for first time must return to palace face queen inform now know truth concerning refuse longer to remain guest see what come of a to seeking to influence have doubt that will do must take risk now that be fully convinced of truth of assertion greatly dread result will go at once get interview over after can either return here ride to wagon make abode a have already done for so many month nay said anuti will certainly not do that there be ample room in house for so long a remain in masakisale must consent to be most welcome honoured guest so be arranged then after little further conversation reiterated warning to be on guard against possible description of machination on part of queen mounted rode back to palace at hand gallop determined to get through what be certain to be very unpleasant business forthwith a befuni came out at approach to receive horse bade walk animal to fro instead of unsaddling hold ready to accompany to new quarter upon reappearance then entering palace made way straight to queen apartment sent in message craving immediate interview be admitted at once found majesty occupying usual seat upon divan at entrance dismissed attendant a soon a be alone invited by gesture to seat at side declined saying that a interview must be brief preferred to stand nay chia'gnosi returned will not be so brief a appear to think therefore sit pray if not by side then opposite for wearies to see standing be well a drew up ottoman seated upon bimbane kept silence for short time resting chin upon clasped hand regarding with inexpressibly mournful expression a returned gaze felt anger against dying away great pity for taking place in heart looked so small so frail so utterly helpless lonely miserable that innate chivalry of nature arose clamoured that be impossible must be guilty of crime imputed to have judged hastily unfairly have wronged by lending too ready ear to declared enemy in deciding to forsake have be guilty of base cowardly thing then faint smile of dawning triumph lighted up eye irradiated face warned of danger warned that again be exercising evil influence upon be fast succumbing to reminded of dreadful state of helplessness to anuti have be reduced by influence pulled together braced mental power to meet resist a did so smile of triumph vanished from eye be replaced by gleam of malice hatred so deadly that although be momentary recoiled in something that if be not fear be very closely akin to yet be glad that have caught that fleeting expression for reassured afforded transitory glimpse of woman true character taught more thoroughly perhaps than anything else must that anuti friend be right justified in denunciation of character think must have realised in moment that have betrayed lost hold upon for when spoke voice be harsh bitter full of scornful anger so chia'gnosi said to whom extended cordial welcome to kingdom whom made general of army upon whom heaped benefit innumerable even to bestowal upon of shining stone posse have so greatly craved whom deemed very soul embodiment of chivalry honour truth have stooped so low a to clandestinely consort with enemy to hearken to slanderous tongue to credit base falsehood about have poured into ear now have assurance to come to with purpose of telling that be so utterly vile even false craven that be will no longer remain guest from fear of contamination quite know how came by information unless be by mean of accursed magic said in main be right there be one two error with regard to detail such for example a reference to falsehood told about by anuti friend also with regard to reason for quitting palace after discrepancy be really of moment may be allowed to pas be of moment be fact can not possibly remain longer guest of woman who have be guilty of such crime a have perpetrated can submit to degradation of retaining of gift have accepted from will leave in room when presently quit regret at abandoning will be much le than will always feel since have be misfortune to have be brought into contact with thus to have learned beyond question that such woman sometimes actually exist oh chia'gnosi be cruel bitterly cruel unjust to say such thing to cried then to utter consternation burst into perfect passion of weeping again felt heart insidiously softening warming toward looked so utterly woebegone so terribly helpless friendless moment became conscious of feeling brought will power to bear determinedly repressed although confess never in life have more difficult task than battled with while bimbane proceeded to explain tearfully that although have undoubtedly done deed with anuti friend charged have be compelled to do in interest of good government for reason of state that if must only listen to explanation must see that be capable of very different interpretation from put upon by enemy listened will do justice to say that listened patiently to woman attempt to exculpate by proving that crime be really not crime at grim necessity of peculiar position occupied a ruler of turbulent restive people having steeled against effect of tear pathetic assumption of helplessness be able instantly to detect draw attention to weak point of defence with result at last realising suppose that have lost power over be no longer to be cajoled suddenly abandoned effort flew into furious passion abusing most abominably heaping upon head opprobrious epithet that must think of be able to think of good many be fool enough to think that after such treatment a have received at hand will let go shrieked in perfect frenzy of fury chia'gnosi have humiliated a believe woman be ever before humiliated by man since have scorned friendship will learn what mean to incur hate see flashed ring on thumb before eye by power possession of stone confers upon slay cattle so be dead dashed clenched right fist toward now be impossible for to leave country unless choose to adventure into wilderness without wagon even that will not do will leave palace a have determined at once will be to lodge in cage next occupied by captive man monkey a soon a have disposed of anuti friend will proclaim festival at of enemy who survive will do battle with equal number of monkey for delectation amusement of people aha chia'gnosi will be rare sight to watch unarmed fighting for life against biggest most savage man monkey that hunter can capture have release brute what must do to help although have not smallest belief in woman power to destroy cattle by alleged occult virtue pertaining to wonderful ring sight of flashed before eye in so provocative manner reminded of almost forgotten promise to siluce to take jewel from bimbane if must exasperated at last beyond endurance by abuse threat sprang to foot seized right hand in mine while stifled cry for help with left drew ring from thumb thrust upon own little finger animated by sudden impulse for must not in least account a ring passed from possession into mine change occurred in be startling in extreme particularly so a regarded bimbane for few second after released remained absolutely silent motionless a though scarcely able to realise what have happened then instead of summoning guard handing over to custody instantly became abjectly apologetic pleading entreating to restore ring in exchange for anything everything might choose to demand offered gold diamond without limit perfect liberty to remain in country a honoured guest a long a pleased help might need in transport of spoil when must please to start upon return journey in short gave clearly to understand need set limit upon demand if must restore ring to a for moment slipped jewel upon finger became conscious of strange new exhilarating sense of power of ability to do thing of being generally complete master of situation determined must keep ring if for other reason than bimbane seemed to attach such extraordinary value to to require restoration so badly therefore left at last quite exhausted with fruitless entreaty doubled up in little shapeless miserably sobbing heap on divan a went forth from apartment summoned waiting woman directed to go in attend to queen a feared that majesty be unwell chapter eighteen climax of adventure hastening across to suite of apartment have thus far occupied discarded splendid garment have be presented to by queen in have be wont to appear in public resumed somewhat worn faded suit in have arrived at masakisale after turned back upon room a thought for ever descended to where befuni awaited walking horse to fro before main entrance to palace mashona seemed somewhat startled to behold once more clad in shabby travelling

a soon a bier with dead occupant have be deposited upon summit of pyre arch priest began funeral service lasted about quarter of hour by time that be over be quite dark surrounding tree top standing out black against star studded sky only occasional faint evanescent gleam here there of starlight upon golden armour told of presence of multitude then religious service being at end lighted torch be mysteriously produced from somewhere handed to anuti who approaching pyre thrust burning brand into heart of retired again to former place for second two darkness continued then here there about pyre small wreath of smoke floated out quickly followed by little tongue of flame rapidly increasing in intensity until within few minute whole of upper part of pyre be ablaze basin with crowd of splendidly attired mounted official be brilliantly illuminated by ruddy glare think bier possibly body also must have be treated with highly combustible preparation for noticed that moment flame reached seized upon with avidity so that within ten minute of first kindling bier body be enwrapped in roaring volume of vivid flame in corpse seemed to shrink shrivel so rapidly that when at length top of pyre collapsed fell in scarcely vestige of bier body be to be seen fire blazed so furiously throwing out almost unendurable heat that within hour pyre have become reduced to heap of ruddy dull glowing ash whereupon anuti gave signal trumpeter blew seven blast by way of final salute to dead white ribbon be torn from banner cast upon flickering flame banner be unknotted forming up in military array mounted contingent wheeled departed making way back to palace leaving pedestrian to return home at leisure on following day golden urn containing ash asserted to be of dead queen be deposited by priest in funeral chamber beneath palace bimbane with fault crime finally disappeared for ever from among bandokolo accession of anuti to throne be cause of general rejoicing throughout country in accordance with custom new king proclaimed grand festival in celebration of event a festival also in accordance with custom necessarily consisted to great extent of fight between condemned criminal wild animal especially man monkey declined to remain be present anuti knowing view with regard to such barbarous spectacle did not press point on contrary fully sympathised with must very gladly have abolished custom public opinion be too strong even for sport be so highly appreciated that to have suppressed must have very seriously impaired popularity dared not risk just then at very beginning of reign therefore did everything must to expedite departure presenting with beautiful team of twenty four thoroughly broken zebra to take place of slain ox lending driver to instruct mine in handling of also insisted upon retaining one of gift bestowed upon by late queen added to second goatskin sackful of magnificent diamond finally instructed old friend pousa to escort with squadron to frontier more a guard of honour than by way of protection for by time fame have spread to uttermost part of kingdom bandokolo must have dreamed of attempting to molest thus magnificently rewarded for service after at least regarded a utterly insignificant took departure from masakisale on homeward journey exactly week after celebration of funeral obsequies of queen bimbane much to regret be assured of whose acquaintance have made departure from masakisale be very different affair from that of entrance into for although be not permitted to suspect at time there can be doubt entered capital of bandokolo virtually a prisoner be object of curiosity suspicion to everybody who set eye upon while now went forth accompanied by expression of regard regret from entire inhabitant of city who seemed to have turned out en masse to witness departure to bid farewell also excluding what remained of ammunition provision wagon be loaded to utmost capacity with gold precious stone no longer crawled over ground at bare three mile hour proceeded at quite double that speed behind sturdy sprightly high spirited team of twenty four zebra must have travelled half a fast again have not determined to work very lightly in view of long toilsome journey lay before here for gratification of curious may a well describe manner in animal be attached to wagon suppose everybody by time know from picture from having seen thing what south african wagon be like also know that be drawn by team of from twelve to eighteen ox yoked together in cleverest pair being yoked next wagon to disselboom answer to ordinary carriage pole where pair of horse be driven abreast while remainder of team be yoked also in pair to trek chain be attached to extremity of disselboom now ox pull upon yoke rest upon neck be attached thereto by strip of rein passing under throat constitutes whole of very primitive harness be obvious that such arrangement must be quite unsuited to new team of zebra consequently harness have to be especially made for consisting of breast shoulder strap former being made long enough to form pair of trace attachable to splinter bar there be also added headstall with single rein be fastened to trek chain arrangement served for leading pair of zebra off animal of be fitted with saddle upon driver sat postilion fashion guiding leader regulating pace of whole team during first two day bandokolo drove team while bantu voorlouper rode beside on one of horse watching process receiving instruction after 'ngulubi undertook driving while bandokolo rode alongside continued instruction thus by time that reached frontier be quite qualified to act a driver while jan piet have also learned to look after zebra when be outspanned with spanking team to draw wagon took only eight half day to cover distance between masakisale frontier instead of seventeen day a on outward journey here pousa squadron regretfully bade farewell captain regret at parting from being mitigated to great extent by gift of shaving mirror burning glass latter being esteemed by at about value attached to two sack of diamond farewell be spoken at precise spot where have met on outward journey did not pause there pushing twenty mile into defile where have seen man monkey before outspanned for night two day later passed grave of unhappy siluce have melancholy satisfaction of seeing thus far have not be disturbed by wild animal on following day arrived at spot where according to vision in bimbane have revealed to route must follow in order to find nell lestrange became necessary for to forsake former trail enter upon new one took up new trail without hesitation conviction being strong upon must be right in so doing event justified for on evening of sixty second day after departure from masakisale arrived upon north bank of pongola river be informed by astonished kafir whom encountered zululand country of redoubtable dingaan lay upon opposite shore of stream of course did not accomplish journey of two month duration through savage country without meeting with few adventure yet be surprisingly few thing considered for hunted now only for food for myself follower moreover be of very similar character to of outward journey with few unimportant variation in detail may therefore be passed over with merely brief reference to since to record in detail must only render story of altogether too unwieldy dimension without adding very greatly to interest arrived upon zululand border lost time in dispatching message to formidable somewhat unscrupulous king of country requesting permission to pas through territory on way to cape colony from north four day later befuni who be messenger for occasion returned with reply to effect that dingaan granted request with proviso did not linger unduly upon journey must call upon at place umgungundhlovu on way to pay respect also a fully understood tribute in shape of handsome present for privilege of course suited admirably a intended to call upon king in case on morning following return of befuni forded river entered upon somewhat risky journey across zululand taking thing fairly easy a wished to keep team of zebra in good condition in case must be necessary to hurry later on after interview with king two day later about mid afternoon arrived at umgungundhlovu multitude of house before reached leading feature of landscape began to assume appearance of familiarity until finally beheld with bodily eye entire scene complete down to smallest detail mafuta basuto nyanga have revealed to in vision six month before there be great town containing suppose quite two thousand hut built upon crest of gently rising hill completely surrounded by stout high palisade with open gateway in through passed number of people going about business merely pausing for minute two to gaze in wonder at handsome team of zebra there too close at hand be singular looking hog backed kopje with straggling bush tumbled mass of dark rock upon be perched fifty sixty vulture seemed to be quite at home there little did dream of ghastly tragedy of weird kopje have be scene few month earlier when on preceding sixth of february treacherous ruthless king have caused massacre upon of ill fated boer general pieter retief sixty of follower otherwise must have be good deal more uneasy in mind than actually be when gave order to outspan yet although have knowledge of memory of tragedy fear lest white must eventually determine to avenge proved of utmost service to in negotiation with savage monarch for when adopting usual tactic of bluffing boldly in dealing with savage informed dingaan bluntly that object in visiting be to demand surrender of white whom held in captivity saw at once for reason must not then guess be very greatly perturbed like savage be also attempted to bluff so that matter soon resolved into bluffing match between in although did not know held advantage first king indignantly denied knowledge of girl for whom be then seeking then when not only insisted that be in power also minutely described two girl companion just a have seen in vision retorted by declaring that be in mind to kill follower destroy wagon turn zebra loose so that trace must be left of of upon countered by asking whether really believed fool a to venture into country without sending messenger to countryman by way informing where have gone asking to investigate fate if did not arrive at home in due course retort proved to be winning card for gave in at once acknowledging nell presence in place insinuating that since have kept alive treated well ever since tembu have sent to a present ought to buy of of course after remainder of negotiation be merely matter of bargaining a be not at disposed to prolong agony by being over particular in matter of price half hour saw dear child sobbing happily in arm in exchange for practically whole of truck still remained to nell sat up quite late that night talking with telling adventure beginning with awful time when awoke to find room full of armed tembu warrior who forced to rise from bed dress go with although tale be interesting enough to have space in to record here one incident however struck a being sufficiently peculiar to be worthy of mention be told how when have be at dingaan place nearly year left town one morning accompanied by two young zulu girl to go down to favourite haunt of hers near river said when be passing just about here where wagon be outspanned very strange thing happened for although be not thinking of at just then suddenly believed for instant saw standing two three yard away with hand outstretched lip moving a though wanted to speak to seemed to see so distinctly that for moment be quite startled indeed believe actually stopped under impression that be really there a did so vanished although remember looking back did not see again now most remarkable thing about occurrence be that by carefully questioning child be at length forced to conclusion that have happened at precise moment when be beholding vision conjured up for by mafuta basuto nyanga inspanned with arrival of dawn on following morning pushing zebra to utmost capacity swept down through zululand into natal thence more leisurely through kaffraria to cape colony arriving in somerset east on seventeenth day after departure from umgungundhlovu to amazement delight of henderson host of other friend who have long given up a wiped out told a much of story a deemed fit though not of by mean did ask anybody advice for wandering in wild have given so much self reliance felt quite able to depend upon own judgment in first place negotiated with manager of local bank for exchange of five hundred pound worth of gold for coin then learning that there be ship loading for england at algoa bay installed befuni piet jan 'ngulubi on estate leaving horse zebra with to be looked after during absence packed up belonging transferred nell to port elizabeth where engaged passage for on ship be on point of sailing for home leaving just time to procure outfit prior to departure pleasant voyage of little under three month ended in finding in london in early part of february although found climate of england exceedingly cold unpleasant after brilliant sunshine warmth of south africa managed to enjoy thoroughly during ensuing two month then with nell cordial approval put to first rate school at bath where remained until eighteenth birthday emerging therefrom very beautiful accomplished lovable young woman meanwhile having disposed of nell for time being next turned attention to disposal of treasure bank of england took gold from at current value thus placing in immediate possession of abundant fund eventually before returning to south africa
