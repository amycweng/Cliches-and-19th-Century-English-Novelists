busy time nearly shop in fore street of good town of devonport be closed one of few exception being that of master john summer apothecary dealer in sort of herb simple a be announced by sign swung

individual behind counter who be with much deliberation care completing preparation of prescription be philip stukely apothecary only assistant while other be one colin dunster pallid raw boned youth whose business be to distribute medicine to master customer be slouching now outside counter beside basket three part full of bottle neatly enwrapped in white paper inscribed with name address of customer to whom be to be delivered in due course apparently package then in course of preparation must complete tale of to be delivered that night for a stukely tied string wrote address in clear clerkly hand lad dunster straightened up laid hand upon basket a though suddenly impatient to be gone at moment youth with blue grey eye curly flaxen hair tall broad chested with limb of young hercules burst into shop taking at stride two step led down into from street a exclaimed heyday master phil how be hast not yet finished compounding thy potion day work ended hour more ago evening be perfect one for sail upon sound ay so 't be will warrant answered stukely a deposited package in basket there colin lad continued be last for to night listen sirrah see that thou mix not parcel a thou

then two somewhat oddly contrasted friend wended way quickly down narrow street on way to waterside a go let take opportunity to become better acquainted with for although knew not be taking first step on road to many strange wild adventure whither who also love adventure propose to accompany philip stukely elder of two aged twenty three half year tall spare sallow of complexion with long straight black hair dark eye precise colour of man precisely knew for seemed to change with varying mood be a have seen by strange freak of fortune apothecary assistant merely to say that be apothecary assistant very inadequately describes man for in addition to that be poet painter in thought feeling if not in actual fact be also voracious reader of everything that treated of adventure from story of flood jonah memorable voyage to homer iliad odyssey everything else of like character that must lay hand upon altogether be very strange fellow who evidently thought deeply originally held many very remarkable opinion upon certain subject be that made friendship for deep attachment to dick chichester chichester equally deep attachment to so strange thing for two have not trait in common to begin with chichester be much younger than stukely being just turned seventeen year of age although difference in age be much le apparent than usual for while stukely in more buoyant expansive moment seemed considerably younger than year chichester might easily have be indeed often be mistaken for young man of twenty one twenty two while stukely be spare of frame sallow of complexion chichester possessed frame stature colouring of young viking being already within quarter of inch of six foot two inch in height although have by mean done growing broad in proportion with eye of steel blue shock of curly hair friend must in latter day have called auburn while enemy if have possessed must have tersely described a carrot in temperament too chichester be very antithesis of stukely for be absolutely unimaginative matter of fact perhaps occupation may have have something to do with for be apprenticed to shipwright delighted in work be also orphan nearest relative being uncle michael chichester merchant of plymouth who have adopted upon death of parent with whom now lived not much be said a strangely assorted pair strode along side by side on way to water for of loved boat sailing pertained to sea life be equally eager to get afloat a quickly a possible so a not to waste unnecessarily moment of glorious evening at last however a dick turned unexpectedly into narrow side alley stukely pulled up short with hillo master dick whither away lad be not way to spot where boat be moored no answered dick be not know be not going to take own boat to night phil be going to take gramfer heard lugger gramfer be to tavistock to night told morning might use lugger whenever pleased if did not want will have something like sail to night phil for there be enough wind blowing to just suit lugger while sea must be rather too much for own boat so saying chichester led way down alley halted at door in wall nearly at farthest extremity then drawing key from pocket unlocked door flung open stukely found looking in upon gramfer heard shipyard scene of dick chichester daily labour gazed for few second with appreciative eye at form of three goodly hull in varying stage of progress inhaled with keen enjoyment mingled odour of pine chip stockholm tar then hurried after dick who be already busily engaged in unmooring small skiff in to pull off to handsome five ton lugger rigged boat that lay lightly straining at mooring in tideway few minute later be aboard lugger busily engaged in loosing setting sail presently be under way having slipped mooring transferred to skiff left behind to serve a buoy to guide to mooring upon return lugger be beautiful boat according to idea of beauty that then prevailed having be constructed by mr george heard familiarly known a gramfer heard shipbuilder of devonport dick chichester master a kind of yacht for own especial use enjoyment be very roomy boat being entirely open from stem to stern be conveniently rigged with two mast main mizzen upon be set two standing lug jib mizzen sheet being hauled out to end of bumpkin consequently when once sail be set must easily be handled by one man stukely who be master spirit took tiller quite a matter of course while dick be perfectly content to tend jib main sheet away went down hamoaze with water buzzing foaming from boat lee bow swirling giddily in wake a sped swiftly along under impulse of fresh westerly breeze full strength of be however not yet felt lugger being under lee of mount edgecumbe beautiful then a be to day prospect delighted eye of two friend of stukely rather for dick chichester somehow seemed almost entirely to lack keen sense of beauty with friend be so bountifully endowed be very different from greets eye of beholder to day devonport stonehouse be mere village mount wise be farm land where citadel now stand be trumpery fort modern gunboat must utterly destroy in hour drake island be fortified be true with battery even more insignificant than citadel fort while hoe showed bare half dozen building chief of be inn afterwards re named pelican inn in honour of drake ship famous a spot behind eleven year later drake hawkins played never to be forgotten game of bowl a boat slid out from under lee of drake island however headed straight for eddystone gradually began to feel full strength of breeze two occupant settled down to enjoy thoroughly good long evening sail perhaps to be extended into small hour of next morning if condition continued favourable for there be nothing that two more thoroughly enjoyed than good tussle in well found boat against strong breeze heavy sea be like enough to have to night so soon a cleared sound reached open water in fact although probably of have thus far suspected be strongly imbued with spirit of born adventurer hour sailing sufficed to carry to seaward of penlee point when found that there be just wind sea enough to make for perfect enjoyment therefore instead of contenting with mere sail round eddystone back determined to make night of sheet be accordingly hauled aft for long stretch to windward close hauled towards chop of channel away sped boat to southward westward careening gunwale to sending spray flying in such drenching shower over weather bow presently water rose above bottom board splashed like miniature sea in lee bilge compelling dick to abandon mainsheet to stukely while took bucket proceeded to bale wind showed disposition to freshen careening boat so steeply that despite stukely utmost care water began to slop in over lee gunwale a well a over bow at length decided to take reef in mainsail for dick have fancy for spending rest of cruise in ineffectual endeavour to free boat of water came in faster than must throw out be done boat resumed headlong rush to southward until by time that sun sank red angry beneath western wave land lay mere film of grey along northern board then occurred thing common enough in tropic much le usual in more temperate climate wind suddenly dropped to stark calm then few minute later came away in terrific squall from about north north east so violent be outfly that there be one thing to do namely to keep boat away dead before away went lugger still heading to southward westward with wind now dead aft instead of over starboard bow have scarcely be scudding five minute when there occurred sudden rending crack of timber mainmast weakened by unsuspected flaw in heart of snapped about midway between heel of sheave went over bow broaching to lugger with drag of mainsail in water nearly filling a came slowly round head to wind friend be now in situation of imminent peril squall raised very awkward choppy sea with almost magical rapidity more than half full of water a boat now be be liable to be swamped out of hand by unlucky sea pouring in over bow occupant therefore set to work with will to bale out stukely taking bucket from dick handing baler instead be back breaking heartbreaking work for rendered heavy sluggish by large quantity of water in boat frequently failed to rise to lift of sea several of poured in over bow from time to time filling faster than must be freed by joint effort of crew so that at length unwelcome conviction forced upon two friend that unless something quite unforeseen happened boat must inevitably founder under conviction caused toiling pair to cease from labour for moment glance about anxiously in hope that twilight might reveal to craft to might signal for assistance to great relief perceived that there be indeed such craft within short two mile to eastward of moreover be outward bound be heading in such direction that must probably pas within mile of waterlogged lugger thanks be devoutly exclaimed stukely a eye fell upon if can attract attention before boat founder will escape after go on with baling dick while wave coat thing to do be to catch eye of somebody aboard ship make understood that be in distress then since can swim will not greatly matter if lugger must go down before yonder ship reach dick obediently did a be told while stukely whipping off coat sprang upon mast thwart with left arm flung round splintered stump to steady proceeded to wave coat energetically luckily for pair in distress be to westward of approaching ship with evening sky in still lingered pale primrose glow behind against background figure of boat stood out black a silhouette cut in ebony be possible that even with advantage might have escaped notice have not phil thought of waving coat figure of standing there apparently upon nothing for be only now then that small portion of hull became visible waving frantically something big enough to show up strongly soon attracted attention on board approaching ship stukely have scarcely be ten minute engaged on waving operation when have gratification of seeing flag float out over rail go soaring up to main truck while stranger helm be slightly shifted swerved perceptibly toward glory be have seen be bearing away for so matter little now whether lugger sink swim exclaimed stukely a sprang off thwart resumed task of baling with renewed zest nevertheless continued will be well to keep afloat a long a may since affords bigger mark to steer for than must head of two afloat upon darkling water stranger tall stately ship of two hundred forty ton measurement be now close aboard of dismasted lugger well be for occupant of latter that such be case for a ship cleverly rounded to with topsail lowered alongside to windward of boat so near be latter to foundering that bow wave of rescuing craft completed disaster by surging in over gunwale in sufficient volume to fill down went at precise moment when dozen rope hurled by sailor above came whirling down about shoulder of dick stukely haul away shouted two with one accord grasping rope end came first to hand a felt lugger sinking going down with next moment be dragged dripping wet up lee side of ship in over high bulwark better late than never i fegs exclaimed stout burly man of middle height clad in crimson doublet of slashed silk trunk hose with crimson velvet cap in front of be stuck feather of same hue secured by gold brooch set jauntily upon head by faith master be only just in time mr bascomb put up helm hoist away topsail again now gentles who be ye how came ye to be in so awkward scrape a from have just rescued ye be evidently captain of ship so stukely taking lead a usual explained in few brief word particular of mishap thanked unknown for kindness in taking trouble to pick up concluded by expressing hope that individual to whom be speaking must have great goodness to stand inshore land on nearest point that must conveniently fetch captain for such proved to be introducing a john marwill captain of good ship adventure of topsham westward bound to indie in quest of spanish booty shook head good naturedly firmly nay friend can not will not do for here have spent whole of last night to day working down channel a far a now that have at last caught fair slant of wind will make most thereof not risking loss of to land man yea even though be own brother utmost can promise be that if must fall in with coaster other ship bound up channel must sight fishing boat will delay voyage just long enough to put ye on board not minute longer if so be encounter craft will e'en have to join for have here room for idler now hie away into cabin take off wet clothes mr bascomb master will furnish with dry clothing from slop chest though misdoubt continued running eye dubiously over chichester stalwart frame whether will find ample enough to clothe friend withal when ye have changed sup with in cabin will talk further together marwill then beckoned to bascomb gave latter instruction to open slop chest do best to provide newcomer with dry clothes whereupon master in turn beckoned to philip dick to follow below where in due time be provided with change of clothing resource of slop chest happily proving fully equal to strain upon resource imposed by chichester bulky proportion change be effected in good time to allow two friend to join occupant of poop cabin at supper where captain marwill made duly acquainted with fellow adventurer be five in number consisting respectively of mr george lumley mr thomas winter marwill lieutenant mr walter dyer mr edmund harvey gentleman adventurer who with marwill have provided wherewithal for fitting out of expedition mr william bascomb master aforesaid be fellow devonian genial hearty company in best of good spirit at prospect of stirring time before with chance of returning home made men be true that not to put too fine point upon be pirate of sort so be grenvile drake hawkins rest of illustrious contemporary piracy be at time regarded a quite honourable profession provided that piracy be perpetrated solely against hated spaniard be by time dark enough to render necessary lighting of great cabin lamp swung in skylight apartment with long table draped with snowy napery abundantly furnished with smoking viand flanked with great flagon of foaming ale presented particularly cosy inviting appearance a dick phil having be introduced in due form to others took seat more so perhaps from fact that of having be too eager for sail to wait for meal at conclusion of day labour have tasted neither bite sup since midday be now in possession of truly voracious appetite then conversation a meal progressed wonderful almost incredible story of past adventure related by marwill bascomb of whom have already once visited indie confidence with anticipated return to england laden with wealth unimaginable exercised almost irresistible fascination over two newcomer one at least of whom philip stukely to wit began to feel before meal be over that cared not jot though must be compelled by force of circumstance to join daredevil adventurer who made clearly understood that so far a outside world be concerned intended to be law unto marwill bascomb talk especially of cloudless sky of richest blue out of sun darted flaming ray by day in star blazed like jewel at night of tranquil sea of sapphire in creature of strange form brilliant hue disported of tropic shore coral fringed clothed with graceful feathery palm backed by noble forest tree of precious wood made glorious by flower of conceivable hue shape amid hovered bird of such gorgeous plumage that gleamed shone in sun like living gem of rich luscious fruit to be have for mere trouble of plucking of firefly spangling velvet darkness with fairy lamp of gentle indian who at least when not brought under malign influence of cruel spaniard regarded white men a god appealed with singular force fascination to stukely who sat listening breathlessly with glowing eye to everything that two sailor said about wonder for singularly enough although man have never until now be out of sight of english soil although have never read about thing seemed strangely familiar to time without number a have sat meditating over fire on winter night have sprawled among hay upon sandy beach on summer evening have vision of just such land just such enchanting scene a marwill bascomb described come floating to like vague distant cherished memory awoke a from delightful dream when meal being finished marwill arose from chair invited guest to accompany out on deck be quite dark when emerged from cabin so dark indeed that for moment eye being still dazzled by bright light of cabin lamp groped way like blind men be fain to stand still clinging to whatsoever hand happened to find then sight coming to again followed marwill up poop ladder stood staring out upon night of blusterous wind faintly phosphorescent foam capped sea of flying cloud amid star twinkled mistily vanished to re appear presently with tall spar swelling canvas of ship swaying dizzily black among night full of unaccustomed sound of creaking groaning timber of splashing roaring of water under ship bow along bend about rudder of strange sighings moanings aloft of low murmur of men voice a watch clustered under shelter of towering forecastle discussing mayhap like superior aft prospect of voyage captain peered about on side of ship anon stooping to send glance forward into darkness beyond heaving bow then hailed lookout upon forecastle demanding in sharp imperative tone whether there be sail of kind in sight answer be in negative well master said turning to stukely chichester see how be there be nothing in sight mile that travel lessens chance of falling in with anything into can transfer if good breeze hold a trust in god that will will be off falmouth shortly after midnight much too far out to render at likely that will sight of fishing craft once to westward of falmouth last chance of getting ashore will be gone now what say ye will ye without more ado up join talked matter over with partner while be changing dud before supper can find room in ship for of have surgeon with so that berth will fit finely mr stukely while a for young son of anak turning to chichester lad of thews sinew can always earn keep aboard ship can offer ye something better than berth of ship boy have one carpenter among will gladly take on with rating of carpenter mate if will suit ye i fegs will now what say ye will call bargain have done wi ' so far a be concerned certainly may if dick will join too answered stukely will not let go ashore alone to answer for loss of boat for accident caused plight in found be at least a much fault a believe that be going to have chance to get ashore therefore what say dick will accept captain marwill very generous offer so settle matter be not thinking of boat gramfer heard be rich enough to bear loss of without feeling be uncle that be troubling about be afraid that will be greatly distressed at sudden unaccountable disappearance answered dick true assented stukely doubtless will what about thy aunt dick will not rejoice that worthy uncle exchequer be relieved of cost of maintenance have heard that keep tight hold upon husband purse string have be whispered that begrudges tester that good man spends upon thee believe will soon find word to console for thy loss be true phil returned dick with sigh must sit watch eating like cat so often enough for very shame rose from table still hungry uncle be not rich man have three maiden of own to feed clothe so that perhaps may be just a well that must take advantage of opportunity to relieve of cost of extra mouth to fill extra body to cover what of master summer phil how will manage without thee master summer must e'en get dispenser answered stukely with shrug trow there be plenty of to be have must have book with not having however must contrive a best can to do without then cut in captain somewhat impatiently may understand that be willing to join will never have such opportunity to make fortune phil looked enquiringly at dick who after moment hesitation nodded whereupon stukely speaking for announced that be ready to sign agreement whenever might be convenient for to do so time like present asserted marwill may a well do now leading way into cabin produced parchment setting forth article of agreement read over to two friend then took pen inscribed name at foot of document thus forging last link in chain be to drag into series of adventure of so extraordinary character that be doubtful whether even stukely with inborn love of adventure must have be willing to proceed must have foreseen what awaited in future chapter two how adventure fought took santa clara off barbados now at very outset almost before ink of signature have fairly dried hitch threatened to occur over matter of berthing two new recruit for stukely being entered a surgeon marwill offered a matter of course stateroom aft while chichester being shipped merely a carpenter mate be directed to go forward establish in house abaft fore hatch in be lodged other petty officer dick to do justice be willing enough to accept lodging assigned to be stukely who objected to being separated from friend insisted that dick being gentleman although merely shipwright apprentice be a much entitled to cabin aft a be when unreasonableness of demand be pointed out to proposed that also must be permitted to berth forward must be managed for there be only one spare bunk available in petty officer house namely assigned to chichester therefore captain arrangement have perforce to stand after very well said stukely when at last be convinced that what desired be impossible let be dick can at least walk talk together when be off duty listen lad in adventure such a be like to be many change be possible probable advice therefore be that make friend with master bascomb get to instruct in science of navigation so that may be fully qualified to act a pilot must occasion arise will be worse pilot because happen to be good shipwright proper place be aft among gentles where hope to see thee soon be a may be answered dick with laugh nevertheless thy advice be good will take for part will give friend bascomb hint that be to teach thee thou art willing to learn cut in marwill for doctor be right many change be like to occur among before see old england shore again will be glad to know have one aboard who be fit to take bascomb place must aught untoward now master away to quarter get good night rest doctor will of course sleep in night be on duty day a for chichester will put in watch to morrow morning next day saw good ship adventure clear of channel for breeze have interfered so unceremoniously with fortune of dick friend held through night contrary to expectation increased at same time hauling gradually round from north east to great joy of captain bascomb who at eight o'clock in morning shaped course for azores where be intended to wood water ship lay in goodly stock of fruit vegetable to stave off scurvy among crew for a long time a might be weather continued fine wind fair for four day during ship with squared yard made excellent progress then came strong breeze from westward drove nearly hundred mile out of course in turn be followed by light wind fair weather with sun so hot that pitch began to melt bubble out of deck seam so that mariner who have hitherto be going about duty barefoot be fain to don shoe to save foot from being blistered finally after voyage of twenty four day came to azores where remained four day filling up fresh water replenishing stock of wood taking in bounteous supply of vegetable fruit especially limmons a marwill called for prevention of scurvy then greatly refreshed by short sojourn by entire change of diet enjoyed during stay again set sail making way to southward westward at length fell in with beneficent wind blow permanently from north east in after year came to be known a trade wind with blowing steadily behind day after day squared away for island of barbados where if there happened to be spaniard to interfere with be marwill intention to lay up for while to give men time to recruit health also to careen ship clear her of weed before beginning great foray along spanish main in due time on fiftieth day from on dick phil be rescued from sinking boat to be precise with rising of sun faint blue blur wedge shaped with sharp edge pointing toward south appeared upon horizon straight ahead joyous shout of land ho burst from lip of man stationed a lookout upon lofty forecastle yes there be land unmistakably sharp clear cut with slate blue cloud only cloud in sky hovering over from breast of vivid lightning flashed for space until having emptied of electricity cloud pall passed away leaving island refreshed by shower have accompanied storm gradually to change from soft blue to vivid green a adventure with widespread pinion rushed toward before favouring breeze with cry of lookout ship at once awoke to joyous life watch below ay even sick sprang from hammock rushed crawled a case might be on deck to feast eye once more upon sight of bit of solid earth green with verdure promising manner of delight to who have be pent up for so long between wooden bulwark whose eye have for so many weary day gazed upon naught sea sky be true that stukely have never tired of gazing upon same sea sky with spirit of artist that dwelt within have be able to see ever changing beauty where others have beheld only monotony to crew at large that wedge of land growing in bulk importance a ship rushed toward be more beautiful than most glorious sunset have ever presented to wondering eye what island be that demanded stukely of master who be standing halfway up poop ladder gazing at distant land under foot of foresail must be barbados unless be long way out of reckoning there be fear of besides know look shape of place have be there before be just so that looked when got last glimpse of yes be barbados please god will sleep ashore to night there be good safe anchorage round on other side of low point with snug creek into ship with little lightening may be taken careened pray that there may be spaniard there for there be better place on god good earth for landing recruiting scurvy ridden crew be there indian on island asked stukely there may be can not say never saw answered bascomb if there be continued be not likely to interfere with such indian a have met have ever be very shy of showing to white always keep out of way if can be to say do so among island on main where have be cruelly ill treated enslaved by spaniard be very different being cruel treacherous ever ready to attack white destroy with poisoned dart discharge from blowpipe poisoned arrow have fear indian on yonder island if indeed there be will be of very different temper quite gentle indeed then pray that may be returned stukely for though have be marvellously fortunate thus far in matter of sickness there be still too many men in sick bay for liking ought to have one of sound fit for duty again before go on with great adventure look now what come yonder surely be ship canvas just beginning to show over land there near southern end of island bascomb shaded eye with hand looked toward where stukely pointed island be by time about five mile distant colour of vegetation be showing up clearly in brilliant light of tropic day beyond again showing over tree top there be faint grey film be evidently moving sliding along a be toward low point even a looked filmy grey object suddenly became strong white assumed definite form a emerged from shadow of cloud revealing a upper canvas of large ship have just got under way from anchorage on lee side of point seemed to be more likely of two be working up to windward in smooth water having sighted island on way to eastward i sure agreed bascomb relapsing into devonshire dialect in excitement be ship sure enough moreover spaniard at most likely if so will have fight on hand afore long do ' e see thicky ship t'other side of island yonder cap'n marwill continued addressing to captain who be on poop conversing earnestly with messrs dyer harvey partner in adventure ship sayest thou where then demanded marwill breaking off conversation running forward to head of poop ladder why there be with sail o ' mun just showing over low point answered master will be clear of land in minute two then will see a clearly a see be spaniard to thinking cap'n there may be fine picking aboard of if turn run so soon see will not do that master bascomb be bigger ship besides how be to know baint spaniard like if tell will clear deck make ready before show flag gentles see what come of let mariner get to work at once mr bascomb excitement aroused by appearance of land on horizon after so many weary week of gazing upon sea sky only be intensified tenfold when strange sail first have seen since leaving azores be discovered when be further understood that chance be in favour of proving to be spaniard preparation for possible fight be entered upon with utmost eagerness alacrity fortunately there be not very much that needed to be done for marwill rendered wise by past experience have consistently made point of always having deck kept clear of unnecessary lumber of kind bulwark be strengthened raised for purpose of affording crew a much protection a possible from enemy musketry fire lower yard be fitted with chain sling so that risk of being shot away ship thus disabled at critical moment might be minimised a much a possible party of musketrymen be sent aloft into round top with instruction to hamper enemy a much a possible by fire especially by picking off helmsman officer powder room be opened ammunition sent on deck for culverin sakers swivel of be loaded men having armed with cutlas pistol bow pike stripped to waist bound handkerchief round head took up several station by gun at halliard sheet marwill took command of ship a whole while lumley winter lieutenant assumed charge of poop forecastle respectively bascomb master taking charge of main deck stukely with knife saw bandage established in cockpit dick chichester who have contrived to gain reputation of being best helmsman in ship be ordered to tiller meanwhile strange ship having cleared land revealed a craft of probably quite hundred ton bigger than adventure carrying four more piece of great ordnance than latter fact by mean dismayed english for stranger be what be called race ship be nearly twice a long a adventure marwill therefore confidently reckoned must two vessel come to blow superior nimbleness of own ship must more than counterbalance advantage conferred upon other by greater weight of metal stranger when cleared land be close hauled on larboard tack heading about south south east be judged from position relative to land that have not actually touched at island have simply availed herself of presence to gain few mile by turning to windward in smooth water under lee discovery of presence of english ship did not appear to have caused uneasiness to commander for did not deviate hairbreadth from course stood on maintaining luff only indication that have observed adventure at being display of yellow flag of spain have hoisted to head of ensign staff within five minute of time when cleared island probably imagined that adventure be also spanish english on part took notice of stranger except by gradually edging down toward until preparation for battle be complete then indeed hoisted white flag bearing crimson cross of saint george hauled wind sufficiently to enable to intercept spaniard at invitation to battle symptom of alarm indecision began to manifest on board latter for first put up helm kept away a though about to turn tail run presently came to wind again tacked heading now to northward over with helm steer for northern end of island cried marwill to dick ought to enable to intercept thank god mean to fight instead of running matter will sooner be settled look to now be stripping for battle for in come light canvas up go mainsail man who command ship be right valiant cavalier will put up good fight therefore let man put match to culverin finger to trigger until give word now let wait play up brave men of devon ' therewith wait five in number stationed on main deck between poop mainmast struck up that favourite inspiring air with such good effect before two minute have passed man boy in ship be singing song at top of voice feeling quite ready to fight spaniard who might care to come against quarter of hour later two ship have closed to within musket shot of other adventure having weather gage when crash came whole of spaniard broadside great gun small so bad be aim shot flew high overhead not so much a rope be touched good ejaculated marwill now steersman up with helm shave past a close under stern a can without touching starboard gunner be ready to pour shot into stern a pas musketrymen archer pick off a many men a can see especially helmsman sail trimmer to station be ready to go about two minute later adventure slid square athwart towering gilt bedizened stern of spaniard one after a be brought to bear ordnance belched charge of round canister smashing spanish gingerbread work to splinter shivering pane of glass in stern window sweeping deck of stranger from end to end deadly nature of discharge being evidenced by outburst of shriek instantly followed aboard stranger well done gallant cried marwill waving sword now ready about larboard gunner stand by to repeat dose down helm steersman let come round raise fore tack sheet have be falling off mean to give larboard broadside while be in stay if can topmen do best now pick off helmsman before be too late well done a spaniard began to come ponderously to wind again showing that helmsman be down let man who did come to by by will have noble for good shot swing mainyard musketrymen clear enemy top of archer shoot down may attempt to take place trim aft head sheet swing foreyard starboard gunner reload ordnance will try trick again if will give chance now larboard gunner be ready let have a pas minute later adventure broadside again crashed into spaniard stern again uprose hideous answering outburst of shriek yell on board latter a english ship with sail clean full slid square across antagonist stern only reply to broadside being four shot discharged from enemy stern port not one of did groat worth of damage tall figure completely encased in armour sprang up on spanish ship poop rail shaking naked sword at marwill shouted in spanish be coward senor englishman why do not fight fair broadside to broadside instead of sheltering under stern where shot can not reach because senor happen to be fool retorted marwill in same language be coward continued a will prove to within next five minute if will do honour to meet on own deck intend to come without further ado will be most happy senor be reply down jumped spaniard in hurry to issue certain order apparently for voice hollow in helmet be heard pealing out in tone of command a two ship drew apart larboard gunner load piece again commanded marwill level so a to take on main deck while be in stay luff helmsman can want to get far enough to windward to be able to run down lay aboard on next tack boarder see to priming of pistol be ready to follow presently now ready about again men down helm a adventure hove in stay ship fired broadside simultaneously one of english shot entering port dismounting gun while rest struck fair in wake of deck went clean through spaniard side a must clearly be seen while spaniard shot a usual flew overhead again by great good luck missing everything now up helm steersman lay aboard commanded marwill be ready men to throw grapnel moment that touch boarder stand by to follow into enemy main chain a two ship closed in toward other for final grip be to decide matter spaniard holding luff while english ship bore up ran down with wind free archer musketeer on side became busy spaniard having slight advantage because of superior height of ship although be more than counterbalanced by greater quickness accuracy of aim on part of english who shot a coolly a though have be practising at butt seldom failed to hit mark nevertheless several englishman went down during ensuing five minute be carried below to stukely who now began to find surrounded by quite a many patient a must conveniently attend to then two ship crashed together grapnel be thrown marwill followed by man whose leg must carry whose hand must wield weapon sprang into spaniard main rigging leaving adventure to take care of herself be rash thing to do perhaps succeeded for spaniard be too busily engaged in endeavouring to keep enemy out of own ship to think of boarding other most desperate be fight ensued english being fully determined to force way aboard spaniard while spanish be a fully determined that must not air became thick with flying arrow with smoke of grenade stinkpot flung down upon boarder out of enemy top while sword pike flashed in sun pistol popped men shouted execrated a cut slashed at other glorious tropic morning be filled with sound of deadly strife dick chichester to let reader into secret have upon first appearance of spanish ship be greatly exercised in mind lest must fail in courage when two ship came to blow with discharge of first shot queer agitated feeling have mistaken for fear completely passed away be instantly forgotten now service being no longer required at helm armed with handspike snatched

in one spot crowding together to resist attack of english upon rear of flung with indescribable fury whirling terrible handspike with such destructive effect that astounded spaniard thus taken unexpectedly in rear went down like ninepin while yell of anguish dismay quickly threw entire crew into complete disorder so violent indeed be commotion that attention of spaniard be momentarily distracted from what may be termed frontal attack of distraction marwill instantly availed to dash in on deck where with few sweep of sword soon cleared standing room not only for also for dozen of immediate follower in turn cleared way for others thus in course of couple of breathless minute man of adventure crew have gained deck of spaniard after capture of ship be foregone conclusion rush of marwill party on one hand onslaught of dick chichester with whirling handspike on other so utterly distracted demoralised spaniard that presently broke fled flinging away weapon cry out that foe be crew of demon who have assumed for nonce outward semblance of englishman hatch be promptly clapped on over fugitive spaniard then marwill follower paused to recover breath look about first thing to claim attention be ship being lashed together by mean of grapnel be grinding rasping other side so alarmingly a rolled plunged in sea be running that have already inflicted upon other appreciable amount of damage threatened to do great deal more if prompt preventive measure be not taken marwill therefore called upon winter one of lieutenant to take party of twenty men with return to adventure cast adrift from prize lie off within easy hailing distance of latter be done at once dick chichester being one of called upon by winter to follow aboard adventure a soon a two ship be parted investigation be made into extent of damage incurred by ship result of investigation be discovery that adventure be much greater sufferer of two larboard main channel piece having be wrenched off seam in immediate neighbourhood opened while three of channel plate be broken thus leaving mainmast almost entirely unsupported on larboard side water be entering ship in quite appreciable quantity through opened seam men be therefore at once sent to pump to keep leak from gaining while carpenter dick went below to see what must be done toward stopping meanwhile marwill assisted by co adventurer dyer harvey proceeded to overhaul prize systematically with view of determining value first fact ascertained be that ship be named santa clara second that hailed from cadiz in old spain third that be homeward bound from cartagena from port be twenty two day out cargo although valuable enough in way be not of such character a to tempt english to go to labour of transferring portion of to own vessel apart from cargo proper be taking home ten chest of silver ingot two chest of bar gold casket of pearl of be quickly transhipped to adventure crew of thus found possessor of fairly rich booty while still upon very threshold a be of sea wherein hoped to make fortune be not for in process of rummaging captain cabin marwill found certain letter unhesitatingly opened read among be communication from governor of cartagena advising home authority of impending dispatch of rich plate ship for cadiz probable date of dispatch be given a three month after departure of santa clara about ten week from date of vessel capture by english that letter marwill thrust into pocket together with certain other document thought might possibly prove of value then summoning unhappy spanish captain to presence informed that english having now helped to that required be at liberty to proceed upon voyage marwill recommended to do with diligence alacrity lest peradventure must fall into hand of certain other british buccaneer at existence of whom englishman darkly hinted hoping thus to nip in bud plan spaniard might have formed for return to cartagena with report of presence of english corsair in caribbean sea two ship then parted company santa clara steering northward close hauled against trade wind while adventure bore up for barbados shaping course to pas round southern extremity two hour later english ship be riding snugly at anchor in what be now known a carlisle bay in five fathom of water within four hundred foot of beach same distance from mouth of small river within a bascomb

forecastle where must enjoy uninterrupted view of island left there to feast eye upon beauty in peace until time must arrive when shipmate must be ready to man boat take ashore what glorious sight be

led carried along deck handed gently down over side whole of being sent ashore in first boat left ship with master in charge duty being to see that unwholesome fruit poisonous berry be eaten unwittingly next sick having be temporarily disposed of there followed strong able bodied who took ashore with spar tackle spare sail with to rig up temporary tent soon greensward be dotted with busy men who in interval of labour drank coconut eagerly devoured banana prickly pear guava soursop grape mango various other fruit with island abounded by by when certain large tent have be erected beneath shade of giant ceiba tree boat put off from shore to ship presently returned bearing nine wounded men result of fight that morning under especial care of philip stukely men lying in hammock a have be taken out of ship be then carried up to completed tent when hammock be re slung to stout pole firmly driven into ground where stukely once more at greater leisure attended to hurt there be one form lying stark in laced up hammock deeply stained with blood be not brought up to tent be remained of george lumley captain marwill chief lieutenant who have be shot to death in very act of boarding spaniard few hour before grave having be prepared in small open space on opposite side of river under shadow of splendid bois immortelle strewed ground with glowing scarlet flower trumpet be blown calling crew together then when be assembled entered boat at sign from marwill took in tow boat containing body of officer with saint george cross at half mast trailing in water astern of having reached other side reverently bore shrouded corpse to last resting place lowered into grave marwill meanwhile reading burial service covered up with rich brown earth service rendered returned to site of camp rapidly proceeded to put up other tent needed to enable hand to sleep ashore night sun be within hour of setting when at length everything be completed to marwill satisfaction men be told that might cease work amuse a pleased permission being accompanied by caution that be not to wander more than quarter of mile from camp not to go even a far a singly not to go unarmed for although be assumed that island be uninhabited save by be recognised a quite possible that band of spaniard might be somewhere upon if so must probably have witnessed arrival of ship might if strong enough attempt to surprise capture camp ship men therefore made up little party for most part went off into wood to gather more fruit to look for gold of seeming to be possessed of firm conviction that being now in indie must inevitably find precious metal if only searched for with sufficient diligence a for dick stukely latter having by time done that must for patient went off for stroll together along beach in direction of southern end of bay well dick what think ye of fighting now that have have taste of demanded stukely slipping hand under chichester arm a turned back upon camp by way continued without waiting for reply to question must permit to offer tribute of most respectful admiration for be told that carried like right valiant redoubtable cavalier indeed captain have not hesitated to say that for most furious onslaught upon spaniard rear morning while be leading attack by way of main rigging matter be like enough to have gone very differently with oh be nonsense laughed dick saw that marwill wished to reach deck of spaniard noticed that spanish crew have congregated together in one place to stop struck must best help by falling upon in rear saw might be done right easily there being man to stop so did precisely with result that spaniard finding thus suddenly furiously assailed by one who bore like very orson feeling desire to have brain beaten out with so heathenish weapon a handspike incontinently gave way before scattered affording opportunity to climb in over bulwark be ye not afraid lad that proud spaniard resenting interference might slit weasand with long sword afraid returned dick not whit 't be true that when first sighted enemy coming out from behind same island learned that captain meant to attack turned suddenly cold hot a be morning be seized with plaguy doubt a to whether must be able to carry a englishman devon man must in coming fight when battle began forgot about doubt thought more of until fight be over done with indeed to be quite frank with ye phil be never happier enjoyed more than during few minute that fight lasted know not what feel like for be down in cockpit be proper place may take word for that there be nothing in world half so exhilarating a good brisk fight stukely laughed true lad said know from actual experience what feel like to be engaged in life death struggle for have never yet taken part in such yet can well believe that be a say for even down in cockpit felt thrill tingle of a listened to booming of ordnance heard shout of men command of captain nay will go even farther than confess have much ado to restrain from deserting post rushing up on deck to take part in word in ear dick believe must make far better leader than be ever like to be surgeon for a stood there listening to sound of conflict strangest feeling of familiarity with came to suddenly felt that have fought many time before fleeting indistinct vision of contending host strangely armed arrayed floated before cry in strange language still seemed to understand rang in ear for moment completely lost sight of surroundings being transported to land of cloudless sky even a clothed with vegetation very similar to what now behold around although land of vision be mountainous with lake shone like mirror embosomed among mountain be dotted with island of palm crowned while others bore stately temple of strange beautiful architecture strangest part of be that while lasted be like vivid memory of scene that eye have rested upon often enough to grow familiar with ay a familiar a be with street of devonport plymouth ay be ever fanciful fellow dreamer phil replied dick who be one of most matter of fact individual who ever breathed mind how many time when have be sailing together outside plymouth sound where clear view must be have of setting sun used to trace cloudy continent with bay inlet harbour outlying island in western sky yes even ship sailing among city rearing among golden edge of cloud well be that so very wonderful retorted stukely look at yonder sky for instance can not imagine that great purple mass of cloud to be vast island set in midst of sea represented by blue green expanse of sky beyond can not see how shape of cloud lends to fancy of jutting cape foreland of gulf sound estuary look at small outlying cloud nearest be not very image similitude of islet lying off coast of main island a to city what can be more perfect picture of golden city built along shore of landlocked bay than golden fringe of cloud yonder behold mountain valley ay there be lake opening up now in very centre of island oh dick son if have not imagination enough to translate picture of evening sky into glimpse of fairy land to derive pleasure therefrom pity from very soul nay then need to waste pity on sir dreamer for need not retorted dick doubtless take joy of fancy reality be good enough for at least such reality a look at bird hovering over yonder flower for instance smaller much smaller than wren be yet how perfectly shaped how gloriously plumaged look to colour of a rich purple a of sunset cloud with crest throat like gold painted green then long curved beak of see how daintily dip into cup of flower sip honey therefrom wing why be whirring so quickly that can not see can only hear can of fancy touch thing like for beauty be a may be dick answered stukely bird be beautiful undoubtedly le beautiful be flower from sip honey constitutes food indeed thing be lovely have eye to perceive loveliness come sun have set darkness will be upon in five minute be time for to be getting back to camp despite croaking of frog snore of tree toad incessant buzz chirr of insect multitudinous nocturnal sound incidental to life upon tropical island overgrown with vegetation ay despite mosquito too hand slept soundly that night awoke next morning refreshed invigorated sick especially exhibiting unmistakable symptom of improvement already due doubtless to large quantity of fruit have consumed on preceding day wounded too be doing exceedingly well coolness of large tent in have passed night a compared with suffocating atmosphere of confined quarter aboard ship being in favour to say nothing of assiduous care phil bestowed upon first thing in order be for hand who be able to go down to beach indulge in good long swim shouting at top of lung splashing incessantly in accordance with marwill order in order to scare away shark might chance to be prowling in neighbourhood then spring of clear fresh water having be discovered within about three quarter of mile of camp one watch be sent off to ship to bring ashore soiled clothing while other watch mounted guard over camp after hand went to breakfast then working watch watch about there ensued general washing of soiled clothes at spring subsequent drying of on grass in ray of sun done gang be sent on board ship to start remaining stock of water pump out after ship be lightened by removal of store ammunition ordnance until draught be reduced to nine foot when anchor be hove up be towed into river where be moored bow stern immediately abreast of camp completion of job finished day work at end of marwill having mustered hand proclaimed that in consequence of lamented death of gallant shipmate officer mr lumley have decided to promote mr winter to position thus rendered vacant further that a second lieutenant be still required have determined after most careful consideration to promote mr richard chichester to position in recognition of extraordinary valour have displayed on previous day by boarding spanish ship attacking crew single handed in rear thereby distracting attention of enemy contributing in small measure to subsequent speedy defeat decision on part of captain strange to say met with universal unqualified approval for dick unassuming demeanour geniality of manner have long since made popular general favourite while superior intelligence almost instinctive grasp of everything pertaining to ship management dauntless courage marked out a in respect most suitable for position have be chosen to fill next two day be spent in clearing everything movable out of ship in preparation for heaving down after be careened until keel be out of water when grass weed barnacle have grown upon bottom during voyage be effectually removed seam be carefully examined re caulked where required then bottom be re painted work be pushed forward with utmost expedition lest enemy must heave in sight touch at island while ship be hove down for ship be absolutely helpless at mercy of enemy while careened when part of work be satisfactorily completed necessary repair made hull re caulked re painted right up to rail mast spar rigging sail be subjected to strict overhaul renovation work be done in very leisurely fashion for marwill have by time quite made up mind to lie in wait for plate ship a have learned through document found on board santa clara be loading at cartagena for cadiz speedily arrived at conclusion that considerable amount of waiting might a well be done at barbados a elsewhere for climate of island be healthy sick be making excellent progress on road toward recovery be essential to success of enterprise man of crew must be in perfect health moreover apart from crew of santa clara ship have reason to believe be daily forcing way farther toward heart of north atlantic not soul knew even suspected presence of adventure in sea consequently resolved to remain where be until last possible moment such work therefore a needed to be done be done with utmost deliberation nicety when at length be finished there still remained time to spare men be permitted to employ pretty much a liked having by time be ascertained conclusively that apart from island be absolutely without inhabitant at length however time arrived when became necessary to put to sea again on certain brilliant morning camp be struck good chattel be taken back to ship with man once more in enjoyment of perfect health with water cask full to bung hole of sweet crystal clear water with ample supply of fruit vegetable on board adventure weighed anchor stood away to westward under easy sail passing between island of saint vincent becquia with first of dawn on following morning marwill have estimated that passage from barbados to cartagena must occupy eight day to provide against unforeseen delay allowed twelve day for accomplishment with result that unforeseen delay having arisen adventure arrived off cartagena just four day before date upon according to information obtained from santa clara plate ship be to sail be just about midnight when according to bascomb reckoning ship reached latitude of cartagena when be hove to a marwill have observed precaution of maintaining good offing during entire passage merely hauling in to southward sufficiently to sight point gallina in passing thus verify position be not surprising that when daylight came land be in sight even from masthead be perfectly satisfactory a must be nevertheless be important that explicit information must now be at once obtained concerning plate ship progress be making toward completion of loading especially whether must be ready to sail on date originally named marwill therefore summoned council of war consisting of in addition to bascomb master winter dick chichester lieutenant messrs dyer harvey two gentleman adventurer meeting be held in main cabin chart of coast be produced after considerable amount of discussion be finally determined to provision water equip longboat remain hove to where be until then filling on ship work in toward land until be a close inshore a must be prudent to take when longboat be to be hoisted out dispatched with crew of four men under command of marwill who be only man aboard who must speak spanish reasonably well then while adventure under bascomb command bore up again regained offing of thirty mile due west of cartagena longboat be to proceed inshore enter bight between island of baru mainland there remain in concealment while marwill must attempt to make way into cartagena harbour if necessary even penetrate into town in endeavour to secure precise information relative to movement of plate ship be further arranged that adventure must remain in offing during whole of succeeding day working in toward land again after nightfall hoisting two lantern one over other at ensign staff a guide for longboat must latter by time have accomplished mission bright lookout be to be maintained for longboat be to signal approach by displaying single lantern must be unable for reason to rejoin ship on night agreed upon same tactic be to be pursued night after night for six night when if did not then return be to be assumed that crew have fallen into hand of spaniard bascomb be to act a might be determined upon after consultation with rest of officer arrangement then be adhered to adventure remained hove to in offing during whole of day filling away beginning to work in toward land about hour before sunset captain marwill then picked longboat crew consisted of dick chichester george burton robert hogan edward fenner directed to make necessary preparation for accompanying after be to turn in take rest until must be summoned on deck be just half past two o'clock in morning when dick having be aroused from sound sleep by cabin boy presented fully dressed in main cabin where found captain marwill already seated at table partaking of early breakfast in by wave of hand invited chichester to join latter promptly did falling to with good appetite quarter of hour later having finished meal pair passed out on deck where found longboat with six beaker of fresh water in to serve a ballast with locker full of provision with rudder shipped oar mast sail lying upon thwart already slung ready for hoisting out be fine night sky clear excepting for few small drifting cloud between star shone brilliantly water smooth wind moderate offshore breeze land clearly in view eight mile to windward be in fact perfectly ideal night for expedition a be in contemplation task of preparing longboat have be entrusted to mr winter who now reported a ready nevertheless captain marwill like prudent mariner subjected to very close careful scrutiny before giving word to hoist out everything however be found to be quite a must be therefore crew weapon having also be subjected to rigid inspection order be given to heave ship to hoist out boat preparation having be previously made business be soon accomplished on stroke of three by ship clock longboat shoved off stepping mast made sail for land being sped on way by hearty cheer from hand aboard adventure who have mustered to assist in witness departure then moment that boat be clear ship helm be put up be headed out to sea again under press of canvas with object of running out of sight of land before arrival of daylight a for longboat be brought close to wind on larboard tack with dick at helm marwill sitting beside while three mariner perceiving that service be not likely to be required further for time stretched out in bottom of boat be soon fast asleep for first hour of progress land to windward merely presented appearance of black blur indistinctly seen under star spangled indigo of night sky by end of time something in nature of outline began to reveal while hour later long tongue of land became distinctly visible broad on weather bow with two three much smaller detached blotch rising out of sea ahead standing up in stern sheet marwill scrutinised appearance with greatest care for several minute then with sigh of contentment sat down again be all right dick said have made most excellent landfall that long stretch of land yonder be baru island small detached blot of blackness be detached islet at southernmost extremity saw marked on chart must pas to leeward of lad giving berth of at least mile because if chart be correct there be reef between must avoid if can only get up abreast of islet before daylight come will be satisfied because will then be hidden from sight of fishing canoe may happen to be outside cartagena harbour once inside baru think need not have slightest fear of discovery moreover have idea that can make way into harbour from back of baru without being obliged to go outside again will be great advantage have formed plan of action to be followed after arrive at back of island demanded dick well ca say have answered marwill experience be that in case of expedition of kind be of little use to scheme very far ahead have found that best plan be to trust to luck be guided entirely by circumstance object of course be to penetrate to town of cartagena there pick up news can get hold of relative to movement of plate ship seeing if possible so acquainting with build rig general appearance so that if by chance must sail in company with other ship may know for certain be craft that must single out for attack may be possible for to go up harbour in longboat although regard thing a very likely there must be too much risk in think to justify such attempt at least until other scheme have failed be not out now in quest of adventure to incur unnecessary risk to obtain information adventure may come later on be more than likely that will returned dick dryly for can not for life of see how be to enter town without exposing to very grave risk of discovery oh may be done asserted marwill with far more confidence than dick thought be justified by occasion cartagena have population of several thousand know suppose be at likely that everybody will know everybody else even by sight will be very difficult for anybody to point to anybody else say with assured certainty that be stranger who have right to be there of course will not enter town at least at present contemplate anything so foolhardy will attempt to get into town alone leaving longboat snugly concealed within easy reach in case of necessity for rapid retreat arising must keep eye open to guard against detection at same time maintain bright lookout for be ready to come to help must be hard pressed ah there be reef that spoke of little while ago see there broad off weather bow can see surf breaking upon there be small island right ahead of keep away lad up helm let go off point so steady a go ought to carry clear of everything thank god there be dawn coming will just get nicely in before grows light enough for anybody to see longboat have by time drawn close in with land island of baru looming up black clear cut to windward with islet adjacent reef now known a rosario island short quarter of mile broad on weather bow clump of hill on main beyond just beginning to outline sharply against lightening sky behind daylight darkness come with rush in latitude by time that rosario island be abeam eastern sky have paled from indigo to white even a one looked became flushed with most delicate ethereal tint of blush rose in turn warmed a rapidly to tone of rich amber against cluster of mangrove bordered island occupying what looked like embouchure of river suddenly revealed point two on weather bow like amber tint spread right left along horizon upward toward zenith to be pierced next moment by broad shaft of pure white light shot upward far into delicate azure be now flooding heaven drowning out star one after other then up shot shaft of light radiating from point just below horizon like spoke of wheel suddenly little layer of horizontal cloud few degree above mangrove top became visible rose red gold edged instant later spark of molten palpitating gold flashed blazed through ebony black mangrove branch dazzling eye tipping ripple with long line of scintillating gold stretched clear from shore to boat flooding in with primrose light quickly golden spark grew brightened until before one must draw breath dozen time have expanded into upper edge of great throbbing burning golden disk flooding land sea with golden radiance be day sea changed from purple to clear translucent green vegetation ashore still black immediately under sun merged by thousand subtle gradation right left into olive green of imaginable tint finally into delicate rosy grey in extreme distance multitude of trivial detail of outline contour tree rock suddenly leapt into distinctness flock of pelican rose from among cluster of island inshore went flapping heavily solemnly out to seaward dorsal fin of shark drifted lazily past boat full extent of bight behind island of baru swept suddenly into view just in time exclaimed marwill with sigh of relief a rose stretched round with lad head up bight while wind last will be flat calm here in hour from now hope not said dick for bight be quite twelve mile long by look of will be joke for four of to be obliged to pull heavy boat greater part of distance there will be need said marwill be not in such desperate hurry a amount to take boat close in under shore of island when wind fails will anchor have breakfast calm will probably last no longer than about hour then will come sea breeze must say from trend of coast just here will probably draw right up bight be fair wind for thus proved force of land breeze rapidly declined until in course of hour boat scarcely retained steerage way during half hour have progressed about two mile up bight while dick have hugged eastern shore of island of baru a closely a depth of water must permit when at wind failed took advantage of last expiring breath to run boat in behind small rocky tree crowned bluff where be not only completely hidden from sight where crew enjoyed further advantage of being sheltered from too ardent ray of sun here having lowered sail moored boat to rock breakfasted comfortably at leisure upon fish caught during progress up bight broiled over fire kindled by mean of pocket lens marwill made point of carrying with constantly captain be also pretty nearly correct in estimate of duration of calm for have little more than finished meal when first cat paw heralding approach of sea breeze be seen playing here there upon surface of water five minute later wind be roaring with strength of gale over top of island whipping surface of bight into small choppy foam capped sea of fine breeze at once took advantage by casting off from rock hoisting canvas when away went bowling merrily up bight at head of arrived about hour half later shape of bight proved to be roughly speaking triangular measuring about twelve mile long by about four mile wide at entrance narrowing at upper end to channel about twelve hundred foot wide separating baru from mainland passed through channel before fully realised where be going upon issuing from northern extremity suddenly found in broad sheet of water eight mile long by about width cartagena harbour without doubt must never do at least in broad daylight therefore hastily putting boat about ran back into channel have just quitted beached boat upon shore of baru where leaving craft in charge of three men marwill dick landed to reconnoitre part of island upon landed be quite low bordered with mangrove of fact took advantage by concealing among tree from secure hiding place examining harbour at leisure found that be on north eastern extremity of island of baru with whole of harbour of cartagena before roof spire of town just showing waveringly in sort of mirage over low land form easternmost extremity of island of tierra bomba be same island of tierra bomba by way convert what must otherwise be open roadstead into landlocked harbour for form western side of harbour serf a natural breakwater sheltering roadstead very effectually when wind happens to blow from westward also being roughly triangular in shape eastern western side measuring about four mile long northern side about three mile divide entire harbour into two part namely upper lower bay upper bay in turn be divided into inner outer harbour by two irregularly shaped spit of low land western spit jutting out south east in sort of elbow from promontory on city be built while eastern spit be divided from mainland by narrow channel be called manzanillo island foregoing be brief rough description of cartagena harbour given for information of reader to enable better to understand what follows comparatively few of above detail be apparent to two englishman lurking among mangrove on north eastern extremity of baru for island of tierra bomba most prominent object in sight shut out much of upper bay obtained however good view of boca chica harbour entrance took careful note of fact that be effectually commanded at narrowest most difficult point by battery built on very beach fort castle crowning crest of hill immediately above agreed that if be only entrance to harbour if garrison of fort maintained proper lookout must be quite impossible for ship to enter leave cartagena except with full permission of authority well exclaimed marwill at last when have familiarised with everything that there be to see from viewpoint be very well have already learned quite enough to repay for trouble in taking trip have not yet seen nearly want to see therefore by hook by crook must get ashore upon island yonder pointing to tierra bomba hill at north eastern angle ought to command view of whole harbour town must get up there now how be best to be done appears to said dick that there be opening of sort creek mouth of small river immediately opposite just to right of bay also to right of two hill one of be showing just clear of other there be two small islet standing in mouth of yes yes see what mean interrupted marwill well what be suggestion suggestion answered dick be that remain concealed until then that must take boat explore creek whatever be if prof to be suitable hiding place well good will conceal boat crew there to morrow morning can climb to top of hill make observation need even perhaps to extent of drawing rough chart of place will cost twenty four hour of time believe that information will thus obtain will more than repay be sure of answered marwill heartily will do lad meanwhile mosquito be becoming something more than troublesome so a have now seen that be possible for to see from here will get away back to boat men will begin to think that something have happened to chapter four how marwill dick entered cartagena harbour in longboat a marwill have anticipated men be beginning to feel distinctly alarmed at prolonged absence of officer admitting indeed that be seriously debating advisability of leaving boat instituting search at moment when marwill dick reappeared admission drew forth sharp rebuke from captain who there then gave strict order under circumstance be ever to dream of doing such thing for instance said what pretty pickle must be in if being discovered pursued hotfoot by enemy be to retreat to boat find that men have left must mean that mr chichester must be obliged to shove off without that in turn must mean that sooner later must inevitably fall into hand of enemy let tell men that to fall into hand of spaniard here mean being clapt into inquisition of who get into inquisition not one in hundred ever get out again therefore never leave boat under circumstance whatsoever except at express command of officer be by time considerably past noon food be therefore produced hand partook of meal after there be nothing to be done until evening men therefore disposed in bottom of boat took such snatch of sleep a mosquito permitted while marwill dick sat in stern sheet discussed plan for morrow at length however after interval of waiting soon grew terribly wearisome sun went down darkness fell pushed off boat got under way there be now young moon of about four day old before too set afforded light enough to make way across lower bay distance of about three half mile to island of tierra bomba to find indentation to dick have directed marwill attention earlier in day proved to be particularly snug little cove about mile long by perhaps quarter of mile wide with thickly wooded hill sloping down toward on side at upper extremity two small islet pretty effectually masked entrance dry sandbank in middle of occupied more than area leaving narrow channel round water in be only just deep enough to afford unimpeded passage to boat be stark calm inside cove be therefore obliged to lower sail strike mast use oar to reach head of creek when arrived there found steep bank so completely overhung with tree bush that when once boat have be forced in underneath branch might remain there for day with little fear of discovery in exceedingly snug berth seemed almost ridiculous to think of keeping watch yet being in enemy territory decided to do so marwill undertaking to stand first watch of two hour while dick agreed to take second when at ten o'clock marwill aroused dick in order that latter might stand watch captain whispered have be thinking about good many thing have be sitting here two hour agone in stern sheet of boat among other matter have thought that might be very useful to know something more than do about two battery that took notice of while be on point yonder to day now be not bit sleepy believe must get to sleep if tried also night be delightfully cool although moon have gone down star give quite enough light for purpose therefore be going to take little walk along shore to battery on beach ca be very much more than two mile away night be only time when will be possible to examine fort without running too much risk if feel too tired will take fort on top of hill on way back so if return until close before daybreak need not be unduly alarmed very well sir answered dick will keep bright lookout if by chance thing must go amiss must be pursued if will fire two pistol shot one close after other will come with one of men to meet provided of course that be within hearing of shot yes may do that if hear signal shot agreed marwill added will need to be very hard pressed indeed to fire pistol for shot at night time anywhere near battery must be certain to put everybody on alert probably bring bigger hornet nest about ear than hand must beat off still if want help very badly will know what to do now will be off keep sharp lookout allow to be surprised good night a dick murmured answering good night captain turned disappeared in darkness through night careful watch be maintained nothing in slightest degree alarming occurred about hour before daybreak captain marwill returned having accomplished mission to own complete satisfaction have difficulty whatever explained to dick did encounter single soul indeed be strongly of opinion that island at least southern half of be uninhabited except for garrison of fort battery tackled battery first making way to by passing round base of hill until reached shore line of next bay then followed for remainder of distance heavy walking found with murrain on for sand be loose deep except where came upon mangrove there mud be even deeper than sand while a for mosquito be a eager for blood a spaniard must be if knew what business be here however be not to be turned back by mosquito even though assailed in legion after trudging through heavy sand for full hour more found beneath wall of battery be planned like triangle one face mounting four gun commanding seaward end of boca while second face command inner extremity third face being turned toward land containing entrance gate point apex of triangle jut out into water be therefore unable to walk completely round nevertheless examined side by walking past back of face of wall be quite smooth about twelve foot high angle be set with rough quoin stone up there being light in battery sign of sentinel essayed to climb accomplishing ascent with greater difficulty hurt than wearing of sol off stocking for took off shoe for sake of quietness to gain better foothold having gained parapet found two sentry sitting there with back against wall fast asleep with matchlock beside gently lifting weapon in hand shook out priming lest perchance must awake seeing open fire upon before must get away then replacing weapon a have found passed quietly on to examine ordnance gun be very formidable of pattern such a have never before seen being good twenty foot in length of bigness to take shot size of man head a learned by passing hand over topmost shot of pile stood beside gun there be eight of piece of great ordnance besides falcon swivel did not stay to count heavy ordnance being caused anxiety even now greatly trouble for if keep better watch there on other night than did on must be easy for couple of resolute men to enter place even a did bind gag sentinel spike eight of gun never man of wiser until came to put fire to piece then having seen desired left battery a have entered made way up hill to castle on top here however be le fortunate there being way of entering building save by walking in through gate climbing wall with help of scaling ladder place be much more formidable looking than battery being in appearance strong castle with dry ditch drawbridge portcullis to main so far a must see only entrance in plan be shaped like letter l with angle turned harbour ward must mount about thirty piece of ordnance for managed to count number of embrasure on two face of sentinel saw none so if set watch presume that like in battery rascal be in habit of sleeping watch through be so much better for freebooter like ourselves for dry ditch be not difficult to cross estimate once on other side ladder of twenty foot in length must enable party of dozen to reach top once on parapet must be able to spike whole thirty of footy ordnance in ten minute mean friend dick with whole of heavy ordnance spiked in castle in battery there be nothing to prevent adventure from sailing into harbour coming to anchor storming blowing up defence then holding town to ransom a well a capturing galleon for a soul liveth firmly believe that castle battery constitute entire defence of cartagena then hey for old england again for with ransom of town booty from galleon there ought to be enough to make rich for life if there be not ought not to be very difficult for to play same game with two three other town remarked dick for suppose be safe to reckon that town along main be wealthy enough to pay for looting ay doubt there be good picking to be have out of one of answered marwill one thing at time ' be good maxim in such business a ours lad will see what cartagena yield before begin to think seriously about of other town now here come dawn at last for thanks be for be a hungry a if have spent all night to top of dartymoor want breakfast hour later meal have be prepared eaten after marwill dick having provided with food water sufficient to last until nightfall if necessary having given crew of longboat most precise instruction a to how to act in event of certain contingency arising cautiously emerged from place of concealment carrying boat compass with for purpose of enabling to take such bearing a might be required set out upon way to top of hill dominated north east corner of island going be exceedingly difficult for slope be rough steep also be so thickly overgrown with vegetation that for good part of distance have literally to cut way for therefore although distance have to traverse be little more than mile be well on toward noon when at length reached summit when there be fain to admit that labour have be well spent for a topped last rise vegetation suddenly became much thinner so that found able to force way through without being obliged to have recourse to hanger presently emerged upon bare hilltop beheld spread out at foot magnificent panorama embracing view of whole upper bay inner harbour with town of cartagena bare four mile distant there in midst of whole fleet of smaller craft also beheld tall stately ship single glance at sufficed to assure that must be none other than plate ship be great object of quest there be exclaimed marwill pointing of seven hundred ton more deep in water too must have pretty nearly quite finished loading seems to that be only just in time now dick lad be opportunity to make chart that be talking about come along let get about will help to night must make way into city somehow find out by hook by crook exactly when be to sail now how do begin upon chart well said dick to be of use must be tolerably accurate drawn to scale top of hill be admirably adapted for purpose first business must be to measure off a correctly a possible longest line can get with little management think ought to be able to make line mile in length will be long enough for purpose then having measured off line taken compass bearing will remain to be done will be to take from end of line compass bearing of a many object a require where several bearing intersect will be correct position of object then can complete chart accurately enough for purpose by sketching in detail between object position of have determined see be sort of thing mean drawing scrap of paper from pocket chichester rapidly sketched diagram illustrating meaning marwill took sketch considered attentively yes said at length ought to be near enough for purpose how be going to measure line quite easily answered dick when learned be to accompany idea of drawing chart of harbour at once occurred to thought out plan have just explained to also borrowed from carpenter ball of fine cord then proceeded to knot very carefully at foot measured with carpenter rule here be just one hundred foot long with help of ought to have difficulty in measuring line have for hilltop be quite level enough for purpose measured twice going returning in order to ensure greater accuracy laying down work on paper to scale a proceeded managed before dark to secure exceedingly useful tolerably complete chart of upper bay inner harbour with help of felt that ought to be able to find way to town even on darkest night of course be not able to ascertain depth of water by mean even colour of seemed to indicate that there be hidden danger to guard against anywhere except just inside entrance of inner harbour where presence of shoal obstructing fairway be clearly indicated by certain glassiness of surface be duly recorded upon chart preparation of chart served to familiarise with principal feature of harbour in really wonderful manner to fix in memory relative position of one with be not for while be at work eye be busy noting various detail one of be that small fishing village existed at base of hill upon be at work not more than mile from spot where longboat lay concealed be discovery of importance to for at once suggested possibility of borrowing canoe from village after dark proceeding in to city by plan must run much le risk of detection than if attempted to reach city with longboat completed labour set out to walk down hill on way to boat while sun be still nearly hour above horizon be safely aboard again ere darkness fell then having partaken of meal marwill dick stretched along in stern sheet of boat in order to snatch hour two of sleep before embarking upon by far most hazardous part of enterprise namely excursion to city of cartagena marwill have given instruction that dick be to be called punctually at eight o'clock when hour arrived man who have watch proceeded to arouse appeared that captain be already awake not having be to sleep at in fact a dick seemed to be fast locked in arm of slumber marwill softly whispered to man who be about to arouse that be to be permitted to sleep on at same time composing to rest giving fresh instruction that be to be called at midnight from be evident that in interim have modified original plan when at length midnight arrived pair be duly awakened marwill remarked with grin darkness effectually concealed well lad hast have good sleep excellent answered dick feel a fresh a lark can scarcely realise have only be asleep two hour two hour retorted marwill with laugh thou hast have six hour of good honest sleep 't be midnight instead of eight o'clock fact be continued in more serious tone must not sleep when first attempted to do so thought be busy with task lay before must not see how be to be done in time have allowed way that looked at matter be have arranged that be to start from here at eight o'clock by time that have found way round to village where hoped to get canoe must be nearly quite nine by time that reached cartagena must be ten o'clock after there must be work doing most of good folk must be abed thus must stand very poor chance of gaining information worth having proper time for to be ashore there be during day when everybody be astir when there be plenty of people about to talk to ask question of when will be too busy to take particular note of wonder who be where came from so altered plan deferring departure until now will afford plenty of time to get into city before daylight then will have whole day before if find that require in to look about make few discreet enquiry a soon after dark a be safe to return will come back reaching boat if be well in time to go out rejoin adventure to morrow night about time now will want to go with a far a village to help if need be to secure canoe when have done be fairly under way can come back here to boat wait for for work have to do can best be done single handed now if have question to ask ask if not may a well be off for want to allow plenty of time to make way into town dick intimated that believed quite understood scheme captain have outlined that have only one question to ask namely how long boat be to remain where be in event of marwill being detained in cartagena longer than anticipated how long repeated marwill let see will make second complete night that have be absent from ship although seems very much longer stay here if necessary for four day night longer a arranged with bascomb if be not back by midnight of fourth night order be that be to rejoin ship report to winter bascomb that have done learned say be wish that will act a may seem to best without reference at to what may have become of for if return to by time have named will be because can not having fallen into hand of spaniard now if be ready let be going silently with observance of precaution to prevent betrayal of longboat hiding place to chance wanderer in neighbourhood pair forced way through leafy bower up steep bank until emerged upon clear ground when bearing away to eastward round foot of hill have day ascended groped way cautiously over unfamiliar ground until in course of about hour caught dim shimmer of starlight upon water between group of dark shapeless blotch upon nearer approach identified a hovel constituting fishing village have seen during day from top of hill circling round presently reached water edge where a have fully anticipated found dozen more canoe of various size hauled up on beach most of with net piled up in stern looked about for smallest canoe must find having overhauled a carefully a light must allow satisfied a to seaworthiness removed net from to craft nearest at hand lifting by two end carried down to water set afloat then with quick hand clasp low murmured goodbye lad take care of men marwill stepped softly into crank little craft seated in stern with vigorous thrust of paddle sent off into deep water where few minute later be swallowed up by darkness dick stood by water edge watching small black blur represented man canoe a receded from shore until vanished then turned slowly away to retrace step to longboat happily unconscious that have looked last upon gallant leader returning safely without difficulty to longboat dick chichester whispered to man who be keeping watch thus far be well then bestowed in stern sheet to snatch hour two of sleep then after somewhat late breakfast emerged cautiously from leafy refuge climbed to top of hill again ensconcing well within shadow of thick bush from beneath commanded uninterrupted view of entire upper bay harbour not that expected to see much indeed anything in particular thought well to keep watchful eye upon thing in general if anything particular must happen ashore take care to be where might perchance be able to detect indication of saw nothing at to indicate that anything unusual have taken place be taking place in cartagena only occurrence of noticeable character came under observation day being violent quarrel among certain of inhabitant of fishing village below quarrel shrewdly conjectured might possibly have something to do with missing canoe remained on hill whole of day allowing only just daylight enough to find way back to longboat then having partaken of meal disposed to secure good long uninterrupted night rest warning men however to be alert during watch so that if captain must return during night need assistance might be prepared to render quickly captain marwill did not return during night therefore after early breakfast next morning dick again ascended hill to keep watch upon town harbour thinking mayhap might thus catch early glimpse of marwill returning if haply must chance to be pursued learn fact in time to go to assistance day too passed uneventfully away galleon with great golden flag of spain flaunting at stern showing visible sign of early departure dick felt so firmly convinced that captain must return time during ensuing night that sat up waiting for taking watch after watch a came round morning dawned with still sign of marwill then young officer began to feel seriously apprehensive for must not imagine that leader must spend two whole day in cartagena without learning that desired to know upon matter must be so widely discussed a departure of exceptionally rich treasure ship for old spain yet of course there be chance that marwill might be voluntarily prolonging stay for purpose of obtaining especially valuable item of information meanwhile four day having not yet expired duty be to remain where be keep sharp lookout so again dick wended way to top of hill ensconced in now familiar hiding place beneath bush on day vigilance be rewarded by sign of activity on board galleon to wit slow very deliberate bending of sail so slow deliberate indeed that at end of day only about half canvas have be secured to yard of course indicated that date of sailing be drawing nigh comforted with reflection possibly date have not yet be definitely fixed spaniard be notoriously dilatory in respect thinking nothing of fortnight even month delay might perhaps be that marwill be patiently awaiting fixing of date before rejoining knowing that boat must be awaiting whenever might find convenient to return to thinking reasoning thus dick at length succeeded in so completely convincing that marwill delay be entirely voluntary that anxiety have gradually be growing upon passed away so completely indeed that composed to rest with absolute conviction that captain must return sometime during night only order deemed necessary to give men being that be to maintain sharp lookout awake immediately upon general arrival night passed day fourth day since marwill have left last of prescribed sojourn where be dawned without sign of absentee when at length dick chichester awakened fact be borne in upon former apprehension returned with redoubled force something have gone wrong with captain be convinced of must never deliberately tarry so long in town man woman child in be enemy identity a englishman have be discovered have be taken without doubt yet with sudden revulsion of feeling dick remembered that one trait of captain character be certain daredevil recklessness made peril rather overcoming of joy delight caused actually to court danger for pleasurable excitement evasion of afforded might not be then that marwill knowing fate awaited in event of detection be deliberately lingering in cartagena in order that might enjoy to fullest possible extent gratification of hoodwinking enemy moving freely among unsuspected swayed thus between hope fear harassed young lieutenant once more for last time mounted hill resumed anxious watch of town harbour indication of happening of unusual character in town in harbour be perceptible everything seemed to be going forward precisely a usual only occurrence that in slightest degree interested watcher being that crew of galleon resumed occupation of bending sail operation proceeding with same deliberation a before contrived to complete about hour before sunset when dick unutterably weary discouraged with long fruitless watch arose made way down hill to place where longboat lay hidden chapter five how disarmed battery on tierra bomba a chichester neared now familiar spot where have left longboat suffered to indulge in returning feeling of elation for notion somehow came to that must find marwill in boat calmly awaiting return feeling presently grew so strong within that must scarcely credit eye when upon passing through screen of concealing foliage saw only three seaman curled up in boat roused from semi somnolent condition sat up to receive with glance of mute enquiry in eye for few moment dick remained silent absolutely speechless with disappointment then remarked what lad have captain not yet returned then sir answered in chorus have seen naught of indeed of anybody else since left morning then said dick greatly fear that evil have befallen that have be discovered taken by spaniard for be last day of stay here order to be that if return not by midnight be to proceed to sea rejoin ship for failure to return will be due to fact of having be captured still there be six hour to run yet before midnight may return even at very last moment let hope that will now men give supper for have eaten nothing since left morning time between then midnight be passed by dick in state of feverish suspense toward end became almost unendurable causing to start jump at trivial sound that reached ear dozen time at least sprang to foot with joyous exclamation of here be when flutter of dry leaf falling from parent bough soft rustle of foliage in night wind movement of restless bird broke silence of secluded spot be always mistaken captain came not at length watch informed that time be hour after midnight then rose to foot with sigh of bitter disappointment said be good lad must not delay departure longer have allowed captain hour grace if must have come must have be with before now without doubt be prisoner can best serve now by returning to ship with speed reporting fact of capture to others who must then decide whether not will sail into harbour attack town endeavour to rescue cast off painter let be moving without further delay almost careless now whether not attracted attention hauled boat out from place of concealment stepping mast hoisted sail got under way wind just permitting to lay course down past sand spit out through entrance of cove into lower bay without breaking tack then to save time dick determined to risk passage of boca chica usual harbour entrance instead of taking longer route out to sea behind island of baru relying upon indifferent lookout of sentinel a reported by marwill to enable boat to pas undetected in be completely successful occupant of battery giving sign that passage of boat have be observed hour after emerging from place of concealment found safely clear of everything out at sea night be dark clear with fresh land breeze blowing sky heavily flecked with fast scurrying cloud between star moon blinked down upon intermittently be sooner clear of land than began to look about for ship within few minute caught sight of signal lantern about eight mile distant dead to leeward after everything went quite smoothly hoisted own signal lamp bore away dead before wind leaving to ship to pick up did about hour later shipmate manifested utmost interest in return hand mustering on deck to see boat come alongside hear news when upon boat being brought to lee gangway dick led way up side be met at entrance port by bascomb winter dyer harvey of whom at same instant fired at question where be captain lost taken fear answered dick left four night ago intending to make way into city of cartagena for purpose of learning precisely when galleon be to sail together with other information might be able to pick up instruction be be to await return until midnight to night if then failed to return must be because something untoward have happened to in case be to rejoin ship at once report to when must act according to discretion after consulting together for moment there be dead silence then bascomb turned to fellow officer said master loss of general be very serious matter need looking into let therefore retire to cabin hear what mr chichester have to tell about after a be arranged when captain marwill left six night ago must consult together decide what next step be to be come then gentleman to cabin mr chichester will be pleased to accompany therewith three principal officer of ship two gentleman adventurer retired to great cabin where seated upon locker with dick occupying chair in front of tale be told of have befallen boat crew from moment of departure to of return including several expedition to top of hill on tierra bomba drawing of chart where be that chart now demanded bascomb have did captain marwill take with have answered dick here be producing sketch fortunately captain left with not needing since information required to enable to make way to cartagena must carry in head four who be sitting on opposite side of table bent over document examining closely for several minute at length bascomb looked up said master if chart be reliable must be judging from pain taken by captain mr chichester must suffice to enable to take ship right up to cartagena lay alongside galleon if ship can be taken by surprise without loss on part a think may what be to hinder from taking town demanding good heavy ransom for part of ransom will consist in return to sound unhurt of captain if refuse be unable to return captain to in condition specified what say to sacking place giving to flame depend upon by so doing will soon learn fate of captain marwill where be to be found for there will be hundred who will be only too ready to curry favour with by telling that know in hope that thereby may be induced to spare property ay will warrant answered winter woe betide city in if aught of evil have be done to captain will find man who have be in anywise responsible for evil will hang before own door for men to see how dangerous thing be for spaniard to lay violent hand upon englishman now what say ye gentles will go in at once do work while blood be hot within nay sir answered dick may scarcely be for if captain be indeed taken a greatly fear be depend upon authority will have identified a englishman in despite of tale that may have told will in consequence suspect presence of english ship somewhere in neighbourhood following suspicion first act must be to warn in fort on tierra bomba to be on watch for ship appearance once seen will according to captain own account be impossible for to force way into harbour unless gun in fort be first spiked now gentles be youngest of have be inside seen place have be privileged to discus with captain very question of taking ship up to town from discussion arose determination to make chart advice be that defer attempt until to morrow night that in meantime be permitted to return in longboat to former hiding place provided with hammer nail for spiking of gun such other necessary a may require together with crew of six of best men can get back to place of concealment before daylight there remain in hiding until midnight later when will sally forth steal into two fort overpower gag sentinel spike gun after will signal ship by burning of portfires where can not be seen from town when will sail in meeting outside piloting in can then land party destroy battery by blowing up capture galleon town sail out to sea again unscathed when have finished business with spaniard thy plan sound promising young sir answered bascomb presently after considering matter little there be one weak point in be if a seem to think spaniard have taken captain thereby be led to suspect presence of english ship in neighbourhood suspecting such presence must warn garrison of two fort to be on lookout for of grant to be more than likely what hope have of being able to surprise fort spike gun task will be difficult one admit answered dick with shrug of shoulder with submission sir plan be only one offering chance of success for be fundamental fact governing else gun must be spiked fort destroyed before ship can enter cartagena harbour having entered get out again fort once in possession whole town harbour with within will be at mercy important matter therefore to be determined be by what mean can ensure obtaining possession of fort with minimum of loss to ourselves yes agreed bascomb be undoubtedly point now gentles let have opinion have one of better plan to offer than of junior lieutenant at moment stateroom door opened stukely emerged from smaller room approaching table stood looked smilingly down upon company assembled pardon fair sir said for thrusting uninvited into counsel surgeon be supposed to know little of warfare beyond healing of such hurt a may be received therein happened to be lying awake in cabin when conference began must not avoid hearing have passed be of opinion can help a friend chichester here have put problem confronts be that of securing possession of fort without suffering loss of men now chief danger to mind arises from difficulty of entering fort without attracting attention of sentinel thus causing to raise alarm bring entire garrison about ear be not that so party at table signified that be very good then resumed stukely now can go on though be probably not aware of chief delight be research investigation of among other thing property action upon human system of juice of herb now while be at barbados spent much time in collection of leaf root seed fruit of several plant since then have be diligently experimenting with with result have evolved from one of liquor one inhalation of odour of will plunge man into state of such complete insensibility that a believe limb might be removed from without feeling being wiser suggestion therefore continued stukely ignoring expression of wonder evoked by statement be that be permitted to go in boat with chichester taking vial of liquor with upon arrival ashore will enter fort with subject sleeping sentinel humbly trust that may be sleeping to stupefying influence of decoction whereby may be bound gagged without difficulty raising of alarm must put fellow soldier on alert then between gun can be spiked at leisure remaining detail leave to riper judgment experience gallant sir doctor demanded bascomb be quite sure that elixir essence of yours may be depended upon to produce effect stated be answered stukely with smile for have already tested upon matter how effect be everything can possibly be desired then what say gentles will allow surgeon to go with mr chichester further test efficacy of decoction upon spanish sentinel asked master 'twould be folly in if did not avail ourselves of virtue of mr stukely be most fortunate discovery said winter for one be in favour of acceding to proposal also agreed dick in response to glance from bascomb two gentleman adventurer when appealed to for opinion at once agreed that experiment be quite worth trying bascomb proposal be accordingly agreed to nem con that matter then be disposed of remarked bascomb now next thing have to decide be assuming that mr chichester succeeds in spiking gun of fort what be to be next step be to take ship boldly into harbour proceed with business of capturing galleon town trusting dame fortune will so far favour a to permit of getting out again before soldier can unspike gun must anchor a soon a inside land strong party capture destroy fort before attempting anything else be gun only not fort have to fear if must permanently disable gun fort garrison might go hang so far a be concerned certainly sir cut in dick before anyone else must speak have hit nail on head need trouble about naught except ordnance must destroy know how to do too will take with enough powder to double charge gun having done will seal muzzle with clay know where to find a much clay a will need then will prime piece lay quick match from priming to priming light match run for life gun will burst can then do what please with galleon town in order to ensure complete success ordnance in battery must be fired a nearly a possible at same moment therefore resolute man must be left in lower battery to fire match upon instant that hears explosion of gun in upper battery after must run for life can see exactly how thing be to be done sir if approve of plan will be starting at once with good leave for be already late will have none too much time for work be to be done be right young sir agreed bascomb time be so valuable now that dare waste more in further discussion therefore plan be excellent one must serve must must go in stead for appear to be already worn out with fatigue lack of sleep have be over ground already know therefore weary though may be fear that must need go so pick men sir a many a need remembering that party must be strong enough to carry powder up to fort procure from gunner that require get gone may god go with amen hour later longboat under dick command with stukely sitting in stern sheet beside be once more under way beating in toward land under press of sail while adventure with light out lay to in offing awaiting signal of explosion of ordnance in fort to fill away stand boldly in toward harbour so sorely be pressed for time dick dared not waste in attempt to elude observation by creeping in a on first occasion behind island of baru headed a straight a wind must allow for boca chica trusting that might be fortunate enough to slip through unobserved in darkness especially a be now past three o'clock in morning if sentinel slept at at post after warning to hold on alert might be supposed to have received from authority might be expected to be asleep now hope appeared to be justified for longboat slid past smaller battery down on beach unchallenged five minute later grounded on sand about quarter of mile farther in then silently a ghost men lowered sail leaving mast standing stepped out on sand bearing appointed load of powder upon shoulder while dick stukely with sword drawn former carrying coil of quick match wound round waist led way directed step southward toward battery have sailed past few minute earlier must just be distinguished a darker blur against blackness of night not light of description showed about building be there sound to be heard save soft lap splash of water on margin of beach to left of sough of land breeze among tree bush on right noiseless a drifting shadow party sped forward within five minute of landing arrived beneath wall of fort here dick stukely man named barker removed shoe walking to northward angle of fort examined to ascertain what mean of ascent afforded found a marwill have said that although wall be so smooth a to be quite unclimbable angle of building be set with quoin stone of so rough surface that ascent by mean of might be made easily accordingly stukely who by virtue of discovery of anaesthetic now claimed to take lead at once began to climb angle closely followed by dick barker in le than two minute trio have accomplished ascent found standing on platform constituted flat roof of battery eight piece of heavy ordnance muzzle projecting far over low parapet be easily distinguishable a be also great pile of shot notwithstanding darkness of night for moment sentinel be visible whispering companion to remain where be stukely moved away with noiseless tread swiftly making circuit of gun platform presently rejoined other two be all right whispered found rascal sound asleep even a captain did withdrawing stopper from vial allowed to inhale vapour for moment be now insensible will remain so for at least hour therefore may now do share of work barker come with will show where lie two moved away together barker uncoiling long length of fine line from waist a did so while dick leaning over parapet dropped small pebble down among group below a signal that be well might now safely make ascent without fear of detection arrangement having be previously made man of party knew exactly what have to do within five minute platform be alive with english seaman of whom be engaged in hauling up powder clay from below while others be employed in silently loading gun with heavy charge of powder upon top of tightly rammed down stiff clay with filled gun to very muzzle then when piece have be similarly treated whole be very carefully primed after length of quick match long enough to allow of safe retreat of man who must ignite be securely inserted among priming two insensible sentinel bound hand foot effectually gagged be lowered to ground entire party retreated a have come with exception of one man who volunteered to remain ignite length of match immediately that saw portfire burned from wall of castle stood on top of adjacent hill whole business have occupied scarcely twenty minute when be finished there be nothing to show that garrison have become aware of what be happening above head once more assembled on ground beneath wall of battery party be rapidly counted by dick to ascertain that be present save man left above on gun platform formality having be quickly gone through unconscious sentinel be picked up carried away to distance of about hundred yard from battery where be effectually concealed in thick clump of bush after englishman rapidly pushed forward up hill arrived near top dick halted for moment near clump of bamboo two long stout stalk of be quickly cut down without waiting to strip of leaf converted into light ladder by lashing cross piece of bamboo to then with improvised ladder carried by two men party resumed way arriving about quarter of hour later beneath frowning wall of castle like battery below be found to be in total darkness at least so far a face fronting be concerned crossed dry ditch without difficulty once on other side reared ladder against wall finding amply long enough for purpose here again stukely took lead being first to ascend ladder a reached top peered cautiously over parapet be disconcerted at discovery here at least sentinel did not sleep for first object that met gaze be man standing at extreme end of parapet apparently gazing steadfastly out to sea while crossed hand rested upon muzzle of grounded matchlock luckily for english man back be turned toward spot where stukely stood staring at in instant latter have made up mind what to do cautiously climbing in through embrasure before stole noiselessly toward unconscious man few breathless second stukely have crept close up behind intended victim next instant a knocked man hat off with one hand dealt with other blow on head with heavy butt of pistol felled unfortunate fellow a butcher fell ox quickly bending over prostrate body now held unstoppered vial to man nostril for three four second then rose cautiously to foot must see other sentinel posted anywhere on parapet passed quickly round in order to make quite sure then finding that only one sentinel have be posted here gave signal for rest of party to ascend few minute later scene of short while before be being re enacted on parapet of much more important structure worked silently with strenuous haste for although heaven a yet gave sign of approaching dawn sudden comparative coolness of atmosphere twitterings of few early morning bird told that must not now be very far off indeed have scarcely finished preparation when faint brightening of eastern horizon told that new day be at hand now be ready asked dick a personally put last finishing touch to preparation then down go except five men who be to help with firing of quick match go last phil when be down ignite portfire be to be signal to man in battery yonder five who be remaining with will see to rest of business up here now off go quickly for daylight will be upon in five minute dick watched friend a latter slid out through embrasure descended ladder when at length stukely reached ground be preparing to ignite portfire chichester sprang back among five men who be awaiting word whispered now instantly six darted to respective station man at once proceeded rapidly yet with nicest care to ignite five end of quick match be especial care be swiftly done lighting of whole occupying le than minute yet before last five be ignited still air be heavily charged with fume of gunpowder there be sound of hissing sizzling suggestive of whole army of angry snake smartly men smartly urged dick match be burning much more rapidly than anticipated if be not pretty lively will be caught by first explosion be sort will do parson stand there fiddling with match be burning right now lad away go over with go last thus exhorted stood not upon order of going went chichester bringing up rear latter be still in very act of descending ladder when six crashing explosion occurring almost simultaneously on parapet above shattered early morning stillness sound being instantly followed by great rush of wing outburst of startled scream issued from throat of affrighted bird in immediate neighbourhood of castle who thus rudely awakened dashed away in direction loudly proclaiming terror answering explosion almost instantly roared out from battery on beach then when dozen further explosion on parapet pealed out little party of precipitately retreating englishman heard heavy thud round a fragment of burst ordnance came showering to ground in between shattering report of bursting cannon be now almost continuous faintly caught sound of human outcry a astounded garrison awakened by report sprang from bed rushed hither thither in blind panic man demanding of other explanation of extraordinary happening be taking place overhead long before bravest of spaniard have summoned up courage enough to ascend to parapet ascertain for source of terrific report crashing blow be causing castle to tremble to very foundation last of englishman who happened to be dick have vanished over brow of hill be racing down steep slope toward spot where longboat have be left in hiding urging ahead of to redoubled effort lest spaniard rallying from first surprise panic must sally forth attempt to cut off fugitive disturbance be over in le than minute echo of last explosion died away along mangrove bordered shore thud of last falling piece of fractured ordnance a crashed through bough of tree have faintly reached ear of flying englishman bird be rapidly beginning to persuade that whole thing have be no more than peculiarly weird startling dream when whole party have be joined on way by man from lower battery reached boat pulled up for moment to listen recover breath there be sight sound of pursuit presently after dick have counted party found that be present perfectly sound order be given to get boat afloat shove off be done in perfectly quiet orderly manner five minute later with beam of rising sun brilliantly gilding sail little craft slid down harbour entrance on way to seaward passing close under wall of beach battery bewildered garrison of have by time summoned up courage necessary to enable to go up on gun platform to ascertain precisely what have happened most of be gazing earnestly out to seaward a longboat slid past consequently did not see until be too late when with loud outcry seized calivers poured hot absolutely ineffective fire after bold adventurer two minute later boat swept round low point form southern extremity of tierra bomba island then occupant saw what be that have so strongly attracted attention of spaniard for scarcely three mile away beheld adventure beating up toward boca chica under heavy press of canvas bascomb have seen interpreted aright explosion in two battery on tierra bomba be now fearlessly working ship in toward land knowing that gun in two battery having be destroyed there be now nothing to restrain from sailing right into cartagena demanding restoration of captain safe sound meant to do too chapter six how took great galleon vast treasure there be enthusiasm cheering nothing in nature of hysterical exultation displayed by crew of adventure when longboat ran alongside who have performed audacious feat of rendering two powerful battery innocuous rejoined shipmate everything be accepted a matter of course be fully realised by hand that deed be one successful accomplishment of required display of nerve courage of superlative character be understood that entire expedition from start to finish from departure from topsham to return thither demanded constant exhibition of same quality must receive therefore murmur two of approval satisfaction from bascomb when dick made report be be said in way of commendation now sir said master dismissing topic of disarmament of battery cartagena galleon be at mercy sooner that spaniard can be brought to understand better be like to be for general therefore will enter harbour forthwith lay galleon aboard take then open negotiation with authority for ransom of town deliverance of captain marwill mr chichester know more about harbour than of rest of must be duty therefore to pilot ship alongside galleon others will ask to go straight to fighting station prepare ship for battle after if there be time will take breakfast if not well must e'en fight fasting eat after galleon be taken so dick went up on poop stationing to windward conned ship a beat in toward boca chica against fast failing land breeze good ship a adventure be progress be exasperatingly slow a be that of ship of date when attempted to beat up against foul wind for form of hull cut of sail be at day favourable to manoeuvre ship be still good mile from harbour mouth when land breeze suddenly failed be left helplessly wallowing upon oily swell outside of course be exasperating enough for when deed of desperate emprise be toward be well to carry through before enthusiasm have time to cool must not be helped wind be dead ship must not be handled now until sea breeze sprang up after delay be not unmitigated misfortune for ensured to crew time enough to complete preparation for coming fight take breakfast afterward even at day be fully recognised that englishman fight best when hunger have be satisfied so finished work upon be engaged then went quietly to breakfast meal be able to dispose of comfortably before cry from deck apprised of arrival of sea breeze yes there came

defined point between land be gleaming glassy swell unruffled by even so much a cat paw boundary line divided breeze from calm be not stationary by mean on contrary be creeping nearer rapidly when bascomb came up on poop merely glanced at for moment then called to seaman to trim yard in readiness to meet by time that have be done line of demarcation be so near that musical tinkling of advancing

close men be instructed to lie down behind bulwark a sail by lest haply of be hit for make doubt that will discharge at piece have a pas say so returned bascomb then by lord harry will be beforehand with ho there load larboard broadside of ordnance great small train piece to sweep top of yonder battery a pas can not afford to risk loss of of number through mistaken sense of magnanimity with swelling sail distended by ever freshening sea breeze adventure now swept boldly in for mouth of boca chica presently curl of white water revealed presence of shoal of dick chichester have spoken right in middle of fairway dick directed helmsman to steer to north of between island of tierra bomba with swelling wood crowned height dick glanced aloft at castle crowned summit of southernmost hill although golden flag of spain flaunted insolently in breeze from flagstaff on northern turret not man be to be seen upon parapet many of embrasure one half of must now see have be destroyed by bursting of ordnance soon became clear that none of garrison intended to make effort to dispute passage of english ship whether garrison of battery down on beach must be le prudent still remained to be seen one thing be perfectly clear be that spanish soldiery be very busy upon gun platform movement being directed by tall man in full suit of black armour helmet of be surmounted by splendid plume of long crimson feather english however be not left long in doubt a to intention of individual who be doubtless commander of garrison for a ship swept along narrow channel hugging northern shore

patarero saker swivel came hurtling from battery across narrow water toward ship gallant cavalier have be just trifle too eager to display valour for most of missile fell short having be fired at rather too long range while hit be so nearly spent that only few of lodged in solid woodwork of ship bulwark not man on board be hit now men roared bascomb give yonder presumptuous fool lesson fire a gun come to bear not before want that parapet swept clean swept clean be english holding fire ship sweeping on in grim inexorable silence until be within two hundred foot of structure when larboard ordnance great small bellowed barked back answer a smoke drove away ahead before wind wall be seen to crumble into dust under impact of heavy iron shot while lighter missile mowed down soldier like corn beneath sickle until not man be left standing upon foot even magnifico in armour going down before hail of iron lead to say nothing of spanish standard staff of be cut clean in two so that toppled over fell carrying flag with to ground at base of wall so much for thicky exclaimed bascomb relapsing into broad devon for moment under influence of excitement if be that have long hot morning work before must anchor ship land party blow footy battery into air perhaps may have time to do when come back way now master load again time with double charge consisting of half keg of bullet to culverin with chain shot on top smaller ordnance in proportion will not fire again if can help until run alongside galleon not then until rub side with ship have by time traversed so much of boca that became necessary for to shift helm in order to avoid grounding upon sandspit stretched athwart course here advantage value of dick chichester previous observation became apparent for so sharp be bend so little be there to indicate existence of shoal that if dick have not previously have opportunity to note position ship must undoubtedly have driven right upon under full sail when must certainly have be in exceedingly awkward predicament might even have be lost presuming spaniard to have be courageous enough to attack while placed at so serious disadvantage be not allowed to get into such awkward situation for dick have noticed everything connected with danger of harbour while looking out watching from summit of hill on tierra bomba carried complete perfectly accurate chart of harbour in head in addition to one marwill have made together helm be therefore shifted at proper moment ship swerved away in south easterly direction making a though for middle of lower bay danger did not reveal until ship be actually slipping past in le than five minute be clear course be again altered time to north eastward where island of tierra bomba thrusting north easterly angle inward divided upper from lower bay narrowing passage between to width of le than mile now ship be fairly inside heading for part of harbour where dick remembered to have observed certain other danger in shape of rock shoal sign of must perceive from deck therefore mentioned matter to bascomb obtained that officer permission to go aloft to fore topsail yard con ship from there in fashion then adventure with red cross of saint george flying defiantly from main truck swept up cartagena harbour rounding eastern extremity of tierra bomba headed straight for inner roadstead where must now be seen among small forest of more insignificant mast towering spar of great galleon with vast crimson flag bearing coat of arm floating at main spanish flag drooping from ensign staff reared at stern town being built on low land lofty mast of galleon be at once seen upon english ship rounding point opening up city great cry of there be instantly leapt from english throat ay there be men returned bascomb ca make mistake about think in halt hour will be alongside rest of work will be for to do will tell plan men will range up alongside lay aboard just before side touch will pour broadside into throw grapnel hook on then dash aboard in midst of smoke drive crew below secret be to strike hard often keep on run if man attempt to stand though only for moment run through at once with pike be have to say men know how to do trick a well a with cartagena city galleon in plain view dick chichester work aloft be done therefore returned to deck spot upon from have previously be conning ship where resumed duty a pilot a adventure slid smoothly rapidly up harbour heading straight for galleon be seen that nearly twenty large boat full of armed men be pulling off to from shore be clear therefore that authority have received notice of approach of english possibly from one of officer in charge of defence on tierra bomba shrewdly guessing that one object at least of unwelcome visit be galleon be determined to defend to last discovery in nowise disconcerted sturdy lad of devon who have long ago learned to regard a invincible so far a spaniard be concerned so continued with utmost calmness to add here there refinement of finish to preparation have be completed hour more ago even ship cook whom nobody regarded a fighting man must need add little quota to general preparation same taking form of several gallon of greasy boiling water with have filled copper proposed to employ at such time a might seem to most suitable a for dick decided that handspike have used in fight off barbados have proved so effective regarded a weapon must scarcely be improved upon be on point of providing with when eye chanced to fall upon heavy iron bar have be brought on deck for purpose so having tested weight at once decided that be very thing needed appropriated accordingly adventure have arrived within about mile of galleon when latter opened fire with heavy ordnance of carried two tier whether be that spaniard designed to shoot away english ship mast so leave helpless unmanageable whether be that piece be badly aimed one of shot went humming high overhead leaving intruder to pas on unscathed in grim silence for not one of gun replied bascomb stepped forward to front of poop issued order let man of said take bow musket prepare to discharge volley upon deck of yonder galleon when give word then that done return to ordnance prepare to fire for time will be at hand sail trimmer stand by to let fly sheet halliard at word of command then be ready to heave grapnel a range up alongside english ship still conned by dick chichester be now steering course if persevered in must carry across stern of galleon at distance of about twice own length from vessel seemed evident from uncertain movement of on board spaniard that be considerably puzzled a to intention of english for having discharged whole of starboard broadside at approaching adventure crew of galleon first began with feverish haste to reload gun on side of ship then seeming suddenly to suspect that antagonist intended to lay aboard on inshore side left starboard broadside only half loaded precipitately dashed across deck to larboard broadside of ordnance began to clear away hurriedly with intention of loading adventure be at moment le than twice own length from galleon bascomb standing on poop be able to look down from there into crowded waist of other ship clearly see spaniard crowding together about larboard ordnance opportunity seemed much too good to be let so calling bowman musketeer up on to poop directed to discharge volley into surging mass of men did instantly with terribly destructive effect good exclaimed a saw twenty thirty spaniard fall writhing to deck now back to ordnance men be ready to fire when give word sail trimmer let fly sheet halliard stand by with grapnel a sailing master issued order dick signed to helmsman who thereupon thrust ponderous tiller hard down adventure answering helm perfectly swept round in short curve went gliding up on starboard side of galleon now gunner let fly ordnance roared bascomb drawing sword a bright blade flashed in air english artillery loaded with round bar chain shot musket ball spike nail kind of missile that men have be able to lay hand upon be discharged when two vessel be scarcely fathom apart spanish ship upper deck instantly became shamble scarcely man remaining uninjured upon throw grapnel shouted bascomb then let man follow aboard spaniard a spoke adventure crashed alongside galleon there be sound of ripping rending timber heavy rebound then a two ship rolled toward other after rebound english crew went swarming over own bulwark down upon spanish deck where found scarcely dozen men to oppose at head of stood very magnificent looking personage in full armour whom bascomb took to be captain of ship do surrender senor demanded bascomb speaking in english for very good reason that have spanish be probable that spaniard be a destitute of english a master william bascomb be of spanish there be language of intonation gesture a well a of word doubtless that of englishman be intelligible enough for spaniard by way of reply grasped sword by point offered to sturdy devonshire seaman who confronted who accepted with very fair imitation of bow with spaniard have tendered be well so far commented bascomb now looking about noticing dick standing near grasping iron bar end trouble up here what about down below mr chichester have better take dozen men gentleman down with perhaps will explain to of people who be on main deck that have surrendered if will lay down arm well good if wo well will just have to make 'em be now go report to here when have gained complete possession of ship dick took dozen men insinuating hand in crook of spanish captain arm led that individual below to main deck where found few spanish seaman still hanging about between great culverin apparently quite uncertain what to do whether ought to do anything spanish captain spoke sharply to apparently be very much surprised disappointed to find so few men there seemed to be asking where rest be for by way of reply seaman said something pointed to hatchway spanish captain relieved feeling by stamping on deck grinding teeth indulging in good deal of castilian profanity after seemed to give certain instruction result of be that men laid down arm went up on deck one of number having previously gone to main hatchway shouted something down caused remainder of crew to come up from below surrender weapon took dick party about hour to explore thoroughly interior of galleon discovered be named santa margaretta satisfy that none of spanish crew be lurking below in hiding when at length returned to upper deck to report found that bascomb winter have mustered surviving spaniard forward on fore deck under strong guard while english have lowered one of galleon boat in have boarded captured small coasting felucca be at moment towing alongside bigger prize bascomb explained have done with object of getting rid of spanish prisoner whom proposed to send ashore in felucca having fancy for keeping aboard prize where must need strong body of english to maintain efficient guard over with released prisoner proposed to send ashore letter to governor of city demanding immediate surrender of captain marwill safe sound together with payment of sum of five hundred thousand ducat ransom for city failure of condition to be followed by sack destruction of place objected dick can neither speak write spanish may very well be that there will be nobody in cartagena who understands english in case will be at deadlock how will manage then replied bascomb sententiously will be lookout if can not find anyone to translate letter so much worse for there must be trouble about for if can find nobody else captain will make meaning clear to be considerably past midday when at whole of spaniard together with dead wounded be transferred to felucca dispatched to shore spanish captain being entrusted with letter to governor commandant of town then english found time to look into own affair take meal be found that by marvellous stroke of good fortune galleon have be captured without loss of man even so much a single casualty on english side being case question arose whether not must retain possession of vessel dividing adventure crew equally between prize there arose sharp difference of opinion on point bascomb two gentleman adventurer maintaining that prize be far too valuable to be parted with destroyed now that have while winter dick contended that be far too few in number to justify proposed division effect of must be to put in possession of two perilously short handed ship instead of one fully manned moreover santa margaretta be nearly twice size of adventure proposal therefore to divide crew of latter into two equal part must hardly meet case since crew of forty men must handle galleon only in fine weather while a to fighting effectually in event of falling in with enemy simply must not be done winter proposal in dick backed up be that everything of value at least a much of a must find room for must be transferred to adventure after ransom of say twenty thousand ducat must be demanded for ship what remained of cargo failing payment of might be burnt at anchor a wholesome example dispute at length grew so warm that stukely who be present took part in suggested that matter must be left for captain marwill to decide upon return afternoon of day be busily spent by english one party of whom under joint leadership of carpenter boatswain devoted to task of repairing slight damage sustained by adventure in running aboard galleon while remainder engaged in work of thoroughly rummaging prize transferring from to adventure valuable must find at first fear be entertained that treasure be intended ship must take home have not yet be put on board for must be found nowhere at length sort of strong room be discovered cunningly built in run of ship entrance hidden by big pile of sail when be entered there sure enough lay treasure consisting of le than five hundred gold brick weighing forty pound two thousand bar of silver averaging about fifty pound chest of pearl value of be so great that made attempt even to estimate approximately small chest of uncut precious stone chiefly emerald ruby of must have sufficed to make man of rich for life whole of stupendous treasure at once proceeded to transfer to adventure so much of be there that working watch watch one watch mounting guard to render impossible anything in nature of surprise attack from shore while other watch carried treasure from one ship to other be long past midnight when at work be done weary men be permitted to snatch little rest authority ashore have be given until sunrise of following morning in to find someone capable of interpreting bascomb letter to come to decision a to whether not must accede to term of said letter first light of dawn revealed large boat putting off from shore pulled by twelve oarsman flying white flag at stern be first boat have attempted to approach of ship since appearance of adventure upon scene approach be watched with utmost interest curiosity carried three official in brilliant uniform four other individual in stern sheet be stukely keen eye be first to detect fact that captain be not in announcement of fact at once raised storm of indignation among who have hastily turned out gone on deck when approach of boat have be reported not in incredulously repeated bascomb not in then what plague do don mean by coming off to at surely made plain enough to that surrender of captain be very first article of demand then what nay nay let be interposed winter speaking quite calmly lip white eye glowing sombrely like smouldering fire need to work into passion will bascomb until thou hast heard what lordship have to say maybe have not seen captain know naught of not seen know naught of why why spluttered bascomb then suddenly calmed down be time for disputatiousness display of warm feeling between man who if haply anything have gone wrong with captain might become head of besides there be wisdom in suggestion to wait hear what don have to say before jumping to conclusion thus little group of englishman on high poop of adventure lapsed into sudden silence a boat drew near be silence be ominous menacing silence of set lip burning eye pregnant with dire possibility for city within if aught of evil have befallen captain therein for not only be marwill rough almost to uncouthness of manner though be at time beloved by there also there be feeling stirring in breast that be vitally important to one of that spaniard must be taught once for to regard englishman life a sacred matter what circumstance might be under might fall into hand however helpless friendless might at moment seem so be very grim visaged uncompromising looking group of englishman at whom newcomer stared upward when boat arrived within easy hailing distance lay upon oar elderly man attired in usual mariner costume of period rose in stern sheet of boat doffing cap opened conversation by remarking in english good morning gentleman be gaspar pacheco lately master of mariner now retired from sea be here to day to act part of interpreter between yourselves illustrious senor don luis maria alfonso calderon governor of city of cartagena don ricardo picador garcia alcalde of cartagena don hermoso morillo intendant don sebastian campana don ferdinand miguel pavia don ramon sylva merchant of cartagena a individual be named rose in stern sheet of boat bowed deeply seated again be instructed by illustrious fellow townsman to inform senor that although cartel be handed to governor immediately upon arrival of messenger in town yesterday be not until very late in day that anyone must be found possessed of sufficient knowledge of language to interpret only person possessed of such knowledge being who live not in cartagena in small hacienda few mile north of city then senor when have be found conveyed to cartagena have translated letter to authority difficulty at once arose for mention be therein made of one capitan marwill who be said to have entered city five day ago whose safe return demand now excellency governor don ricardo garcia alcalde have ever before heard of person a el capitan marwill indeed of other stranger being in city at once became necessary before anything else must be done that enquiry must be set on foot to ascertain whether such person have be seen so that whereabouts might be traced enquiry senor be at once instituted be still being actively pursued be regretfully obliged to confess thus far have be entirely without result meanwhile stop interrupted bascomb throwing up hand with imperative gesture do mean to tell that be possible for stranger that stranger englishman to be four day five night in city without anyone being wiser interpreter shrugged shoulder spread hand abroad deprecatingly must greatly depend upon skill courage resourcefulness of stranger senor answered if capitan marwill speaks spanish fluently posse knowledge of how to look act like spaniard be quite possible that might do so objected bascomb must not well have be in city yesterday have remained in ignorance of what be happening know well enough to feel certain be alive in good health free must have rejoined ship ere now that have not done so be evidence conclusive convincing to that something untoward have happened to for will hold entire population of city individually collectively responsible now continued turning addressing companion on deck be speaking plainly enough for even spaniard to understand be since captain marwill safety well being must be first consideration think ought not to make condition so hard a to be impossible of fulfilment therefore propose that allow little more time in to find before proceed to extremity let make clear to that must be found delivered up to safe sound within certain time say noon to day failure to comply with demand will be followed by bombardment sack of town what say gentles agreed came answer a with one voice from present very well then concluded bascomb turning toward boat hailed now listen to senor interpreter mark well word have come to ear of english that spaniard of new world in selfish determination to retain in own hand whole of trade of rich country be making practice of seizing englishman upon whom can lay hand delivering over to so called holy inquisition in order that while salving own conscience with plea of religious zeal countryman may be subjected to fiendish torture so be discouraged from attempting to secure share of immeasurable wealth enjoy now time have come when mind must be disabused of notion amount of torture can possibly inflict upon solitary helpless englishman will deter fellow countryman from striving by fair mean foul to secure share of what be a much entitled to a yourselves will never rest until have obtained mark that further remember henceforward for englishman who be lost on shore be found to have perished under hand of inquisitor english will take terrible vengeance exacting life of ten of most distinguished spaniard upon whom can lay hand now captain be somewhere in city at moment for own sake must be found brought on board ship before noon when be done will talk further with if by noon be not found delivered up to then say to that will first bombard town afterwards sack destroy a lesson to spaniard to beware henceforward how meddle with englishman even when seem to be absolutely at mercy now translate that to illustrious senor companion interpreter did so a proceeded varied emotion of indignation horror fear be evoked by bascomb plain speaking be easily enough discernible upon countenance of audience flushed turned pale by turn wrung hand once excellency governor started to foot shook fist savagely at little group on adventure poop be instantly dragged down again by comrade who evidently feared english more than did when at interpreter have finished governor burst into torrent of apparently violent language seemed to wish interpreter to translate to englishman others interposed with what appeared to be emphatic veto be followed by somewhat lengthy very animated discussion among during boat be kept in place by occasional stroke of oar at length resolution of sort seemed to be arrived at for alcalde be seen to speak earnestly to interpreter who presently rose to foot hailed illustrious senor said be desired by don ricardo garcia respected alcalde to say that possible effort will be made to find missing capitan when found will at once be restored to senor time have allowed be much too brief for effective search to be made did not say that search be begun yesterday be still being actively prosecuted interrupted bascomb even so illustrious general answered interpreter very well then retorted master if be in city be alive well will be found before noon if be not found then will be because evil have befallen for cartagena will be made to suffer look in inquisition for senor be a likely to be there a anywhere tell inquisitor that if be not forthcoming by noon inquisition will be first building to suffer from shot now go so went with much shaking of head wringing of hand chapter seven how set out to rescue captain marwill failed morning be passed strenuously by english in preparing adventure prize for grim business of bombarding cartagena if need be hope in man heart being that spectacle of preparation be clearly visible from water front of town must have effect of breaking down stubborn will of spaniard constraining to surrender prisoner for up to moment there have never be real doubt in mind of one of englishman that marwill have be discovered made prisoner be steadfastly resolved to secure freedom let cost be what must after carefully considering discussing matter together bascomb winter arrived at conclusion that must be possible to effect division of crew a must enable ship to employ whole of heaviest ordnance against town be accordingly done adventure being afterward moved to berth astern of galleon so that ship must obstruct fire of other wanted about quarter of hour of noon preparation aboard ship be complete when boat have visited in morning be observed to be putting out again from wharf pulling toward adventure be soon perceived that on occasion carried only one figure be presently seen to be that of interpreter captain be not there exclaimed bascomb when be recognised now what plague do mean by sending off boat without be going to beg for more time wonder if so why for will never believe that know where be be determined to exhaust artifice subterfuge in endeavour to avoid giving up others said nothing for what be use of hazarding conjecture when must soon know for certain so held tongue watched approach of boat with gloomy louring glance be disappointed in savage dangerous mood ready to plunge at word into desperate enterprise boat ranged up alongside oarsman rested upon oar a before hallo boat ahoy hailed bascomb what doe mean senor why have not brought off captain be people ashore aware that within five minute bombardment of town will begin ala most illustrious senor answered interpreter unless must prove fortunate enough to be successful in mission have be entrusted to that of pleading with excellency for further extension of time upon what ground senor demanded bascomb have already granted extension of six hour without result must appear why must grant moment because excellency be now believed that clue to whereabouts of capitan have at last be found be hoped that in course of hour two freedom may be obtained answered interpreter ah returned bascomb with sigh of relief so captain have be found at last have where be thought to be in inquisition senor answered interpreter inquisition interrupted bascomb odds bodikins did say so how long have be there friend if clue have be obtained prof to be true one capitan will have be there close upon four day be reply man whom believe to be be noticed in small posada four evening ago landlord of house be of opinion that someone must have suspected informed upon for during evening four familiar of inquisition called at house in spite of violent resistance took carried away did did retorted bascomb if can lay hand upon four familiar will make wish hand have withered rather than that have laid upon englishman there seems to be good deal of uncertainty even now about story of yours senor interpreter think best plan will be to take up investigate matter ourselves what say gentles four day why will have have time to maim man for life in four day if have well what say ye master will take strong party of men go ashore make way to inquisition see for whether not captain marwill be there if be there have mi used will be able to take vengeance upon evildoer instead of punishing lot of innocent men woman by knocking home about ear say that ought to do a propose without moment unnecessary delay replied winter too answered of others present then will be done answered bascomb determinedly proposal mr winter be that make equal division of force one half under leadership to go ashore look for captain while other half under remains aboard adventure to take care of prize be that agreeable to worship yes answered winter be a good plan a be like to devise even though be to cogitate for rest of day be true must have preferred to lead landing party since if aught must happen to will be left without navigator nay that need not be answered bascomb for will leave young chichester with can be navigator have be apt pupil now know a much about navigation a do so difficulty be soon overcome hallo boat ahoy continued directing conversation once more to interpreter come aboard senor will will require service anon have word most illustrious that evil will befall if put into hand asked man have answered bascomb may trust to without fear indeed be like to be great deal more safe with than elsewhere during next few hour be enough returned interpreter signed to boatman to put alongside climbing to deck stepping in through gangway without fear when have done so now then senor pacheco said bascomb when spaniard peering about curiously have joined party on poop be about to land party march to inquisition in order may ascertain for whether not captain be within wall whereabout be place can be seen from here nay most illustrious can not for lie at back northern extremity of western half of town answered pacheco lie in direction of western tower of cathedral far beyond um m commented bascomb then after there must not have be much chance of reaching with gun be strong place will find very difficult to force way in have never be inside saint be praised so can not tell very much about answered pacheco so far a building be concerned be strong place being built entirely of stone with high wall be said to be nowhere le than three foot thick main entrance be guarded only by pair of oaken door massive doubt probably fastened only with bolt of ordinary strength for who must ever dream of attempting to break into inquisition heaven forgive for affording information to heretical english muttered under breath in native tongue indeed if in fury must tear place down for one must not be sorry be there many troop in town demanded bascomb about hundred illustrious senor answered pacheco five hundred be on way down from interior having be intended to send home in galleon have not heard that have yet arrived if have arrived do think must have heard of demanded bascomb might senor on other hand might not answered pacheco if have arrived marched into town openly doubtless other inhabitant of cartagena must have be aware of fact senor question have given rise to doubt in mind be now wondering whether in view of presence in harbour threat to bombard town excellency governor may not have taken step to have expected troop intercepted introduced into town secretly during dead of night if be to ask advice senor must recommend not to trust overmuch to fact have heard nothing of arrival of soldier see here sirrah ejaculated bascomb suddenly rounding upon man be extraordinarily free glib with information now be traitor to own people be information false intended to mislead senor on honour a spaniard answered pacheco fact be continued in explanation have seen much of english during business a seafarer have learned to like in spite of overbearing way fact that be heretic moreover senor be about to attack inquisition good catholic though be must not grieve be to take give to flame for like not be truth saint forgive now gentles said bascomb have heard what senor pacheco have said about troop if be truth a doubt not be behoves to be careful how thrust nose into city of cartagena yonder yet go must will for be not to be thought of captain may be in accursed inquisition perhaps suffering torment unimaginable doing nothing to help therefore in view of possibility of troop having arrived having be secreted somewhere in town think must modify plan little to extent be to say of making landing party a strong a can at expense of party remaining behind now mr winter what be smallest number of men that must care to be left with if be to defend ship successfully in event of possible attack said winter must have at least twenty men can not do with le leave twenty may take rest even including young chichester who be like to be great deal more useful ashore than must be with very well agreed bascomb twenty be can scarce do with le for be more than likely that while be busy ashore will endeavour to recover possession of treasure now senor pacheco will need a guide to show shortest way to inquisition art willing to do that service be most illustrious answered pacheco with favour senor must be under at least seeming compulsion for if be known that did thing save under fear of instant death must never again be able to show face in cartagena therefore most valiant englishman if be to lead must be with hand bound pistol held to head very well answered bascomb will manage for thee old sea horse a natural a life so that nobody seeing thee being driven along at head of will guess that thou'rt quaking in thy shoe at step thou takest take charge of dick be to be thy prisoner remember bind hand behind so firmly that can not get away just tightly enough to leave mark put halter round neck hold end of in thy hand threaten with thy drawn pistol at street corner now gentles to preparation man of shore party will go armed with hanger on hip pair of loaded pistol in belt good bow in hand quiver full of arrow slung over shoulder muster on main deck twenty minute hence pinnace with interpreter boat ought to be sufficient to carry from ship to wharf first half dozen men who be ready slid down ship side into interpreter boat so swiftly silently that took astonished crew completely by surprise held in subjection until rest be ready then senor pacheco slung in noose be lowered down ship side roughly ordered into stern sheet by dick who followed there kept in apparent awe with drawn pistol within twenty minute be ready embarked in two boat pinnace having be lowered in interim when pushed off from adventure attenuated crew of bade godspeed with hearty cheer headed up harbour toward north western half of town distance have to pull in order to reach wharf indicated by pacheco be about three quarter of mile a neared landing place perceived that good many people have gathered be watching curiously of soldier there be not one to be seen bascomb confessed regarded a rather bad sign a absence of visible inclination to resist landing seemed to to point to preparation of trap somewhere on road asked pacheco what thought about god forgive know not what to think most illustrious answered that worthy like not for think with that governor must never permit to land unresisted have not prepared warm reception for at point where will be at even greater disadvantage than must be on wharf yet know how must be either for have have mean of learning destination so how must know where to set trap lest must have guessed will lead by le direct way for there be two road by be possible to reach inquisition a boat ranged up alongside wharf englishman mounted formed up on quay mob consisted of about two hundred wharf labourer with small sprinkling of half breed woman fifty sixty boy gave back sullenly scowlingly with few low muttered threat occasional hissing gibe of hereticos there be attempt at violence except when dozen boy began to throw stone stringing of englishman bow fitting of few arrow to string sent mischievous young urchin to right about in double quick time within minute landing have be accomplished march begun pacheco with hand lashed behind halter round neck end of be in dick hand led way marching between chichester stukely latter having come ashore in bascomb boat bringing case of instrument pocket case of drug with road lay for short distance along water front have not be marching two minute before came to wide busy street seemed to run right through very heart of town to farther end remarked pacheco be direct road to inquisition be for excellency to decide whether will choose whether will go on take longer narrower road to same place road do recommend senor demanded bascomb nay most illustrious be not for to recommend either answered spaniard responsibility be far too great for for if disaster be to overtake after have accepted advice must be blamed for can only repeat what have already said that be direct road to inquisition road authority will naturally expect to take if have suspicion a to destination then in case decided bascomb will take other one forward march be thereupon resumed little band of englishman being followed at respectful distance by rapidly increasing mob seemed from appearance to be composed of ruffian cut throat of city did not offer to molest invader beyond occasionally shouting insulting epithet at of english took notice mob seemed simply to follow out of curiosity possibly with hope of witnessing interesting development later on quarter of mile farther on came to street not nearly so wide a first street of lofty more le dilapidated house with narrow cage like balcony before upstairs window small cellar of shop on ground floor street be paved with rough cobble stone sloped from side toward centre through ran kennel gutter encumbered with garbage filth of description through foul stream of evil smelling water wound devious way street have apparently at one time be one of pretension have now fallen upon evil day become abode of number of petty tradesman such a cobbler seller of fruit cheap drink dealer in second hand good of description riffraff generally swarmed with dirty slatternly woman still dirtier half naked child lean hungry looking dog lazy hulking men with brass ear ring in ear rag of tawdry finery upon body sash perfect battery of murderous looking knife be villainous scowling criminal looking lot of ruffian without exception low murmur of anger astonishment not unmingled with dismay passed from one to when english suddenly wheeled into street gradually seemed to acquire courage however a noted small number of intruder fact that latter took notice of presently when mob have followed english from wharf swung into street began to explain in response to question with be eagerly plied many of tenant frequenter of calle de santa catalina joined procession by time numbered three four hundred completely blocked up narrow street in rear of english be becoming ugly dangerous looking crowd too kind of mob whose courage grows with consciousness of increasing superiority in number now began to flaunt fearlessness before admiring woman folk by joining vociferously in insulting epithet be now being raucously yelled after little band of stranger situation be becoming distinctly threatening bascomb quietly dropped to rear for be in direction that trouble seemed to loom largest have just joined rearmost file when one boastful ruffian egged on by rest suddenly ran out in front of crowd whipping long murderous looking knife from sash hurled with deadly aim at luckily for master caught movement out of corner of eye wheeled round just in time to parry flying missile with blade of sword halt cried extend yourselves across street facing outward at same instant whipped pistol from belt levelled fired at aggressor who flung up hand with shriek fell prostrate in gutter with blood rapidly dyeing purple dirty white of shirt howl of execration dismay from spaniard immediately followed act of retaliation knife be whipped from sheath for instant looked a though mob be about to charge business like promptitude with english fitted arrow to bow drew latter quelled courage of assailant for moment who contented by yelling execration a lifted injured man carried into nearest house then satisfied with effect of demonstration english resumed march mob continued to hang tenaciously upon skirt like pack of hungry wolf became moment increasingly evident that must need little encouragement to induce to attack in deadly earnest in fashion english proceeded for nearly mile when perceived what appeared to be square opening out before moment later a debouched into saw that square be full of soldier cavalry infantry back for life into street will stand better chance there yelled stukely halting facing little band who followed be too late street behind have in unaccountable fashion also filled with soldier retreat of english be cut off be trapped a neatly effectually a enemy must

returned dick releasing grasp upon halter round spaniard neck go save while be possible one of own countryman will doubtless free hand have time to do go thanks senor may blessed mother saint protect bending forward went at run with hand still bound behind toward soldier who seeing that be apparently escaped prisoner opened out allowed to pas through rank at moment officer wearing full suit of plate armour mounted on horseback advanced lifting visor of helmet demanded in fairly good english where be officer in command of force here answered bascomb pushing way to front spaniard bowed then indicating with wave of hand troop present must have numbered eight hundred at least said with smile senor do need further argument than to convince of desirability of surrendering at discretion buena querra demanded bascomb who have picked up phrase two of spanish during conversation with marwill certainly senor if a presume to be case hold commission from queen hold such commission senor answered bascomb who began to realise that follower be in very tight place hold such commission eh then be one to assume that be merely band of ordinary commonplace pirate eh demanded officer be at liberty to assume what please retorted bascomb repeat hold commission authority save be conferred by own sword surrender buena querra not at surrender at discretion not at senor pirate be to be be rejoinder not at then answered bascomb will fight to death rather than surrender to perish in hellish inquisition spaniard bowed closed visor of helmet reined horse back very slowly until have returned to place at head of regiment of cavalry commanded while bascomb turning to follower shouted now dog of devon show cowardly spaniard bit of quality look to troop horse foot that have brought against eight hundred

twice a many again wo save from heavy ordnance of galleon adventure hour bombardment will make 'em glad enough to come to term wi ' now one half of charge back along down street other half will follow retiring backward facing enemy now have at heart for here come clear way with arrow first then give cold steel while bascomb have be delivering pithy address officer in armour have also be haranguing troop with much gesticulation sword nourishing have wound up with command to charge leading attack upon little band of english seaman wedged so to speak in throat of narrow street at bascomb word to have at half nearest street faced quickly about whole party fitted arrow to bow drew to head let fly half of arrow winging way to rake narrow street while other half whistled into rank of soldier in square who have just put spur to horse range be short aim deadly consequently arrow found mark of indeed twice over for there be at least dozen of cloth yard shaft passed clean through body of first victim to find lodgment in body of second a for dick distinguished by sending arrow neatly between bar of visor of officer on horseback who thereupon reeled out of saddle crashed down upon cobbled pavement of square with rattle like of whole cartload of spilled ironmongery close to chichester foot who thereupon dashed nimbly in snatched up splendid sword flew from fallen warrior grasp twenty soldier fell to that first discharge so great be dismay occasioned by fall that comrade instead of continuing charge riding englishman down a might easily have done reined horse sharply back upon haunch with result that comrade in rear dashed headlong into in instant whole of part of square abutted upon street became confused medley of plunging squealing fallen horse dead wounded men meanwhile other front of english have be equally successful first discharge of arrow having be so deadly that soldier drawn up across end of street to cut off retreat have simply crumpled up withered away leaving street open for retirement of english latter have accordingly availed of opportunity to dash in a fondly believed secure protection for flank although soldier have given way before terrible discharge of arrow be by mean beaten presently officer succeeded in rallying about twenty whom drew across street in double rank with matchlock unslung bascomb however be quick to see danger let bring ordnance into use will be up with shouted keep 'em moving lad keep moving so long a doe that be so good a be better once let bring firearm into play be done so keep 'em moving set example by rushing upon enemy sword in hand laying about so shrewdly that spanish line be once more broken forced into full retreat indeed what must heavily accoutred spanish soldier tightly strapped up in suffocatingly hot uniform do against nimble english who for most part fought in shirt breech shoe only whose arrow flew with such irresistible force that pierced right through man body flesh muscle bone who seemed to be governed by law of fighting instead of observing nicety rule punctilio of fence simply rushed in cut man down before poor wretch must guess what must be at for ten minute fight raged with unimaginable fury before single englishman be hit then one poor fellow dropped with long knife quivering in skull flung from upper window of one of house man who did dastardly deed be seen to withdraw hurriedly from window be enough dozen of fallen man comrade instantly dashed into house be gone about minute then returned with perfectly satisfied look upon face once more plunged into melee more knife be thrown from house unfortunately deed not swift retribution followed have be seen thought worthy of imitation within five minute there be scarcely window within range of fighting be not vomiting missile of one sort with disastrous effect upon english who under new form of attack began to fall thick fast for now that populace have support of several hundred soldier courage became so reckless that must no longer restrain accordingly engaged in attack upon english with avidity from comparatively safe position of upstairs window of house on side of street stukely dick be with rearguard making vigorous successful stand against attack of soldiery when new feature in fighting be introduced knew nothing about until great stone hurled from attic window of house in front of be fighting crashed down fair upon young chichester head sent reeling senseless to ground chapter eight how phil dick escaped from cartagena when dick recovered consciousness be evening street be quiet be lying upon couch in darkened room with philip stukely elderly woman bending over woman holding basin of warm water while stukely assiduously bathed ugly scalp wound on crown of head said head be throbbing aching most atrociously when young man sat up attempted to rise to foot discovered to astonishment chagrin that have control over room seemed to be whirling spinning round with at bewildering speed leg immediately collapsed under now then none of youngster exclaimed stukely a flung arm round chichester gently lowered lad back on couch what plague induced to start up like of sudden before be ready for will just have to lie still young man until tell that may move how do feel now that have seen fit to at last come to sens how do feel reiterated dick trying to pas hand over forehead failing for member seemed heavier than lead why seem to have more strength than baby head be nothing one big atrocious ache seem to be able to remember thing very well for instance in least know where be how got here who be ah lady phil worry about lady youngster be right proved to be friend just when badly needed one answered stukely important thing just now be to find out precisely what be matter with so have goodness to answer question a clearly a possible will ye while stukely be closely questioning patient opportunity may be taken to explain in very few word how two friend came to find where be a have already be stated be fighting among party who be defending rear during retreat of english back along street by have come when dick be felled to ground by great stone hurled from top story of one of house opposite be at moment engaged stukely who be fighting behind heard crash of stone on dick head saw lad reel fall instantly stooped to raise to foot again dick chichester be light weight for man like stukely to lift unaided before must be done whole fight seemed to sweep right over stukely be knocked down trodden under foot men locked together in grip of deadly strife reeled staggered stumbled over finally received kick in temple so nearly robbed of sens that be only very vaguely conscious of what be happening during next minute two next thing of be fully aware being that be being held by shoulder dragged along over uneven ground then became suddenly conscious of being inside building of hearing door closed barred finally of finding sitting upon floor of room where dick now be with old lady supporting head on knee while young woman endeavoured to pour aguardiente down throat then fully recovered sens to find to great joy dick also have be rescued be then lying senseless on couch in same room then somehow young woman have disappeared rising to foot have devoted to task of wooing back dick chichester sens however have proved far more difficult task than have at first anticipated be not until golden quality of light streaming in through closed jalousie proclaimed near approach of sunset dick manifested indication of returning consciousness with result already recorded now protracted careful examination of wound coupled with much questioning of patient convinced stukely that friend dick have sustained very serious injury to head have so far affected brain that must be several day at least before young man must possibly be moved meanwhile what be happening to ship rest of crew be question must not be answered just then for old lady who for mysterious reason have chosen to play part of good samaritan must not speak word of english while stukely spoke spanish a for venturing outside house in quest of information be obviously impossible for two excellent reason first being that dick condition be such that must not possibly be left even for so short time a hour while other equally good reason be that to venture into street must be to invite immediate assassination well stukely told matter must not be helped dick be victim of circumstance there be nothing for to submit with best grace possible so far a future be concerned that must take care of sufficient unto day be anxiety thereof so with elderly dame assistance devoted to task of doing what must to relieve help dick philosophically leaving future to take care of presently became too dark to see old lady went to door of room called two female voice replied few minute later two young woman entered one bearing lighted oil lamp while other carried tray upon be set out bowl of soup dish containing roast rib of kid head of young indian corn boiled loaf of bread flask of wine viand be placed upon table together with lamp young woman retired again after indicating by sign that food be intended for two englishman dick hurt proved to be very much more serious than be at first supposed became delirious for whole week phil be kept busy night day constantly attending to watch being shared by old lady two daughter who proved extraordinarily kind solicitous then patient began to mend slowly young woman who proved to be twin named respectively clara dolores did best to beguile time for two guest by teaching spanish remarkably efficient teacher proved to be too pupil making enough progress within next three week to enable to gather tolerably correct general idea of what be said to thus little by little by dint of frequent reiteration accompanied by much laughter many blush on part of fair instructress two young englishman learned that owed life to compassion of senorita clara dolores who watching fight from window have be so greatly impressed by gallant bearing of dick phil when two be seen to go down in melee girl moved by common impulse have dashed out of house moment that favourable opportunity have presented have dragged apparently inanimate body indoors unnoticed in prevailing confusion also learned that according to common report eight ten survivor of ill advised landing party have succeeded in fighting way back to ship have thereupon got under way sailed out of harbour leaving santa margaretta ablaze from stem to stern thus time went on until dick phil have be secreted in cartagena nearly six week by time former be so nearly approaching convalescence that pair have begun to discus seriously question of future then one night about nine o'clock two girl who have be out taking air upon alameda came rushing home in consternation with news that somebody have somehow acquired inkling of fact that be harbouring two englishman in house that soldier might be expected to arrive at moment to take whole party prisoner a girl breathlessly explained if englishman got away at once a must for own sake harm need be expected to befall hostess a must then appear that enemy have be spreading false malicious report two young englishman hardly liked idea of going off leaving kind entertainer to bear unaided brunt of strict severe cross examination be obviously only thing to be done for must be far worse for family if hated ingleses be actually found in house than if recent presence there be only suspected therefore agreed to go at once since have belonging to pack be ready to depart upon instant girl who be bitterly distressed at idea of so sudden unceremonious leave taking must not let leave house alone to take chance of finding way unmolested down to harbour insisted upon accompanying guiding by least frequented way did following number of narrow winding deserted lane alley at length brought out upon wharf where have landed on ill fated day when have attempted rescue of captain marwill here after long lingering tearful parting on part of girl two young men eventually found alone about half past ten o'clock at night by hour wharf be deserted save for now whole thing have be so hurried girl have have so much to say during journey from house to wharf that two friend have be quite unable to form anything in nature of plan even now be not wise to linger on wharf discussing question of what must do for city guard watchman might come along at moment surprise therefore hastily surveyed such boat canoe a be moored to wharf chose first useful looking craft came to jumped into cut painter pushed off down harbour on way to island of tierra bomba dick decided have better be first halting place night be fortunately fine with high spacious sky of indigo star studded flecked with few thin fleecy cloud driving up solemnly out of eastward moon in second quarter sailing high overhead affording light that needed with perhaps little to spare boat have appropriated be very good craft of kind about fifteen foot long very willow beamy equipped with pair of oar tiller rudder mast sail latter be especially thankful for a journey before be one of about seven mile a soon a be fairly clear of town have reached point at must bear away far enough to southward to permit of setting sail stepped mast unfurled canvas went buzzing merrily down harbour passing on way hulk of santa margaretta have be burnt to water edge before flame must be extinguished destination be creek in eastern shore of tierra bomba in longboat have lain hidden when dick marwill have reconnoitred town together reached about midnight secreted boat beneath well remembered bush then composed to sleep a well a must in stern sheet sun be full hour above horizon when beam piercing thick canopy of foliage overhung place of concealment awakened two fugitive who arose from hard couch refreshed hungry plunge into willow water of creek washed lingering remains of sleep out of eye further refreshed when having allowed body to dry in brisk warm breeze dressed scrambled ashore to hunt for food of obtained without difficulty a much a required for tierra bomba be at time densely overgrown with tree bush of various kind among several fruit bearing variety flourished wild particularly plantain banana upon then satisfied hunger at same time taking precaution to secure bunch of sufficiently generous dimension to meet need for several day to come then immediate want satisfied retreated to place of concealment seating in boat proceeded to discus plan for future information respecting doings of adventure communicated to by fair friend senorita clara dolores left little doubt in mind that crew thoroughly discouraged at disastrous result of adventure in cartagena have decided to rest satisfied with treasure have already acquired indeed be considerable enough to satisfy most reasonable people have sailed direct for england upon quitting harbour too hastily concluding perhaps that missing be dead if not dead at least captive beyond hope of deliverance assumption seemed to stukely chichester to be only one at must reasonably arrive since acceptance shut out from hope of ever again seeing adventure being able to rejoin question naturally arose in mind be what be to do now be dick who first put question into word by way of reply stukely put question why did come here at well retorted plain matter of fact dick because must help suppose very well agreed stukely will concede that if like came because must not help ourselves because in other word after be picked up by adventure opportunity occurred to land again therefore have choice to remain in ship why did consent to become member of crew why in hope of making fortune of course returned dick did so too must have done so rather if thicky stone have not cracked skull for precisely agreed stukely if skull have not be cracked if have contrived to get back to ship a of others appear to have done be just little ifs dear dick rule destiny of men if other thing have have not happened everything must have be very different now for own part be great believer in destiny believe that there be such thing a accident chance that what usually call by one other of name be ordered by what men call fate what prefer to call providence will not attempt to argue matter out with just now will simply content with assertion that be destined to be left behind if ask for what purpose reply that know can not even guess have doubt that will be revealed in due time if theory be correct providence be indeed interfering in affair may do a will will be guided governed in spite of ourselves until have accomplished work be destined to do being case let leave in hand of destiny to do a will with watching for such right impulse a may impart to following implicitly under belief conviction that be guiding now why did come to golden west be not to make fortune to acquire share of wealth with land teems of course be since be here can not get away say let push into interior see if can not find for of gold gem with soil be said to abound there must be score nay hundred of undiscovered mine in lonely fastness to man have thus far penetrated can see reason why must not find one of now what say simply that agree with word have said phil be quite ready to go to world end with answered dick now when do start way do go well returned stukely first business be to get safely away from cartagena sooner better for be evident that authority have somehow obtained inkling of fact that two englishman belonging to band who have wrought so much damage have be lurking hidden in city if estimate of spanish character be correct believe will take good deal of trouble to find if find may rest assured that will clap into inquisition by hook by crook therefore say let get away to night immediately after dark so that may have chance to put a many mile a possible between ourselves cartagena before daylight then a to way must go interior be where be bound for interior lie to southward therefore when get out to sea let steer south enter first river of importance that happen to come to knowing that river lead to interior agreed exclaimed dick will leave here a soon a darkness be deep enough to conceal movement will begin voyage by slipping across bay going out to sea by way of channel at back of island of baru by mean will reach open sea twenty five mile south of cartagena so avoid risk of being seen informed upon by of local fishing boat must have one of mr bascomb chart with a have must e'en do without trust to memory have recollection of having seen river of importance marked on chart not very far south of if hug shore pretty closely can scarcely fail to find matter settled proceeded to take stock of possession totalled a follows pair of pistol lock of have fortunately be fitted with new flint immediately before disastrous attempt to force way to inquisition at cartagena two powder horn full of powder thirty bullet together with considerable quantity of greased rag to serve a wadding good serviceable hanger last not least splendid sword dick have taken from spanish cavalier during fight in square clothes stood up in boat in have made escape be that possessed in world thus scantily provided two young men be calmly about to plunge into very heart of hostile country of knew nothing in search of fortune truly be said of men contemporary that feared god naught else be who laid foundation of greatness among nation of world britain enjoys to day may have wisdom to retain day two fugitive lay in place of concealment resting otherwise preparing for wakeful busy night when at sun plunged down into western sea in transient blaze of glory sea breeze began to die away cautiously pushed out from underneath leafy screen proceeded to paddle quietly down little cove toward south bay reached just a last of daylight be fading out of sky star be beginning to twinkle out one after other in swift succession in great purple dome of heaven above evanescent twilight now shrouded everything in mystery few boat must be seen moving about here there only by lingering golden light in western sky reflected gleamingly from ripple of bow paddle fugitive passed across bay entered narrow channel between island of baru main just a first soft breathing of land wind began to make felt to gladly spread sail for paddling be rather too warm work to be agreeable went gliding easily pleasantly along closely hugging weather shore for sake of smooth water deep shadow afforded by mangrove thickly lined beach have reached thus along shore for about hour half when sudden brightening of sky to eastward heralded rising of moon presently orb now nearly at full sailed up over top of tree lined shore flooded entire scene with soft orange radiance first thing upon eye of fugitive fell be large galley lying at anchor right in middle of fairway scarcely mile ahead there be light visible on board frequent flash of moonlight upon polished steel showed that someone at least probably sentinel be moving presumably on watch on board now arose question what be to be done must stand boldly on take risk of being challenged must run boat ashore take to wood everything depended upon question of what be galley business just there of place in world did not take englishman long to make up mind that in probability have be stationed there to keep lookout for a passage out at back of baru be so obviously one must be most likely to be taken by people anxious to escape from cartagena by water if be case must not possibly hope to slip past craft unchallenged for moon be moment soaring higher into sky more clearly lighting up scene especially surface of water if be challenged refusing to reply attempted to escape what hope of success have absolutely none therefore put down helm hove boat about headed in for land if doubt remained in mind a to character intention of galley be speedily dissipated for have scarcely got boat round upon other tack when musket be discharged on board craft hail be faintly heard pealing across water from two minute later ruddy flash succeeded by puff of smoke leapt from forecastle followed second two later by splash of heavy shot in water dozen yard so astern of boat five breathless minute followed for fugitive then whole forest of oar suddenly sprang from galley side plunged into water be under way heading straight after boat will do dick think demanded stukely a peered anxiously under foot of sail yes answered dick if wind hold blow good breeze blow murmured began to whistle softly suddenly sat more upright in boat gazed eagerly ahead look ahead along past weather bow phil said be sight deceiving do see number of water channel running into land there to look a though there be indentation of sort like well like mouth of river choked with island away ahead of if so be saved for will be strange indeed if can not dodge galley among island even if can get in among added for unless be very greatly mistaken water shoal close inshore of do notice how smooth be do said stukely humbly hope may not be too shoal for a well a for galley right fire away continued apostrophising galley fire away waste powder will have to shoot good deal better than to hit for people in galley be loading firing in feverish haste evidently anxious to hit boat before must reach shelter of island now le than quarter of mile ahead presently boat shot into belt of smooth water that dick keen eye have detected phil seized paddle plunged over side to withdraw moment later inspect by light of moon four foot of water with quantity of soft black mud under announced if thicky galley keep a be going for five minute dick will be stuck so hard fast in same mud that will have something else to think about than chasing ah a boat luffed round small mangrove covered island galley be shut out from view there go last chance of hitting with footy ordnance with murrain on fugitive now suddenly found sailing through labyrinth of small mangrove covered islet intersected by water lane so narrow winding that be only able to sail boat along by exercising utmost care vigilance intricate difficult navigation continued for nearly three hour at end of time suddenly emerged from maze of islet found in stream of thick muddy water averaging about quarter of mile in width with low bank fringed by mangrove tree beyond be occasionally possible to catch glimpse of more lofty vegetation water here be so deep that except when close to bank on side be impossible to reach bottom with six foot paddle when have traversed river far enough to enable to get vista of clear mile astern of there be still sign of galley therefore concluded have be unable to pas mud bar at entrance of river course of stream be now following be approximately north north east for distance of about twenty two mile be traversed in trifle over four hour here river suddenly bent sharply round in south easterly direction mangrove disappeared being replaced by thick fringe of reed bank of river gradually increased in height be covered to water edge with thick tangle of bush amid towered outpost of forest of magnificent tree must be seen stretching away for mile ahead fugitive considered that be now well beyond likelihood of pursuit thick bed of reed fringed river at frequent interval afforded excellent opportunity for concealment wind continued favourable moon afforded ample light therefore determined to press forward so long a condition continued favourable one of remaining on watch steering boat while other slept in fashion sped up stream hour after hour through night width of waterway remaining about same character of country ever changing bank in place rising to height of quite hundred foot here in form of gentle tree clad slope there towering precipitously rocky face with overhanging bush great clump of fern springing from fissure at moon sank beneath tree top on western bank light became so uncertain that voyager be seriously debating advisability of seeking suitable spot in to tie up boat when sudden chilliness in wind warned that dawn be at hand few minute later sky to eastward paled so that top of tree stood out against pallor black a though drawn in indian ink star dimmed blinked out one after eastern pallor became suffused with delicate primrose rapidly warmed into clear amber beam of golden light flashed through branch of tree on eastern bank of river in moment whole scene changed a if by magic thousand lovely tint of green blue orange crimson white leapt into view a daylight flooded landscape revealing great mass of flowering shrub enormous festoon of queer shaped gorgeously coloured orchid colibris that flashed like living gem darted hither thither flock of gaily plumaged parrot winged way screaming discordantly across stream brilliantly painted kingfisher darted like stream of living fire from bough to bough perched staring intently down into water from overhanging branch enormous butterfly of exquisite colour dragon fly with transparent rose tinted wing flitted inconsequently over surface of water be leaped at by fish a brilliantly tinted a be day in south american forest hour later a boat rounded low bluff break in forest appeared ahead beyond wide expanse of water be seen sparkling in ray of early morning sun presently boat shot out of stream have be traversing night wanderer found floating upon bosom of magnificent river about mile wide flowing a nearly a might be due north for few second young englishman be silent lost in admiration at spaciousness grandeur tropical luxuriance beauty of scene upon gaze rested entranced then dick broke silence by murmuring now what river be wonder surely can not be magdalena of have heard so many wonderful story yet if be not know not what river can be magdalena lie somewhere in direction believe what matter name be superb waterway however may be called current be not so strong that can easily stem with help of sail come from direction in want to go what say phil be to be north south south of course answered stukely why ask totally unnecessary question spoke with so much irritation of manner that dick looked at anxiously fearing that might be suffering from slight touch of fever there be nothing in stukely appearance to suggest that be suffering either from fever other malady be glancing about keenly eagerly yet with puzzled expression a though recognised what be looking at must not understand why recognised next word conveyed precisely same impression for murmured a though speaking to now be most extraordinary scene be absolutely familiar to seem to have gazed upon upon something precisely similar to in respect thousand of time before look at gigantic ceiba yonder long trailing rope of purple orchid see flamingo with scarlet black barred wing long thin leg curiously twisted beak observe graceful white bird with handsome crested head ay even very monkey swinging down by creeper to dip up water drink out of palm of hand be all much more familiar homelike to than ever be scenery of devon yet have never be here before unless indeed have be in dream must dream even series of dream impart to perfect knowledge seem to posse of everything upon eye rest now yonder for instance be tree out of used to make mean that in strange way seem to know splendid bow can be made out of wood of particular tree there growing close beneath shade in water be clump of rush when dried in sun make perfect shaft for arrow reminds dick that since must save powder shot for very special occasion ought to provide with bow good stock of arrow if only to enable to procure game now know perfectly well in mysterious manner how to make bow arrow since material for making be at moment before eye ought to avail ourselves of opportunity think so certainly answered dick though what mean by saying that know what particular kind of tree make best bow rest of confess understand do admitted stukely same posse knowledge however strange may appear perhaps later on understanding will come to now there be good place to land among reed push boat in through dick will find bank low just there with water enough for boat alongside now how can possibly know that demanded dick nevertheless continued will try because will afford excellent opportunity to test accuracy of boasted knowledge put helm up headed boat straight for reed into midst of plunged minute later pushing easily aside a drove through while closed up again behind effectually screening from view from river a effectually obliterating track have temporarily made through chapter nine how phil dick voyaged up magdalena there now what did tell demanded stukely triumphantly a boat slid easily through reed glided alongside smooth grassy bank top of be scarcely foot above surface of river now continued if lower sail unstep mast may remain here a long a please undetected indeed statement be strictly true for having lowered sail unshipped mast stepped ashore upon smooth grassy lawn of four acre in extent completely hidden from river by screen of tall reed feathery top of rose ten foot above water surface while inland be completely encircled by belt of forest undergrowth of be so dense a to be absolutely impenetrable by man without aid of ax other hewing implement lawn be thickly dotted with tree shrub of various kind amid be conspicuous tree stukely have asserted be good for making of bow many of tree be fruit bearer among being banana pawpaw guava mango other excellent variety dick stared about in amazement a stepped ashore taking boat painter with making fast to sturdy bush grew conveniently close to water edge well said in answer to stukely question be perfectly right however came by knowledge a to remaining here well think might do worse ought to accustom gradually to outdoor semi savage life will henceforth be ours think can not do better than begin here that reminds have not yet breakfasted while yonder see banana appear to have reached very pink of perfection be hungry phil be answered stukely with emphasis have full larder seems so help lad at present will be obliged to content with exclusively fruit diet in course of few day when have provided ourselves with bow arrow can vary little by adding occasional venison steak parrot two can assure dick that parrot be very excellent eating how do know demanded matter of fact dick have ever eaten one ay often enough answered stukely impulsively then checked at least stammered seem to have done so yet of course 't be impossible do believe a assert that certain number if not of have lived on earth once twice thrice before present life dick because be exactly how feel a though have spent at least one previous existence here in very part of world amid such surroundings a eye now gaze upon seems so absolutely familiar feel that know that there be to know about everything except name of ay there be even time when strange dim memory of past scene seem to visit for moment picture surrounded by pomp grandeur of civilisation have long passed away will call dreamer a indeed have often called already perhaps be right yet be strange that dream must centre round scene glorious a have be so vivid that recognise hitherto unseen object a perfectly familiar when gaze rest upon be unprofitable talk really important thing be that be hungry be surrounded by food in abundance let to breakfast when at length have satisfied hunger by feasting upon several kind of delicious fruit abounded in enclosure phil approached tree have asserted be good for making bow from drawing hanger proceeded to examine very carefully several bough finally choosing two be absolutely straight about twelve foot long hacked off from parent trunk without difficulty using hanger a axe then handing one to dick whom directed to follow own example sat down in shadow of great umbrella tree proceeded to trim away first twig then bark done took bare straight branch trimmed off thin end until wood be perfectly round be about three quarter of inch thick then cut away enough of thick end of branch to leave pole about six foot long proceeded to whittle away at thick end until also be about same thickness a thinner end leaving middle part about two inch thick did with pocket knife without difficulty wood seeming to be quite soft yielding to sharp blade with utmost facility a worked so did dick latter with smile of amusement upon face for flattered that knew thing two about bow to seemed ridiculous to suppose that wood yielded a readily a cheese to shaping of knife must ever be of slightest use a bow worked steadily on following stukely lead shaping own branch precisely a stukely shaped after three hour of by mean arduous work possessed perfectly straight smooth rod accurately trimmed into form of bow about six foot long with properly notched end for string to fit into there said stukely at last a critically inspected own dick production think can improve upon of ought to make really formidable weapon when be ready for use now next thing be to hang up in shade to dry will take three full day at least after will be ready to use will steadily improve in quality until whole of sap be completely dried out of if have fault will probably be that will find shade too strong for at first will grow accustomed to in time can not do better than hang to bough of tree where will be completely shielded from ray of sun will dry slowly evenly now next thing need be string for bow if can contrive spare string a stand by glancing about think ought to find material for manufacture of string not very far away hung up two bow in such situation at time of day must ray of sun get at then wandered round enclosure peering up among branch of tree at length seemed to find what be seeking for presently swung up into particular tree climbing little way up plucked two brown ball about size of orange with descended here be exclaimed in accent of satisfaction a exhibited ball to dick be cocoon of certain caterpillar name of forget spin kind of silk be admirably adapted for making of bowstring for be incredibly strong doe not fray be not affected by damp now how on earth do come to know phil demanded dick a took one of cocoon in hand examined curiously can not tell answered stukely rather impatiently let suffice that posse knowledge in inscrutable way ay good deal more too of be like to reap benefit in long run then proceeded to explain illustrate how silk be to be unwound task kept busy for several hour when be at length done showed dick how to spin fine tough filament into thin immensely strong cord most remarkable part of whole affair be perfectly intimate knowledge displayed of various operation none of be remembered have ever performed before unwinding of cocoon spinning of cord two for bow occupied young men during remainder of first day whole of second for process be rather tedious delicate one in dick at least exhibited inaptitude of novice third fourth day be fully occupied in cutting of reed conversion of into arrow here again stukely showed same weird incomprehensible knowledge skill that have so conspicuously displayed in choice of wood for bow working of to proper shape manufacture of bowstring for arrow when finished be a nearly perfect a such missile must possibly be shaft being of uniform length perfectly straight tipped with strong hard thorn sharp a needle growing naturally in form of barb two dozen arrow for constituted initial equipment cut considerable quantity of spare reed thorn wound quite large skein of silk to bind barbed head with a be quite prepared to lose several of arrow at outset accordingly made ample provision for replacement must be done at odd moment while working way up river next business be to plait two quiver of palm leaf fibre with shoulder strap to support same be stukely who have to make for when dick endeavoured to follow friend instruction proved to be so absolutely lacking in necessary skill to save time phil undertook to do work several occupation kept busy for entire week during saw sign of human presence on river by time that be finished bow have dried into prime condition dick found to amazement that wood when first cut have be soft workable a cheese have become a hard a iron tough elastic extraordinarily strong that have in short become perfect for use a bow being now equipped with powerful effective weapon must enable to save powder ball for special emergency provide with game might require two adventurer resumed journey heading up wide deep river believed to be magdalena sailing when wind permitted paddling when did not unless happened to be within sight of good camping place when wind failed in case very frequently ran in alongside bank moored boat rested hunted until wind sprang up again be perfectly happy now two be difficult to say be happier life be living be a nearly a possible ideal be passed in open air in midst of glorious scenery be constantly revealing new beauty wonder have not care in world for river forest provided with ample supply of food while have anxiety with regard to clothing in climate rendered clothes superfluity in short physical need be abundantly satisfied enjoyed perfect health if adventure thus far be of somewhat tame commonplace description well what mattered have not doubt excitement in plenty lay before meanwhile daily life be insensibly training preparing to cope with of be happy in own way dick because be new splendid phil because be possessed of wonderful overmastering feeling after long period of exile once more found amid scene be familiar although must not say precisely in what way suggestive of glorious association late on second day of resumed voyage arrived at point where river forked stream on right hand being almost a important a other decided that stream on left be main stream therefore followed although knew not at moment decision of theirs to follow left instead of right stream be of utmost import to for have decided differently must have missed extraordinary adventure awaited among mountain lay so far ahead that many weary mile of river forest plain must be traversed before peak must swing into sight camped that night on point of land where two river united water have scarcely landed when without sound to tell of coming graceful antelope emerged from brake few hundred yard away evidently going to river to drink adventurer be at moment partly concealed by reed among have moored boat moreover wind be in favour for nearly minute creature failed to see by time that did stukely have seized bow fitted arrow to string risen cautiously to foot then antelope appeared to become aware of unusual feature in scene halted to investigate whereupon phil cautiously drew bowstring released with loud twang arrow flying straight true pierced creature heart so that fell dead in track have first deer now again stukely gave fresh evidence of uncanny knowledge for although have never before killed deer might be supposed to know nothing of verderer art at once set to work to skin break up animal with skill of adept so that night feasted sumptuously upon venison steak grilled upon ember of fire with further display of strange knowledge phil kindled by apparently simple really exceedingly difficult process of rubbing two stick together that night too heard for first time roar of jaguar in adjacent forest for several day so many indeed that lost count of voyaged steadily up great river sailing when wind permitted paddling when did not passing at tolerably frequent interval point where lesser stream discharged into main body of water while by imperceptible degree waterway narrowed forest dense green flower decked alive gay with bird insect life pressed foliaged wall in upon ever closer closer except where occasional break caused by fire windfall afforded momentary glimpse of giant mountain range to right left at first delicate purple grey in distance ever like forest creeping closer in upon now at increasingly frequent interval began to see indian at first solitary buck spearing fish from canoe later on in party of from dozen to fifty more crossing river like using a highway thus far much a stukely desired have never succeeded in getting into touch with native for latter invariably fled at mere sight of one of most surprising circumstance perhaps in connection with voyage up river be rapidity with two englishman dick rather lost capacity to be astonished stukely indeed have never manifested least surprise at of wonder be continually coming under observation for steadfastly adhering to strange fancy of that must have lived in region during former state of existence persistently asserted that everything saw be perfectly familiar to with dick be very different be a matter of fact a phil be fanciful sight of giant tree between two three hundred foot in height towering up into cloudless blue solid mass of purple scarlet yellow bloom of graceful clump of feathery bamboo hundred foot long of lofty forest wall on hand draped with festoon of orchid of most extraordinary undreamed of shape most gorgeous colour of bird insect ay even fish that flashed glittered with hue of rainbow of monkey who followed course up river in troop of hundred more of lithe graceful jaguar lying stretched upon trunk branch closely overhung water watching with ready paw to seize unwary fish might chance to swim past within reach of alligator basked log like on mud bank thing be to chichester at first source of utmost wonder admiration yet within month have become veriest commonplace to have entirely ceased to attract attention be far more interested in sight of fair breeze stealing up river after than be in sight of most beautiful flower most gorgeous butterfly most dainty brilliant colibri for knew that thing must see again thousand time more wind must relieve of labour of paddling in scorching climate ah be indeed sight worth seeing at length when have be journeying up river in leisurely fashion for about three week meeting with adventure worthy of record on certain hot steamy afternoon when boat under sail be doing little more than barely stem current gradually became aware of low faint roar at first scarcely distinguishable above rustle of wind in tree aloft buzzing hum of innumerable insect swarmed in forest hovered in cloud over surface of water a boat continued to creep upstream roar gradually increased in intensity until at length a rounded bend entered reach of river extended practically straight for nearly three mile ahead of saw at distance of about mile long stretch of foaming tumbling water rushing headlong down through rocky gorge about three hundred yard wide over what be evidently rocky bed for brown head of several rock be seen protruding above leaping water in channel rapid with fall of nearly thirty foot in about mile be formidable obstacle indeed for did not seem possible that must get boat through if must be obliged to abandon what must then happen obviously must be obliged to walk rest of distance to build boat canoe above rapid be difficult to say be more distasteful alternative of two walking probably for although belonging be few by mean cumbersome to carry forest be so dense that a have already proved by experience be scarcely possible to travel hundred foot without being faced by necessity to cut way well said practical dick after have sat staring at beautiful tantalising scene for full five minute be use meeting trouble halfway wondering how be going to get across bridge until come to let push on get a close up a can then will get ashore walk up along have look at place perhaps when come to will not look so bad a doe from here bank on hand be so densely overgrown with shrub that landing seemed out of question seizing paddle two adventurer drove boat up against rapidly strengthening current presently tiny strip of beach yard wide by ten twelve yard long came into view here beached boat making well fast in order that current might not sweep away rapid be now le than hundred foot distant rush of water brought down with cool spray laden breeze be infinitely refreshing after baking breathlessness of stream below roar of chafing water be so loud that be almost impossible to make one voice heard phil therefore scrambled up steep bank signed to dick to follow fighting way through dense undergrowth through be obliged to cut much of way with hanger at length came out upon jutting spur of bare rock overhung rapid at height of fifty foot from point be able to obtain tolerably distinct view of whole gorge a dick have suggested when came to look at place from close at hand did not appear to be nearly so impracticable a have at first imagined bed of channel be badly encumbered with rock be true only for about two hundred foot at lower end rest of while showing partially submerged rock here there be on whole remarkably clear water rushing over bed in swift glass smooth stream even where rock be thickest be apparent that there be very well defined channel between up carefully navigated boat might easily pas if propulsive power enough be applied to to overcome downward rush of stream how be power to be obtained certainly not by paddling stream be too swift for be just possible that might be done by warping if warp long enough strong enough must be obtained moreover warp need not be so prodigiously long for now that came to look at rapid at close quarter saw that original estimate of length have be long way over mark be much nearer quarter than mile long glanced about saw that tree be here a everywhere along river bank thickly draped with long thin tough liana same idea flashed into mind at same moment why must not twist plait warp of liana there be plenty of after merely resolved into question of time while time just then be of le importance to than labour there be alternative of course might abandon boat construct canoe above rapid be worth considering whether construction of canoe making of warp must involve more labour to settle point decided to go on through wood until reached head of rapid there inspect tree with view of ascertaining whether there be suitable for construction of canoe having come to decision left rock re entered forest for more than hour be so busily engaged in forcing hewing way through dense parasitical undergrowth that have attention to spare for anything else at length became conscious of certain discordant sound reaching ear above roar of rapid presently became distinguishable a beating of drum mingled with sort of braying bellow comparable to nothing that have ever heard before a pair pressed on unearthly sound gradually grew louder not only because be approaching source of also because be evident that producer of sound be becoming more excited for tapping of drum increased in rapidity while braying a steadily grew in stridency discord five minute of strenuous labour then two englishman burst through last of undergrowth emerged upon cleared space of about hundred acre on bank of river just above rapid at point river widened out again to about space of mile from bank to bank gorge being about hundred yard below current be again gentle enough to render paddling against easy matter small strip of shingly beach be dotted with forty fifty canoe hewn out of single log adjoining beach scattered over space of about five acre of ground be native village consisting of about fifty palm leaf hut dotted about without slightest attempt at symmetrical arrangement except that be built round open space remainder of clearing consisted of cultivated ground divided into patch devoted in about equal proportion to cassava maize with little indigo here there whole forest of slender pole connected with other by liana from large quantity of fish be suspended drying in sun by way gave off most intolerable odour indicated that inhabitant depended a much upon river a upon soil for subsistence apparently sort of festival religious ceremony be in process of being observed when dick phil burst in so unceremoniously upon for entire population of village men woman child be squatted in circle round open space in middle of village despite scorching heat large fire be blazing in centre of open space round sat village band consisting of four drum made of section of tree with inside cut away leaving thin cylinder of wood over one end of be tightly strained skin of sort be slapped with palm of open hand about dozen flageolet player instrument being made of baked clay be last emitted unearthly braying bellowing sound already mentioned to hideous medley of sound figure in middle of circle be dancing figure so queer that for second two young englishman scarcely knew what to make of presently saw that be man laced up in jaguar skin with teeth claw tail complete face of man peering out from between gaping jaw be not only dancing vigorously if indeed dancing must be called consisted in leaping violently into air springing from side to side over bundle nature of intruder must not at first make out also singing rather howling certain word appeared to be gradually working audience up into state of savage excitement for at interval one of apparently moved out of must yell furiously shake in air villainous looking triple barbed spear for nearly minute people be so completely absorbed in movement word of piache medicine man witch doctor a man in jaguar skin proved to be that be quite oblivious of presence of two englishman suddenly piache caught sight of stopped short in leaping howling glared open mouthed at stranger for second two before with yell of dismay turned tail leaping right through blazing fire in panic dashed into hut violently drew across mat served a door extraordinary behaviour on part of medicine man naturally excited wonder of audience also aroused in feeling of consternation caused to spring to foot look about apprehensively then too caught sight of englishman like piache made mad dash for hut yelling a went thus in course of couple of minute two young devonian be left in complete undisputed possession of village although be conscious of being stealthily observed from practically hut in place well exclaimed dick a stared about in astonishment beat everything men woman big little there must have be close upon two hundred of not one have courage to stay face probably took for spaniard answered stukely may have thought that be merely advance guard of considerable force hence terror only hope that when discover mistake may not revenge upon for fright have given must that one other of possessed smattering of lingo sufficient to make ourselves understood be afraid that will find ignorance in respect very serious hindrance a penetrate farther into interior must do best to remedy hallo what on earth be in bundle did see move phil referred to bundle over piache have be performing extraordinary dance when interrupted have appearance of being simply bundle of ordinary matting stukely eye happened to have be resting upon while spoke have distinctly seen move did answered chichester in reply to friend question for simple reason be looking at will look at now if like striding over to where bundle lay upon ground drew knife severed thong bound unrolled matting disclosed to own companion astonished gaze figure of little old man securely bound hand foot be indian of sort evidently not of same race a inhabitant of village colour being that of light copper while of others be very dark brown nearly approaching to black also feature be of totally different much higher type forehead being broad high nose thin aquiline cheek bone rather high prominent in fact must in day of youth have be decidedly handsome man with imposing presence now be old how old be rather difficult to guess probably not far short of hundred shrunken shrivelled up until resembled animated mummy more than anything else head face be clean shaven be naked except for sort of petticoat of feather about loin said petticoat having evidently at one time be exceedingly handsome garment though now be soiled frayed generally very much worse for wear a dick bent over old fellow with long keen knife in hand to sever bond creature suddenly cried out dozen word in thin high piping voice causing stukely to start forward gaze earnestly into face of speaker then to dick stupefaction stukely replied in apparently same tongue bent over rapidly loosed thong bound old fellow hand foot together proceeded gently to chafe shrunken limb chapter ten how two adventurer acquired companion why phil exclaimed dick in amazement what doe mean surely be not pretending that understand old chap lingo dick be not pretending answered stukely regarding chichester with dazed expression be fact most extraordinary unaccountable fact that really understand what poor old chap say without knowing without even previously suspecting for instant seem to posse sufficient knowledge of tongue to be able to comprehend speech even to answer believe that in course of day two will be able to converse freely with what cried out just now be entreaty that must spare life answered that need not fear for meant harm um m m commented dick well be land of marvel mistake thought have grown accustomed to wonder of that have capacity for further astonishment confess that have contrived to give one more spasm of surprise ask friend who be where hail from dare swear that be not native of village stukely turned to old man who be by time sitting up gently chafing wrist ankle attempted to put to question dick have suggested found that word must not come to felt that knew must not remember after two three bungling attempt be obliged to give up now be very extraordinary said attempting to explain failure to dick almost a extraordinary a fact that understood old chap word be able to answer know language be certain do after have practised with little will come back to meanwhile must do best can be feeling better gramfer ' be indian going to do to in english indian looked up in stukely face spoke for nearly minute when have finished stukely be again to own dick amazement able to reply be getting on phil explained old gentleman asked why did not address in own tongue since evidently understand then went on to say that arrived here just in nick of time a villager be about to torture to death to secure favour of god devil of whom appear to be particularly afraid said that might depend upon to protect so long a have power to do so then turned again to old man with good deal of stammering hesitation many long pause for consideration said something else to ancient again replied whereupon phil made further attempt with result ultimately two have quite long conversation together although must be confessed that elder man did most of talking at length conversation came to end for moment stukely seized opportunity to transmit to dick information have acquired friend story be very remarkable one said tell that name be vilcamapata that be peruvian be once priest of sun in temple stood ruin of indeed still stand on island in midst of great lake lie among mountain far away to southward be when peru be at zenith of power glory under inca named atahuallpa whom spaniard under pizarro decoyed into power murdered most shamefully cruelly afterward seizing country making own since then gramfer ' vilcamapata have be wanderer fugitive always fleeing from spaniard who appears be doing utmost to extirpate peruvian under pretence of converting trying to convert to christian faith thus be in course of aimless wandering that came to village three day ago be seized by inhabitant who after much deliberation decided to sacrifice to one of demon be indeed about to do so when appeared upon scene interrupted well said dick seems to that stand very good chance of being sacrificed still a soon a indian find that there be only two of to defend pray heaven that may not take into head to sacrifice too with murrain on oh think will do even attempt to take gramfer from replied phil cheerfully seems that have very great respect for white men except spaniard be ever on lookout for paleface named amalivaca to come across great water unite indian into one great powerful nation will utterly destroy spaniard restore country to original owner suppose must not be persuaded to accept a two of amalivaca son come over a sort of advance guard to prepare indian for arrival of old boy suggested dick then difficulty be that understand lingo doe gramfer think if so might be induced to act a interpreter inform indian that be friend perhaps if must be persuaded of might be induced to help to get boat up above rapid yes agreed phil might be very good idea will see what can be done therewith turned to ancient again with much halting stammering contrived to explain what desired to accomplish peruvian put several question to stukely seeming not quite to comprehend what white men required dick noticed that after ex priest have spoken little while with latter became much more fluent certain in speech so that in course of further conversation of ten minute duration contrived to make vilcamapata clearly understand what wanted whereupon old man facing round toward hut lifted up voice made what seemed to be long proclamation in language of stukely understood nothing if what said be incomprehensible to white man be evident that be clearly enough understood by indian who before speech be half over came swarming out of hut prostrated before phil dick grovelling in dust did attempt to interfere further with peruvian on contrary listened with utmost attention to that have to say to when have finished about dozen of jumped into one of largest canoe paddled across to opposite side of stream vanished into forest after absence of about hour half reappeared singing song of triumph carrying white men boat with gear content intact upon shoulder having evidently brought up past rapid by path through forest on opposite side of river to by phil dick have ascended be by time within hour of sunset when boat have be launched in river above rapid towed across to village side of stream safely moored piache again made appearance addressed at considerable length to vilcamapata who in turn addressed to phil informing latter that villager be profoundly grateful for honour white men have done in condescending to visit village that trusted said white men must by lodging in village for night at least if not for much longer time afford opportunity to show gratitude in practical way to phil after consultation with dick replied that be gratified to find indian child duly appreciated honour have be done that a token of favour must accede to request to spend night in village provided that new hut be erected for accommodation that must depart at sunrise a have long journey before whereupon indian with joyful song at once proceeded to erect new hut on vacant space somewhat apart from village pushing forward work so rapidly that hut be completed ready for occupation by time that first star began to appear in sky sooner have two white men installed therein with large fire blazing before hut to afford light drive off mosquito than several woman appeared with basket on head of contained cassava while content of others consisted of young head of indian corn boiled wrapped in plantain leaf hind quarter of kid roasted roasted plantain quantity of fruit calabash containing liquid have faint mellow acid flavour something like weak cider exceedingly refreshing a beverage decidedly heady a discovered little later on peruvian at joint request of white men established in corner of hut thankfully accepted such viand a gave generally comported in manner a to convey idea that regarded a under special protection indeed be glad enough that must so regard for there must be doubt that must be of very great service to if only a guide interpreter having appeared be wanderer up down country for a phil understood nearly forty year thing puzzle most of said dick when be discussing day doings a sat at supper night be how peruvian came to be able to converse together to seems nothing le than miracle yes agreed stukely have doubt doe can quite understand that must so appear to indeed when come to reflect upon also appears miraculous to for why must be able to understand language have never studied spoken even heard before seems impossible upon face of doe yet although know that never be abroad until came over here in adventure have from earliest day of childhood have feeling amounting sometimes to conviction sometime in past dwelt in just such land a sound odour have brought to vague elusive memory of country of vast forest great shining river stupendous mountain island dotted lake crowned with vast building constructed in style of architecture such a eye of mine have never beheld in england then again seem to be able to recall gorgeous pageant in took prominent part at in presence of innumerable people assisted in performance of strange rite such scene come to most vividly in dream at night there be occasion when dream be so realistic that when awake be puzzled to decide be dream reality strangest thing of on occasion have spoken language spoke with vilcamapata to day recognised rather type of countenance moment set eye upon for have beheld many such in dream ever since have be in country have have feeling of one who after long absence find again among familiar homelike surroundings be fact can not explain more than can explain to why fire throw out heat on following morning up river journey be resumed much to grief of villager who seemed to have taken most extraordinary liking for englishman possibly because of fancy that presence of white men must bring good luck to village inhabitant stukely dick be minded to delay journey met pressing invitation of indian to remain with by repeating explanation that long journey lay before that there be urgent reason for utmost haste whereupon headman of village through vilcamapata petitioned that party might be permitted to accompany paleface two day journey up river in order that might transport friend boat past certain rapid cataract must be met with at distance above village statement a to existence of rapid cataract being confirmed by vilcamapata stukely graciously gave required permission when after early breakfast little expedition set out consisted not only of two englishman vilcamapata also of twenty indian in two canoe who be vastly astonished when fresh favourable breeze happening to be blowing saw white men step mast unfurl sail go scudding upstream against current at speed taxed utmost energy to keep pace with wind died away about noon then nothing must satisfy indian that must take boat in tow did with result that dick stukely be spared long hot afternoon paddling moreover not content with when time came for to camp for night friendly indian insisted on building hut for dick phil to pas night in one half of party undertaking task while other half plunged into wood to return three quarter of hour later loaded with fruit game of various description choicest portion of placed in white men hut next day journey be in essential particular counterpart of preceded except about mid afternoon arrived at foot of rapid of existence of indian have warned rapid be very much more formidable than have first encountered channel being considerably narrower current consequently far more rapid also river bed be here full of enormous rock boulder over between water rushed leapt boiled in turmoil of fury that boat canoe must possibly have faced furthermore rapid be nearly mile half in length beyond be about mile of comparatively quiet water then came cataract of over hundred foot in perpendicular height with half mile of rapid beyond before river once more widened out sufficiently to be navigable have two adventurer be alone must certainly have be compelled to abandon boat at spot indian made light of difficulty beginning by building hut for white friend a on day before on small open plateau near foot of rapid while dozen of number explored bank on side of river in search of practicable road by mean of boat must be carried up past rapid cataract to navigable water beyond eventually discovered in time to effect portage before dark then more fruit having be found game taken on way back great fire be kindled farewell feast be held in honour of paleface friend be wound up with of most weird extraordinary singing dancing that englishman have ever heard seen on following morning indian escorted phil dick vilcamapata to spot where beyond cataract upper rapid boat with content intact rode safely in placid water of little bay where river widened out navigation be once more possible here at last kind hearted native bade reluctant sorrowful farewell to dick stukely bitterness of parting being mitigated by promise on part of white men in event of returning by way of river must not fail to make stay of at least week in friend village now with long stretch of unobstructed navigation before have time to improve acquaintance with vilcamapata who be never tired of expressing gratitude to dick stukely for having saved from terrible death soon became apparent that for inexplicable reason regarded stukely a much more important personage of two devotion to phil being of pronounced character that almost amounted to worship of course might have be accounted for to extent by fact that stukely be able to converse with in own tongue rapidity with phil attained to proficiency in peruvian language be never ending source of wonderment to dick there be evidently something more than in something did not offer to explain upon stukely did not care to question fearing that if did so such exposure of ignorance on part might result in weakening of influence over peruvian while from influence hoped to obtain certain very important advantage rather remarkable circumstance gradually revealed in course of phil conversation with ex priest be that latter did not seem to be in least surprised that stukely must be desirous of penetrating peru on contrary appeared to regard a quite matter of course nay more almost appeared a though stukely visit have be long expected be thing to be rejoiced over at least be impression stukely gathered from remark expression dropped by vilcamapata from time to time must greatly have liked to have questioned man upon subject learned precisely what meant by such reference forbore for reason above stated when at length stukely cautiously hinted that object of journey be acquisition of wealth ex priest far from exhibiting surprise displeasure displayed utmost satisfaction eagerly assured phil that must place in possession of wealth that must possibly desire upon phil asking where wealth be to come from peruvian replied that when country fell into hand of spaniard enormous quantity of gold silver uncut gem have be concealed in secret chamber of temple of have be priest that be there still that be quite prepared to reveal hiding place to english friend feeling assured that must use in manner have be intended when be first concealed again be distinctly cryptic remark of of englishman must possibly guess meaning stukely replied that vilcamapata might rest assured that must employ wisely well with answer peruvian seemed perfectly satisfied when be asked to describe whereabouts of temple must only very vaguely indicate a being built on island situated in midst of sacred lake that lake lay at immense distance to southward under shadow of rather remarkable snow capped mountain that way thither be encompassed with danger from wild animal hostile indian worst of spaniard that if be fortunate might possibly reach place in about four moon of diligent travel four moon month of diligent travel seemed immense distance for diligent travel through virgin forest vilcamapata gave to understand that very considerable part of distance must have to be traversed by land meant something like average of fifteen mile day fifteen mile day for one hundred twenty day meant journey of eighteen hundred mile be not dismayed for by time have come to have unlimited confidence in be daily becoming more learned in woodcraft being now able to traverse at least three mile of forest in time that have originally taken to travel one mile familiarity have caused to lose completely original dread of wild animal noxious reptile insect a for indian spaniard well believed must always circumvent of while so far a length of journey be concerned what be four month if there be fortune to be gained at end of so with light heart pressed forward day after day always following river until at length be obliged first to abandon boat in consequence of increasing number of rapid fall take to light canoe instead be easily able to transport overland when necessary finally reached point where river be no longer navigable even for canoe be obliged to take to forest although must no longer travel by water still clung closely to river a be only source of supply of drinking water moreover happened to lead pretty nearly in direction of route be now proceeding up valley hemmed in on side by mountain ranging in height from ten thousand to fifteen thousand foot yet so dense be forest through be travelling that seldom caught glimpse of except in one particular instance where frequently sighted majestic snow capped peak right ahead of when encamped in clearing close to river at length day came when noble river upon broad bosom of have journeyed for so many day dwindled to tiny brook brawling over rocky bed across must leap forest grew thin stunted degenerated to few scattered scrub oak finally ceased altogether found confronted by mountain barrier bare rock of be interspersed with patch of grass upon of be grazing small flock of most extraordinary animal such a have never seen before with vilcamapata be evidently quite familiar there be three distinct specie of although bore striking resemblance to other being about size of donkey having long neck head somewhat like of sheep leg foot resembling of camel vilcamapata informed englishman that animal be known respectively a alpaca llama vicuna that first be used by countryman for food while wool be woven into garment second be used a beast of burden third be valuable principally for hair hide river be now left behind caused traveller inconvenience for mountain be ascending be most of snow capped tiny rivulet of ice cold water formed by melting snow be frequently met with so that be at loss for water wherewith to quench thirst a pressed on climbing ever higher higher began to suffer very severely first from cold next from mountain sickness due to steadily increasing rarefaction of atmosphere vilcamapata however have remedy for evil for killed three alpaca stripped off skin to serve a wrap for companion to protect from cold while a soon a first symptom of mountain sickness declared produced from pouch quantity of leaf of marvellous coca bade englishman chew did whereupon not only did sickness disappear felt further need of food while strength be restored to in manner seemed absolutely miraculous cost three day of arduous labour to cross mountain range evening of third day found once more encamped in tropical forest beside tiny stream flowed to southward eastward while on farther side valley sloped away into still deeper depression six day later having meanwhile traversed about hundred mile of stifling tropical forest travelling while in due southerly direction having crossed two important stream running in easterly direction to say nothing of numberless rivulet came to bank of third stream also running almost due east here vilcamapata announced that must be necessary to build canoe a now proposed to take to water again upon stukely pointing out to that river like others that have recently crossed flowed east whereas understood that own route lay to southward peruvian replied that such be certainly case that although river have now reached ran eastward eventually discharged into by travelling up must in process of time come very near to destination that although distance must have to travel by water be very much greater than direct overland route must be able to accomplish in much shorter time with considerably more ease comfort to with reply englishman be obliged to be content accordingly while dick peruvian proceeded to hunt for suitable tree out of to construct canoe within reasonable distance of river bank stukely taking bow arrow went off into forest in search of game there have be time when must have hesitated to go very far into depth of green shadow alone for fear of losing that time be now long past for young englishman have grown quite accustomed to travelling through pathless forest to wandering hither thither in in pursuit of game mechanically to note while doing so thousand sign quite imperceptible to novice whereby be enabled to return with certainty to spot where have temporarily fixed camp therefore on occasion a on many others stukely with word of explanation to companion plunged unhesitatingly into labyrinth of tangled undergrowth covered soil between bole of giant tree instinctively taking direction in must be likely soonest to come upon track of game yet might have be excused have hesitated to enter maze a reared within le than hundred yard of spot party have fixed upon for temporary camp for there be semblance of path through mode of progress consisted simply in entering at spot where tangle be thinnest still following line of least resistance in way make one devious way forward progressing in fashion must have be quite possible nay more almost inevitable that one unaccustomed to such mode of travel must become hopelessly lost within first five minute not so stukely dick have learned to preserve bearing by noting moss growing on trunk of tree direction in principal branch pointed hundred other apparently trivial sign be weird place in to be alone for apart from green twilight produced by filtration of light through dense canopy of foliage shut out view of sky overhead under brake be so thick that be seldom possible to see more than yard two ahead be impossible to say what strange thrilling sight might at moment meet gaze then there be uncanny silence of place kind of silence caused involuntary movement on tiptoe holding of breath for fear of breaking yet be broken at recent interval by stealthy unaccountable rustling sudden violent commotion beginning close at hand gradually dying away in distance strange sudden unaccountable sound caused in probability by boa constrictor buck other creature startled into quick movement by scent of human being wafted to nostril by errant draught of air be even more startling to nerve than distant roar of jaguar call of bell bird irresistibly suggested incongruous idea at great distance in gloomy forest depth must be found church stukely be thoroughly accustomed to various other strange sound so frequently broke silence of forest if noted at be merely a hunter note sound that guide toward game warns of possible danger be not however in such spot a that expected to find game be in open glade that occur here there where for unaccountable reason acre so of ground be entirely free from tree at event from undergrowth where soil be covered with thick rich grass upon deer love to graze seem capable of scenting for mile so pushed forward worming way through tangled brake with ease celerity must have seemed absolutely miraculous to three month earlier ever a went glance darted hither thither searching for stronger light must reveal to whereabout of one of open glade incidentally venomous snake other noxious creature lurking in path at length when have be thus engaged for about hour have travelled distance of about two mile somewhat stronger light away on right front conveyed to welcome intimation that open glade a sought be at hand ten minute later emerged from forest to find confronted by scene of so extraordinary character that halted abruptly rubbed eye uncertain for moment whether what beheld be reality effect of disordered imagination chapter eleven how phil encountered most marvellous adventure place in stukely now found be perfectly open glade of about forty acre in extent carpeted with rich luscious grass such a antelope love to feed upon without tree shrub of kind upon be not however excited astonishment for such glade be by mean uncommon even in densest part of south american forest be that immediately facing on opposite side of glade towered bare vertical stretch of porphyry cliff towering up full three hundred foot into cloudless blue be unique spectacle face of cliff afforded that excited englishman admiration astonishment for be sculptured over from base to summit with boldly executed figure of men woman animal when admiration have passed sufficiently to enable to study in detail seemed to stukely to tell sort of story what story be be quite unable to puzzle out for there be hunting episode depicted also scene seemed to represent sort of religious ceremonial while others again might be interpreted a representing human sacrifice possibly execution of criminal for represented group of men thrusting forward by long pole whose hand be bound behind toward great uncouth looking monster be emerging from pool advancing ponderously toward unwilling victim with widely opened cavernous jaw thickly set with most formidable looking teeth figure be executed in rather high relief there be certain quaintness stiffness of outline in delineation that marked a work of untutored artist yet action of be depicted with spirit vigour proved that sculptor although untutored be undoubtedly keen student of nature altogether be by far most surprising thing of kind that stukely have ever seen stood for long time studying various tableau wondering why in world anyone must have thought worth while to spend best part of lifetime in carving in stubborn rock so elaborate series of picture where probably one occasional wandering indian must ever behold somewhat to stukely surprise there be game in glade yet be one place of others where must have expected to find antelope at least looked about to see whether must discover cause for emptiness of glade presently thought have found in cave opening of in face of opposite cliff have already curiously noted while examining sculpture doubtless be panther other evil beast have made home in cave have preyed upon game frequented glade until have be frightened away decided to go across investigate place possibly panther whatever be might be at home if so skin must be very useful for clothes be becoming much worse for wear so walked across glade presently noticed a drew near mouth of cave that soil round about be damp that small trickle of water be issuing from opening by time that have advanced few step farther have also noticed that grass immediately about entrance of cave be very nearly worn away a though by foot of many animal while damp soil about opening be trodden into consistency of thick mud bore impress of foot of many animal among recognised of antelope wild pig monkey jaguar two last confirmed theory a to reason why glade presented utterly forsaken appearance pair of jaguar knowing by instinct that spot must be largely frequented by various kind of game have doubt taken up quarter in cave have fared sumptuously day until repeated attack have driven game away stringing bow drawing arrow from quiver stukely strode forward until stood in mouth of cave when halted looked in now saw that be very much larger place than have at first imagined to be for looking inward be able to follow rough wall for few yard a receded inward when lost sight of in gloom also became aware of curious charnel house kind of stench now then issued from cavern be just kind of odour that one must expect to meet with in den of carnivorous beast phil peered keenly into darkness more than half expecting to see shining eye of jaguar puma glaring at when own eye have become accustomed to subdued light of place such sight greeted only a stood staring listening sudden faint splash of water reached ear from within dark depth of cavern few second later a little stream of water came trickling down slope from interior hot strong puff of peculiar effluvium have previously noticed smote almost turned sick retreated hastily to open air noticing a did so that momentary trickle of water have ceased to flow felt that after inhaling dreadful odour must get breath of fresh air also if desired to explore interior of cavern must provide with torch accordingly retraced step across glade re entered forest proceeded to look about for few dry branch to serve a torch dry moss for tinder couple of piece of wood suitable for rubbing upon other when be desired to kindle fire thing be soon found stukely be returning to open glade with perfect silence caution have now become habitual to when a parted last branch of scrub shut in quick eye detected something moving along base of cliff toward cave single glance sufficed to assure that be one of large ape almost a big a man abounded in forest determined to remain where be for few moment watch creature if brute entered cave a seemed to be intention stukely felt might safely conclude that jaguar might be be not at home consequently might enter without observance of quite so much precaution a must otherwise have considered necessary a have anticipated ape be evidently bound for interior of cavern for upon arriving at entrance creature paused for moment appeared to sniff air carefully for second two then went boldly in somewhat to stukely surprise for although when first saw creature gathered from movement that intended to enter cave must not imagine why must do so for knew perfectly well by time that particular specie of ape lived in tree not in cave then recollected water immediately came to conclusion that there must be spring pond of sort inside cave to animal of neighbourhood be accustomed to resort in order to quench thirst yes of course must be told must account in perfectly natural manner for many footprint have seen in mud at entrance if be case of course must not be den of panther other carnivorous animal at for monkey pig antelope must not frequent spring in cave one more of most deadly enemy have made lair yet what about abominable stench issued from cave how be to be accounted for be difficult question to answer stukely felt that there be one way of getting at truth namely by thoroughly examining interior of cavern so forgetting for moment that be out after game be not engaged upon exploring expedition passed out through parted scrub headed straight for mouth of cave have traversed about width of glade when sound of sudden loud splashing of water reached ear immediately followed by outburst of most appalling shriek yell couple of second later out dashed ape at speed of stukely must never have believed creature capable have not beheld with own eye ape cleared mouth of cave a though have be shot out of came straight across glade toward phil for instant latter thought that simian have caught sight of transported with rage intended to attack so halted dropped branch tinder prepared to fit arrow to bow to repel attack second glance assured that be mistaken for monkey be not coming directly toward must pas at distance of about dozen pace moreover be more than likely that creature did not even see for phil must now see that poor brute a dashed toward in great headlong bound with long hairy arm hand stretched out before eye turned back in head most hideous shriek issuing from foaming jaw be frantic with terror in drawing of dozen breath terrified beast have come up level with dashed past plunged headlong into depth of forest where yell at once raised tremendous commotion among parrot other bird to say nothing of monkey jaguar made home phil meditatively gathered up material wherewith proposed to illumine interior of cavern slowly resumed way across glade evidently there be something in cavern after otherwise that poor ape must not have dashed out of so precipitately in such ghastly state of terror what must be must be something even more formidable than jaguar puma to have terrified that unhappy monkey to verge of madness yet so far a phil knew jaguar be most dreaded beast to be found in south american forest there be one way of determining point satisfactorily so completely forgetful now of errand upon have started out stukely at once decided to adopt way be of course to enter cavern see for accordingly having arrived within about thirty foot of opening in face of sculptured rock young englishman looked warily about peered into interior of cavern to make sure that there be likelihood of being attacked unawares when at length have satisfied on head laid down bow proceeded to arrange dry moss so that must kindle readily then took two fire producing stick rubbed one against other in most approved manner presently have little flame deftly communicated to tinder like moss when be fairly ablaze ignited biggest thickest branch have with be soon in possession of brilliantly burning flambeau holding in one hand bow arrow in other at once boldly plunged into interior of cavern glancing keenly about a held torch aloft first thing phil noticed be that fetid charnel house odour have before assailed nostril be now for reason not nearly so strong a when have previously stood in entrance of cavern indeed be scarcely perceptible next thing to attract attention be fact that cavern widened out very considerably a receded into interior of rock that floor slightly rose a walked forward then shimmer of water ahead in light of torch caught eye when have penetrated about fifty foot suddenly found in vast rock chamber so large that light of torch must scarcely reach farther extremity roof there be peculiarity about rock chamber consisted in fact that whole of interior from wall to wall be occupied by pool of water brimmed to level of highest part of upward sloping entrance passage nay did even more for occasionally slopped over went trickling away in tiny stream down passage into open thus moistening soil at entrance creating mud in phil have detected spoor of numerous different kind of animal further circumstance at once arrested phil attention caused again to look sharply about be that surface of pool instead of being glass a one must naturally expect water to be in place completely sheltered from wind be considerably agitated a though creature of great bulk have recently be swimming in yet so far a must observe be only living creature in cavern must see to farthest extremity pretty clearly now that eye have become accustomed to comparatively dim light of torch moreover upon carefully examining rocky floor upon stood only wet footprint visible be of ape have recently beaten so precipitate retreat from cavern phil be quite certain that creature have not be indulging in swim for be prepared to swear that brute fur be perfectly dry when dashed past on way across glade so far a ape be concerned sign indicated that have waded into water far enough to bend down drink then have be suddenly very badly frightened again phil gazed about searching obscurity on far side of cave now noticed that there be passage over there roughly circular hole about five foot in diameter running still farther into heart of rock thought must like to get across explore hole how be to do so of course might swim across water that idea did not appeal to for meant risking extinguishment of torch also must not very well carry torch bow arrow in one hand while swimming with other be by time much too wise to go poking about in strange place without weapon must certainly not do rather than be guilty of so foolish act a to discard weapon must leave hole on other side unexplored that alternative too be distinctly distasteful to young englishman once more raised torch carefully examined wall of cavern to see if must find way of getting to other side without being obliged to swim across now that be definitely looking for saw that there be something in nature of narrow ledge running along left side of chamber at height of about six inch above water surface by mean of aided by roughness of cavern wall believed must scramble over to other side at once determined to make attempt noticing at same time without attaching particular significance to fact that agitation of surface of pond have so far subsided that there be now merest suggestion of ripple on when stukely reached ledge by mean of proposed to essay passage to far side of cavern found to satisfaction that be quite well defined projection running entire length of wall apparently nowhere le than four inch wide while there be place where widened out to nearly foot in breadth also surface of wall be so rough that irregularity must afford excellent grip for one hand therefore returning to quiver arrow have thus far be holding in readiness for sudden emergency slinging bow over shoulder so that might have one hand quite free to cling by young man set foot upon ledge began to make way cautiously across have accomplished rather more than distance across when suddenly felt water surge up over foot ankle upon looking down saw to consternation that be once more violently agitated swirling eddy upon surface plainly indicating presence of powerful disturbing influence at bottom of pool then a phil continued to gaze influence revealed a shapeless fawn coloured something imperfectly seen through disturbed water next moment enormous head emerged pair of monstrous jaw gaped widely air of cavern at once became again surcharged with disgusting effluvium phil have once before observed a stukely gazed fascinated at terrifying object have thus suddenly appeared became aware that creature be dazzled to extent discomfited by light of torch for lid of immense goggle eye blinked incessantly a returned phil gaze taking immediate advantage of young man thrust torch toward a far a must reach with immediate result that great head again sank out of sight only for few brief second however young englishman availed of few second to scramble along remainder of ledge reach point for be aiming now proved to be sloping surface of rock about twenty foot broad leading up from water to circular opening stukely have be so anxious to explore now that be there be ready to execrate folly for not having retraced step along ledge made good escape by way of mouth of cavern instead of continuing journey a have done for ill judged action have resulted in placing at wrong end of cavern to escape must be obliged to make way along whole of narrow ledge again with possibility that monster recovering from discomfiture might snatch off before have traversed distance phil felt that with horrible possibility a confronting simply must not essay return passage along ledge indeed be not afforded opportunity for have scarcely reached broad slope of rock leading up to circular tunnel have be so anxious to explore when surface of pool again became violently agitated monstrous head again appeared followed time by enormous body four thick clumsy leg tail with ponderous rush creature at once made for spot where stukely stood phil without waiting for further development incontinently turned tail stooping bolted up tunnel like opening comforting assurance coming to that so monstrous beast must not possibly enter so comparatively small passage moreover be right for after running few foot looked back over shoulder saw that although beast have head a far a eye into opening must advance farther then summoning courage to aid retraced step plucking arrow from quiver poised in hand for moment must not use bow a be too long to be drawn in so confined space then hurled with strength straight at beast left eye missile flew true indeed must scarcely miss at such exceedingly short range buried length in great blinking orb whereupon with bellowing roar that echoed reverberated like thunder in underground chamber monstrous head be suddenly withdrawn next moment sound of tremendous splashing told hardy assailant that enemy have precipitately retreated to depth of pool then acting more by instinct than reason phil rushed back along way have come out of tunnel on to along ledge heedless of violent disturbance of water told of convulsive movement of enormous shape hidden beneath surface so back to cavern entrance out of rushed almost a precipitately a ape have done hour earlier wonder thought young man that poor beast be frightened if happened to catch glimpse of monster of pool two hour later turned up at spot where little party have made temporary camp beside river nonchalantly flung to ground carcass of guazu puti deer have chanced to encounter on way back found that dick vilcamapata have made good use of time during absence for have not only found splendid tree out of to fashion canoe have actually felled there lay within couple of hundred foot of river ready to be hewn into shape hollowed out have be away long time remarked dick gramfer here be seriously discussing desirability of starting out to look for have found game scarce game of kind be after yes game of very different sort answered stukely fact be dick continued have have quite interesting afternoon for have discovered cliff carved over with picture that there be nobody to look at why yes now that come to think of of picture show very beast dear phil remonstrated dick be talking to to because if latter let remind that in least understand what be referring to laughed stukely of course in good time friend hurry man cattle thou wilt understand when explain know then o most matter of fact dick have day seen sight two sight to be strictly truthful will cause thee to open thine eye in amazement first of be a have already said cliff pictured over face with strange wonderful sculpture doubtless tell story if one have wit to read that reminds that ought to take ancient along with when go to see to morrow may be able to interpret meaning to now among picture there be one depicting a read man being thrown to huge monstrous beast inside cave in same cliff not only found beast narrowly escaped being devoured by fortunately for there happened to be hole in rock big enough for to enter not big enough for when must fain have followed head got stuck fast in opening in position being at mercy drove arrow into left eye escaped while be endeavouring to free therefrom must go together to morrow dick see wonder for be worth seeing warrant thee dick chichester however be not to be satisfied with such bald incomplete statement a foregoing accordingly when sat down hour later to take last meal for day stukely gave full true particular account of entire afternoon adventure be agreed then there that first business of following day must be visit to sculptured rock slaying of strange monstrous beast accordingly on following morning immediately after early breakfast trio set out arriving in due course at glade lay at foot of cliff a usual approached open space with utmost precaution be thus enabled to secure antelope one of small herd happened to be grazing there at moment of arrival killed creature not because required for food because phil be of opinion that carcass might serve a bait for enticement of monster out of pool thus enabling to get fair shot at having dragged dead animal to mouth of cave next proceeded to examine at leisure sculptured face of rock vilcamapata at once unhesitatingly pronounced to be work of wonderful being whom indian be looking for from across great water to deliver from power of hated spaniard restore to undisputed possession of own country be unable to interpret meaning of sculpture beyond stating vaguely that like many others existing in country undoubtedly portrayed certain custom mode of life peculiar to race who inhabited country long before indian came into then having at length satisfied curiosity by gazing fill at curious scene set forth in imperishable porphyry entered cavern inspected pool surface of be still agitated showing that tenant be restless a indeed might be expected then returning to where have left carcass of deer dragged far enough into cavern to enable monster just to reach by completely emerging from pool then stringing bow satisfying that priming of pistol be a must be calmly sat down to await issue for more than hour waited in vain for beyond occasional stirring of water caused to overflow momentarily trickle down slope of approach nothing happened then troop of small monkey suddenly approached cavern seeing human occupant bolted loudly chattering indignation fright shortly afterward deer came tripping daintily across glade halted suddenly threw up head after sniffing air for few second wheeled smartly round bounded back into forest hour passed be discussing in low tone advisability of adopting other plan for enticement of great beast from lair when heard sudden rippling splashing of water in interior of cave followed by low moan gust of offensive effluvium phil have noticed on previous day then still more violent splashing of water accompanied by quick rush of overflow sound of ponderous movement then looming out of darkness there vaguely appeared enormous shape coming slowly cautiously toward carcass of deer in moment have advanced sufficiently to enable watcher to observe shape of monstrous head phil saw that in way creature have managed to free of arrow have implanted in left eye on preceding day brute have doubtless lost use of eye for must now be seen that be closed that small trickle of blood be flowing from between lid a slowly advanced beast moaned frequently while disgusting odour exhaled momentarily became stronger have be agreed that if beast must be enticed out of water three of hunter must at given signal discharge arrow at right eye trio be now standing with bow fully bent awaiting signal moment brute slightly raised head halted a though suspicious of danger slight raising of head be just what be required to enable perfect aim to be taken phil at once gave word shoot loud practically simultaneous twanging of three bow be instantly followed by hideous roar in moment great beast bellowing horribly came charging right out of cave crushing to death adventurous enemy a did so for three have only just time to dodge behind projection of rock when monster rushed past at lumbering trot to stumble roll over just a reached open for moment trio thought that in unaccountable manner must have missed aim for a creature passed be unable to see portion of shaft of arrow protruding from remaining eye too be now closed presently concluded that with momentum imparted to by exceedingly powerful bow arrow must have completely buried in monster eyeball at event be perfectly evident that missile have got home somewhere for huge creature be now rolling bellowing in agony a clawed frantically at eye with immense foot be distressing sight to see such enormous animal suffering so intensely so presently phil dick ran out put fresh arrow to bow stood at distance of about dozen pace from beast watching for opportunity to plant arrow in heart came after while beast subsiding at last into quiescence a though exhausted upon instant dick phil drew bow to fullest possible extent arrow flew straight to mark with tremendous convulsive shudder last moaning bellow enormous brute stretched out on grass dead then proceeded to examine creature at leisure at respectful distance for odour exhaled be so overpowering that found impossible to approach carcass nearer than within three four yard head be somewhat like of alligator immensely larger enormous jaw slightly open disclosed two row of huge teeth similar to of alligator monstrous head be joined to body by neck a long proportionately a of horse body be lizard like in shape humpbacked have four very thick lizard like leg foot terminating in four long toe armed with formidable claw tail be nearly a long a body thick deep blunt sort of serrated fin ran whole length of body from nape of neck to extremity of tail total length from snout to tail a lay stretched out on grass be just trifle over twenty two pace when have at length satisfied curiosity by exhaustively examining enormous carcass agreed must be that of identical beast portrayed in carved picture on cliff face of one precisely similar procured torch having lighted proceeded to examine thoroughly interior of cavern in outer chamber that contained pool surface of be now perfectly placid mirrorlike there be nothing to see beyond what have already be described after brief glance round therefore passed over to far side by mean of rock ledge along margin of pool entered tunnel like passage in phil have taken temporary refuge on previous day proved to be about one hundred foot long gave access to chamber of such immense dimension that standing just within holding three torch high above head be unable to see opposite wall roof be wonderful cavern worth travelling long distance to see for upon examination discovered that wall a high up a light of torch must enable to see be most elaborately sculptured in high relief with figure of men woman animal tree representation of spacious landscape with building even sea with rising setting sun partially obscured by cloud remarkable thing about sculpture be that be very much more finely artistically executed than outside representation be much more true to nature detail of clothing be rendered with most minute elaboration exactitude there be also evidence of knowledge understanding of perspective for first quarter of hour so of inspection be unable to obtain clue to purpose to enormous chamber have originally be put reason must induce person rather number of person for single individual must possibly have produced whole of work even if have devoted entire lifetime to to spend time in laboriously executing such work in situation where must seem that must be seldom never seen by by when explorer arrived at far end of chamber saw that be neither more le than immense temple for there in very centre of wall be most beautifully elaborately sculptured niche within be enshrined lifesize figure in black marble of man in carving of unknown sculptor seemed to have reached very summit of perfection of art for with most scrupulous precise fidelity have succeeded in reproducing minutest detail texture wrinkle of skin finger toe nail course of vein even curl in long hair bushy beard drooping moustache figure have originally be executed nude whether from consideration of modesty for glorification of idol have afterwards be clothed in most elaborate costume consisting of tunic confined to waist by belt cloak sandal tunic be made of kind of fine canvas crumbled away when touched mantle be of feather of most gorgeous hue sandal be of delicate kind of leather dressed with hair on a well a tunic belt be encrusted with minute scale of dull ruddy yellow metal proved to be virgin gold scale be not only sewn on to material be also sewn to other be due to latter fact doubt that garment have not powdered away long ago eye of idol consisted of two large green polished stone looked so much like emerald indeed be that vilcamapata offering objection two young englishman determined to appropriate a well a gold scale with result that left figure denuded of finery from artistic point of view at least far more worthy of admiration than be before spent quite two hour in wonderful cavern when at length emerged into daylight once more found that already whole army of vulture have gathered about carcass of strange monstrous beast be busily engaged in devouring malodorous flesh trio made wide circuit so a not to disturb obscene bird at disgusting banquet in due time found way back again to camp where after hearty meal set to work in earnest upon construction of canoe chapter twelve how two adventurer lost companion to hew hollow canoe out of solid tree trunk be sufficiently formidable task for two men to undertake when posse more suitable tool than hanger hanger being weapon very similar to more modern cutlas although two englishman have already done similar piece of work once before be therefore not altogether lacking in experience although vilcamapata taught how to hollow out hull expeditiously after be properly shaped by use of fire cost phil dick very nearly month strenuous labour to get new craft to liking when be finished be very good canoe indeed much more shapely than made by indian hull be so thin that although measured about eighteen foot long over by four foot beam be light enough to be carried easily distance of two three mile if need be by two englishman vilcamapata being too old feeble to be capable of lending assistance in work of sort at work be finished craft be taken down to river put in water found to float true a buoyantly a egg shell trio therefore put few belonging into not forgetting two fine emerald gold scale taken from idol embarked resumed journey be now on headwater of river have rise somewhere on eastern slope of andes water be icy cold being in fact nothing drainings from enormous glacier must be seen forty mile away clinging to side of majestic peak towered nearly twenty thousand foot into deep blue of tropic sky be blessing rather than otherwise for although be not yet down among plain weather be intensely hot being now immediately under equator coldness of water helped somewhat to mitigate stifling heat between two great wall of forest bordered river on hand sail be needed for be now travelling with stream being a yet little more than mountain torrent ran rapidly so that paddle over stern to keep craft in midstream be be necessary although stream ran at rate of fully six mile hour progress be not by mean a speedy a one might at first suppose for rapid occurred at frequent interval if be found to be impassable became necessary to carry canoe past through forest plan however be only resorted to in extreme case for if upon examination be deemed at possible to shoot rapid be shot a sometimes happened a often a three four time day adventurer soon acquired degree of dexterity in art that must have regarded a perfectly amazing at beginning of journey on evening of fifth day of journey down river chanced to camp at spot afforded exceptionally fine view of mountain range to westward when on following morning rose to prepare for day journey saw that terrific thunderstorm be raging about halfway up eastern slope of range be magnificent sight cloud black a night below brilliantly illuminated by sun above clinging to mountain spur in enormous mass rolled together parted rolled together again like charging squadron while lightning keen vivid a molten steel incessantly darted from black breast like flash of platoon of musketry while elemental warfare be raging furiously up there among mountain be brilliant weather where wanderer be camped with not breath of wind to assuage torrid heat stukely happened to make remark upon contrast to vilcamapata to old man replied yes be well for that be here rather than there for storm might well mean death for must be watchful to day lord for storm cover many mile of country rain be falling in torrent unless be greatly mistaken most of will find way into river therefore must be on guard against sudden spate may overwhelm if be caught unawares englishman agreed nothing further be said about matter for be busy making preparation for day in due time embarked proceeded on journey about midday in confirmation of old peruvian word first of expected spate revealed in sudden acceleration of current change in appearance of water became turbid with mud in suspension yet although speed of current continued to increase gradually merely helped voyager on way for now seemed to have reached stretch of river be entirely free from rapid nothing of kind having be encountered since start in early morning swiftly canoe sped down river running now at rate of good nine mile hour occupant rejoiced exceedingly for be getting over a much ground in single hour a sometimes cost whole day to cover began to make light of precaution have observed during earlier hour of day told other with glee if be worst spate must do must welcome one day so long a be bound downstream indeed be speedy travelling compared with what have be accustomed to be like journeying by postchaise after travelling in market wagon country swept past at speed almost made giddy a watched while motion of canoe be smooth easy a of cradle then a whirled round bend suddenly without warning found sweeping through gorge with vertical rocky fern grown bank on hand too well knew what that sort of thing be prelude to there be rapid ahead almost to dead certainty have missed chance of inspecting before attempting to shoot for there be landing on of vertical bank while a for returning to point where landing be possible might a well have attempted to fly well there be one thing for if there be indeed rapid ahead must do best to shoot without usual preliminary inspection be growing quite accustomed to kind of work now ought not to be so very difficult accordingly dick placed in bow of canoe phil stationed amidships armed with long pole used to bear canoe off rock when shooting rapid while peruvian perched up in stern with short steering paddle in hand presently expected rapid swung into view ahead sufficiently formidable sight presented be difficult nay impossible to tell how far extended for bend of river shut out view there be at least mile of in plain sight narrow channel of foaming leaping water with black head of rock showing occasionally here there amid foam dick drew foot up under raised to full height in crank cockleshell of canoe in order that might obtain a extended view a possible of what lay before be admittedly far more expert canoeist of two especially when came to shooting rapid therefore on such occasion post be always in bow then becomes post of honour of responsibility what saw be by mean reassuring there be far too much spouting foaming water for taste for such appearance invariably indicated rock submerged to extent of few inch at utmost contact with of meant at least destruction of canoe if worse mishap true in almost stretch of rapid there exists what may be termed by courtesy channel be to say there be passage more le tortuous between rock where water be deep enough to float canoe if one can hit off in time channel passage be usually distinguishable by comparative smoothness of water in so that if navigator can guide canoe fairly into by time that rapid be actually reached stand very fair chance of accomplishing run in safety although even then must be continually on alert since turn be often so sharp that unless taken at precisely right moment canoe may be dashed with destructive violence against obstructing rock be part of bowman pilot to look out for such rock bear canoe off with long pole invariably wielded at length dick believed saw beginning of such channel close under right bank of river waved vilcamapata to steer canoe toward minute more little craft have darted in between two formidable wall of leaping water be speeding downward at speed of fully fifteen mile hour with dick phil standing upright thrusting long pole first to one side then other a chichester experienced eye detected sign mark presence of dangerous rock to right left signalled accordingly to cry out be utterly useless roar hiss of tortured water be far too loud to render even voice of stentor audible behind pilot must watch motion act accordingly two minute of strenuous labour brought to bend in river dick knew must be one of most critical point in whole run for be difficult enough to follow turn of channel even when course of river be straight when river a well a channel bend be difficult indeed to avoid disaster still dick remained perfectly cool possessed certainty success with have piloted canoe through unknown half mile of chaotic leaping rushing water have given more confidence in than rest of experience put together felt that unless something quite unexpected out of common happened there be reason why must not accomplish remainder of run in safety held up hand a warning to behind to be extra vigilant for be at what be probably most dangerous point of run next instant waved to peruvian to swerve canoe powerfully to left indian obeyed to best of ability be old strength be nothing like what have be little craft did not swerve quite smartly enough to carry clear of rock lay in course therefore out shot dick long pole moment that felt jar of upon rock threw whole weight upon in attempt to save canoe shock be tremendous canoe be turned violently broadside on to current at critical moment dick pole snapped clean in two recoil sending youngster headlong into boiling current while next moment canoe swept up against submerged rock be rolled over over remaining occupant be flung into swirl moment dick felt pole snap in hand knew that capsize be inevitable with instinct belongs to accomplished swimmer at once made up mind what must be best thing for to do if must manage to get into centre of main current must probably retain position there so swim remainder of distance to lower end of rapid in safety provided that must avoid rock there be use in looking out for others be a well able to take care of a be besides must stand better chance apart than together in mad turmoil a for canoe must take chance probably must be smashed to splinter if so must only mean making of one true must involve month delay time of late have seemed to lose value for be bound for definite goal must assuredly reach sooner later loss of month two seemed mere trifle not worth consideration accordingly moment dick rose to surface shook foam spray from eye glanced round verified position at once struck out powerfully for comparatively smooth water indicated main current noting a did so that phil peruvian be swimming strongly that canoe full of water be slowly rolling over over a drove along through worst of broken water five minute of desperate struggle during have time to think of anything own safety during have several very narrow escape of being dashed violently against rock sustaining serious injury if not being killed outright suddenly found in smooth water with canoe swinging hither thither in eddy close beside to swim to proceed to push before toward nearest bank be instinctive act with dick presently have satisfaction of grounding on small strip of shingly beach where there be slight back eddy then looked about for other two presently caught sight of phil little lower down swimming slowly supporting vilcamapata apparently senseless form phil looked a though be rather in difficulty so dick at once plunged in again swam to assistance ten minute later three of be ashore again about mile lower down river than spot where canoe have be beached be afraid gramfer here be rather badly hurt gasped phil a dick lifted insensible form of peruvian to top of low bank evidently have be dashed against rock stunned if not worse continued pointing to very ugly jagged wound in right temple from blood be welling pretty freely noticed a drove past that have saved canoe do think must manage to go back fetch down dick case of medicament be in if thwart to be lashed have not gone adrift must be very glad to have just now dost thou mind art too tired not bit of answered dick of course will go with pleasure will be glad to hear that so far at least a must see craft be not damaged at of course paddle be lost except one gramfer there have stuck to so tenaciously so must borrow from stooped down with difficulty loosened grip of unconscious man hand on steering paddle have doubt unconsciously retained in grip ever since capsize will be back a quickly a possible concluded dick a struck off into bush just there bordered river returned again in about hour with canoe intact nothing having be lost paddle be only article happened to have be loose in when capsized with quick finger cast loose small medicine case phil have taken ashore with on occasion of ill fated landing at cartagena have carried about with ever since carefully enwrapped like powder horn in portion of shirt liberally smeared with caoutchouc juice to exclude moisture poor old vilcamapata be still insensible when dick returned phil be looking exceedingly anxious about production of medicine case soon altered matter few minute later old man be sitting up looking about dazedly at first seemed not to recognise phil dick to be able to remember what have happened gradually came back to when phil asked how felt replied that be fatigued desired to sleep accordingly young medico bathed wound with water from river applied healing ointment to bound up with what remained of shirt then made up temporary couch for sufferer under shadow of bush left to sleep a long a must while dick went off in search of game phil proceeded to carve pair of new paddle to cut couple of new pole when dick returned from hunting expedition two hour later with small deer brace of guinea fowl found that vilcamapata be still asleep while phil be putting finishing touch to new paddle peruvian appeared have scarcely moved since fell asleep there be peculiarity in manner of breathing be causing stukely good deal of anxiety be rather afraid explained phil that poor old man have sustained internal injury in addition to wound on head if so may have trouble with will let sleep a long a will for sleep be great restorer breathing difficulty may disappear when awakes sits up when doe will subject to very careful examination be most unfortunate that pole broke dick for believe must have shot rapid in perfect safety while phil completed paddle dick set to work to light fire break up deer prepare guinea fowl for cooking still injured man slept on breathing ever growing more laboured stertorous until at length difficulty with drew breath awakened with groan strove to raise in instant stukely be by side slipping arm beneath shoulder raised old man to sitting position with back supported by stiff branch of bush under shadow of have be sleeping while be making poor old fellow a comfortable a must enquired solicitously how felt vilcamapata only looked at blankly murmured few word in tongue be quite unintelligible to listener then with gentle touch phil began to pas hand cautiously over patient body searching for possible fractured rib similar injury old man waved impatiently away presently broke forth in low crooning sort of chant day be done murmured wandering be at end father sun mother moon call must depart for island of blessed that father sometimes deigns to show floating afar in serene sky of eventide spirit be weary longs for rest full forty year have be outcast wanderer in land once belonged to people during year friendly face have ever beheld no friendly voice have ever reached mine ear until day when two white men saved from fire of pegwi indian to have be since then a son nay more than son for there be time when dreamed that whom fair young giant call phil might be father manco capac returned to earth to deliver people from thraldom of spaniard to day have mine eye be opened know of surety that manco will never return to earth to deliver people whose doom be to disappear gradually from off face of earth be known more therefore listen unto o ye who have be a son to in day of loneliness old age ye crave for gold stone gleam in light white bright a star green a young grass spring to life after rain of winter red a heart blood of warrior in blindness dreamed that ye sought a mean whereby ye might obtain power to drive out spaniard from fair land of inca restore to from whom be wrongfully taken in day of great calamity there arose one who prophesied that in latter day father manco must return to earth do thing therefore be great treasure of gold stone secretly gathered together from mine known only to own people securely hidden from spaniard in order that when manco came might have abundance of wealth wherewith to buy arm food clothing for army to day know that prophet who foretold thing be false prophet that hidden treasure will never be needed for accomplishment of purpose for be gathered also be last of who knew secret of hiding place if pas away taking secret with treasure will be lost wasted useless remaining for ever undiscovered therefore hearken now unto o ye who have be to a son in last day of mine old age when spirit leaf withered shell a be about to do ye will build funeral pyre lay body thereon put fire thereto for by fire be thing purified on wing of flame will spirit mount soar away to happy isle where be sin sorrow suffering other evil thing will ye do to night with rising of to morrow sun ye will resume journey down

cuzco until ye sight sorata mighty snow clad crest there under sorata morning shadow will ye find sacred lake there be island in lake lie in centre of lake be island ye must seek for on stand ruined temple of sun beneath great marble floor of lie lie yea great lord father come sinking back among branch of bush supported vilcamapata one time priest of sun closed eye a torrent of blood gushed from mouth quietly passed away internal haemorrhage exclaimed stukely a lightly laid finger upon pulseless wrist feared yes a passed hand over body three of rib be broken jagged end have doubtless lacerated internal organ lung perhaps well be dead beyond question now remains for to do dick be to dispose of body in accordance with instruction altogether like idea of building pyre just here must see if can not find suitable spot about quarter of mile away know perfectly suitable spot about distance from here answered dick passed through on way back to camp about hour ago come will show to there be plenty of dry wood there there be path by can easily carry body to better make litter perhaps take with now stukely eagerly concurred in view at once proceeded to construct litter of bough bound together with liana upon when be finished laid attenuated form of old man with measured step slow bore to spot where mortal frame be to undergo typical purging by fire place be one of perfectly open clearing be so frequently met with in south american forest be about ten acre in extent roughly circular in shape be carpeted with thick grass deer other grazing animal kept close cropped consequently be well adapted for purpose to be about to be put since by erecting pyre in centre of clearing there must be risk of setting adjoining forest ablaze laying litter burden down in convenient position just within clearing two englishman plunged back into forest using hanger a ax vigorously proceeded to hew down dry dead branch underwood must find for afternoon be waning apace be essential that flame must be kindled in time to allow of returning to camping place by daylight fortunately there be lack of suitable material close at hand hour arduous work sufficed to provide sufficiency for purpose then proceeded to build pyre laying smallest branch at bottom intermingled with plenty of dry brushwood putting thickest branch on top then on top of placed body phil next proceeded to make fire in usual way by rubbing two stick together be soon done fire be inserted into heart of pyre by mean of aperture left for purpose then when whole be fairly alight phil dick bared head fell upon knee with simple faith so strongly characterised religious feeling of time humbly commended soul of vilcamapata to mercy of god who gave by time that have finished petition pile be mass of flame roared crackled fiercely a shot straight upward in still evening air with last parting glance at body must be seen shrivelling in midst of flame turned silently wended way back to camping place thus passed vilcamapata last of ancient peruvian priest of sun with two men only of alien blood alien religion to perform last sacred rite for on following morning having breakfasted completed preparation for immediate departure two young englishman feeling strangely lonely walked over to spot where funeral pyre have be built inspected what remained of found that have be completely consumed to very last twig upon searching among white ash found calcined skull few fragment of larger bone gathered carefully together reverently buried after having now done be possible to preserve remains of late friend from desecration returned to camp embarked in canoe resumed voyage down river following fortnight proved quite uneventful for two adventurer journeyed on down river at average rate of about twenty mile day from time to time encountered rapid cataract together shooting most of former of course being compelled to carry canoe down past latter have by time become so thoroughly accustomed to negotiation of rapid waterfall that have long since ceased to regard passage of one other a adventure true saw few indian occasionally generally beat hasty retreat when white men appeared remained concealed until canoe two occupant now garbed like savage in skin of beast have disappeared round next bend in river a foretold by vilcamapata reached much mightier river maranon on afternoon of twelfth day there pleasant journeying with current ceased henceforward current must again be enemy instead of friend a have be of late inch of progress must have to be won either with assistance of sail by arduous toil with paddle luckily for have have prescience to bring sail along with when found obliged to abandon boat now reaped full reward of labour be glad that have resisted often repeated temptation to leave behind when encountered exceptionally difficult bit of road thanks to help afforded by strong breeze from north east end of second day journeying on maranon found seventy mile above spot where have struck river in territory have known of fierce warlike mayubuna indian have seen several party of during latter part of day contrary to usual custom of indian have thus far met with instead of running away at first sight of canoe mayubunas have stood on river bank watched progress manifesting fear of white on other hand displaying outward sign of hostility unless indeed fact that about hour before sunset large canoe have be manned at last village white men have passed have proceeded rapidly up river ahead of might be so construed unfortunately for did not so construe regarded rather a sporting attempt on part of number of indian bound up river to display superiority of paddle over sail be amused accordingly when upon rounding next bend of river two englishman sighted two large canoe full of indian ahead of one canoe paddling along close in with left bank while other a closely hugged right began for first time to suspect that be not quite a must be phil who be sitting idly amidships while dick sailed canoe rose to foot hailed in indian dialect have picked up from vilcamapata notice however be taken of hail be observed that sailing canoe be now gaining distinctly upon others encouraged by evidence of superior speed white men pressed on anxious to get into communication establish friendly relation with indian before be not until two canoe ahead suddenly swerved outward laid athwart hawse of sailing canoe a though to bar further progress that of occupant of latter thought of looking astern then realised that matter be indeed beginning to look serious for behind be no le than four large canoe containing twenty one men have evidently emerged from small creek about mile lower down be now drawing near with unmistakably hostile intention look awkward dick exclaimed stukely seizing bow arrow surely can not seriously intend to try to stop if why be laying canoe across hawse like thicky demanded dick have better speak to bit phil ay will try answered stukely stepping into bow of canoe ostentatiously laid down weapon made usual sign of amity reply be yell of anger hatred from indian who be blocking way while one of springing to foot shouted go back dog of spaniard go back be land of mayubuna will permit spaniard to set foot upon soil have desire to be swallowed up a atahuallpa people be after have welcomed to country therefore go back die take for spaniard explained phil to dick raising hand shouted back people of mayubuna be mistaken be not spaniard be enemy of spaniard friend of who hate be on way up river to fight now beg to give free passage through land also little cassava laugh of derision greeted statement indian who have just spoken shouted in reply lie dog son of dog be spaniard for skin be light like one of have beard suddenly raising bow speaker discharged arrow at phil whizzed past within inch of gentleman ear make a though intended to run down canoe ordered phil then seizing bow fitting arrow to string answered fool be english tell deadly enemy of spaniard therefore let pas in peace otherwise must make passage for ourselves by force of arm reply to be scornful laugh flight of arrow from indian in two opposing canoe by miracle phil again escaped although le than five arrow lodged in puma skin tunic be wearing sail of canoe be literally riddled with felt that matter be getting beyond joke that time for fair speaking be past time for action have arrived so raising bow drew arrow to head aimed full at breast of indian who have addressed so abusively for single moment hesitated then released arrow next moment with shaft buried so deep in body that point protruded nearly foot out of back savage flung up arm reeled backward fell into water capsizing canoe in have be standing a did so chapter thirteen how fell into hand of mayubuna yell expressive in about equal proportion of amazement at strength must drive arrow very nearly through body of man fury against audacious slayer of man who happened to be cacique immediately arose from occupant of companion canoe to be almost immediately succeeded by loud cry of dismay a sudden swirl rush along surface of stream toward spot where occupant of capsized canoe be splashing in water betrayed presence of hungry alligator paddle be dashed into water with frantic energy a occupant of other canoe abandoning attempt to bar passage of englishman whirled craft round sped to assistance of friend alligator be beforehand with for before must reach spot where capsized canoe floated bottom up surrounded by crew two piercing shriek be followed by abrupt disappearance of two indian beneath surface of water few second later third indian vanished in same terrible manner caiman be among shouted stukely to dick be chance to get past lad starboard helm little so steady keep at now if be vindictively inclined must hamper effort very considerably by galling with arrow a slip past let be perhaps lesson have already have will teach folly of interfering with englishman mayubuna however have not yet received full lesson for when canoe of must be rescuer dashed in among swimmer latter frantic with fear of alligator seized gunwale made such frenzied reckless effort to scramble into despite warning cry of occupant too be instantly capsized now blind senseless panic seized in instant upon indian present for shriek after shriek told that alligator be still busy while remaining four canoe have also be hastening to rescue suddenly paused evidently fearful lest if approached scene of disaster too might be involved in meanwhile englishman taking fullest possible advantage of situation slid at safe distance past spot where indian be struggling in water in vain effort to right canoe climb into favoured by freshening breeze pursued way up river although have escaped for moment phil dick still have plenty of cause for anxiety for have by time be long enough in wild to have learned that when indian be hostile hostility be very bitter pertinacious must scarcely hope that having mistaken for spaniard who at time be more feared hated than other earthly thing by indian mayubuna must be satisfied with issue of first encounter with white men moreover to add to difficulty of said white men evening be now drawing on apace sun have already sunk so low that beam be unable to pierce forest on right hand while orange glow suffused tree top on left told a plainly a word that great luminary be within brief half hour of setting unfortunately there be moon just then while without light of moon be impossible to use river at night must therefore be imperatively necessary for to seek quickly place of concealment wherein to pas night if wished to avoid being overtaken by darkness on river therefore now proceeded to look anxiously about for place eventually when brief twilight of tropic be closing down upon scene firefly be beginning to appear sighted spot while by mean ideal for purpose might possibly be made to serve lay about hundred yard up small creek branching out of main stream a be only spot at suitable have seen since encounter with indian really have choice to avail of consisted of little grassy mead of about two acre in extent lying quite open to view from main river surface of soil being not more than foot above of water with rush to form screen therefore if be to camp there for night a indeed must there being apparently other place for must have to manage a best must without fire wherewith to cook supper need must under certain circumstance so with glance astern to assure that be not being followed sail be lowered canoe be turned into creek minute later voyager be ashore glancing keenly about to ascertain possibility of place be rather better than first glance have led wanderer to hope for for first necessity be to find hiding place for canoe there about hundred fifty yard away be clump of detached bush must serve admirably for such purpose so availing of very last of waning light hauled canoe out of water hoisted upon shoulder carrying to clump of bush very effectively concealed therein afterwards going back over trail through grass carefully obliterating by mean of leafy branch in manner have learned from vilcamapata then looked about for spot in might pas night place be by mean ideal one for fugitive to pas night in for there be nothing even remotely resembling hiding place that must see concealment be just then what wanted more than anything else true there be enormous ceiba tree growing upon very edge of clearing among upper branch of might possibly be able to conceal in absence of anything more suitable at length determined to avail of braving peril of possible jaguar scorpion snake ant other undesirable bedfellow accordingly two friend ascended to lower branch of tree by climbing liana hand over hand depended conveniently from bough working way aloft a well a must in thick darkness created by luxuriant foliage at length established quite safely comfortably in fork formed by junction of two enormous branch with parent stem have food with be possessed of healthy hunger for have eaten nothing since midday be also exceedingly tired be not long before forgot hunger in profound sleep probably must not have slept so soundly have known that have unwittingly entered trap have for indian whom have encountered shortly before knew that part of river perfectly be fully aware that difficulty of navigation be such that fugitive must not possibly proceed very far in darkness also knew that spot where dick phil have landed be only one within many mile where upstream landing be possible therefore conjectured shrewdly that since white men must arrive at spot just about nightfall must be certain to land there took measure accordingly first of to make everything quite sure sent messenger on to next village fifteen mile up river to inform cacique of presence of two white men in neighbourhood to request that watch for must be kept with view to capture requested further that in event of white men being captured must be sent back down river to pay penalty for having caused death of seventeen mayubuna indian then having by mean ensured capture of fugitive in event of succeeding by chance in forcing way up river in darkness launched manned four canoe containing ten men four canoe spreading right across river so that nothing must possibly pas downstream undetected proceeded to make way cautiously up river to spot where knew be morally certain that white men must must land be nearly eight o'clock at night when four canoe arrived at spot for be bound be then of course much too dark for to see anything therefore troubled not at to search for sign of white men presence assumed that be there somewhere at once with infinite precaution proceeded to surround open plateau cunningly concealing in long grass dozen of lay immediately beneath overhanging branch of ceiba tree arrived there so silently that even if dick phil have be awake must have heard nothing now there be probably creature in world of ours more vindictive than angry indian particular mayubuna indian considered that have ample cause for anger against two white men whom be taking so much trouble to capture for have not same white men be directly responsible for loss of seventeen male mayubuna life among south american indian who even then be beginning from variety of cause to die out nothing be so valuable a life of male female care nothing about may live die a please therefore who be responsible for sacrifice of le than seventeen men life must receive punishment severity of must be proportionate to enormity of crime consequently not one of indian closed eye for moment throughout long hour of night with first hint of approaching dawn long before of occupant of ceiba be awake be keenly looking about for sign of white men presence for time however looked in vain for englishman have learned few of way of wild from vilcamapata have succeeded in obliterating track so completely that even sharp eye of savage failed to detect by by when be broad daylight one of mayubuna who have recognised possibility of concealment afforded by ceiba detected spot here there on two of depending liana where small strip of bark have be freshly torn off a though somebody have very recently climbed up to immediately directed attention of rest with result that soon became practical certainty that fugitive be somewhere in tree having be determined certain of mayubuna young men of party anxious to distinguish proposed to climb tree forthwith bring white men down dead alive cacique in command of party who happened to have be in one of attacking canoe on preceding night have therefore already have experience of prowess of hunted men at once vetoed plan a being far too dangerous besides for certain grim reason will in due time appear wanted quarry to be taken alive unhurt if possible therefore instead of permitting of men to climb tree so disposed round base of while far enough away to ensure that must not be seen by occupant during descent must be near enough to rush in effect capture of white men moment that set foot on ground meanwhile stukely chichester absolutely unconscious of elaborate preparation be being made for capture slept soundly on until sun be fairly above horizon when cry of bird in neighbouring branch of tree aroused to fact that day have arrived that be high time for to descend from lofty hiding place proceed with preparation for resumption of journey accordingly began descent with observance of precaution past experience have taught unfortunately have not yet learned that when ascend tree in search of concealment be always advisable to descend other a might easily have done have thought of for a be case almost everywhere in south american forest tree grew so thickly together that might easily have travelled for mile without descending to ground merely by climbing along from branch to branch idea did not occur to therefore proceeded to lower gradually down giant trunk carefully inspecting what lay beneath before attempting to reach next branch below for first fifty foot so of descent however foliage of tree be so dense that completely shut out view of ground beneath by time that occasional glimpse of grassy glade below became visible be so near ground that a cunning cacique have anticipated be impossible for to detect hiding place of concealed indian at two adventurer reached lowest branch of here paused very carefully scrutinised ground beneath if knew how to obliterate track so did indian there be nothing visible to indicate presence of forty foe lurking in long grass below indeed anywhere within glade therefore with assurance begotten of conviction that have succeeded in hoodwinking foe of preceding evening boldly ran out along great spreading branch seized liana slid rapidly to ground to find skilfully noosed in lasso arm tightly confined to side moment that foot touched earth then despite frantic struggle to free from entangling lasso be instantly seized other rope of raw hide be deftly twisted about limb body until in le than minute be so tightly securely trussed up that must scarcely wag finger after be hoisted upon shoulder of four indian borne with song of triumph rejoicing to canoe into be tumbled with scant ceremony then with further song of triumph be swiftly transported back down river to village to captor belonged village be quite invisible from river being approached by mean of one of small short winding creek so frequently occur on south american river existence of seems so difficult to account for when upon canoe rounding bend place swung into view be seen to be of quite considerable extent consisting of fully one hundred palm leaf hut standing in open glade of about two hundred acre in extent part of be under cultivation being planted in almost equal proportion with banana yam cassava triumphant song shout of victorious expedition caused entire population of village to turn out swarm down to small strip of beach constituted landing place so when dick phil be lifted out of canoe beheld crowd of four five hundred indian men woman child crowded together to gaze upon jeer at jeer at did with more gusto when be seen that so tightly have bond be drawn about prisoner limb that when be set upon foot be unable to stand sank helplessly to ground with involuntary groan indian have already have enough of carrying stalwart prisoner especially dick who towered head shoulder above tallest of therefore when saw that be impossible for white men to stand have fathomed reason for helplessness loosed thong about prisoner foot leg allowed few minute pause for blood to circulate afresh few minute be surcharged with exquisite suffering for unfortunate victim bore with stoical silence composure when at cacique gave order for to rise march at once scrambled to foot proceeded in charge of dozen indian fully armed with pocunas blowpipe bow arrow of be doubtless poisoned with curare long spear in order followed by entire population friend be marched up through village to hut situated near northern extremity into be bundled while guard ranged round hut outside to frustrate attempt at escape unfortunate prisoner be by time suffering so acutely from tightness of ligature confined arm to body that be in mood for conversation just lay upon earthen floor of hut in silent torment luckily for be not called upon to endure very much longer for when have lain there about hour cacique appeared gave order that bond be to be loosed at same time warning that first indication of attempt to escape must be met by shower of arrow smallest scratch from must be followed by death of intolerable agony phil replied that under circumstance cacique might rest assured that such attempt must be made followed up assurance by asking why have be taken prisoner seeing that be not spaniard be enemy of spaniard therefore ought to be regarded a friend by who hated spaniard to statement cacique made reply simply turned on heel departed few minute later however two woman appeared bearing food portion of roast kid on plantain leaf cassava bread together with small gourd of what looked like sour milk set upon ground before prisoner phil dick agreed that in regard of woman there be more of pity than of hate during whole of day next friend be kept close prisoner on morning of third day of captivity be summoned from hut almost before have finished breakfast upon emerging be conducted to open space in middle of village where be assembled not only inhabitant of place seven eight hundred more who seemed to be visitor crowd generally be densely packed round side of quadrangle middle being kept clear by line of armed men who maintained order by free use of heavy club unhesitatingly drove into pit of stomach of unauthorised person who displayed undue eagerness to get good view of impending proceeding in middle of clear space sat cacique of village with two men apparently visitor on side of little apart from stood two other men one of whom phil immediately recognised a having be in one of canoe have attempted to bar progress up river little murmur of excited expectancy perhaps mingled with wonder swept through crowd a two prisoner be led forward halted in front of cacique quickly died away intense silence ensued be presently broken by cacique who addressing stukely said white man whence come whither be going when strove to force passage up river on evening of day before last come replied phil from island far away across great water so far that be voyaging whole moon more without sight of land business be to fight spaniard who be enemy a well a of indian twice have fought already once on great water where took from one of great canoe once again in one of town far away to north where took of great canoe with much gold of have robbed indian by mischance friend be left behind when comrade sailed away for time be in danger of falling into hand of spaniard then escaped from having canoe big enough to take across great water be obliged to remain in land having heard that there be many spaniard in land lying to southward determined to seek out take from a much a can get of gold have unrighteously taken from indian if story be true why did ye not tell instead of slaying many of people one of by arrow from bow rest by jaw of caiman demanded cacique nay why ask question of know answer retorted phil for be in one of canoe saw heard everything that passed did not make to leader sign of amity goodwill rejected called dog of spaniard bade go back by way that have come shot arrow led to trouble be that way in mayubuna treat who come to a friend how do know that ye come a friend demanded cacique when spaniard first appeared in land too said that came a friend of indian how have proved friendship by killing inca atahuallpa seizing kingdom by enslaving indian despoiling of that posse by ravaging country with fire sword nay believe not story if ye be not spaniard ye be white skinned even a be heart be evil full of guile like theirs if be foolish enough to listen to lying word must treat even a treated atahuallpa people there be only two of be in power moreover ye have slain caused to be slain seventeen men of mayubuna therefore will ye die not quickly easily little by little so that ye will die not once thousand time torment will be a honey to friend of whom ye have slain groan cry for mercy will be more pleasant to than song of bird go have spoken amid tumultuous shout of rejoicing from assembled multitude two englishman be conducted back to prison hut once more placed under strict guard for be trebly valuable now having be condemned to die by torture be seldom indeed that indian be afforded so delectable sight a of white man suffering unspeakably hideous torment with fiendish cleverness be designed to inflict maximum amount of pain human frame must possibly endure still continue to live moreover there be two of big strong men apparently in very pink of health condition must linger long endure unimaginable torment before succumbing sight of agony must be one long drawn out rapture to who be privileged to witness oh yes must be guarded well for escape now must mean lifelong disappointment to whole village guest must not only be kept safe health strength must be preserved intact therefore during remainder of day abundant supply of food be provided for be urged with utmost solicitude to partake of freely did for a phil remarked to dick strength be never of such vital importance to a now since be not to be supposed that be going to submit to be slowly tortured to death without at least making effort to escape for effort to be successful must keep well strong worst of be that be quite unable to obtain slightest inkling of form torture be to take men who guarded be willing enough to converse with upon general subject indeed be full of curiosity asked innumerable question respecting past adventure of englishman when came to talking about forthcoming festivity at once fell silent must not must not give slightest information well said phil at conclusion of long conversation with jailer be at least unbound hand foot be free before suffer to be again tied up good many of mayubuna be going to die say ditto to replied dick rising to foot stretching long limb a though to test strength action by by at once brought guard facing round with spear poised bow bent so alert be to act upon slightest thing seemed to hint at attempt to escape yet be precisely problem be exercising mind of two white men through day succeeding night three time during night did make tentative effort to escape watchfulness of gaoler without success one thing however be pretty evident be that torture might be nature be to begin on morrow for village be in perfect ferment of excitement day through night too for matter people be constantly coming going in crowd past hut merely for sake apparently of getting casual peep at prisoner a passed with nightfall great fire be lighted in square singing dancing went on through night a fitting introduction to entertainment of following day at length after sleepless night of intense anxiety on part of prisoner a have be said more than one unavailing effort to elude vigilance of guard morning dawned of day be to see prisoner begin to die with rising of sun excitement hilarity of village became still more pronounced crowd grew more dense laughter conversation louder people have donned holiday attire such a be child chased other with joyous shout in out of throng then meal be brought to prisoner while be partaking of sudden clamour of drum horn arose laughing chattering crowd seemed to dissolve a suddenly from vicinity of prison hut leaving plunged in atmosphere of silence save for monotonous banging of drum blare of horn low humming murmur might be that of multitude of people conversing in low hushed voice mean that time have come suppose remarked stukely a set down food of have be partaking well keep up courage lad remember that if be to die will do so in fashion mayubuna will never forget so long a be people there be wife now who will be widow before sun go down for will never torture to death either lad if can help have hand free devon man can do much with hand alone when put to plan be to watch chance snatch first weapon come to hand make play with will doubt shoot down with arrow rather than let escape that kind of death will be infinitely preferable to one of lingering torture if die must yes agreed dick may depend upon to be interrupted by arrival of messenger who summoned guard to follow whereupon rose to foot completely hedged in by sixteen fully armed men be marched toward centre of village ultimately arriving in square where have previously be interviewed by cacique curious sight square presented on occasion for long street ran through from end to end of village be packed with people who have come in response to invitation from village within radius of twenty mile to see two white men die be ranged right along what may be called main street in dense crowd eight ten deep for distance of quarter of mile be arranged in two compact line with clear lane of about six foot wide between two line of people through gap have evidently be left open in one of line for especial purpose two prisoner be conducted into lane led to one extremity of where upon raised platform sat cacique with five men presumably cacique of neighbouring village on side of englishman be marched up to platform there left face to face with cacique friend guard retiring through gap by have entered thereupon be immediately closed for space of full five minute more phil dick stood facing cacique while profound impressive silence fell upon vast crowd of indian broken only by rustle of wind in tree top faint rumble caused by movement of naked foot of assembled multitude who be in grip of excitement so intense that apparently found impossible to stand quite still must need continually shift weight of body from one foot to other at length when pause have become almost unbearably impressive cacique rose to foot lifting hand to command attention spoke white men said ye have told story may may not be true ye have declared yourselves to be enemy of spaniard friend of indian how have ye shown friendship for by causing death of seventeen men of mayubuna by creating seventeen widow forty six fatherless child for whom rest of villager must now provide food for great wrong ye be doomed to die rest with yourselves whether death will be quick whether will be one of long drawn out torment ye see great lane of people stretching right through village ye will note that man of front rank be armed with club now doom be ye will start from where ye now stand will run to farther end of lane of people a ye run man on hand will smite ye a often a may with club if ye can hold out against blow ye will receive retain strength enough to reach other end of lane without falling by way then death will be quick if ye fall then who fall will be tied to stake slowly done to death for pleasure of spectator understand then go during brief address two englishman have be thinking hard rapidly phil first thought have be to force way up on to platform seize cacique threaten with instant death unless man must consent to give immediate liberty instantly discarded idea for a thought flashed through mind noticed that indian in front of platform be fully armed for unarmed man to force passage through hedge of deadly spear ten deep be simple impossibility then threw glance along lane dick be to traverse be hedged in on side by serried rank of indian armed with heavy club about three foot long indian be by mean powerfully built individually looked by mean formidable thought came to that if dick instead of starting to race at top speed from end to end of lane be to snatch club from nearest man then back to back way slowly along lane might possibly contrive to reach end of without being beaten to earth after who knew what unforeseen possibility might arise be not particularly hopeful plan be best that suggested on spur of moment moreover dick be expert at quarter staff play must at least be able to make fight for so hastily communicated plan to dick while cacique be speaking received dick murmured acceptance of at precise moment when cacique uttered word go chapter fourteen how phil dick be made to run gauntlet go a word left cacique lip two englishman faced round back to back sprang straight at indian who happened to be nearest perfect forest of bludgeon whirled in air on side of human lane from one end of to other in savage anticipation of moment when two victim must dash past length of weapon be such that not more than three must reach victim at given moment of two friend have already taken note deciding with rapidity of thought that if by skill quickness of action must evade three simultaneous blow need not trouble about anything more for moment for progress down lane must simply be continuous succession of evasion of three blow aimed at at same moment object therefore be to secure bludgeon before receiving disabling blow contrived to do sudden spring taking indian so completely by surprise that weapon be wrenched out of hand without slightest difficulty then instead of sprinting for life down lane by course of action must have inevitably exposed to certainty of receiving sufficient number of violent blow to disable in probability prevent from reaching goal placed back to back facing own particular line of assailant moved sideways along length of lane at ordinary walking pace contenting with parrying with bludgeon blow aimed at not attempting to return blow excepting when particular indian happened to exhibit especial vindictiveness when if opportunity offered retaliated with such effect that before fifty yard of course have be traversed at least dozen indian be down with cracked skull now must naturally be imagined that multitude of savage finding thus baulked of vengeance to have be so eagerly looking forward must have with one accord broken rank rushing in upon two white men in overwhelming number have slain out of hand did nothing of sort on contrary cool calm courage of prisoner audacity in daring to face such enormously overwhelming odds gallant fight that be putting up extraordinary skill with handled bludgeon seemed to appeal to elementary sporting instinct must have be lurking dormant unsuspected in mayubuna nature exciting admiration to extent that several of indian who might have struck unfair blow actually forbore to do so presently even began to utter shout of admiration when of white men achieved particularly brilliant passage of defence in short seemed gradually to dawn upon that be playing game that since balance of advantage be enormously on own side be morally bound to play fairly within certain limit did although there be not wanting whose ferocious passion be so deeply stirred that seemed to crave be life of white men be willing to go to length to get thus one man aimed so savage blow at dick that smashed bludgeon to splinter upon of chichester a latter guarded blow then doubtless enraged at failure sprang out of place in rank catching dick unawares stabbed at with splintered fragment of weapon remained in hand inflicting quite painful jagged wound on young englishman shoulder be last act for stung into sudden fury by smart of wound dick turned upon throwing strength weight into blow struck out with clenched left fist catching unfortunate indian square on point of chin so terrific be blow that actually lifted man clean off foot sent whirling back through air for distance of nearly four yard before fell to earth dead with broken neck great shout of mingled amazement admiration terror arose at wonderful exhibition of strength thenceforward influenced by fear spirit of fair play may be combination of there be further attempt made to take unfair advantage of two who be making so gallant fight to save from fate too hideous to be put into word at length gauntlet be run far end of lane be reached two young englishman still stood upon foot not unscathed very far from have made gallant fight have afforded savage captor far more exhilarating spectacle than have ever before witnessed although have be of very different character from what have be anticipated now two prisoner stood trembling with exhaustion from superhuman effort cruelly bruised bleeding altogether too dazed helpless to make sudden wild dash for freedom have planned in heart when entering upon terrible ordeal through have just passed what be to be next move in grim game of life death be not long left in doubt for party of armed men who have conducted on to ground now forced way into lane arranging in circle round two white men led back to where cacique of village sat enthroned a passed back along lane of humanity have fought way through few minute previously many of whose arm still tingled with jar of parried blow have aimed at now greeted return with murmur of commiseration admiration then almost before realised where be found still hemmed in by armed guard facing cacique who sat for moment silent regarding with inscrutable countenance then raising hand for silence spoke white men said ye have not fulfilled term of agreement made with ye be to run from end of lane to other ye walked instead of accepting unresistingly a be intended blow be aimed at ye took by force superior strength two club from people wherewith to defend yourselves worst of ye have killed outright le than four more men of mayubuna maimed five others so that will be many day before will again be able to provide food for wife child therefore because of have gone before doom be nay nay be merciful o father cried number of woman voice be merciful forcing way through throng party of twenty woman of varying age from girl of seventeen eighteen to one withered hag who from appearance might have be hundred year old flung upon knee before cacique mercy reiterated cacique in astonishment who pleads for mercy on behalf of white men surely not insipa whose only son have done to death leaving desolate in old age yea even insipa answered hag above mentioned hearken now o father continued be custom among that if man be killed slayer be taken alive if mother widow of slain man claim slayer a slave to provide food for in place of slain man demand will be granted slayer will be given to for rest of life now behold two white men see what mighty men be between have slain no le than twenty one men of mayubuna leaving twenty one woman many child with none to protect find food for let be given a slave to then that whom have thus cruelly bereaved may not suffer from loss of father husband son be right demand cacique considered extraordinary request for several minute then turned to dick phil white men said ye have heard what woman asks now behold give choice will ye become slave of bereaved woman to till field tend cattle hunt fish for generally watch over protect child in place of whom ye have slain will ye go straightway to stake pay penalty of misdeed by dying slow miserable death since must need do one other answered phil who alone fully understood purport of cacique speech therefore took upon to reply choose to become slave of woman who have intervened to save from death will do best to fill place of whom have unfortunately slain tilling field tending cattle hunting fishing for wife child protecting from evil be well answered cacique then turning to group of woman said take be yours have granted request nevertheless methinks must find easier to tame two full grown jaguar fresh from forest than to subdue white men to will be affair with wave of hand dismissed party subdue ' said muttered ancient insipa have have will see yes will see men be truly young strong fierce yea stronger fiercer than black jaguar while insipa be old weak nevertheless here take bind for turned suddenly held out two tough raw hide rope to armed guard who still surrounded prisoner with coarse jest two at old woman expense at once proceeded to bind dick phil hand behind after placed two free end of rope in beldame hand left way free for to lead prisoner away come then cried old woman jerking rope roughly come son of mine have have have lost one son who be lazy who cared not for poor old mother often left for many day without so much a smallest morsel of deer meat let garden be overrun with weed in place have gained two two who be brave enough to protect strong enough to till garden field to keep hut well supplied with need have have have done well be gainer come white men come make old insipa declining year pleasant happy proceeded to drag prisoner away followed by other woman who be believed be part owner of body of dick phil now what doe mean what be to be fate have withered old mummy to do with grumbled dick who have scarcely half understood what have passed since phil have be led back to cacique phil explained adding will probably be unpleasant enough for time must grin bear lad at event will be le disagreeable than being lashed to stake slowly tortured to death if have accepted that fate everything must have be at end for within next two three day whereas by choosing alternative at least save life be main thing with at present there must have be comfort satisfaction in being tortured to death by parcel of savage after having come so far done so much besides if be to hunt fish for woman must be free to come go pretty much a please do need to tell what will do a soon a obtain freedom of course not answered dick will just watch opportunity continue journey precisely agreed phil must confess be greatly surprised that friend cacique did not foresee such possibility well then seems to that what have to do be to be good boy for present do everything with good grace that have undertaken to do generally use utmost endeavour to win confidence of people disarm suspicion with be certain to regard at outset then way to escape will soon become clear hut of insipa be wretched neglected hovel of place in very last stage of dirt neglect decay situated on outskirt of village to delectable abode old crone conducted two son inducted therein before took inside hut carefully examined hurt when at length have satisfied that although be doubt painful enough for moment so severe a to incapacitate prisoner for anything very lightest of work there be serious harm done dispatched one of woman who have followed who considered a part owner of prisoner to river for water for wood to make fire while third be sent into forest to hunt for certain herb then took two men into hut released from bond graciously gave permission to lie down upon heap of dried fern be glad enough to do after rough trying experience through have so recently passed in few minute be fast asleep slept soundly for hour more when awoke insipa be ready with hot fomentation for wound bruise poultice of macerated leaf for application after fomentation finally food piece of roast goat flesh cassava bread warm drink of somewhat peculiar not unpleasant flavour after partaking of again fell into profound sleep lasted until following morning for drink have be medicated insipa be anxious that son must begin to work for at once knew that after hurt have be dressed sleep be very best restorative that must possibly administer to a matter of fact when phil dick awoke from long night sleep found to astonishment that ache stiffness of bruise be gone that for practical purpose be a well a ever quite fit to be up about again insipa be delighted with success have attended ministration so much so indeed that instead of ordering out to find food for at once went out borrowed from neighbour on strength of new acquisition brought home cooked laid before with information that must be last unearned meat must get hint however did not greatly interfere with appetite of friend for have already agreed that be quite well enough to resume journey up river have decided to do so at first opportunity whenever might occur believed that might occur at moment very day perhaps although be quite prepared to find that precaution of sort must be taken for little while at least to see that did not get away in be not mistaken for have scarcely finished meal when be summoned to presence of cacique who informed that have arranged that one of must spend day in hunting while other must remain in village under direction supervision of member of village council till garden attend to cattle of twenty one widow whose property be that might settle between of two must be hunter now at once put effectual stop to plan for immediate escape for although not word have passed between two friend on subject be of one mind whenever went must be together in fact must have dreamed of going off leaving other behind probably shrewd old cacique have guessed a much when arranged apparently simple really ingenious scheme whereby at least one of two white men must always be in village under close observation of course dick being younger offered phil choice of two occupation stukely at once unhesitatingly decided that must undertake agricultural work while dick be to do hunting arrangement came into force forthwith dick duty being to secure game fish possibly must take product of industry to cacique who must divide out equally between twenty one widow according to number of family to provide flesh food enough to satisfy more than sixty healthy appetite be mean task particularly in immediate vicinity of village of five hundred inhabitant where whole of neighbouring country be strenuously hunted day after day dick happened to be particularly keen clever hunter moreover training during journey have be of such character a to develop speed strength endurance to degree that be able to go farther afield than of indian thus reach district where game be neither so scarce so wild a be in immediate neighbourhood of village also soon got to know spot where game be most likely to be found consequently after first three four day during be learning country did quite a well a must be reasonably expected frequently excited cacique admiration by quantity of meat contrived to bring in a for phil be devon man consequently have acquired almost unconsciously considerable amount of knowledge regarding farming matter so that found more than on par with indian whose knowledge of agriculture be of most elementary character also understood full value of system in arrangement of work indian did not consequently by working systematically making woman do fair share found that must do work have be allotted to still find time for favourite hobby of research be not necessary to give detailed description of friend doings day after day during sojourn with mayubuna indian above indication will enable reader to picture uneventful sort of existence led be only needful to add so well did young englishman contrive matter by time that have be three month in village suspicion distrust with have at first be regarded have entirely disappeared indian seemed to have gathered impression that white prisoner have quite settled down be content to spend remainder of life with took fully three month to establish matter on satisfactory basis brought time on to what may be termed winter season be to say period of year when after long continued spell of fine weather during crop ripen be gathered in season of rain wind violent thunderstorm begin be to soften nourish invigorate baked earth prepare to bring forth luxuriant vegetation of summer be one of violent thunderstorm provided friend with opportunity to escape for have be so long so patiently waiting day have be unusually hot to start with about noon sky have be clear during earlier part of day have gradually become veiled by thick haze through sun revealed with ever increasing difficulty merely a shapeless blotch of whiteness in midst of haze before vanishing altogether then wind fell atmosphere became so oppressively close that mere act of breathing became difficult great silence fell upon scene for insect bird warned by instinct of what be impending sought shelter in deepest recess of forest while indian unable unwilling to labour in enervating heat also knowing from past experience what be coming retired to hut resigned to overpowering languor oppressed of inhabitant of village dick phil be only two who resisted enervating influence of hour for dick be away hunting a usual while phil having set certain task to perform be not sort of man who must allow to be deterred from execution by such trifle a mere oppressiveness of weather a day wore on sky grew ever more lowering heat closeness more pronounced found work growing increasingly difficult distasteful be with sigh of deep satisfaction at last having finished what have set to do wended way to hut dick have be permitted to erect for having laid aside primitive tool have be using continued way to creek where at conclusion of day labour be wont to indulge in refreshing luxury of bathe while be still in water be joined by dick who have also done good day work having brought in two deer have duly delivered over to cacique by time that pair have sufficiently refreshed gloom of departing day be deepening into darkness of moonless starless night a entered hut first shimmer of sheet lightning be precursor of coming storm flickered above tree top of contiguous forest phew exclaimed dick a flung upon heap of dried fern served a bed how unbearably hot close be how tired be doubt if must walk mile if life depended upon be sorry to hear that gravely returned phil for unless be very greatly mistaken believe will have opportunity to escape to night to escape reiterated dick how do mean old man do know what be going to happen to night demanded phil know that be going to have pretty severe thunderstorm if be what mean answered dick what have got to do with escaping what have to do repeated phil why everything gentle cuckoo dost thou not yet know that indian generally mayubuna in particular have very wholesome dread horror of thunderstorm believing a do that evil spirit come abroad hold high revel upon such occasion if indian happens to be struck by lightning fellow indian be firmly convinced that have be killed by evil spirit hence be extremely reluctant to venture abroad during thunderstorm have observed that reluctance even in case of comparatively few unimportant storm have visited village since have be here hitherto mayubuna have be too suspicious too watchful to afford opportunity to get clear away now however think have at last succeeded in completely lulling suspicion have not be nearly so watchful of of late be very doubtful whether there be single indian in village from cacique downward including old mammy insipa who will be willing to turn out in such storm a be now brewing merely for purpose of watching that two run away yes agreed dick have doubt be right well be quite ready to make attempt whenever say word what about thy fatigue demanded phil oh answered dick with laugh be not so tired dare say can manage to do may be necessary to secure escape from wretched place very well then said phil in case let get supper make preparation heaven know will be few simple enough then lie down get what rest can will be two three hour yet before will be safe for to make attempt friend be awakened out of sound sleep by blaze of lightning that flashed across closed eyelid with vividity of noontide sunshine followed instant later by crash of thunder caused to start upright from fern bed in something akin to panic so appalling be sharpness intensity of sound followed a be by series of deep heavy reverberating boom might have be caused by broadside of entire navy simultaneously discharged concussion of sent perceptible tremor through earth beneath booming sound seemed to echo back forth from cloud to cloud rumbling growling a though reluctant to cease at length subsided into momentary silence only to burst forth with even greater violence few second later a second flash tore across ink black sky be signal remarked phil quietly a rose to foot may safely move now for bad spirit be abroad with vengeance to night indian in place man woman child will be cowering with head tightly wrapped in blanket unable to move for fear of what may be seen there listen to a vivid flash illumined hut low terrified wail burst forth from round about mingling with roar volleying of thunder give one idea of state of mind that poor wretch be in believe that if village be to take fire must remain in hut burn rather than turn out face lightning come along must get clear away if can before rain come because when begin will be able to see nothing now have belonging medicine case pistol ammunition sword bow arrow yes think there be nothing missing be ready then march where be going demanded dick a groped way out of hut in opaque darkness followed upon dazzling flash of lightning first round to back of hut then past rear of other hut since although believe might walk straight through village without being seen believe in running unnecessary risk then down to beach replied phil for first few minute of journey going be exceedingly difficult eye of pair being alternately dazzled by vivid electric flash blinded by cimmerian darkness followed by time that have groped way through village be approaching beach flash glimmer of lightning fork sheet have become almost continuous be able to see way for rest of distance without difficulty now said phil when at length reached beach stood among canoe first business must be to choose handy canoe for ourselves hope will not require for more than hour then send rest adrift down river will put out of power of villager to pursue be of course bit hard upon can not be helped after have kept enslaved here for three month so be not so very unfair exchange now be handy little craft ought to serve purpose very well even if can not find own canoe again so help to haul up dick then must push others off a quickly a can suck of current will soon draw down creek into main stream when once be there mayubuna may say goodbye to took best part of hour to send whole of canoe adrift did job effectually by time that last canoe have be thrust off into middle of creek first dozen so be fairly in main stream being rapidly sucked out toward middle by strong current then dick phil after giving last look round flinging parting glance toward silent apparently deserted village thrust off canoe have reserved for sprang lightly into a went afloat seized paddle headed down creek upon reaching main stream found that current be running very strongly showing that there have be much rain higher up among hill on other hand storm be still raging violently although have brought no rain a yet have bred strong breeze from northward must be of incalculable value to if must recover own canoe with sail therefore paddled across to opposite side of river where current be to great extent nullified by eddy worked way upstream close inshore until reached creek near own canoe remained a hoped concealed when turning into paddled up until arrived at former landing place easily recognisable in light afforded by incessant lightning flash in like manner have difficulty in finding detached clump of bush in have hidden canoe on evening preceding capture by mayubuna toward now hurried eager to learn whether still remained where have put a strode rapidly across little meadow noticed that tall grass round clump in hoped to find canoe be much beaten down a though number of people have be walking round also observed several well defined trail leading away from clump toward forest of sent hope down to zero for sign pointed to fact that someone something have made frequent visit to clump of bush of quite recently if visit have reference to hidden canoe must not very well guess what purpose must be one thing be evident that clump of bush must be approached with caution accordingly loosened hanger in sheath strung bow fitted arrow to string then stole cautiously forward figure strongly outlined in vivid light of incessantly flashing lightning reaching spot where slight thinning of undergrowth have first suggested to idea of hiding canoe there dick suddenly thrust phil aside cautiously parting bush proceeded to insinuate into opening thus made phil following close up with drawn hanger in hand raised ready to strike blow if necessary although hemmed closely in on side a be by tough elastic stem bough of undergrowth be almost a difficult to strike blow with sword a be to effectively draw bow working way quietly rapidly forward in effective manner have acquired by several month practice in penetration of such growth dick at last stretched out hand touched what at once knew be hull of canoe right phil exclaimed delightedly here be now if will stay where be widen opening little so that will pas out easily will go to other end help to lift out accordingly proceeded to work way along length of canoe forcing bough aside to make passage for until have reached to about mid length of canoe when darkness in there being almost impenetrable in spite of continuously flashing lightning reached hand over to ascertain whether sail paddle be still in craft a have be left a did so became conscious of strong musky odour while be still pondering what might portend hand came in contact with cold clammy scaly body touch told before hastily withdrew hand with low cry of astonishment repugnance must be not far short of a thick a own body next instant there occurred sudden rustling caused canoe to shake quiver paddle in to rattle huge dimly seen shape upraised in canoe gust of hot fetid breath smote dick in face loud angry hiss made heard even through heavy booming of thunder chapter fifteen how escaped one great danger only to fall into greater there be need for dick to ask friend what be nature of monstrous indistinctly seen shape upreared out of canoe poised head within foot of face two eye flashing baleful green fire into a long forked tongue flickered angrily in out of slightly opened jaw knew at once for one of enormous boa dispute sovereignty of south american forest with puma black jaguar that most rare ferocious of cat tribe for instant so great be astonishment at thus unexpectedly finding at close quarter nay face to face with creature big enough to envelop body dozen time over strong enough to crush into shapeless mass that be completely paralysed have fear of serpent although be perfectly aware of awful danger in stood knew that in instant enormous body might fling great coil about gradually bring into action tremendous pressure must crush bone in body to splinter on other hand never occurred to to make slightest effort to save from so hideous fate a stood there perfectly quiescent for a seemed to quarter of hour more actual length of time did not probably exceed three second sharp rattling of dry twig over head heavy thud met ear little shower of twig leaf rained down upon at same instant terrific upheaval occurred in canoe coil upon coil vast length of serpent body leaped into view plunged over side there be violent rustling crackling of branch for few second a monster snake writhed irresistible way through neighbouring bush then be gone a last sound of hurried retreat died away dick chichester sank helplessly to ground violently sick for minute two paroxysm of vomiting be simply dreadful then feeling of horrible nausea gradually passed away pulling together dick struggled to foot right lad heard stukely be voice say a felt friend encouraging pat on shoulder feel better now that be capital faugh what disgusting stench wonder made sick feel almost a bad will bet trifle that brute feel good deal worse than of for must have hit pretty hard indeed if have not be for thick growth that baulked hindered stroke must have cut head clean off well have saved life phil gasped dick thickly a felt for other hand pressed convulsively pooh nonsense be rubbish know interrupted phil patting dick on back must have cut at brute just same if thou hadst not be there now if feel all right again let get canoe out see what look like nice mess will have made of expect making lair in with murrain on have put something worse than murrain on be judge laughed dick trifle hysterically brute will certainly die before morning now then be ready then lift with difficulty at length extricated canoe from hiding place to find good deal to surprise that apart from two broken paddle craft be very little worse for having be made lair of snake so big that must have practically filled from end to end luckily mast yard sail have be placed in bottom of so have not be broken although almost whole of boa ponderous weight must have rested upon so when presently put into water be rejoiced to find that although have be lying dry for three month so completely have be shielded from sun ray that hull be still intact that leaked not drop be far better than have dared to hope for so stepping into appropriating paddle of other craft leaving latter moored to bank joyfully shoved off three minute later be in main stream with canoe head pointed up river meanwhile storm still raged a furiously a ever flash of lightning be incessant rolling of thunder be continuous deafening northerly wind be blowing so fiercely that surface of stream be whipped into small foam capped wave be not high enough to imperil safety of canoe moreover wind roared so savagely aloft among tree top stripped off dried leaf rotten branch in blinding shower be fair wind for fugitive so stepped mast close reefed sail be presently foaming up river in midstream where although have strong current to contend with be at least safe from branch flew hurtling through air a fast a horse must trot now time storm have be dry storm be to say not drop of rain have fallen from bosom of scowling cloud seemed bursting with be bound to come sooner later come did with vengeance when friend have be under way about hour just a canoe have shot into broad lagoon like stretch of river where broadened out to about mile in width where consequently water be willow current scarcely perceptible well be for that rain caught just at point for otherwise must perforce have landed until worst of have blown over for came down not in sober steady respectable fashion in fall in temperate climate literally in sheet through be not possible to see anything more distant than ordinary boat length with came more wind so that canoe with gale right behind close reefed sail set in condition be not very much bigger than man shirt rushed along with foam boiling up level with gunwale sometimes even in over while state of affair prevailed nothing must be seen beyond dripping sail glistening in flash of lightning englishman continued headlong flight up river unable to see where be steering keeping boat steadily dead before wind confident from glimpse have have just before rain came on so long a be able to do must be running up centre line of river must not come to very much harm first violence of rain lasted about twenty minute then settled to quiet steady downpour for about hour during thunder lightning gradually subsided until thunder became mere muttering in extreme distance finally died away altogether sheet lightning continued to play intermittently low down on northern horizon for time longer affording light enough for fugitive to see where be going a wind still continued to blow strongly held on hour after hour making most of splendid opportunity thus afforded to make good escape so when at morning came wind died down with rising of sun be far beyond reach of pursuit by mayubuna now ensued month of comparative uneventfulness during two dauntless young englishman forced way up great river where fall into amazon be named maranon while in higher reach be called ucayali higher still quillabamba although journey up magnificent stream may be fitly described a comparatively uneventful must not be inferred therefrom that met with adventure at on contrary there be scarcely day when did not meet with adventure of sort be scarcely of sufficiently notable character to justify amplification in page being merely sort of occurrence be inevitable in river journey through wild country in tropic zone for example there be frequent rapid cataract to be negotiated food to be sought for obtained in course of search many strange creature be seen many curious wonderful sight witnessed occasionally savage animal encountered also indian began to be met with at frequent interval of whom proved friendly while others be hostile must fain have disputed right of white men to be in country at thanks to tyrannical treatment have experienced at hand of spaniard once encountered tribe of genuine amazon woman who have turned usual order of thing upside down having usurped function of men such a fighting hunting fishing while men folk be compelled to cultivate land care for cattle cook food look after child so on then there be gradual change in nature of vegetation character of scenery a traveller worked way upward from level of great plain pampas into mountainous region toward cuzco with ever increasing difficulty of navigation at length became so great that canoe have to be abandoned altogether journey continued by land although still followed course of river a closely a possible in order that might always be able to get water also because served a guide be not until have be journeying full month after escape from mayubuna that next really important adventure befell have by time climbed upward out of low hot tropic forest region have attained altitude at climate might almost be described a temperate where while day be still distinctly hot night be cool sometimes even to extent of sharpness where dense morning fog be frequent at particular period of year fog be cause of much inconvenience delay to pair for must neither hunt travel in fog result being that be frequently obliged to remain in camp until eight nine o'clock in morning instead of resuming journey at daybreak a have heretofore be custom such be case on particular morning when young englishman encountered next important adventure sun have be above horizon nearly two hour when at dense fog have enveloped camp cleared sufficiently to permit of proceeding upon journey still hung about here there in heavy wreath motionless in still morning air when quite unexpectedly came upon one of old peruvian road constructed by inca road bore evidence of having at one time be magnificent highway under rule of spaniard have be neglected until now be little more than sandy track over nature be fast resuming sway happened to lead in approximately right direction for englishman heavy a be travelling over be le laborious than toiling over rough trackless country therefore promptly decided to follow so long a ran way about mile from spot where two traveller came upon road entered dense wood here fog still hung thickly friend decided that be of little consequence since road though surface be broken up much overgrown be still easily distinguishable accordingly plunged into wood without hesitation quarter of hour later a rounded bend in road made exceedingly unwelcome discovery that have walked right into midst of party of fifty spanish soldier who having recently partaken of breakfast be now resting by roadside until fog must clear encounter be so sudden so absolutely unexpected on part of englishman almost before realised presence of spaniard latter who have heard dick phil talking together a approached have surrounded rendering flight impossibility in trice pair be disarmed hemmed in by escort of dozen armed men conducted to spot where captain tall dark handsome man in full armour without helmet with horse standing beside be reclining against trunk of enormous pine ah jorge exclaimed individual in spanish rising to foot a party approached what have here prisoner who what be surely not indian although might well be from garb truly senor capitan know not who what be answered man addressed a jorge who seemed from dress equipment to be sort of inferior officer possibly sergeant heard approaching along road a speech be strange deemed duty to seize therefore hastily arranged ambush into next moment walked here be if be not so dark in colour must say that might possibly be englishman ingles here exclaimed captain be impossible who be picaros now during six week residence in cartagena under hospitable roof of senorita clara dolores two englishman have by assiduous study acquired sufficient knowledge of spanish to enable to understand nature of question thus contemptuously addressed to phil who a usual took lead whenever talking be to be done at once replied impossible not senor be englishman beyond bare statement of fact must pardon if decline to say anything oh retorted spaniard decline to say anything do very good be not at curious to learn history of such vagabond a appear to be fact that be by own confession english be enough for there be others who may be more interested than if so may rest assured that will find way to make speak take away secure jorge continued addressing subordinate take care that give slip will hold responsible for safekeeping a soon a have secured prisoner to satisfaction let men fall in will resume march man to whose charge friend have be committed saluted then gave signal for prisoner to be led away adding to signal significant order shoot rascal at once upon slightest sign of attempt to escape at spot among tree situated about hundred yard from where captain have be standing little party came to place where dozen pack mule have be tethered brief search among heterogeneous article comprised pack furnished sergeant with raw hide rope from cut off couple of length sufficient to securely bind hand of phil dick firmly behind back operation be at once so effectually performed that anything in nature of escape by simply breaking away running for one life be rendered impossible quite apart from sinister significant order to shoot have be given to soldier quarter of hour later entire party be on move two englishman have mortification of finding marched back along road by have come shortly after passing spot where friend have struck road path for be little more curved away toward left led along top of extensive plateau of rich pasture land upon about midday sighted first herd of cattle that englishman have seen since escape from mayubuna during afternoon saw other herd in charge of peon showing that party be gradually approaching civilised territory about hour before sunset marched into small village composed chiefly of adobe hut where halt be called for night where friend be confined in ramshackle barn of place in company with sergeant ten men that sergeant be quite determined not to get into trouble by neglect of possible precaution soon became perfectly evident for when about hour after arrival of party at village supper be served individual in question gave order before hand of prisoner be released to enable to convey food to mouth ankle be to be securely bound together be done then after supper be over without unbinding ankle of prisoner wrist be again bound together behind back after ankle wrist be drawn a closely together a must be induced to come firmly lashed behind in constrained exceedingly painful posture be unceremoniously flung into opposite corner of hut where upon bare floor suffering torment from vermin with place be infested from in constrained position be helpless to defend be left to pas night a best might seemingly interminable night of torture for hapless prisoner came laggingly to end at last when about hour after daybreak lashing have confined limb through hour of darkness be loosed be allowed to scramble to foot walk to fro for few minute before partaking of breakfast after breakfast march be resumed not to dwell at unnecessary length upon portion of narrative about hour before sundown entire party marched into city one of soldier surlily informed phil be cuzco here two young englishman be at length safely deposited in underground dungeon of building have once be one of inca palace escape being rendered impossible by simple process of chaining to wall by mean of heavy iron chain about six foot in length one end of be attached to iron girdle locked round prisoner waist while other end be welded to iron ringbolt shank of be deeply sunk into solid masonry of dungeon wall on morning of following day be temporarily released from loathsome prison where bed have consisted merely of thin layer of damp straw cast upon stone flag with dungeon be paved where only ventilation consisted of small iron grating let into masonry above door conducted under strong guard into presence of governor of city who questioned closely concerning name nationality where have come from where be bound for why wished to go there at first two englishman resolutely refused to answer of question put to when at governor growing exasperated at obstinacy threatened with torture of boot phil so far satisfied man curiosity a to inform truthfully of name nationality adding fictitious information that having quarrelled with captain have be forcibly put ashore somewhere in gulf of darien have since be wandering aimlessly about country not knowing where to go how to escape from story be well enough concocted considering that be made up on spur of moment be evident that did not altogether satisfy excellency who finally ordered to be taken back to dungeon kept there pending certain enquiry proposed to make later in day when once more found alone again chained to dungeon wall dick in simplicity ventured to question phil a to reason for resorting to fiction instead of boldly telling truth refusing to say anything at to phil replied gentle buzzard if have persisted in refusing don request for information must have be put to torture for when fellow threaten thing like usually mean if actually mean at moment must unhesitatingly carry out threat rather than give lie must show singularly deficient in common sense be to submit to be tormented for hour probably maimed for life rather than impart little information so long a information be of such nature a to harm nobody at cost must avoid being tortured if can for how must hope to escape having escaped hope to carry out plan if bone be broken limb twisted out of joint therefore a soon a torture be mentioned decided that time have arrived when speech be to be preferred to silence be careful to avoid saying anything might connect with adventure because sooner later news of exploit of ship be certain to penetrate a far south even a have suspicion that participant in exploit will not be altogether popular with don also must remember that there be rumour two of crew of ship have found shelter succour in certain house in cartagena if two person belonging to adventure must eventually be found at large in country certain colour of probability might be imparted to rumour in case gentle friend clara dolores might get into serious trouble therefore thought best on account to mingle little fiction with fact trust long before excellency proposed enquiry have borne fruit will be far enough away from cuzco governor do think then that there be slightest chance of effecting escape asked dick glancing expressly at chain bound to wall darkness of dungeon be too profound for phil to detect glance nevertheless must have guessed at for replied son think anything of sort know ask how know for can not tell knowledge be nevertheless here tapping forehead keep up courage youngster continued chain be nothing chain stone wall can long hold in restraint man who be destined to be free tell that be doomed to die at hand of spaniard more can not tell for although be a certain a be of own existence that will escape foreknowledge be not clear enough to enable to say how escape be going to be effected wish felt half a confident a seem to do about grumbled dick at present appears to that nothing short of miracle can help well will see lad pessimism seemed to be fully justified when on following day pair be once more released from chain confined to wall be summoned by jailer to follow obeyed summons with alacrity of animated by secret hope that opportunity might present for to break away from custodian effect escape from building eventually from city hope be nipped in bud when immediately outside door of dungeon armed guard consisting of dozen soldier corporal be seen to be awaiting evidently moment for escape be not yet to surprise of when prisoner arrived at top of flight of stone step leading from dungeon found that instead of being again conducted along passage led to governor quarter a on previous day be marched along corridor presently found in street even now there be encouragement for to attempt to escape because besides being hemmed in by escort of dozen soldier entire party be surrounded by gaping scowling execrating mob of ragged unwashed ruffian apparently scum of city who must have effectually frustrated attempt on part of englishman to break away from guard take to heel indeed if one might have judged from expression of coarse brutal feature remark fell from lip nothing must have pleased better than for prisoner to have made attempt since must have afforded mob legitimate excuse for hunting pair to death be prisoner permitted to remain very long in suspense with regard to destination for when presently soldier wheeled charge into certain street loud murmur swept through accompanying mob of heretic be heretic be being taken to inquisition so indeed proved for five minute later arrived before big gloomy jail like building constructed of great block of stone having number of exceedingly small aperture in wall aperture being guarded by iron bar of quite unnecessary thickness entrance to place be great gateway twelve foot wide nearly twice a high fitted with pair of enormously solid wooden door so heavy that leaf be fitted with roller running upon quadrant rail let into pavement to facilitate opening soon became evident that ponderous gate be only opened on special occasion for when having halted little party corporal in charge tugged at handle attached to chain hung down from aperture in wall bell be heard to clang somewhere in far interior of building small wicket cut in one of big gate be presently thrown open by individual in garb of lay brother soldier with prisoner be invited to pas through party now found in lofty vaulted passage twenty five foot in length farther end of opened upon paved courtyard surrounded by cloister surmounted by lofty building massively constructed of same dark grey stone a building through have just passed like provided with window strongly protected by massive iron bar only instead of being small a be window in exterior wall of looked out upon courtyard be of very considerable dimension at opposite side of courtyard facing passage through party have just passed be door giving admission to what appeared to be main building to be now conducted by lay brother who having unlocked door threw open bade enter big gloomy cavern like ill lighted hall now stood revealed once inside place prisoner be delivered over to custody of huge brawny brute in shape of man who from fact that bore bunch of big key attached to belt be doubt jailer of institution then tall thin ascetic looking man in garb of priest stepped forward scanned two prisoner attentively carefully compared appearance with description of contained in document corporal handed to signed document returned to corporal dismissed follower waved jailer to lead charge away fellow immediately did in morose silence way lay down long narrow corridor having door opening out of at interval on side at precise moment when prisoner arrived opposite one of door long drawn wail rising to piercing shriek rang out from behind causing flesh to creep upon bone with horror so eloquent of keen excruciating almost unendurable physical anguish be sound jailer who be leading way glanced over shoulder at prisoner with smile of such gloating satanic suggestiveness cruelty on heavy feature a cry pealed forth that on instant feeling of passive repugnance with two englishman have thus far regarded fellow be converted into fierce hot active unreasoning hatred for fraction of second glanced questioningly into other eye then reading in lightning glance thought of other pair flung upon fellow while dick exerting giant strength pinned man arm to side at same time by deft movement of left foot tripped fellow up so that crashed violently forward upon face on stone pavement of passage phil clasped man throat with two hand compressing windpipe in such vice like grip that be utterly impossible for fellow to utter slightest sound thus locked together three went down in bunch under impetus of sudden attack jailer being undermost hard pavement seemed to fairly ring with violent impact of man skull upon next instant dick felt fellow tense muscle relax a though violence of blow have partially wholly stunned whereupon youngster still acting upon impulse seemed to emanate from somewhere outside pushed phil on one side flung in kneeling posture upon prostrate jailer shoulder grasping man by hair with hand pulled up fellow head dashed furiously upon pavement again thrice after victim lay silent inert to appearance dead roll over quick unbuckle belt must have key hissed phil in dick ear before five second have passed two englishman be on foot standing over victim while phil rapidly examined key one after other quickly selected one showed sign of more frequent wear than others then glanced keenly about be near far end of corridor ended in wall lighted by fair sized window there be only four more door to be passed two on side before end of corridor be reached stay here until beckon then bring man to whispered phil darted off to end of corridor leaving dick to mount guard over prostrate body of jailer rapidly yet with utmost coolness phil tried key have selected in lock of one of farther door slid in turned door swung open single glance sufficed to assure phil that door be that of cell that cell be unoccupied whereupon beckoned dick who hoisted unconscious jailer upon shoulder bore to cell flung unceremoniously upon heap of straw be apparently intended to serve a bed now belt quick whispered phil who have followed gently closing door behind rolling still insensible body over on face pair bent over with deft finger contrived to fasten ankle wrist of victim together in such fashion that more man struggled tighter must draw ligature then using formidable looking knife man have worn suspended from belt formed gag by cutting strip from skin clothing wrapping round largest key of bunch detached from chain inserted in victim mouth thus rendering a impossible for to cry out a be for to move having disposed of jailer in such fashion that must not be likely to give trouble for next hour two pair left cell closed locked door behind stood listening intently to ascertain whether sound of recent struggle have attracted attention chapter sixteen what happened in inquisition at cuzco for perhaps minute pair stood outside cell door listening with ear not slightest sound broke silence seemed to pervade whole of vast building then from somewhere in far distance there came sound of door being closed almost at same instant quavering cry rising to long drawn shriek of agony again pealed forth from behind awful door few pace along corridor for mercy sake what be whispered dick with ashen lip surely such sound can never be human be though replied phil in low tense whisper be cry of poor soul under torture being put to question a fiend of inquisitor express oh if must lay hand upon one of must come along lad must not dally here if be again taken after what have done fate will be well something wo bear thinking of then seizing dick by arm dragging lad after stukely proceeded softly on tiptoe along corridor have arrived within yard of door from behind dreadful sound have emanated when suddenly opened tall dark man emerged clad in long black habit girt about waist with cord of knotted rope feature be partially obscured by hood of garment wore drawn over head so that stood up in sort of peak wearing round neck massive gold chain from gold crucifix depended back happened to be toward have closed latched door behind before turned saw two englishman within arm length of for second stood motionless regarding two wild looking figure with blank amazement then look of mingled terror anger leapt into eye be evident that be about to open mouth shout alarm cry never passed lip for in instant stukely be upon with silent irresistible bound of jaguar in next be dragging wildly at englishman hand to tear away from throat nevertheless might a well have striven to force way through solid masonry of adjoining wall a to tear away two relentless thumb be compressing windpipe choking life out of presently grew black in face eye rolled upward until only white of be visible grip on phil wrist relaxed gave way arm fell limp to side knee yielded sank slowly to ground rather be lowered to by stukely who still maintained remorseless grip upon other throat kneeling upon one knee beside now prostrate body presently however phil rose to foot with eye still fixed upon body of priest whispered to dick must fain break fellow neck so in sort avenge poor soul in there have time for vengeance now must be clear of accursed building before villain revives fate be sealed so come along lad therewith pair resumed passage along corridor few second later found back in great gloomy entrance hall of building with not soul in sight in direction phil came to halt now where be that lay brother who admitted whispered to dick must have rather key for without can not get out of place believe whispered dick in reply went in there indicating door after have let out corporal guard then returned phil let see if be in there now then crossing to door tried handle turned flung open door boldly entered room closely followed by dick who closed door behind apartment be empty of human occupant otherwise presented bare uninviting aspect only furniture in consisting of table two chair be imperfectly lighted by small window looking out upon cloister surrounded courtyard that prisoner have crossed quarter of hour earlier bell suspended near ceiling attached to chain leading out through slit in wall seemed to indicate that be room in warder of outer gate be accustomed to sit man be certainly not then in room be there anything to indicate that have recently be there if therefore dick belief that have seen lay brother enter have be well founded man must have left again almost immediately while two englishman be being conducted to cell by now imprisoned jailer true might have passed on to inner room for there be door opposite to by dick phil have entered after hurried glance round two friend moved a might have be by same impulse crossed to door quietly opening glanced into adjoining apartment single glance round room sufficed to show that man whom sought be not in for also be empty so far a human occupant be concerned be room of very considerable size be apparently refectory for two row of table capable of seating about fifty person ran lengthwise down hall be draped with coarse white cloth upon be set out array of platter water pitcher knife rest of paraphernalia used at meal room be very much loftier better lighted than one englishman have just left there being four large window in outer wall overlooking large beautifully kept garden in several people be working of attired in garb of monk while others wore dress of lay brother there be two door in room in addition to one by friend have entered one being at far end of room communicating with kitchen of establishment if sound odour emanated therefrom be to be trusted while other much larger door occupied centre of inner wall be obviously used by inmate of establishment at meal time now what can have become of man demanded phil in angry whisper a pair glanced round room noted deserted appearance be quite sure that be not mistaken a to door by saw enter answered dick in same subdued tone be not quite sure believe be not mistaken same phil continued be really necessary that must find can not get out of building in other safer way than by finding that man knocking down taking key from besides even if way be free for to leave here instant where must go must not walk dozen yard along street attired a now be without attracting attention being recognised a stranger must inevitably be recaptured within ten minute then what plague be to do demanded phil impatiently to remain here be to court recapture a surely a if showed in street why even now at moment man may enter room see give alarm yes agreed dick be very true doubt if remain here long enough be what will happen inquisition seems to be rambling old pile of place can not help thinking that must contain many obscure little used recess cupboard in might find at least temporary safety concealment until small hour of morning when might leave place make way out of city with comparatively little risk be right dick agreed stukely be undoubtedly best plan if dame fortune will stand by will be plaguey risky for to attempt to remain in here until small hour of morning how can possibly hope to avoid being seen by prowling priest lay brother within next twelve hour pish what be use of anticipating trouble plan be certainly right one sooner that see about carrying out better now be quite evident that there be place of concealment in room so there be nothing to be gained by dawdling here also know that be useless to retrace step yonder be obviously kitchen must therefore be avoided that leaf with resource to try big door so come along let see how far luck will hold good without further ado pair advanced cautiously to door phil have indicated latter laid hand upon handle turned gradually noiselessly a far a must go then having noticed that door opened inward drew toward fraction of inch glanced through slit thus created phil now found that be looking into long wide corridor passage imperfectly lighted by two small window one at end there be one to be seen in part of corridor came within somewhat limited range of vision so emboldened thereby opened door widely enough to enable to peer out take hasty glance along full length of corridor glance assured that for moment at least passage be empty at same moment became conscious of low sweet note of organ being played somewhat toward far end of building good whispered excitedly to dick do hear that lad be organ mean that chapel be not very far away if can gain interior will be reasonably safe for there be sure to be dark nook somewhere in where may be able to lie concealed for few hour since coast seems to be clear just now may a well proceed upon hunt at once hand be probably now engaged upon regular morning business if so may be lucky enough to go good way without meeting anybody whereas later on whole place will probably be alive with people so come along lad time like present silently a ghost pair slid through open doorway into corridor drawing door to closing behind in very nick of time for a phil released hold upon handle heard door leading from kitchen to refectory open hitherto subdued sound of activity in kitchen suddenly became greatly intensified while voice sound of shuffling sandal on stone floor of refectory came through door have just closed quick lad for life whispered stukely in companion ear way run for be lost if come into corridor find here running tiptoe on bare foot two sped down corridor like mist wreath driven before wind at very end of corridor came upon large doorway fitted with folding door one leaf of be ajar through aperture note of organ softly played floated out to with tip of finger phil gently pushed door trifle wider open peering in saw that be indeed at one of entrance to chapel formed part of holy inquisition of cuzco building of phil thus obtained glimpse be unexpectedly large so large indeed that instantly jumped to conclusion that be intended for use of general public a well a for member of order accommodation being sufficient for at least four hundred worshipper door through be peering be situated underneath gallery in be placed organ loft for note of instrument floated down to from immediately overhead to right of stretched away main body of church one half of half nearest being fitted with pew while other half toward great west door be furnished with common rush bottomed chair evidently intended for use of casual worshipper lower order generally to left lay chancel fitted with exquisitely carved gilded stall tall elaborately worked brass standard for lamp gaudily painted gilded statue of various saint superb reredos in marble surmounted by cross bearing fine lifesize figure of redeemer whole illuminated by rainbow tint streamed in through beautiful stained glass of magnificent east window faint odour of incense still clung to air of place main thing however at least that chiefly interested two interloper be that although west door stood wide open affording glimpse of broad gravel path leading up through superb garden beyond must be seen road house traffic of foot passenger horseman vehicle there be not soul to be seen inside church organist being apparently only occupant for moment phil therefore wasted more time pushing door wide enough open to afford admittance to companion slipped through dragging dick after pushed to door again behind leaving ajar a have found then advancing pace two taking care to keep well beneath shadow of gallery pair made rapid comprehensive survey of building in search of hiding place where might safely lie perdu for next few hour noted several place looked quite promising if must reach only unfortunately there be organist up aloft doubtless assistant to blow bellow if of must chance to glance down into body of church at moment when fugitive happened to be making for chosen spot must be lost for instance choir stall rose in tier one behind that of course meant beneath floor of rearmost tier there must be hollow space amply sufficient to conceal dozen men if must obtain access to then there be high altar be doubtless hollow possibly access to interior might be obtained at back to gain of position must be necessary to pas over part of pavement phil conjectured might be seen from organ loft felt very strongly disinclined to take risk of being seen after have thus far so successfully evaded detection fully recognised that must not waste much time in making up mind there be priest whom have left senseless outside door of torture chamber to say nothing of jailer be simply marvellous that one have not yet be found other missed a thought flashed through mind confused sound of shouting scurrying foot came to ear muffled by distance through slightly opened door knew in instant what meant thing have along be fearing indeed knew must very soon happen have happened discovery of sort have be made probably priest have recovered sufficiently to raise alarm now in minute two whole place must be swarming with searcher hunting in possible impossible place for missing prisoner something must be done decision arrived at instantly there be more time for indecision phil once more flung lightning glance about building wall of chancel on side of high altar up to level of sill of glorious east window be draped with rich tapestry depicting on background of gold thread on one side annunciation on other apotheosis of blessed virgin phil noticed that tapestry be suspended from ring strung upon massive brass rod be supported by brass bracket let into wall seemed to that bracket be of such length a to afford space enough for man to hide between tapestry reached right down to floor wall organ be softly breathing out note of agnus dei from mass organist be evidently practising man must probably be intent only upon music organ blower phil decided must be risked perhaps must be behind organ in part of loft from chancel must not be seen a voice outside grew louder seemed to be drawing nearer plucked dick by sleeve beckoned to follow pair stole softly up length of chancel to altar dropped on knee lifted bottom edge of tapestry crawled underneath let fall behind rose to foot in enclosed space between wall tapestry at precise moment when great bell began to peal out alarm note from distant part of building organist almost immediately ceased playing minute later soft pad pad of own sandalled foot descending wooden staircase not far away came muffled to ear of fugitive then followed slam of door turn of key in lock two friend knew to be alone in church with west door wide open affording mean of instant flight into outer world if chose to avail of that thought came to only to be rejected on instant be still clad in skin of beast have taken place of worn out clothing be unkempt unshaven altogether far too conspicuous in way to justify in venturing into street by daylight indeed at time while inhabitant be abroad therefore must remain in hiding until darkness fell people have retired to rest fervently hoped that citizen of cuzco kept early hour then began to feel hungry for be now several hour since have tasted food have grown accustomed to such petty discomfort a hunger thirst long ago be a nothing compared with torture that poor wretch must have be undergoing in room yonder a phil thought of possibility even yet dick might be recaptured subjected to similar suffering worked way along foot two of distance separated from high altar proceeded to examine latter a have more than half expected structure proved to be hollow being built of massive slab of marble a to front side having back for reason be quite unable to divine be most heartily thankful for there be space left between side of structure wall of church just wide enough for to squeeze through without undue discomfort so gain interior of altar seemed distinctly safer place to hide in than merely behind tapestry there be room for three four men to bestow comfortably must lie down if chose therefore lost time in transferring to new place of concealment have scarcely settled comfortably therein when heard door noisily unlocked thrown open sound of many sandalled foot swarming into church judging from sound alone fugitive crouching in interior of altar estimated that about dozen people have entered church seemed to rush forward few pace then halt a though staring about then followed few brief desultory movement silence finally voice said in spanish well be perfectly clear that be not here from what do draw inference brother demanded voice first from fact that door by entered be locked on other side next because great west door be wide open answered voice have first spoken true answered second voice yet of fact be proof that fugitive be not lurking somewhere in church do ask why will tell first brother gregorio have be here morning a usual practising know that be habit of to leave door communicating with domestic part of establishment unfastened very often open while practises therefore if did same thing to day happen to know that did for be in church hour ago must be easy matter for fugitive to gain access to building conceal somewhere in a to open door yonder attach importance at to for englishman be much too conspicuous in appearance attire to venture abroad in city by daylight must be recaptured in le than five minute if did so give credit for being sensible enough to know consequently maintain that be still somewhere within wall of establishment a likely a not may be in church therefore let place be thoroughly searched at once nothing more be said sound of renewed activity immediately followed upon order to search scuffle of footstep along aisle on step leading to organ loft distinctly reaching lurking pair a crouched beneath altar intently listening to gather if might indication of direction in search be proceeding presently to discomfiture heard footstep of apparently two person approaching enclosed space within altar rail pair talking in low tone a approached for part said one entirely disagree with fray felipe believe english heretic have escaped by open door for if not where be can not be in other part of establishment for if so must have be seen by someone unless indeed be in league with devil have power of disappearing at will be not in church because if have come here must have seen that open door nobody will persuade that seeing must not avail of opportunity offer nay brother answered other think fray felipe be right so must have seen two men looked be dressed like savage must never pooh interrupted first impatiently be nonsense if looked a conspicuous a that what be there to prevent from entering vestry appropriating couple of spare habit be always hanging there if did that must walk out of church in broad daylight nobody must dream of challenging now if be in church at be belief that will be found behind tapestry take side brother will take just run hand along length of tapestry if be lurking behind will soon find ay grumbled other a like a not be slain by for pain tell brother that like not be not here concluded a ran hand along tapestry in exceedingly perfunctory manner without discovering sign of missing prisoner be beginning to think with brother jose that rascal have escaped of course have agreed first speaker be not on side either ah a great bell began to toll somewhere aloft there be bell for mass thank heaven now foolish search will be brought to end therewith footstep retired much to relief of concealed englishman who be momentarily dreading that might occur to one other of searcher to turn up tapestry peep into opening beneath behind altar did not possibly of worthy brother be particularly anxious to find suddenly face to face with couple of desperate englishman presently sound of retreating footstep died away in distance be still in great church not for long lurking pair have only time to dispose little more comfortably on hard marble pavement when other footstep be faintly heard accompanied by occasional scrape of chair in distance fugitive knew that congregation be assembling then great bell ceased to toll organ once more poured forth sweet solemn note door opened measured footstep be heard approaching there be slight momentary bustle a brother of order filed in took place then service began englishman who be lover of music enjoyed hour of such keen delight a have not experienced for many long day in due time solemn service came to end congregation retired there ensued opening closing of door sound of echoed reverberated hollowly along aisle among arch of sacred building then great silence fell for time fugitive remained huddled up in hiding place silent listening at length convinced that church be indeed empty began in low whispered tone to discus situation two priest who unwittingly came so near to finding have furnished with hint if cared to avail of a to how might make good escape even in broad daylight so far a dick be concerned must have be quite willing to act upon by raiding vestry there then appropriating one of habit fray jose have said be to be found there sallying forth into city without more ado for bone be by time growing sore with lying so long upon hard cold marble although phil bone be aching quite a much a dick elder of two be very strongly disinclined to run slightest unnecessary risk argued that church having once be subjected to tolerably thorough search dick be reasonably safe so long a chose to remain where be that to venture abroad prematurely even in disguise for mere sake of avoiding few hour of further discomfort must be very height of folly for how must tell at moment door might open someone enter church discover supposing to be so foolish a to venture out of place of concealment who knew how many more service be to be held during day if happened that there be more then indeed might be safe enough for to venture out go in search of vestry spare habit not otherwise moreover how must be sure that habit if found must actually prove to be a effective disguise a fray jose have asserted must phil knew enough about roman catholic religion to be fully aware that who professed be sometimes prompted to stop first priest might chance to meet discus with spiritual difficulty even to invoke aid in merely temporal trouble what sort of figure asked dick must cut in such case a hungry thirsty a be sore a be limb through long contact with hard pavement be for remaining where be at least until when probably if must procure effective disguise might venture to sally forth essay attempt to get out of city so cogent be argument at length succeeded in silencing dick if did not altogether convince phil conjecture that there might be further service in church before day be over proved to be correct there being two last of occurred late enough in evening to necessitate lighting of lamp in building be while lamp be being lighted that two englishman learned from gossip of engaged in illuminating grand altar much perplexity uneasiness have resulted from fact that despite most rigorous search of entire city trace of missing prisoner have thus far be discovered that conclusion have therefore be at length arrived at must have got clear away knowledge be eminently satisfactory to two whom most intimately concerned for seemed to indicate that engaged in search have at length lost heart that if hunt be still to be maintained must only be in more le perfunctory manner consequently fugitive might by exercise of proper amount of caution hope to make good escape from city at last service of day be over lurking pair heard closing locking of various door by general public entered building be followed by shuffling of foot here there a lamp candle be extinguished one after other low murmur of voice gradually died away finally there came loud slamming of door from direction of sound fugitive conjectured to be door beneath organ loft by have entered church during morning then followed grating of key in lock rattle indicated withdrawal of key silence at last thought weary pair behind altar church be empty closed for night to make assurance doubly sure however agreed to remain where be for half hour when at length judged period to have elapsed crept very cautiously out of place of concealment have served so well made way to choir stall upon soft cushion of rested weary limb for short time while eye be growing accustomed to gloom of place then having agreed that certain small door immediately opposite by have found way into church must be one giving access to vestry stole silently across pavement phil having first satisfied that room whatever be that lay beyond be in darkness found handle proceeded to turn a cautiously a though believed place on other side to be full of people door proved to be unlocked minute later fugitive found a have expected in vestry of church room be small one be lighted by fairly large window a night happened to be brilliantly fine starlit gloom here be not nearly so intense a have be in interior of church consequently be able to distinguish without much difficulty that there be indeed a fray jose have said number of garment of sort hanging from peg on one of wall why garment must be kept there fugitive never troubled to conjecture fact that be there be sufficient for lost time in appropriating donning two of be long black garment reaching from shoulder to ankle with large hood might be drawn up over head almost entirely concealing feature when wearer be out of door be confined round waist by girdle of knotted rope attired in pair felt that might safely brave very closest scrutiny therefore have scruple about sallying forth into open forthwith window of vestry overlooked portion of extensive garden glimpse of have gained through great west door of church earlier in day peering out through two friend saw that there be thick shrubbery at great distance looked a though might afford good cover from to reconnoitre ground prior to attempt to gain street beyond at once decided to make for in first instance moment be at outer door proved to be locked key be luckily in lock on inner side of door slight difficulty be therefore soon got over minute later pair drew great breath of relief a found once more in open air free chapter seventeen how escaped from inquisition yes free in sense yet not wholly so for be still within boundary of holy inquisition although outside building to have done so much a have however to have evaded capture for best part of day finally to have won outside wall undetected be mean achievement felt that having accomplished so much rest ought to be easy matter standing within deep shadow of doorway for minute two after have silently closed door behind pair searched with gaze a much of garden a came within range of vision nowhere must detect sign of human presence within indeed scarcely expected to do so for be now altogether too dark for anything in nature of gardening operation moreover surmised that be about hour when everybody connected with establishment must be at supper therefore feeling that moment be propitious left shelter of doorway keeping a closely within shadow of building a must moved off toward shrubbery into dense obscurity of plunged minute two later here a wound way cautiously among bush suddenly found close to long low block of building being entirely in darkness surmised must be shed devoted to storage of gardener tool implement paraphernalia generally at once halted subjected building to careful examination for weapon having be taken away from by soldier who have seized weapon of sort be now first necessity with hoped that shed might at least afford knife apiece if nothing better investigation however resulted in discovery that shed be locked difficulty be soon overcome by simple process of breaking pane of glass inserting hand unfastening hasp entering through open window when enterprise be eventually rewarded by discovery of several formidable pruning knife two of together with couple of short stout iron bar length of thin strong rope unhesitatingly appropriated two adventurer now felt might befall be no longer altogether defenceless leaving shed behind again plunged into shrubbery object now being to discover way of escape from garden into street of city first obstacle encountered be stone wall about fifteen foot high surmounted by chevaux de frise deciding that be rather too formidable to be tackled until have made further search followed wall for distance eventually arrived at stout wicket gate built of wood of course be locked upon examination soon came to conclusion with help of pruning knife bar must not be difficult matter to burst lock open unfortunately however must not be done without making considerable amount of noise have already ascertained while examining lock that good many people be still abroad in city for heard footstep frequently passing on other side of wicket therefore decided to seek further before attempting to force way out decision being influenced by fact that be evidently still early in evening there must not be so many people moving about consequently might be wise to delay final escape until bulk of population have retired to rest soon afterward however while pursuing investigation reached spot where wall ended where ground be enclosed for distance by lofty iron railing despite fact that be formidably spiked at top thought might be easily scaled by two men who be accustomed a be to climbing mast rigging of ship on other side of railing be wide open street along people be constantly passing to fro adventurer therefore retired to shelter concealment of shrubbery having come to resolution not to run unnecessary risk by undue precipitancy since have managed so excellently thus far at length however sound of traffic in street began to diminish sensibly finally died away altogether good people of cuzco seemed to have gone home to bed at last so throwing off disguise for moment dick essayed to climb high railing be now only barrier between liberty task be not at difficult except when came to clambering over complicated arrangement of spike at top steady head little patience be be needed in about two minute young chichester be standing on pavement outside once more in clerical disguise receiving few article phil passed through railing to before latter in turn climbed over obstacle a chanced only just accomplished feat in time for a stukely reached pavement on right side of railing footstep be heard approaching phil scarcely have time to don priest habit draw hood well over head conceal bar pruning knife in ample fold of garment when belated frequenter of one of numerous posadas of city staggered past humming in maudlin tone refrain of bacchanalian song cut short when realised that two dark figure jostled be a supposed connected with dread institution lay back there frowning in distance a soon a roysterer be fairly out of way adventurer looked about to get bearing purpose be to leave city by same way that have come into then strike eastward until again came to river in accordance with vilcamapata instruction be to follow to source recalling several twist turn have taken through building after encounter with jailer that morning finally decided that must follow footstep of drunken man until reached first street bearing to right must be street by have be conducted to inquisition that morning once arrived in be convinced that must find way over remainder of route accordingly started briskly off in course of few minute reached street sought presently verified a right one by passing great entrance gateway by have be admitted to inquisition building that morning that morning seemed much more like week ago still walking briskly yet without exhibiting undue haste meeting only occasional wayfarer here there who took notice of except to stand respectfully aside yield narrow pavement to a passed two englishman wound hither thither along street occasionally identifying building that remembered to have passed before until in little narrow street phil suddenly halted before small building bore across narrow front sign reading in spanish of course mateo cervantes armourer plate chain mail blade of finest imported direct from toledo in old spain musquets pistolettes ammunition for same ah ejaculated phil with sigh of satisfaction here be at last be place have be looking for be beginning to fear have missed what plague want ye with now that have found demanded dick peevishly for be beginning to feel sleepy knew that many weary mile must yet be walked before must hope to get rest what want with reiterated phil gentle mutton head read sign over shop there be light enough for surely though be starlight dick read sign eye brightened ah said of course begin to understand have be wondering along what must do without weapon if chanced to make good escape bar pruning knife be well enough in way be better than nothing at of course wo help to get game precisely interrupted phil therefore since spaniard have seen fit to deprive of weapon propose to make spaniard provide with others now be going to knock up friend cervantes persuade to supply need so far a resource of establishment will allow to make sure that after have obtained what require senor will not prematurely give alarm set soldier upon track must seize bind whoever come to door so be ready to pounce a soon a door be opened therewith phil proceeded to hammer loudly upon senor cervantes door five six time did hammer upon door with iron bar gently at first with steadily increasing vehemence before notice be taken of summons at length however thin pencil of light appeared through shutter of window over door drawing of bolt became audible just a phil began to hammer afresh window be thrown open figure appeared gruff voice demanded querulously hallo there who knock at untimely hour away with whoever be leave in peace will sound rattle summon watch watch exclaimed phil under breath phew never thought of if must chance to encounter watch may yet have trouble sudden inspiration came to stepping back into middle of road where hooded figure might be seen from above exclaimed in deep solemn voice mateo cervantes in name of holy inquisition command to open holy inquisition ave maria what have done ejaculated figure above in evident trepidation pardon reverend father continued not who be will be down instantly light vanished from window be good idea of mine remarked phil in whisper thought must fetch down now think will be necessary to seize bind friend cervantes immediately that come to door will admit without question doubt after be in door be closed must be guided by circumstance act accordingly here come streak of light showed beneath door there be sound of bolt being drawn presently door opened big burly elderly man touzled hair touched with grey body enveloped in long white nightgown appeared holding candle above head a light fell upon two hooded figure involuntarily drew back with gasp whereupon phil dick stepped into passage closing door behind holy father exclaimed cervantes dropping on knee placing candle on floor beside raising hand in attitude of supplication swear to have done nothing be good catholic peace commanded phil raising hand imperatively how many be there in house with how many reiterated trembling man be alone reverend father quite alone give solemn word workman live here with house be not large enough be well interrupted phil now rise to foot friend cervantes conduct to shop shop echoed armourer give word reverend sir that there be nothing in shop that le reason why must hesitate to lead thither interrupted phil sternly of course of course agreed man anxiously follow reverence have nothing to conceal nothing to conceal then scrambling to foot taking up candle man proceeded few step along passage flung open door raised candle above head in such manner a to throw light into room stood aside to allow unwelcome untimely visitor to enter after friend remarked phil waving hand for armourer to precede light lamp two added must have more light than candle affords man bowed entered room be in fact shop set candlestick down upon bench proceeded to light couple of lamp stood on wall bracket while be doing visitor be busily engaged in noting content of shop so far a imperfect light afforded by single candle permitted most prominent object therefore first arrested attention be dozen complete suit of very fine armour two of being black inlaid with fine gold scroll work while others be perfectly plain highly polished then there be back breast piece greave gauntlet mace ax sheaf of arrow suspended from wall several very fine bow tied up in bundle in one corner last by mean least large case resting upon counter in be set out number of sword dagger poniard there be also three long case ranged along base of side back wall of shop two visitor shrewdly suspected contained firearm ammunition now reverend sir said armourer a having lighted two lamp turned faced two hooded figure with bow be at service be pleased to give command be well retorted phil now hark ye friend cervantes be credited with being man of discretion see to then that ye justify reputation by observing most complete silence regarding visit understand perfectly father replied armourer word hint will breathe to living soul about good replied phil will do well to remember that promise keep now for reason doe not concern in least require certain arm must be very best have to begin with therefore show two best sword in stock arm sword ejaculated astonished cervantes looking keenly at visitor then suddenly seizing candle thrusting forward endeavoured to peer into face who be ye exclaimed be not ah have be two english prisoner who morning before must get further pair threw upon bore to ground while phil gripped unfortunate man by throat to prevent from cry out raising alarm dick whipped out rope have be carrying beneath habit trussed up worthy senor so securely that must move neither hand foot then gagged very effectively by thrusting hilt of one of own dagger between teeth securing there now hark ye friend cervantes admonished phil be unfortunate for that have penetrated disguise since will necessitate remaining a be until morning when doubt someone will arrive to release need certain weapon propose to help to need not fear that be about to be robbed will pay generously for whatever take now dick continued turning to chichester pick weapon let begone have none too much time before daylight recommend for choice good sword musket brace of pistol with good supply of ammunition for stout dagger bow arrow good strong machete for general purpose that think will be quite a much a will be advisable for to cumber with so do agreed dick dryly for own part be not at sure that must not dispense with musket be heavy cumbersome thing to carry may never need still suppose may a well take one apiece can always throw away if find too troublesome how do propose to pay man phil know that have money true assented phil have still two emerald eye of idol found in cave where slew monstrous beast will give one of in payment handsome payment will be too ay that will agreed dick have entirely forgotten about emerald give one of by mean can then help with clear conscience to best shop affords swiftly yet with greatest care two englishman selected weapon required together with a much ammunition a considered wise to cumber with after phil extracted from pocket in puma skin tunic one of emerald have mentioned holding close to eye of prostrate armourer said see that friend be emerald value be about one hundred time that of what have taken from nevertheless be going to leave with for payment see there be placed stone on floor where cervantes must see now listen to continued phil probably have in mind to go to authority to morrow a soon a be released inform of visit of ours to be that so yes can see by expression of eye have guessed aright well friend be advised by do remember that have escaped from inquisition if head of institution must learn that have be here will certainly hold responsible for escape from town will be useless for to say that must not help that surprised overpowered helped ourselves to of property will simply reply that ought not to have allowed to be surprised overpowered that knew two prisoner have escaped that must have have wit enough to have seen through disguise given alarm before have time opportunity to overpower suppose need not remind of what fate will be in case therefore think well over matter hing that may afterward regret must be easily able to concoct story to account for present plight must satisfy who may find in morning without referring to now will leave farewell therewith two friend extinguished lamp taking candle retired from shop quietly closing door behind light of candle enabled easily to unfasten outer door done blew out light silently opened door cautiously peered out into street be silent deserted therefore without further ado tiptoed down step closing door behind a went keeping within shadow a much a possible hastened in direction must take out of city hour later be clear of cuzco using star a guide be speeding along fairly good road led in south easterly direction intending to strike off to eastward in search of river twenty thirty mile farther on since suspected that high road must be last place where pursuer must be likely to look for about ten o'clock next morning having encountered meanwhile only troop of thirty loaded llama with attendant driver whom having sighted at distance easily avoided by concealing until whole have passed unexpectedly came upon river again where bend brought close to road therefore deserted latter at point although going be by mean so easy thenceforward followed river until at length reached source high up among andes of carabaya now ensued period of incredible hardship suffering for adventurous pair for be now among most lofty of stupendous peak run in almost unbroken chain from one end of continent to other from sierra nevada de santa marta in north to within little more than one hundred mile from strait of magellan in south way lay over boundless snowfield across enormous glacier gashed with unfathomable crevasse up down stupendous precipice along narrow ice clad ledge where single false step must have hurled to death thousand of foot below to journey amid such surroundings be of course bad enough in hardship of be increased tenfold for two englishman from fact that came new to without experience after month of life in torrid lowland have thinned blood rendered peculiarly sensitive to piercing cold of high altitude be further intensified by icy wind seemed to rage continuously about peak come howling at through ravine add to difficulty of obtaining food for there be life among mountain solitude save occasional llama guanaco so wild a to be scarcely approachable condor two soaring aloft at such height a to be scarcely distinguishable to unaided eye impossibility of making fire reader will be able to form faint idea of what phil dick be called upon to endure while making awful passage over mountain

leaf with bountiful supply of have be careful to provide otherwise even indomitable hardihood courage must have succumbed to frightful toil privation exposure be obliged to undergo detailed description of five day journey over mountain must of suffice to fill book for must be record of continuous adventure hairbreadth escape from avalanche be constantly threatening to overwhelm of treacherous snow bridge crumbled away beneath foot of furious icy wind that seeming to be imbued with demoniac intelligence malignity always assailed in especially perilous situation sought to buffet from precarious hold of long hour of intolerable suffering when during hour of darkness be compelled to camp on snow patch build snow hut a partial protection from howling marrow piercing snow laden gale narrative however exciting a might be in earlier page must soon grow wearisome from rapidity with one adventure must tread upon heel of can therefore only be hinted at here suffice to say early in afternoon of fourth day upon surmounting crest of long ridge of ice encased rock at moment when demon of mountain have temporarily withdrawn elsewhere atmosphere be for brief space calm clear two weary exhausted adventurer caught brief entrancing glimpse of long green valley stretching away ahead of between two mountain range with island dotted lake in far distance sorata dominating ice clad peak piercing blue sky to left of at last at last goal be in sight incontinently flung down gasping upon iron hard rock gazed entranced upon glorious vision thrice glorious to after that have suffered until great snow cloud evolved out of nothing swooped down upon in final effort at destruction gale snowstorm lasted le than hour however when at atmosphere again cleared two friend who have be crouching under sheltering lee of great shoulder of rock rose to foot again looked forth toward land of promise vast snowfield corrugated by wind a sand of seashore be by rippling advance of tide otherwise of surface gently sloping downward offered easy road for first two mile of descent weary though be traversed in hour then came almost perpendicular descent of five hundred foot to snowfield where in deep recess might almost have be termed cave in great spur of rock camped comfortably for night enjoyed sweetest rest that have known for many long day when arose on following morning rested refreshed by long night sheltered sleep weak famished with hunger even coca leaf must now partially relieve nature be again kind to for air be still so crystalline clear that be able to determine accurately road for many mile ahead while most welcome sight of in little sheltered valley six mile away on small patch of green perceived flock of twenty vicuna grazing here at last be food for once more if must reach within bowshot without alarming animal to task bent energy with such success three hour later be gorging to repletion on raw flesh of one of animal being still without material wherewith to kindle fire marked end of trouble for before night again closed down upon have not only passed below snow line be also fortunate enough to encounter indian who be herding flock of llama

not be fed since have fallen into hand of spaniard not only lodged for night gave minute instruction how be to proceed during following day four day later arrived at northern extremity of sacred lake reached margin at precise moment that sun sank beyond long line of lofty rugged snow clad peak ran parallel to lake on western side evening be perfectly calm cloudless save in west where agglomeration of delicate rosy purple streak patch of vapour lay softly upon clear background of palest blue green sky forming picture of fairy archipelago of thickly clustering island intersected by bewildering maze of channel winding hither thither with thin sickle of young moon gleaming softly silver white hanging just above whole be one of sky set imaginative dreamer fancy free to wander afar into realm of fairyland to picture sort of strange unreal happening sort of sky probably suggested to simple mind of indian poetic idea that when gazing upon be vouchsafed vision of isle of blessed where dwell soul of departed in everlasting bliss for full five minute after two englishman have halted by margin of lake smooth unruffled surface of repeated picture a in mirror stood gazing entranced upon loveliness of scene lay spread out before in front of almost at foot lay placid water of lake bordered with reed rush just where happened to stand glassy mirrorlike surface faithfully reproducing soft delicate tint of overarching sky bank of rosy cloud in west cold pure blue of snow capped sierra on right ruddy blush of peak on left upon summit of last ray of vanished sun still lingered to change to purest white even a gazed clump of sombre olive vegetation between to right left of few mile apart two stream having source in neighbouring mountain discharged into lake so perfectly still be air that murmur of water came faint clear to ear of two comrade who have travelled so many hundred of mile with scene a goal to right left of shore of lake swept away in many curve bay indentation clear to horizon far beyond in whole of fair landscape never sign of life human animal yet stay what be dark film like tiny cloud came sweeping down toward from far up lake dick practical be first to catch sight of for phil be standing like one in trance gazing at scene with retrospective look in eye seemed to say thought be far away a dick watched approaching cloud like film resolved into flock of wild duck making a seemed directly for patch of rush near two be standing with momentous question of supper looming large in mind chichester plucked companion by sleeve pointed to approaching wild duck suggested propriety of immediately seeking hiding place until bird have settled murrain on duck dick exclaimed stukely in tone half pettish half playful have jolted out of reverie in be endeavouring to account for extraordinary feeling sometime in past have beheld very scene even a behold now of course know that be only fancy know have never before stood on soil foot be pressing at moment yet believe not a please waved right hand before to right left be absolutely familiar to a familiar a though have lived here life nothing be changed except that clump of bush seem to have approached little closer to margin of lake yes see that low bluff yonder well when last looked upon oh well never mind be laughing at have right to be surprised that must do so same know exactly where be now know that there be island out there on lake beyond horizon know of be that must visit will recognise instantly when see remember word now come along let see whether can get one two of duck seem to be making for reed yonder pair crept down to margin of patch of reed concealed therein scarcely have done so when flock came sweeping along with great rush of wing wheeled finally settled with loud quack probably of satisfaction that day work be over that be once more back in haven of rest then two musket wanderer have tenaciously retained throughout perilous journey across mountain barked out death message simultaneously flock rose again with loud squawk of alarm leaving round dozen of number dead badly wounded behind ten minute later a brief twilight be rapidly deepening into night nude figure of two englishman scrambled out of water bearing quota of dead wild duck laying spoil upon ground nonchalantly proceeded to resume quaint garment of skin now constituted only clothing long into night sat pair crouching over camp fire for though day be hot night be bitterly cold even in valley between two range of mountain while dick gazed abstractedly aloft into velvet blackness at innumerable star glittered above through frosty atmosphere phil spoke of strange dream persisted half jestingly half in earnest in regarding a memory visited so frequently of curious scene that have witnessed remarkable deed that have done in far past in imagination reality must not possibly say while talked dick listened vacillating between amusement conviction twenty stalwart figure thin aquiline of feature copper hued of skin strangely clothed came creeping up out of darkness until reached clump of bush within earshot of pair where lurked waiting patiently until audacious intruder upon most sacred territory must resign to sleep to captivity a planned by chief figure of group be to be of brief duration ending in death of unspeakable horror chapter eighteen how found enormous treasure took home be past midnight camp fire dick have bountifully replenished with stout branch from neighbouring clump of bush last thing before stretching out to sleep have dwindled to mass of dull red smouldering ember when white clad figure of elderly man copper hued bald headed clean shaven approached with stealthy footstep recumbent body of two slumbering englishman bending over first one then other held saturated cloth toward nostril in such manner that sleeper be permitted to inhale for about minute faint fragrant fume that emanated from then abandoning further caution withdrew from fire half consumed branch waved in air until smouldering stump be fanned afresh into flame when torch having served purpose a signal flung back upon almost extinguished fire couple of minute later to whom man have signalled approached camp fire while two party of four raised recumbent now unconscious figure of englishman to shoulder remainder carefully gathered together took possession of weapon other belonging of prisoner after at signal from leader entire party moved off marching inland away from lake relieving other at frequent interval for found unconscious burden heavy especially who be told off to carry dick party marched distance of nearly eight mile until in sequestered valley among hill reached ruin of what have evidently at one time be city of considerable importance built equally on side of ice cold mountain stream most of building be in ruin many indeed have be razed almost to foundation possibly to provide material for maintenance in repair of remained intact there be sufficient of latter to afford accommodation for fully three thousand people of be inhabited many of inhabited building be of considerable size with one solitary exception architectural grace beauty be conspicuously absent building being with exception mentioned constructed of large block of stone so perfectly worked that joint of masonry be scarcely perceptible without ornament adornment of kind whatever roughly roofed with thatch exception be in case of temple like so many in ancient peru be dedicated to sun structure be erected upon summit of low mound scarcely important enough in height to be termed hill yet high enough to allow building to dominate rest of town be built of beautiful white fine grained stone very much resembling alabaster also in startling contrast to other building in town be admirably proportioned elaborately ornamented with bold moulding cornice other architectural ornament although somewhat barbaric in design be nevertheless exceedingly effective chief glory lay in pair of immense bronze door of main entrance entire surface of be most exquisitely engraved with series of picture representing ceremonial of sun worship building stood upon immense quadrangular base of massive masonry side of be worked into step idea of age of structure must be gained from fact that immediately opposite main entrance step be worn away to depth of nearly three inch by innumerable multitude of worshipper who have passed up down pavement of interior be of marble of various colour worked into elaborate pattern beneath pavement there be chamber for confinement of prisoner other more sinister purpose be in one of subterranean chamber that friend phil dick recovered consciousness on morning following arrival at shore of sacred lake amazement at awaking to find bound hand foot on cold stone floor of dimly lighted dungeon whereas have fallen asleep in open may be readily imagined first most natural impression be that have again fallen into hand of spaniard be disabused of idea when hour two later four stalwart copper hued sharp featured men with long straight black hair clean shaven clad in white sleeveless tunic with sandal on foot armed with short broad bladed sword of copper entered cell leaving two coarse earthenware basin liberally filled with what looked like stiff porridge two jar containing water placing upon floor two of four proceeded to unbind hand of prisoner while other two drew copper sword stationed at door of cell with evident purpose of frustrating attempt at escape prisoner might be ill advised enough to make then phil inspired by knowledge have so mysteriously acquired at once recognised that companion have fallen into hand of body of aboriginal peruvian face cleared be right dick exclaimed joyously fellow be evidently surviving remnant of original inhabitant of country of whose existence vilcamapata told whose language speak will only be necessary for to tell who be will free at once when addressed first one then of quartette paid attention whatever to what said contenting with signing to prisoner to eat drink instead of obeying however phil continued to talk to alternately explaining ordering finally threatening men be not until twenty minute later when proceeded to bind hand of behind back again that stukely realised too late that quartette be evidently deaf dumb thus phil missed breakfast that morning while dick practical one of two secured having fully availed of opportunity afforded by unbound hand to eat drink in eminently unsatisfactory comfortless fashion hapless prisoner passed ensuing ten day seeing nobody four deaf mute who twice daily brought food water stood over while ate drank afterward securely binding again although seemed to be altogether unnecessary act of cruelty since so strongly constructed be place of confinement even door being massive slab of stone have be entirely unbound must not possibly have forced way out at length however on twelfth day of captivity two hour after morning meal have be served to be quite unexpectedly visited by four deaf dumb jailer who having unbound ankle signed to that be to leave noisome hole where have hitherto be confined when pair passed through stone door found in long passage where be immediately surrounded by escort of dozen soldier armed with sword spear shield of bronze wearing breastplate helmet of polished bronze latter adorned with tail feather of bird that gleamed with brilliant metallic golden lustre hemmed in by prisoner be marched along passage until reached flight of stone step party ascended finding at top in long spacious lofty corridor lighted at interval by circular opening high up under flat stone ceiling along corridor also prisoner be marched until reached doorway closed by two bronze door at officer of party first knocked immediately afterwards thrust open revealing room in be congregated thirty men attired in garb phil at least instantly recognised to be priestly by pair be at once taken over from armed guard who thereupon retired be more seen at one end of room stood table upon lay heaped quantity of flower two stalwart priest having taken possession of of prisoner latter be led to table flower have be arranged in form of two long festoon be thrown round neck crossed over breast passed round waist finally tied in front with long end drooping almost to foot be evidently being decked a victim of sort of sacrifice then phil suddenly wrenched free from hand of two priest who be putting finishing touch to adornment spoke in low voice to assembled concourse of priest what said be wholly incomprehensible to dick for be in tongue of young chichester have knowledge have most extraordinary effect upon priest who first seemed stricken dumb with amazement finally overwhelmed with paralysing fear for several minute while phil spoke in accent of mingled indignation reproach priest stood silent motionless with many mingled emotion displaying upon expressive countenance when at length concluded tirade by pronouncing certain word in unmistakably threatening tone of voice whole assemblage a though moved by same impulse threw up hand with action clearly expressed deepest profundity of horror then incontinently with one accord prostrated on marble floor at foot of two prisoner uttering howl of sorrow abject entreaty for perhaps five minute phil permitted to remain in posture then suddenly shouted single word have instant effect of reducing prostrate one to silence when again addressed time in gentler tone when at length concluded party rose slowly humbly to foot after two of stepped forward with appearance of deepest reverence proceeded to untwine garland of flower release pair from bond finally erstwhile prisoner be taken in charge by two of priest who first conducted to apartment wherein be requisite for bath together with complete change of clothing afterward to room very luxuriously furnished in found not only choice though evidently hastily provided meal likewise weapon ammunition other belonging while be being done remainder of priesthood filed into temple where vast congregation have assembled to take part in specially arranged festival in honour of full moon to be accompanied by sacrifice to explain a best must to assembled multitude that unfortunate most regrettable mistake have be made consequently although festival must proceed sacrifice beyond of pair of goat must be offered to dick chichester sudden extraordinary change in fortune of friend be utterly incomprehensible sooner be once more alone than turned to phil demanded explanation to great surprise stukely for almost first time since memorable night when have escaped from cartagena together seemed inclined to be reticent professed not to understand wholly sudden remarkable turn affair have taken appeared thoughtful inclined to be silent must only say that peruvian have mistaken for couple of spaniard that have consequently escaped terrible death by very skin of teeth when dick further pressed with several very obvious question only reply must extort be that in excitement of moment certain word meaning of did not in least understand have involuntarily escaped lip that be undoubtedly mysterious word have wrought singular change in priest attitude toward of change have felt justified in taking utmost advantage immediately that became apparent added that although danger seemed for moment to be past situation be still exceedingly difficult delicate demanding utmost care circumspection in handling wound up with earnest request to dick to cease from questioning further a wished to think matter out decide upon plan of action must be best to pursue under circumstance week ensued during dick phil saw very little of other for latter be engaged during practically whole of day in conference with chief priest authority who governed town sometimes with together while at night stukely manifested unmistakable desire to be left alone to puzzle out problem seemed to be worrying at length when have be exactly week in town phil returned late in evening to quarter dick have be jointly occupying in temple be at once apparent to younger of two that trouble difficulty with stukely have be wrestling be at end for be once more former self frank genial self reliant in exuberant spirit be all right at last dick exclaimed flinging down upon couch have straightened everything out to morrow start for sacred island with labourer tool provision in short everything that require a thing have turned out be very fortunate for that fell into hand of people for otherwise must never have succeeded in penetrating to hiding place of treasure getting safely away again now however be going there with full knowledge approval have even insisted on furnishing with help may require consequently will have nothing to fear from who be guarding island who have approached a stranger must certainly have destroyed in case said dick suppose ought to congratulate upon what have happened although hesitate to acknowledge now that thought be up with when be hauled up before priest last week decorated with flower what have happened to bring about fortunate turn in affair think that may a well explain whole affair to certainly will agreed stukely indeed be necessary that must understand situation in order that may know how to comport in presence of people first of then town be called huancane be place of very considerable importance in time of inca being in fact one of place to inca be in habit of resorting during period of extreme summer heat on account of proximity to lake also because of exceptional salubrity of climate now at time of conquest of country few spaniard settled here upon peruvian in accordance with pre arranged policy entirely abandoned town retired to certain secret hiding place among mountain believing that spaniard must not possibly contrive to exist here if left entirely to to astonishment of peruvian spaniard not only contrived to exist steadily increased multiplied to extent that there be three hundred of settled here supporting entirely upon product of valley then came change respecting peruvian of to day be exceedingly reticent one thing be certain huancane developed remarkable mysterious unhealthiness of climate rapidly cleared of spaniard so for two three year town be uninhabited fell rapidly into decay after peruvian returned to have be here ever since so much for history of huancane ever since time peruvian have be very jealously on watch against return of spaniard to part of country watch for have always be maintained when from time to time small party have appeared in neighbourhood have well vanished friend here be very reticent about disappearance too now seems that on day of arrival at margin of lake be seen watched day under impression that be spaniard when night came slept party stole upon stupefied in fashion did not explain how brought eight mile so from camp to town where a understand rather elaborate preparation be subsequently made for dispatch from world to next plan a know fell through in consequence of certain remark exigency of situation prompted to make somehow have idea that be being mistaken for spaniard decorating of with wreath of flower also seemed to sinister sign therefore concluded that moment for explanation have arrived began by informing that be not spaniard be such inveterate enemy of that have sailed across black water in great canoe for whole moon more with express object of fighting then suddenly that story of vilcamapata came into head hinted that there be more than met eye in fact of presence in country suddenly assumed high mighty demeanour reproached for blindness inability to recognise friend who stood before finally moved by impulse for be wholly unable to account rapped out certain word flashed into mind of knew not meaning somehow seemed to understand be word of power be too for from what have since transpired understand that be mysterious word utterance of by complete stranger be to be sign to peruvian manco capac first of inca have returned to earth to free from hated spanish yoke now of course know that utterance of magic word at what be for most critical moment be very extraordinary almost miraculous thing have have very little time to dwell upon thus far for when saw astonishing result of word have spoken mind be at once exercised with task of turning utterance to best possible account here be met by great difficulty for while attitude of priest became instantly changed from relentless hostility to submissiveness so complete a to be absolutely servile be without knowledge must have supplied key to situation therefore have to conduct with utmost circumspection lest must say do something must nullify good effect have unwittingly produced by adopting attitude of extreme reticence however allowing others to do talking gradually attained to knowledge that be regarded a reincarnated manco now copper coloured friend be on fire with eagerness for to initiate operation will eventuate in expulsion of spaniard from wonderful country many of be desirous that will at once assume style title of inca make huancane headquarters send forth summons to peruvian scattered throughout country to come in enrol under standard understand that even now there remain enough of to sweep spaniard into sea if properly led dick lad idea be not without attractiveness by mean assure have quite seriously considered tried to picture a inca with a lord high admiral of fleet generalissimo of army prospect appeal to very strongly so strongly indeed that intend to give much further consideration for somehow feel that position must exactly suit must suit position task of driving out spaniard restoring country to position of former power splendour must provide with many year of strenuous work wild adventure eh meanwhile however there be several formidable obstacle in way of immediate adoption of proposal obstacle have laid before chief priest half dozen noble who govern place have recognised reasonableness of contention be willing to leave everything in hand arrived at complete understanding agreement upon matter to day thereupon boldly informed that first step proposed to take be to secure possession of certain treasure existence situation of have be revealed to demanded assistance in task of recovery there be one two of who be shrewd enough to enquire in what way proposed to employ treasure when have secured that question refused to answer hinting that in present position of affair le knew about plan better must be for everybody concerned with rather ambiguous assertion have be obliged to remain content outcome of whole affair however be that to morrow start for sacred island accompanied by gang of thirty labourer provided with necessary tool so now think may say that with one very important exception trouble be over pray what be one important exception demanded question of how be going to convey treasure home when have secured possession of answered phil ah responded dick emphatically yes be going to be puzzler for there be only two quite so interrupted phil there be only two a say nevertheless be not going to worry unduly over for have doubt that problem will solve a others have during wonderful journey dick son resolution have brought two alone from cartagena to spot will not fail when time come for to decide how will transport treasure to england so worry lad now good night be tired to death for have scarcely slept wink during last five six night expedition set out from huancane on following morning be unexpectedly imposing from point of view of two englishman for in addition to thirty labourer promised by authority there be dozen llama four of be harnessed to couple of vehicle somewhat resembling hammock suspended from long pole being intended for accommodation of englishman while other two be loaded with food for expedition labourer carrying own tool llama have own driver expedition therefore consisted of thirty eight people told including two white men route lay along eastern side of lake covered distance of twenty five mile before camping for night on following day when afternoon be well advanced party arrived at point where at distance of three mile from shore small islet rose out of bosom of lake highest point of be crowned with group of extensive very imposing looking ruin islet guide in charge of expedition declared to be sacred isle phil strong in assurance springing from knowledge of be so mysteriously possessed agreed with next question be how to reach islet for there be boat craft of kind upon lake that difficulty be quickly met by labourer who at once set to work to cut large quantity of reed bound together in such fashion that formed commodious exceedingly buoyant raft upon entire party with exception of llama driver crossed over first thing on following morning passage of raft from mainland to island propelled a be by paddle only occupied about hour half a unwieldy craft gradually approached destination two white passenger on board began to realise that island ahead be considerably larger than have first imagined being fully hundred acre in extent while character of ruin made clear that not only have island be chosen for inexplicable reason a site upon to erect vast very magnificent temple dedicated to worship of sun that monastic establishment of corresponding importance have also be founded there now however whole of building be roofless in ruin yet even so be sufficiently imposing to imbue dick at least with several new startling idea regarding extent of civilisation to peruvian have attained under rule of inca a for phil seemed to have undergone complete yet subtle transformation during short journey across water of lake eye blazed with eagerness nostril dilated a though after prolonged absence be once more breathing native air carried with new kingly dignity that somehow seemed to render unapproachable gave order with calm finality of tone of absolute monarch knowledge of place be approaching be so intimate a to be positively uncanny a be evidenced when raft drew near island in charge must have run ashore at nearest point a soon a stukely perceived what must be at turned to said rebukingly not there not there bear away to south do not know that there be bay on side of island with wharf at can land comfortably conveniently apparently peruvian did not know yet when balsa rounded point there be bay there stone pier wharf of phil have spoken first thing to be done upon arrival be to instal party in a comfortable quarter a ruin afforded be accomplished more easily than have seemed possible at first glance for although a viewed from lake not only temple also other building have appeared to be roofless closer inspection revealed fact that one of small chamber formed part of main building of temple be still intact even to coved roof of solid masonry phil at once ordered to be cleared out prepared for reception of dick while a for rest building be soon found with aid of few branch cut from neighbouring grove of tree quantity of rush grew abundantly along margin of bay must be quickly covered in sufficiently to render habitable preparation kept peruvian busy for remainder of day while be thus employed phil dick devoted to minute inspection of temple proper have evidently at one time be magnificent building probably finest of kind in entire country now be in state of utter ruin beautiful roof wall having be stripped entirely of massive hammered engraved gold silver plate phil asserted have once adorned while marble pavement be heaped high with immense fragment of masonry of be evidently portion of boldly moulded cornice have once adorned inner wall of structure while others bore upon face sign of having be exquisitely sculptured in alto basso rilievo be melancholy sight even to unimpressionable dick irreparable ruin of once noble surpassingly beautiful building phil a gazed round in silence be so deeply moved that for moment seemed to have entirely forgotten object of visit to place seeing dick at length wandered away left friend to own mysterious self communings later on when again met to partake together of evening meal have be prepared for phil who though still in somewhat melancholy mood seemed to have become once more almost normal self endeavoured to explain to dick emotion have swayed through day be one of strange fit again that overcame said know dick have be subject to off on a far back in life a can remember come upon without previous warning apparent cause sometimes in form of extraordinarily vivid dream sometimes a more le vague memory awakened by chance sound sight of apparently slight cause have sufficed at time to recall scene in seem to have be actor far back in past so far back indeed that if really occurred at must have be long before be to say present body be born now laugh at lad doubt when talk thus must seem to to be stating absurdity impossibility for have often told that have never experienced curious sensation of speak let tell that however extraordinary may seem to to appear most natural thing in world because occur to so frequently because began to come to when be still too young to recognise extraordinary character most remarkable thing about to mind be that seem to bear close relationship to other appear to refer to same period of time same locality that locality being country of south america especially peru be not strange thing must have dreamed of being associated with people one of whom instantly recognised in person of vilcamapata be not equally strange that in dream must have acquired knowledge of language spoken by people who be now with yet know that such be actually case now tell dick that when stood among ruin of once splendid temple to day feeling be strong upon be not standing within wall for first time must shut eye recall dim tantalising vision of in pristine glory seemed to again see ruined wall standing erect perfect with decoration of gold silver plate ornament sculptured panel heavy cornice magnificent golden roof surmounting oh be tantalising to remember so much yet so little to have memory flash athwart one mind only to vanish again before one have time to fix identify why do not come to perfectly if must come at fleeting memory puzzle perplex nay more worry for can not help thinking that must have purpose if must know what be now to turn from generality to particularity be worried a to locality of hidden treasure will remember that vilcamapata last word to be that something have always believed to be treasure lie beneath great marble floor of temple until to day have believed have to come here straightway find entrance giving access to vault in treasure lie hidden yet have spent whole day in wandering among ruin in search of entrance without success have be quite unable to find opening promise to lead to underground part of structure day too have be haunted by elusive memory of secret connected with hiding of treasure memory continually seems to be on point of becoming clear illuminating only to fade away into nothing again be here however be great point swear will not go away again without treasure even though must be necessary to raze temple to foundation stone by stone in order to find for time seemed that nothing short of such drastic measure must serve purpose of two adventurer for search a must must find door opening of description giving access to chamber vilcamapata have given to understand existed beneath floor of main building indeed so far a discovery went there might have be such chamber at although phil be most positive a to existence made beginning of kind by setting labouring gang to work to clear away debris rubbish lay piled high upon temple floor in course of fortnight sufficient progress have be made to lay bare about one fourth of marble floor at eastern end of building including once beautiful now sadly damaged altar dedicated to sacrifice to sun then secret have so persistently eluded phil be revealed for one of rear corner of altar have be broken away by fall of heavy mass of masonry from roof exposing interior of structure now appeared be hollow revealed more than that revealed fact that massive slab formed rear of lower portion of altar be movable being pivoted on stone hinge at one end so by applying pressure in certain way to other end must be made to swing inward giving access to flight of step leading downward hinge be true have become stiff from long non usage so that now needed united strength of dozen men to revolve slab when once be forced open remained so there be further trouble in respect yet even then be found to be impossible to penetrate to subterranean chamber at once for when attempt be made to do so torch must be explorer carried refused to burn in mephitic atmosphere time therefore have to be allowed for exterior air to penetrate displace poisonous vapour have accumulated in chamber during many year that have remained hermetically sealed at length however after process of ventilation have be permitted to proceed for nearly week air in subterranean passage be found to be fresh enough to be breathed without much difficulty to allow of torch burning in with scarcely diminished luminosity search for treasure chamber be resumed now be discovered that labyrinth of passage chamber extended far beyond area covered by superstructure many of chamber having evidently be used a prison cell in at least of unhappy prisoner have be interned apparently left to perish of hunger thirst for upon being broken open be found to still contain mummified body of unfortunate wretch while others seemed to have be used by priest a place of retirement meditation one exceptionally large chamber too have be used a place of interment for successive chief priest of temple for body also withered shrunken in dry atmosphere of place be found ranged round wall of mausoleum clad in sacerdotal vestment enthroned in bronze chair of very beautiful elaborate workmanship finally after two englishman have be exploring elaborate system of underground chamber for nearly three hour came upon object of search stood for awhile breathless dumb in presence of apparently incalculable wealth chamber be by far largest that pair have thus far entered so large indeed be that light of torch carried be not nearly powerful enough to illuminate entire chamber even what beheld at first glance be enough to take breath away for upon forcing open door found confronted by enormous mass of dull white frosty looking metal upon closer inspection proved to be composed entirely of brick hundred thousand of of pure silver brick weighing about thirty pound just a much a man must conveniently lift with one hand for several minute pair stood gazing enraptured at enormous mass of precious metal experiencing such sensation a be given to few men to feel for must be remembered that have be brought up amid such condition that possession of few hundred pound must be regarded by a wealth then a if moved by same impulse turned to other burst into torrent of mutual congratulation mingled with expression of amazement that there must be so vast quantity of wealth in world for few joyous minute must scarcely speak rationally to other so intense be delight presently pulled together proceeded with investigation passing round enormous pile of silver be again brought to stand by pile of metal of almost equal size time be dull ruddy yellow in colour in fact gold gold piled up like silver in solid mass also composed of brick trifle larger than of le valuable metal being actually of such weight that brick be a much a one man must conveniently lift with hand be not for beyond pile of gold brick came upon row after row of great leather sack upon being opened be found to contain more gold either in form of rough nugget just a have be taken from mine dust have evidently be washed out of sand of river sight came near to driving demented for there be ton of precious metal far more of indeed than must possibly hope to ever carry away even be not for at far end of chamber came upon three great bronze coffer of elaborate exquisitely beautiful workmanship upon being opened be found to be more than half full of crystal diamond ruby emerald reflected light of torch in perfect blaze of vari coloured effulgence so dazzlingly brilliant that for moment must scarcely credit evidence of eye with at end of journey have be jealously hoarding guarding first pair latterly remaining one of emerald have formed eye of idol few gold scale have decorated clothing idea seemed so absurd so supremely ridiculous that when occurred to phil mentioned to dick pair of burst into peal after peal of laughter soon became hysterical indeed pair be very much nearer to being driven crazy than of dreamed of by sudden sight of such incalculable wealth fortunately for however be in pink of health condition thanks to long arduous journey through wilderness continuous life in open air since sound mind go with sound body mental process be in best possible condition for withstanding shock thus suddenly brought to bear upon eventually after hysterical outburst of joy have spent once more became rational being fell to discussing momentous question of how treasure be to be transported to england soon came to conclusion that to transport to england rather to coast for once there rest must be easy must be impossibility finally decided to take gem a much of gold a must find mean of conveyance for last namely mean of conveyance to coast be problem now confronted eventually agreed that there be only one way of solving be by returning to huancane enlisting service of high priest other authority of town in favour accordingly with object in view closed door of treasure chamber again made temporarily secure after returned to upper air electrified peruvian follower by directing to make immediate preparation for return to huancane such be energy contrived to infuse into native that not only crossed to mainland also accomplished very satisfactory return march before sunset night return of adventurer to huancane with news that secret hiding place of treasure have be discovered caused utmost rejoicing among inhabitant for somehow idea that elder of two stranger be reincarnated manco capac have got abroad what be more have found general acceptance now native in place for mile round be in perfect fever of impatience that operation for recovery of country from spaniard must be pressed forward with possible speed therefore when phil intimated that required strong transport train to assist in conveyance of treasure to coast nobody thought of demanding reason for conveyance of treasure out of country simply one devoted energy to collection of train armed guard phil declared must also be necessary when stukely determined to avail to utmost of obliging mood further intimated that must also need at least thirty peruvian to man ship intended to capture said peruvian of course to proceed across great water with met with difficulty in securing a many volunteer a needed formation equipment of such expedition a phil have demanded be not to be accomplished in day even week therefore while men animal arm be being got together at huancane messenger armed with necessary authority be sent forward along route must be followed by caravan with instruction to native along route to collect certain quantity of food for men fodder for animal in order that passage of expedition to coast might be expedited a much a possible while be being done phil dick having taken formal leave of huancane authority returned to sacred island assisted by dozen peruvian proceeded to transport to mainland a much of treasure a thought must be able to convey to coast of course be soon done then remained to be to wait patiently for transport train without must hing really worth doing at length after have be idly waiting for nearly three week train duly arrived what train be two hundred llama with driver for ten beast two hundred fifty armed men to protect caravan from possible not very probable attack by spaniard forty men one of whom be prepared to follow phil to world end back if need be ten of llama be intended for transport of provision on march from one village to be already loaded to full extent of capacity four be harnessed to curious hammock like arrangement have be provided for accommodation of phil friend on march remaining hundred eighty six animal a well a forty volunteer for sea service be available for transportation of treasure llama being provided with pair of saddle bag broad connecting band of sank so deeply into wool of creature that there be not slightest fear of bag slipping transport train be so very much stronger than englishman have dared to hope for instantly recognised possibility of carrying away nearly twice quantity of gold have originally arranged for day following arrival of train be accordingly devoted to transport of further gold brick from island to mainland until full load be provided for animal including be harnessed to hammock phil dick preferring to make journey on foot on following morning however imposing caravan started with first light of day upon journey toward coast winding way along eastern margin of sacred lake until reached southern extremity when swerved away to south westward across valley in lake lay embosomed toward towering snow peak of western cordillera of andes first three day of journey be quite pleasant uneventful for during time caravan be winding slow way across mountain valley on fourth day train entered mountain pas peruvian asserted be known only to have chosen in order to avoid possibility of collision with armed force of spaniard thenceforward for four full day train wound perilous way along narrow pathway bounded on one hand by towering inaccessible rocky cliff on other by ghastly precipice of such awful depth that base be frequently hidden by wreath of mountain mist floating far below across frail swing bridge stretched from side to side of awful fathomless rift called barrancas seem to be peculiar to andes up down steep rugged almost precipitous slope where single false step loose stone must send man beast whirling away down to death thousand foot below llama seemed to be more sure footed than mountain goat despite load scrambled up down apparently inaccessible place plodded sedately along narrowest most dizzy ledge without accident while peruvian seemed to be absolutely at home among peak precipice at length after four full day of incessant peril train emerged from last mountain pas found upon sloping grassy plateau on western slope of andes with limitless pacific stretching away into infinite distance peril hardship of journey be at end for thenceforward road wound serpentine way downward through series of ravine wild savage enough at first gradually widened out into gentle grassy tree clad slope that led down to sandy plain lie between lower spur of andes ocean took train two day to cross plain under neglect of spaniard be fast returning to desert state from under wise rule of inca have be reclaimed finally on seventeenth day of journey entire train arrived safely at little peruvian village on site of important port of arica now stand thanks to precaution adopted by guide of party not spaniard have be encountered on part of journey good luck of party did not end here for on very night of arrival small spanish coasting craft of about seventy ton be sighted by light of full moon becalmed in offing manning four fishing canoe with forty peruvian volunteer dick phil paddled off took without slightest difficulty towing safely into bay before sunrise where brought to anchor crew of fifteen spaniard be easily disposed of by return train who took far enough up into mountain to render impossible for to do harm then turned adrift craft herself named el ciudad de lima proved upon examination to be very fine stanch little vessel nearly new in ballast therefore required nothing to be done to to prepare for long voyage save storage of sufficient quantity of water provision with assistance of peruvian be soon obtained before sailing however phil at dick suggestion have completely emptied of ballast store of description then hauled close in to beach in sheltered position careened so that bottom might be carefully examined weed removed from then when be done gold brick be stowed right down alongside keelson upon plenty of dunnage on top of be stowed gem packed in strong wooden box joint of be afterward caulked well paid with pitch box finally being thickly coated over with pitch then on top of round gold box of gem sufficient quantity of sand to ensure ample stability be placed on top of again water provision be stowed to do to dick satisfaction demanded nearly month strenuous labour when be finished little craft re christened elisabeth be finally ready for sea dick pronounced fit to face heaviest weather longest voyage a be only small craft pair decided that twenty of forty peruvian volunteer must suffice a crew twenty be selected because of superior fitness for work of sailor a exemplified during preparation of little ship for sea at length everything being ready little craft hove up anchor sailed out of bay on long voyage round southern extremity of america up through vast atlantic ocean to say that voyage undertaken in so small vessel with crew of men who have never before looked upon sea be adventurous one full of peril marked by countless hairbreadth escape from capture shipwreck seems superfluous indeed so full of adventure be that detailed description of what little vessel crew went through must require larger volume than present for adequate recital must suffice therefore to state that adventurer ultimately arrived safely with precious cargo intact in plymouth sound six month after departure from peruvian fishing village to unbounded astonishment delight of who have long given up phil dick for dead meeting with old friend relative so far a dick be concerned landing eventual disposal of gem gold with necessary precaution must be left for reader to picture in detail may be mentioned that while dick purchased big estate built thereon magnificent mansion not far from plymouth speedily becoming one of plymouth most important citizen using enormous wealth wisely well ultimately earning knighthood for valiant conduct in assisting to disperse spanish armada phil stukely be so enamoured of idea of returning to peru becoming inca driving out spaniard that actually fitted out expedition with intent how fared what ultimately became of may perhaps be privilege of present historian day to relate story of great wonderful adventure of philip stukely dick chichester be ended yet upon reading page have with so much labour compiled be conscious of certain sense of incompleteness conscious that something still remains untold feel that to let narrative go forth to world without offering sort of explanation of source of stukely extraordinary uncanny knowledge of indian lore of ancient peruvian language have never learned must be unfair to reader in rough yet voluminous note of adventure sir richard chichester amused by jotting down at leisure after return to england left to heir at death fell into hand twenty year ago find word throw slightest light upon subject yet from time when first skimmed through note have be moved by ardent desire to put into narrative form in order that englishman of to day may be afforded yet one more example of indomitable courage tenacious perseverance that distinguished forefather during stirring glorious day of good queen be until quite recently have be deterred from undertaking pleasant task for reason certain portion of narrative be of such character a to strain credulity of reader to breaking point to cause to denounce good sir richard a will say perverter of truth must be exceedingly reluctant to do anything must produce latter result for seems perfectly evident from contemporary record that worthy knight be held in highest esteem by who be brought into contact with a man of unimpeachable honour probity whose word be always to be relied upon who be so unimaginative so thoroughly matter of fact of so simple straightforward character generally a to be completely above suspicion of slightest tendency to embellish story by perpetration of untruth quite recently however be made acquainted with certain extraordinary fact may possibly bear upon matter although not absolutely conclusive appear to corroborate sir richard astounding statement a may perhaps prove of interest to reader now set forth chanced that few month ago be guest at dinner party at men only be present be seated next to very brilliant young american physician who be devoting especially to study of heredity being hobby soon contrived to turn conversation toward topic after few general remark told several very startling story illustrative of certain contention advanced among others related case of young western farmer whose ancestor have emigrated from little village of langonnet in brittany to america two hundred fifty year ago have passed through usual vicissitude of fortune experienced by early settler in process of time have become so absolutely americanised that even very name have become corrupted almost out of recognition a of french origin young farmer in question possessed only very elementary education have never be taught french yet almost from moment when first began to speak occasionally interpolated french word in conversation practice extended a grew older finally transpired that certain property in neighbourhood of langonnet ancestor have abandoned a practically worthless have become so valuable enquiry a to whereabouts of owner have be set on foot descendant have be with much difficulty traced young farmer a being person most directly interested crossed to france to investigate now come marvellous part of story young man have sooner arrived in langonnet be remembered be now visiting for first time in life than began to recognise such of surroundings a remained unaltered since emigration of french ancestor more strange still perhaps be able to converse in breton dialect with little difficulty by time that have be twenty four hour in village point narrator sought to illustrate emphasise be that not only be heredity responsible for transmission persistence of certain peculiarity of face form character also that in few isolated case have actually be known to transmit knowledge a soon a neighbour have finished story replied to several comment upon put to case of philip stukely asking whether thought that uncanny knowledge manifested by gentleman be also due to heredity to replied that have not doubt of that if chose to investigate must probably discover that phil have peruvian blood in vein that long dead english ancestor of have once be in peru remained there for several year have not yet be able to undertake suggested investigation be able to do so be afraid that after so great lapse of time must be found impossible to pursue very far can not help thinking that story of american physician tends to explain to extent if not completely source of stukely amazing otherwise inexplicable gift of knowledge accordingly offer suggestion for what may be worth
