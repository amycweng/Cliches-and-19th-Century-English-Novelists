log of privateersman by harry collingwood chapter one capture of weymouth what led to french probably never did more audacious thing than when on night of october th party of forty odd of left lugger belle marie hove to in weymouth road pulled with muffled oar in three boat into harbour from whence succeeded in carrying out to sea newly arrived west indian trader weymouth loaded with full cargo of rum sugar tobacco expedition be admirably planned night chosen being that upon new moon occurred be dismal rainy exceptionally dark night with strong breeze blowing from south west hour be about two o'clock be there be ebb tide running ship have only arrived late in afternoon of previous day be outside vessel in tier of three frenchman have therefore nothing whatever to do to cut craft adrift allow to glide silent a ghost down harbour with bare pole under combined influence of strong wind ebb tide there be not soul stirring about quay at hour nobody therefore saw ship go out two custom house officer watchman only englishman aboard be fast asleep be secured before have time opportunity to raise alarm so neatly indeed be trick done that first intimation poor old peter white owner of ship cargo have of loss be when at first streak of dawn slipped out of bed went to window to gloat over sight of safely arrived ship moored immediately opposite house on other side of harbour where have be berthed upon arrival on previous afternoon poor old gentleman must scarcely credit eye when organ informed that berth occupied few hour previously be now vacant looked looked looked again finally caught sight of rope by weymouth have be moored dangling in water from bow quarter of ship to have be made fast then inkling of truth burst upon hastily donning clothes rushed downstairs let out of house sped like madman down high street across hope square so on to nothe in forlorn hope that ship with cargo represented bulk of saving of lifetime might still be in sight to inexpressible joy be not only so be scarcely two mile off port under sail heading for harbour in company with british sloop of war have be recaptured ere news of audacious seizure have reached ear of more than few of townspeople be back again in former berth safely moored by chain to quay be clear to to rest of weymouth crew when mustered that same morning to be paid off that incident have inflicted terribly severe shock upon mr white nerve poor old boy looked good ten year older than when have boarded in road on previous afternoon have shaken hand with captain winter a welcomed home congratulated upon having successfully eluded enemy cruiser privateer there be fierce glitter in eye firm determined look about mouth for one took a indication that fright severe a undoubtedly be have not quelled old man courage capture of ship by frenchman occurred during early hour of friday morning on following tuesday evening received message from mr white asking to call upon at office next day at noon punctual to moment presented be at once ushered into old gentleman private sanctum where found employer seated at desk with several bundle of paper lying before shook hand with very cordially signed to to be seated let see george commenced indenture will soon expire will not yes mr white answered will be out of time on sixteenth of next month just so just so thought that must have about month to run have be too busy last few day to ascertain precise date well george continued have come to conclusion that weymouth must be laid up for present at event capture other night have opened eye more completely than have ever be opened before to risk of working unarmed ship during war time be to continue to do so ship must happen to be captured must go far toward ruining be too old to endure loss so have made up mind to lay up weymouth while war last there be good money to be made even in war time if man go right way to work privateering be very profitable business when can be carried on successfully success depends a much a anything upon kind of men employed have be having chat with captain winter upon subject with result have purchased schooner that be now finishing off in martin building yard intend to fit out a privateer being kind of work in fact that have be especially built for captain winter will have command of of course with mr lovell a chief mate george upon captain very strong recommendation have determined to offer berth of second mate will take more than month to complete schooner fit for sea by time indenture will have expired captain winter give most excellent character have recommended for berth from what have seen of lad have come to conclusion that will not go very far wrong in giving to nay owe thanks boy have earned refusal of offer by steadiness industry so be yours freely if like to have want to make up mind answer nay upon spur of moment take little time to consider matter if like let know by end of week needed time for consideration however offer be altogether too good advantageous in way to be left hanging in balance a be therefore thankfully accepted on spot question of pay prize money then being gone into settled upon very satisfactory basis so far a be concerned took leave hurried off home to acquaint relative with good fortune now reader will have gathered from foregoing at period of opening of story be sailor quite young man probably need say little more to complete acquaintance thus begun name be george bowen be only son of father captain bowen who be believed to have be drowned at sea ship never having be heard of after leaving england for south sea when be little chap of only six year old sister dora be born just about time that be supposed father must have perished year later poor mother died broken hearted at loss of husband that positively idolised thus two dora be left orphan at very early age be forthwith taken into motherly care of aunt sophie who have child of own poor aunt sophie be afraid led terrible life for be almost from birth big strong high spirited boy impatient of control resolute to have own way dora ah dora with sweet docile disposition made ample amends for shortcoming in end by gentle persuasiveness did much to subdue rebellious spirit render amenable to domestic discipline be exceptionally well educated a education went then for uncle jack aunt sophie husband be clever long headed fellow who believed that be not possible for man to know too much so dora in addition to receiving sound english education be taught french music in fact general run of what be then known a accomplishment while in addition also to good sound english education be taught french latin mathematics including geometry algebra trigonometry be allowed to continue at school until fourteenth birthday when in consequence of strong predilection for sea a profession be apprenticed by uncle jack to mr white for period of seven year first year of apprenticeship be spent aboard collier trading between tyne weymouth then be transferred for three year to levant trader finally be promoted a considered into weymouth west indiaman brings back to point from whence bit of explanation started modest cottage called home be situated in picturesque little village of wyke have therefore walk of two mile before when left mr white office a sped along road beguiled way by building most magnificent of castle in air after brief peace of amiens war have again broken out in may of preceding year everybody be of opinion that struggle then commenced be destined to be of quite exceptional duration severity then again be well known that spain be only waiting for sufficiently plausible pretext to declare war against that pretext be believed must be found in capture by british squadron of three spanish treasure ship medea clara fama news of have just reached england be of course simply disastrous from commercial point of view for navy men privateersman opened up long vista of opportunity to win distinction fortune for gave marine commerce of three rich powerful nation france holland spain a lawful prey fortune of almost fabulous magnitude have be made by lucky privateersman during last war be there not even then living in heroic captain tizard who have captured spanish plate ship sailed into plymouth sound with prize in tow massive gold candlestick glittering at mast head if others have done such thing why not knew captain winter for man who not only have detail of profession at finger end who also combined highest courage with nicest discretion subtlety of resource have already served in good stead on more than one occasion then there be robert lovell chief mate late of weymouth like captain be finished seaman bold a lion knew exactly how to deal with crew encouraging who did duty while idle skulker found in terrible enemy late second mate man named penrose who have only be one voyage with have not given skipper satisfaction have proved to be untrustworthy overbearing obstinate unscrupulous altogether objectionable so be not at surprised to find that have be passed over be surprise most agreeable one too to learn that captain have recommended in place of be responsible post more so even than of second mate in ordinary trader have fear of myself be quite determined to leave nothing undone to justify old man recommendation thus pondering soon found at home truth compels to admit be greatly disappointed with reception that good news met with at hand of aunt sophie dora instead of congratulating wept wept because be so soon to leave again because of dangerous character of new berth declared conviction must be killed by first enemy that might happen to fall in with if be fortunate enough to escape death must be brought home to miserable helpless cripple leg arm two uncle jack must say failed to shake conviction dora even went so far a to endeavour to coax to decline berth only desisted upon representation be so foolish a to do so must inevitably be snapped up by press gang indisputable fact appeared to have forgotten that there be at least dozen men in weymouth alone who have gone through whole of last war without receiving so much a scratch brought to regard matter somewhat more resignedly at length when have cried blind uncle jack cheery sanguine argument began to tell upon so effectually that dried tear announced determination to hope for best strange to say although have be at home six day have hitherto be so busy running about with dora calling upon rather numerous circle of friend up to time of receiving mr white offer have not found time to do more than just become aware of fact that mr joe martin local ship builder happened to have very fine craft upon stock well advanced toward completion now however that have come about be to serve on board same craft a dickey be impatience to see what be like so next day happening to be fine set off first thing after breakfast walking in to weymouth made way straight to shipyard a reached gate caught first near view of stood entranced be planked right up to covering board while one strong gang of workman be busy fitting bulwark gang upon stage be hard at work caulking third gang under bottom having apparently just commenced operation of coppering be consequently not presented to view in most attractive guise nevertheless being entirely out of water be able to note beauty fell in love with on spot be much bigger craft than have expected to see measuring a be presently told exactly two hundred sixty six ton be very willow load line being only seven foot above lowest part of unusually deep keel be more than counterbalanced by extraordinary breadth of beam have very long flat floor despite excessive beam line be finest have ever seen be saying great deal for have seen in west indie of most speedy slaver afloat altogether impressed a vessel likely to prove not only phenomenally fast also perfect sea boat be pierced for four gun of side with two stern chaser there be pivot on forecastle for long eighteen pounder must therefore carry armament formidable enough to enable to go anywhere do anything in reason having thoroughly inspected from outside gone down under bottom next made way on board went down below to have look at interior accommodation found to be everything must possibly be desired arrangement have evidently be carefully planned with view to securing to crew maximum possible amount of comfort cabin be large a lofty a willow depth of vessel must allow there be convenience in state room in shape of drawer locker sofa folding table shelf cupboard so on living quarter be not only light airy comfortable be being finished off with great taste considerable pretension to luxury while be prowling about below encountered harry martin son of builder who told that mr white when completing purchase of vessel have given instruction that reasonable expense be to be spared in making craft a thoroughly suitable a possible for service of privateer spent fully two hour on board prying into nook cranny of vessel making thoroughly familiar with whole of interior arrangement then left well satisfied with prospect a second mate of so smart comfortable craft a be crossing hope square toward foot of scrambridge hill on way home again met captain winter who after congratulating upon appointment informed that have secured carte blanche from owner a to number of crew that be determined to have vessel strongly manned enough to enable to keep at sea even after sending away prize crew two be therefore anxious to secure a many good men a possible suggested must not better employ spare time than in looking about for such sending to a many a must find did a skipper mr lovell chief mate be industriously engaged in same manner contrived by time that schooner be ready for sea to scrape together crew of ninety men told large proportion of whom be portlanders a fine fellow for most part a ever trod plank schooner be launched fortnight from day upon have first visited a slid off way joe martin youngest daughter christened giving name of dolphin be launched with two lower mast in be at once taken up harbour moored opposite mr white warehouse where work of rigging getting gun store on board be forthwith commenced thenceforward be kept busy day assisting skipper mr lovell in task of fitting out so diligently did work by mid day of th of november dolphin be ataunto ready for sea very handsome rakish formidable craft looked a lay alongside quay enormously long delicately tapering mast towering high above warehouse roof wide spreading yard extending far over quay accurately squared standing running rigging a taut straight a iron bar ten long nine pounder grinning beneath triced up port lid brightly polished brass long eighteen pounder mounted upon forecastle spacious deck scraped scoured until be a white a snow new copper black topside gleaming shimmering in gently rippling tide day after day a work of fitting out progressed quay be crowded with people who came down to watch operation admire schooner so favourable be impression created that have be in want of men must have secured volunteer in plenty from among idler who spent day after day alongside watching at work speculating among with hand in pocket a to measure of success that bold venture be likely to meet with when knocked off work at noon to go to dinner work be completed a mr white have taken care to secure letter of marque in good time be determined that dolphin must proceed to sea same evening crew having already signed article be warned to hold in readiness for start at moment notice a for trap be already on board nicely arranged in cabin sister dora having with usual tenderness of affection insisted upon attending to matter there be therefore nothing for to do to go home say good bye rejoin ship ceremony have always found to be most painful business be especially so in present case for be not only once more about to brave ordinary peril incidental to sailor life be in addition to be exposed to still greater hazard involved in battle with enemy poor dora aunt be too well aware from experience of others in last war what hazard be knew how many men have gone out from home hale strong full of enthusiasm to find death in first engagement to be brought back sooner later maimed helpless physically ruined for remainder of life a tender loving woman will anticipated one of evil for be therefore distressed beyond hope of comfort must shut eye to possibility that foreboding might come true might therefore be looking upon dear face for last time to bid farewell therefore tear from clinging arm be most painful business be not until have returned to dolphin be busying about final preparation for departure be able in degree to recover equanimity get rid of troublesome lump must keep rising in throat chapter two foggy night in channel town clock be striking four when muster roll having be called hand being found to be on board cast off shore fast under influence of light keen frosty air from northward went gliding down harbour under mainsail flying jib fully two hundred people following along quay cheering a went dolphin be first privateer that weymouth have fitted out since last declaration of war enthusiasm be intense for in addition to foregoing circumstance be largest most powerful most heavily manned privateer have ever sailed out of port full complement numbering le than ninety told including surgeon one of whom be weymouth portland man consequently there be plenty of friend relative to see start bid god speed upon clearing harbour sail be at once made upon schooner object being of course to reach open channel a quickly a possible when might hope to fall athwart prize at moment noble picture must have made a edging away to pas out round portland noble space of new white canvas be expanded one after other until be under plain sail to royal day have be one of quiet grey day occasionally occur about latter end of november sky pallid shapeless canopy of colourless cloud through sun at long interval became faintly distinguishable for few minute at time then vanished again there be little wind to speak of faint breathing prevailed being from northward air be very keen atmosphere so thick that horizon be contracted to limit of scarcely three mile looked very much a though with must have fog moon be long time past full small crescent to have be reduced must not rise until very late there be prospect therefore that coming night must be dark thick just kind of night in fact when might hope to blunder up against ship belonging to enemy take by surprise captain winter plan be to run across to french coast make cherbourg then cruise to westward in hope that by so doing must either pick up french homeward bound merchantman succeed in recapturing one of prize that french privateer occasionally captured in channel generally sent into cherbourg saint malo must fail in next project be to cruise in chop of channel for fortnight then return to weymouth to replenish store water being hoped that by time something definite must be known a to prospect of war with spain course took close past easternmost extremity of portland highest point of miscalled island by time that have drifted across bay for progress must scarcely be called more than drifting fog have settled down so thickly that have not by good fortune happened to have heard two men calling to other ashore must have plumped schooner on to rock at base of cliff before seeing land even a be be touch go with for although helm be put hard starboard at first sound of men voice be so close in a schooner swerved heavily round just grazed great rock head of be sticking out of water now knew pretty well where be hauling well off land out of further danger shaped course must take well clear of shamble so stretched away athwart channel by time that have hauled off land about mile have fallen a dark a wolf mouth with fog so thick that what with darkness together be impossible to see a far a foremast from main rigging while wind have fallen so light that canvas flapped rustled with heave of schooner upon short channel swell yet by heaving log found that dolphin be slinking through water at rate of close upon three knot in hour while be perfectly obedient to most profound silence prevailed fore aft for captain winter have given instruction that bell be not to be struck that order be to be passed quietly along deck by word of mouth binnacle light be also carefully masked skylight obscured by close fitting painted canvas cover have be made for express purpose there be therefore nothing whatever to betray presence except soft rustling of canvas a same sound must prevail on board other craft might happen to drift within vicinity be in hope that by keeping ear wide open might become aware of presence before own be betrayed be true that precaution greatly increased risk of collision with other vessel trusted that watchfulness upon depended for discovery of other craft in neighbourhood must suffice to avert such danger in way time slowly dragged along until midnight when be called to take charge of deck upon turning out found that there be improvement in weather except that faint breathing from northward have strengthened sufficiently to put canvas to sleep to increase speed to trifle over six knot be just a dark thick a ever lovell whom be relieving informed that nothing have be seen heard during watch now by dead reckoning be a nearly a possible thirty mile south by west of portland bill skipper be still on deck have be up through first watch announced intention of keeping deck until weather must clear night be now bitterly cold frosty rail rope coiled upon pin companion slide even glass of binnacle be thickly coated with rime deck be slippery with be close upon two bell everything on board dolphin be silent a grave sound being audible save soft seething of water past bend gush of wave created by plunge of schooner sharp bow into hollow of swell when skipper who be standing near on starboard side of binnacle sucking away at short pipe caught hold of arm said in low tone listen bowen have sharp ear tell if hear anything hereaway on starboard bow listened intently for second without hearing anything be about to say so when thought caught faint sound a of creaking of boom at same instant two look out men on forecastle forgetting in imminence of danger instruction to be silent simultaneously shouted in sharp incisive tone hard port hard over there be big ship right under bow there be nothing whatever to be seen from where skipper stood cry be too imperative to be neglected therefore sprang with one bound to wheel assisted helmsman to put hard over while skipper rushed forward to see for what be be reported to be in way have grasped spoke of wheel when heard cry close ahead of of there be small craft close aboard of on larboard beam sir followed by confused rush of foot along ship deck order to put helm hard starboard call captain sound appeared to be so close aboard of involuntarily braced against expected impact of two vessel next moment through dense fog saw faint glimmer of light opening out clear of foremast saw huge dark shapeless blot go drifting away on to port bow heard sharp hail from stranger schooner ahoy what schooner be that dolphin privateer of weymouth what ship be that answered skipper hoogly east indiaman calcutta to london can tell whereabouts be thirty six mile south by west of portland bill answered skipper much obliged to sir came faint acknowledgment from indiaman already out of sight again in fog be followed by further communication apparently question from tone of voice two vessel have by time drawn so far apart from other that word be unintelligible captain made endeavour to reply coming aft again resuming former position near binnacle be still discussing in low tone narrow escape from disastrous collision ten minute having elapsed since have lost sight of hoogly when suddenly faint crash be heard somewhere away on port quarter immediately followed by shout cry confused popping of pistol lasted about minute when became a suddenly silent again hillo ejaculated skipper turning hastily to binnacle a first sound be heard taking bearing of a nearly a possible there be something wrong with indiaman sound very much a though one of rascally prowling french lugger privateer have run aboard d 'ye hear rumpus away out on larboard quarter sir hailed one of men on forecastle ay ay lad hear be not asleep at end of ship answered winter depend upon george continued to hoogly have be boarded carried by frenchman there a sound ceased be over whatever be will haul up bit see if can discover what have happened starboard man to man at wheel starboard let come up to full by hand to sheet brace mr bowen brace sharp up on larboard tack then let men cast loose gun load call hand quietly let go to quarter skipper peered into binnacle again ' east half east continued referring to direction in schooner be now heading if be in luck ought to come athwart indiaman again in about twenty minute be to say if have hove to in order to transfer prisoner pulled out watch noted time replaced watch in pocket just slip for'ard mr bowen caution hand to be a quiet a possible over work said give look out men hint to keep eye skinned french have undoubtedly taken indiaman by surprise now must see if can not give frenchman surprise in turn went forward to execute order upon return found skipper watch in hand talking to chief mate who with rest of watch below have be called meanwhile crew be at quarter having cast loose gun be busily loading work being carried on a quietly a possible a rejoined skipper arm chest be brought on deck in few minute man be armed with cutlas brace of pistol by time that preparation be completed twenty minute allowed by captain winter to reach scene of recent disturbance have elapsed topsail be laid to mast word being passed along deck for absolute silence to be maintained for man to listen with ear to come aft report if heard sound then fell to listening with bated breath not sound be to be heard save gurgle wash of water about rudder a schooner rose fell gently to lift of sea in way full quarter of hour be allowed to elapse at expiration of skipper remarked well be clear that wherever indiaman may be be not hereabout if a believe have be attacked have beaten frenchman off have of course proceeded on up channel if have be taken captor have evidently headed at once for french port possibly having be near enough to have heard hail passed between if be case must naturally be anxious to get away from neighbourhood of exploit a quickly a possible for fear of being interfered with assuming supposition of mine to be correct will be certain to make for nearest french port in case be cherbourg will therefore resume course toward cherbourg when if be lucky may get sight of indiaman privateer at daybreak if confounded fog will only lift accordingly squared away once more upon former course followed until morning without hearing seeing anything of vessel for be looking being first night out watch being starboard watch be relieved by lovell at four o'clock be under ordinary circumstance must not have be called until seven bell half past seven be not greatly surprised when on being called found that be still dark time being five bell be lovell who called george exclaimed shaking by shoulder george rouse bitt lad tumble out fog be clearing away cap'n expects to make out indiaman at moment so be hand hurry up hearty ay ay grumbled only half awake will be up in brace of shake a lovell quitted cabin returned to deck rolled out of bunk hurriedly began to dress by lamp that chief mate have be considerate enough to light for convenience when went on deck found that a lovell have stated fog be clearing away few star showing out here there overhead moreover wind have hauled round from eastward be now blowing fresh topgallant breeze have already raised short choppy sea over dolphin be plunging a lightly buoyantly a sea gull doing seven knot easily although skipper have taken square canvas off letting go along under mainsail foresail staysail jib there be nothing to be seen a fog still lay thick on water there be indication that must probably lift before long captain winter have therefore ordered hand to be called so that might be ready for emergency might arise sorry to have be obliged to disturb george before time said skipper a appeared on deck fog show sign of clearing want to be ready to act decisively moment that catch sight of indiaman quite so sir replied where do expect to make ah answered be just question have be puzzling did not see enough of last night to enable to judge very accurately what rate of sailing may be rather fancy from glimpse caught of that be something of slow ship if so may have run past at same time if french have got hold of of have very little doubt must be pretty certain to crowd sail upon in order to get well over toward own coast before daylight have shortened sail a see so a to reduce own speed a nearly a possible to what judge hers will be schooner be perfect flyer there be holding must not surprise bit to find that have shot ahead of chase feel more than half inclined to heave to for short time lovell think that indiaman be still ahead of somewhere well said ought to see something of before long for be clearing fast overhead appears to that even down here on water can see further than must when first came on deck be evident that skipper be very fidgety so thought must not further unsettle by obtruding own opinion coincided with upon therefore finding slightly disposed to be taciturn left made round of deck assuring that hand be on alert ready to go to quarter at moment passed forward along starboard side of deck noticing a did so that there be faint lightening in fog away to windward showing that dawn be approaching a turned on forecastle to go aft again observed that fog be thinning away famously on weather quarter a walked aft kept eye intently fixed on thin patch appeared to be small widening break in curtain of vapour enveloped for be evidently drifting along with wind have reached a far aft a main rigging still staring into break when suddenly halted for struck that there be small faint blotch of darker texture in heart of away about three point on weather quarter before must be quite certain about matter however blotch if such be have become merged lost again in thicker body of fog followed in track of opening while be still debating within whether must say anything about what fancied have seen became aware of much larger darker blot slowly looming up through leeward portion of break apparently drifting across to windward though effect be knew due to leeward drift of break time felt that there be mistake about accordingly cried sail ho large ship about point on weather quarter hurried aft to point out to skipper before must vanish again looked in direction toward be pointing be unable to see anything eye being dazzled in consequence of having be staring in fit of abstraction at illuminated compass card in binnacle must lovell see anything while be still endeavouring to direct gaze to disappeared be quite certain that eye be not deceiving mr bowen demanded skipper rather pettishly absolutely certain sir replied what be more believe to be indiaman for just before sighting fancied saw smaller craft about two point further to windward astern of bigger ship be now of opinion that what saw be lugger ay retorted skipper fancied saw lugger so perhaps under circumstance must naturally fancy also that saw indiaman did anybody else see anything like sail astern of demanded in low voice addressing crew yes sir answered voice from forecastle looked directly that heard mr bowen sing out fancied that saw something loomin up dark through fog on weather quarter fancy ejaculated skipper however continued may be right mr bowen after how far do suppose stranger to have be away from probably matter of three mile thereabout answered smaller craft must perhaps be mile mile half astern of then said skipper will haul fore sheet to windward let jib sheet flow wait quarter of hour to see what come of if be correct in surmise mr bowen ought to see something of stranger of yours by time have doubt will sir answered if may be allowed to offer suggestion be that must bring schooner to wind so that may eat out to windward of indiaman ready for bearing up running aboard when heave in sight very good idea mr bowen will do so answered skipper main fore sheet be accordingly flattened in when schooner luffed up to about south east slowly forged to windward athwart what believed to be track of indiaman meanwhile dawn be coming slowly while fog be gradually thinning away under influence of freshening breeze so that be by time able to distinguish head of breaking wave at distance of fully mile a for kept eye intently fixed upon grey cloud of vapour went drifting away to leeward past weather quarter presently when have be hove to about ten minute caught sight of thickening in fog thereaway even a looked began to grow darker assume definite shape there be sir exclaimed pointing out darkening blot to skipper by time that have found same blot have strengthened into misty outline of large ship under studding sail running before wind steering course must bring diagonally athwart stern within biscuit toss of lee quarter ay there be sure enough responded skipper eagerly now continued next thing be to find out whether be indiaman not without arousing suspicion of aboard haul aft lee jib fore sheet there lad must not present appearance of lying in wait for luff can without shaking to man at wheel want schooner to move fast through water must let yonder ship pas near enough to if possible to be able to read name on stern think there be much doubt about being indiaman sir said for if will look out here broad on weather quarter will see what take to be lugger have captured ay true enough do see something have sharp eye george mistake answered skipper yes there certainly be something there a say look uncommonly like lugger well be good two mile off will have time to run big fellow aboard take before lugger be near enough to trouble stand by there of to jump aloft loose topsail when give word hillo what be that gun from lugger by hookey have made out like look of apparently so have fired gun to wake up people aboard prize have now have seen aboard big ship too be taking in stunsails to haul to wind suppose be too late hearties apostrophising ship now le than cable length from will be to leeward of in two minute boy bring glass will find slung in becket in companion on came ship near enough now for to see that be undoubtedly indiaman a undoubtedly british people on board be evidently in great flusteration for have started to take in studding sail at once pretty mess be making of job most of studding sail having blown forward over fore side of boom while be still battling with unruly canvas ship swept yawing wildly close past lee quarter so close indeed that glass be required for even in faint light of growing dawn be possible to read with unaided eye gilt lettering on stern hoogly london chapter three first success settle matter for good exclaimed skipper now in rare good humour a pointed to indiaman stern up with helm man to man at wheel let go broad off will pas under indiaman stern board from to leeward away aloft there let fall topsail of mr lovell will take twenty men suppose there be above forty frenchman aboard craft board by main mizzen chain a touch will have to be smart about a want to remain alongside grinding schooner side to piece moment longer than be absolutely necessary take ship a soon a have secured possession driven prize crew below haul wind keeping between lugger moment that party be aboard will haul off may leave to deal with fellow to windward will make best of way to weymouth of course see that men freshen priming of pistol at once then station half by main rigging half by fore ready to jump at word ay ay sir responded lovell a hastened away to select twenty men topsail be by time sheeted home men be mast heading yard skipper sprang upon rail steadying by weather main swifter to con schooner alongside in obedience to order from went forward gave word for who be not of boarding party to arm with musket pick off of frenchman who might show head above rail took le than ten minute to close with indiaman a ranged up on lee quarter swept alongside party of ten dozen jabbering gesticulating frenchman jumped up on poop saluted with irregular fire of musketry however did harm upon people returning fire three of frenchman fell while rest tumbled off poop in such desperate hurry that fellow be fairly convulsed with laughter skipper conned alongside in such masterly style believe hull of two vessel actually touched at at least be unconscious of shock yet be close enough for two boarding party to spring with ease certainty from rigging into indiaman channel next moment a tumbled in over ship rail helm be eased up vessel sheered apart without having carried away so much a rope yarn there be tremendous scuffle on indiaman deck for perhaps minute with great popping of pistol sound of heavy blow cheer from lad loud execration on part of frenchman shriek two of pain at well directed cut thrust then rush forward during remained twenty fathom to leeward of indiaman ready to sheer alongside again render assistance if necessary then lovell sprang up on poop hailed that have secured possession of ship must haul wind a soon a must get in studding sail thereupon helm be put hard up wore short round bracing sharp up on starboard tack to intercept lugger craft be now foaming along under canvas that must spread be big lump of craft of class measuring according to estimation fully hundred fifty ton appeared to be very fast be light enough by time what with increasing daylight clearing away of fog for to see that mounted four gun probably six pounder of side there be something very like long nine pounder covered over by tarpaulin between fore mainmast be well to windward of presently crossed bow at distance of about mile of course at once tacked letting schooner go along clean full so a to head off lugger set topgallant sail small gaff topsail rapidly neared other dolphin gradually edging away a lugger fore reached upon until only mile of water divided two craft then saw that people be busy with mysterious object between mast presently sure enough long nine pounder mounted upon pivot stood revealed five minute later tried shot at from same piece ball from struck water five fathom astern of at same time hoisted french tricolour responded by running ensign up to gaff reserved fire for while skipper having a yet have opportunity of finding out lad capability with gun at length however having edged up to within quarter of mile of lugger having conclusively demonstrated superiority of sailing captain winter gave order that larboard broadside must be carefully levelled trained upon lugger mainmast while be being done fired starboard broadside at one of shot from passed through mainsail while struck fore topmast about foot above topsail halliard sheave hole bringing down upper part of spar topgallant sail frenchman cheer at success be still floating down to when having personally supervised levelling training of gun gave order to fire sharp at word broadside rang out a smoke blew over away to leeward lugger mainmast be seen to suddenly double up a be in middle upper portion toppling over to leeward carrying sail with into water while foresail began to flap furiously in wind sheet having be shot away hurrah men capitally done shouted skipper have now a lugger under mizzen only shot up into wind plunging heavily ready about stand by to rake with starboard broadside a cross stern helm lee load port gun again a smartly a please lad topsail haul stand by starboard battery give a gun be brought to bear away aloft there couple of hand clear wreck of topgallant mast dolphin tacking a fast a men must haul round yard without losing headway for instant went round like top in le than minute be crossing lugger stern there be tremendous confusion on board crew to number of thirty forty rushing about deck a must now plainly see apparently undecided what to do next at proper moment starboard broadside be fired great white jagged patch that instantly afterwards appeared in lugger transom showed that pretty nearly if not quite shot have taken effect well aimed men cried skipper in ecstasy of delight be way to bring to sens ready about again stand by to give port broadside helm lee round swept dolphin again presently be once more crossing stern of lugger confusion on board being a seemed greater than ever be by time within quarter of mile of antagonist again broadside discharged at precisely right moment told with terrible effect on board lugger not only raking from stem to stern also bringing down fore mizzen mast time have not replied to fire with single gun standing on for distance of about cable length dolphin again tacked time fetching far enough to windward to have enabled to cross lugger bow have desired to do so instead of however captain winter gave order to keep away pas close under stern starboard broadside being ready to pour into if need be captain winter order be however not to fire until gave word reaching along on easy bowline be soon on lugger starboard quarter within biscuit toss of vessel when skipper ordered topsail to be laid aback a with diminished way drifted fair athwart lugger stern in position admirably adapted for raking from end to end sprang into starboard main rigging hailed in french asking whether surrendered man who looked like captain standing near deserted wheel looked at intently for few second then observing that be ready to give starboard broadside answered in affirmative whereupon people several of whom have smattering of french gave three hearty cheer a dropped lanyard of lock to deck laid down rammer sponge hand spike take starboard cutter mr bowen ten men go on board to take possession said skipper cut away wreckage a soon a have secured crew below then send boat back with couple of hand be ready to receive tow line from will have to take in tow a see that indiaman be now on wind have fancy for leaving to make way into port unprotected a soon a be fast to set men to work to get up jury mast if find that there be spar aboard suitable for purpose there be fine breeze blowing now if have luck ought to get into harbour to night prize ay ay sir answered carpenter have better come with have not expect will want help in rigging jury mast yes certainly assented skipper take by mean thank sir said a turned away now then continued ten of into starboard cutter lad a quick a like take cutlass pistol with come along chip man get tool tumble into boat ten minute later be on board lugger proved to be belle jeannette of saint malo very fine craft be a saw when stood upon broad roomy deck mounted nine gun eight of being long six while ninth be long nine pounder between fore mainmast be astonished to see what havoc shot have wrought deck bulwark being broadly streaked splashed with blood while gun have own little group of two three killed wounded lying about three of mast have be shot away a already stated in addition to stern transom be regularly torn to piece one of jagged splintered hole being quite large enough for to have passed through have be so minded three spoke of wheel have be shot away be wonder to a marked path of shot along torn splintered deck that whole concern have not be destroyed companion be badly damaged started a for cabin skylight there be very little of left crew few of who must still stand be to say have thrown down arm gone forward on to forecastle upon hearing skipper state that surrendered there found when boarded prize skipper rather fine looking man thirty five year of age with piercing black eye curly black hair beard large gold ear ring in ear have of course remained aft when sprang over bulwark in on deck advanced toward handing sheathed sword remarked rather bitterly accept sword monsieur with congratulation upon good fortune in having secured two such valuable prize indiaman be not to be despised be fool not to let go when saw that capture be inevitable believe must have escaped have hauled wind when first made out a be have lost not only prize also ship chest of specie took precaution of removing from indiaman last night be certain to find a be lying beneath table in cabin so may a well make virtue of necessity tell of at once perhaps under circumstance monsieur will be generous enough to be content with treasure allow to retain lugger represents posse in world thus restore to power to inflict further injury upon commerce be afraid not monsieur answered have be mere harmless trader might possibly have be different a be proposal be pardon for saying so preposterous a monsieur plea of course will be ruin remarked man gloomily with monsieur permission then will retire to cabin turned away a though to go below pardon monsieur said hastily interposing between companion be afraid that duty necessitates requesting monsieur will be so obliging a to remain on deck for present then take that curse ejaculated whipping big ugly knife out of bosom striking savagely at heart with fortunately sudden glitter in eye warned succeeded in catching upraised arm in left hand with gripped wrist so strongly that be perforce obliged to drop knife to deck submit to have wrist broken kicking weapon overboard through open port close at hand called to one of men to clap lashing round hand foot of antagonist then went forward to superintend securing of remainder of prisoner there be only fourteen of uninjured whose wound be so slight a to leave capable of doing mischief drove down into hold where finding plenty of iron effectually secured by time that be done wreck of mast cut away sail have be towing overboard secured dolphin be ready to pas towrope on board at once took securing end to windlass bitt when schooner filled away with lugger in tow stood after indiaman be by time couple of mile to windward of heading to northward on easy bowline on starboard tack russell dolphin surgeon came aboard about same time a tow line while busied in attending to hurt of frenchman went to work to rig up set of jury mast suitable spar for be lucky enough to find aboard lugger by dint of hard work contrived to get three spar on end securely lashed to stump of mast well stayed by dinner time by four bell same afternoon have lugger under own canvas once more when cast adrift from dolphin being found that even under jury mast belle jeannette be quite capable of holding own with indiaman in moderate weather then prevailing long before however have found opportunity to go below have look at treasure chest have found in position indicated by french skipper be unexpectedly bulky affair so much so indeed thought safest place for must be down in dolphin run there be soon safely stowed after have gone on board schooner to report to captain winter great value of prize afterwards turned out that chest contained le than thirty thousand pound in specie so be right in considering worth taking care of chapter four fight prize weather have be clearing day when about six bell afternoon made high land of portland sky be without cloud atmosphere clear bright sun be shining a brilliantly a though have be midsummer quite taking keen edge off frosty air there be not vessel in sight in direction be rather relief to for situated a be then must have be difficult to say whether sight of friend of enemy must have excited most uneasiness in breast friend must almost certainly have be man o war although paper be nominally protection of crew against impressment be fully aware that a matter of fact be nothing of sort captain of men o ' war impressing almost a freely from privateer a from ordinary merchantman now men be so far a have have opportunity of proving first rate fellow with scarcely single exception be therefore most anxious not to lose of be consequently reverse of desirous to meet with one of own ship of war on other hand be by time so close in with english coast that if happened to encounter enemy must certainly be prowling privateer like heavily enough armed manned to admit of venturing without much risk over to side of channel on look out for homeward bound british ship to encounter customer a must mean plenty of hard knock without very much profit with just chance of losing one other of prize be therefore heartily thankful to find clear horizon round when fog cleared away be destined however to have bout with frenchman before long a will presently appear have made high land of portland about hour when sound of distant firing be faintly borne to ear shortly afterwards two craft cutter brig latter evidently in chase of former hove into view broad on weather bow firing be not very heavy be true be briskly maintained a came sweeping rapidly down toward became apparent that two craft be exchanging shot from bow stern chaser respectively cutter be flying british ensign while brig sported tricolour two vessel being dead before wind brig carrying studding sail on side frenchman seemed to be getting rather best of overhauling cutter slowly surely a soon a be seen dolphin hove to put ten more men on board belle jeannette with order to to close with indiaman to clear for action order obeyed without loss of time while doing so dolphin hoisted british colour a hint to brig that if dared to meddle with be quite ready for cutter brig happened to be steering course must bring close aboard of little squadron when frenchman saw colour of bunting began at once to shorten sail by taking in studding sail preparatory a supposed to hauling wind out of so perilous neighbourhood in supposing thus be mistaken fellow evidently at once hit off respective character to t saw that lugger under jury mast bearing other unmistakable sign of having be very recently in action be prize doubt judged indiaman to be recapture perhaps believing that with two prize schooner must be very short handed quickly made up mind that of three must be more valuable than cutter to at event shortened sail in most determined workmanlike manner threw open port slightly shifting helm made a though must slip in between dolphin indiaman captain winter however must not have so a frenchman luffed dolphin edged away until vessel be heading well in for west bay athwart indiaman hawse running upon line so rapidly converging that within ten minute of declaration of frenchman intention brig schooner be within biscuit toss of other brig mounted six gun of side against dolphin five disparity be altogether too trifling matter for skipper to take notice of accordingly when two vessel have neared other to within about twenty fathom frenchman showing sign of intention to run schooner on board captain winter poured in starboard broadside at same time edged away just sufficiently to keep few fathom of water between brig broadside be promptly returned in minute two vessel be at hammer tongs yard arm to yard arm running almost dead away before wind meanwhile having sent hand aloft to take look round having thus ascertained that there be nothing else in sight to interfere with came to conclusion that indiaman might very well take care of herself for hour so accordingly in lugger at once bore up to support schooner up to time of encountering frenchman have be sailing about quarter of mile to leeward of indiaman while dolphin have be jogging along about same distance to windward of big ship position therefore be such that in lugger have only to put up helm couple of spoke so to enable to converge upon two combatant did by time of arrival upon scene fight be raging so hotly craft be so completely enveloped in smoke that party be aware of presence therefore steered so a to just shave clear of dolphin stern having done so men deliberately fired of four long six in larboard broadside slap into stern of brig raking fore aft then passing out clear of tacked instant that have room passing close under stern again gave in like fashion content of starboard broadside time frenchman be ready for returned fire with two stern chaser shot passing through mainsail without doing further damage again tacked time gave order to put in charge of grape on top of round shot rattled into stern of frenchman at distance of not more than three four fathom shot must have wrought terrible execution for after discharge must hear shriek groan of wounded even through crash of two other vessel broadside time only gave one gun in exchange for four shot passing in through port bulwark out through starboard killing man on way shot however have killed brig helmsman almost immediately afterwards vessel broached to foremast going over bow a did so be enough for received broadside from dolphin then just a be in stay preparatory to passing athwart stern raking again man ran aft hauled down flag at same time cry out that surrendered firing on side at once ceased smoke drifted away to leeward be able to see around once more a well a to note condition of combatant after brief spirited engagement cutter have seized opportunity to make good escape be now more than two mile to leeward running before wind to westward on original course brig proved to be etoile du nord of dunkirk have a already stated lost foremast bulwark be riddled with shot hole rigging badly cut up dolphin also have suffered severely from fire of antagonist starboard bulwark being almost destroyed rigging showing good many loose rope end floating in wind main boom so severely wounded that parted in two when helm be put down to bring to wind heave to a for damage that have received from brig fire be so trifling a to be not worth mentioning knew of course after so determined fight service of surgeon must be in urgent request on board principal combatant so a be aboard lugger ran down close under dolphin lee having hove to lowered boat put medico on board schooner going with to see whether must be of service deck of schooner bore eloquent testimony to sharpness of recent conflict several dead wounded men lying about gun in little pool of blood while torn splintered woodwork met one view on side be grimly suggestive of pandemonium have raged there few minute previously captain winter be one of wounded splinter having torn large piece of skin from forehead laying bare skull over right eye gallant old fellow have replaced skin a well a must lashed up wound with silk neckerchief using pocket handkerchief under a pad be attending to duty a coolly a though have escaped untouched instructed to go on board brig with ten men to take possession leaving carpenter in charge of lugger at same time signalled indiaman have hove to two mile to windward to close new prize be a may be supposed terribly knocked about out of crew of eighty six men boy have le than nineteen killed captain among forty three wounded while in addition to damage have be noticeable before going on board found that two of gun have be dismounted most probably by lugger raking broadside fortunately hull be quite uninjured whole of damage done being to upper work first task be to clear away wreck of foremast skipper hailing soon after have boarded to say that intended indiaman to take in tow wreck be soon cut away just a be falling dark got tow line aboard indiaman proceeded uninjured frenchman having meanwhile requested permission to attend to wounded fellow prisoner make comfortable below more le disabled a be with exception of indiaman took until past midnight to reach weymouth roadstead where anchored for night without communicating with shore one in town therefore be aware of quick return to port brilliant success until following morning a for mr peter white owner first intimation that have of affair be while be dressing when servant knocked at door to say that captain winter have returned with three prize be waiting below to see old gentleman be afterwards told be so excited at good news that must not wait to dress descended to parlour where skipper awaited in dressing gown old boy be almost overwhelmed at news of good fortune insisted that captain winter must stay to breakfast with afterwards despite cold weather came off to roadstead visited of prize in turn be a well perhaps that did so a there be considerable amount of business to be transacted in connection with recapture of hoogly captain of be anxious to resume voyage up channel a soon a possible important matter be arranged by noon about two o'clock wind having hauled round from southward indiaman weighed proceeded passenger on board having meanwhile subscribed purse of two hundred thirty guinea for officer crew of dolphin in recognition of what be complimentary enough to term gallantry in recapture of ship nice little sum be however only first instalment of what be to come there be salvage of ship to follow over above may mention that underwriter voted sum of five hundred guinea to while patriotic fund committee awarded skipper sword of value of one hundred guinea to sword of half value for fight with capture of two privateer poor lovell being left out in cold in consequence of having be prize master of hoogly having therefore taken part in of engagement got reward however in way for etoile du nord turned out to be such very fine vessel quite new wonderfully fast that mr white purchased on own account rechristening north star put lovell in command be fairly successful in afterwards heard not nearly to such extent a ought to have be with so fine vessel under declared that luck be always against a for mr white be so pleased with report of conduct captain winter have given that a soon a ever purchase of etoile du nord have be effected lovell provided for offered berth of chief mate of dolphin berth promptly thankfully accepted a for belle jeannette too be sold fetching very good price before left port again have divided prize money share of amounted to very respectable sum of two thousand six hundred odd pound dolphin have received so severe mauling in fight with french privateer brig although utmost despatch be used in repairing refitting be not until th of december that be again ready for sea by time news have reached of declaration of war by spain against great britain last circumstance of course threw hand of into fever of impatience to get to sea again in order that might have early opportunity of picking up rich spanish prize when christmas eve arrived finding still in harbour owner be generous enough to say that might if pleased defer sailing until day after christmas day in order that crew might have opportunity to spend christmas at home opportunity thankfully made most of hand be on board by noon of th when cast off stood out of harbour once more before fresh south westerly breeze day being for wonder with wind in wet quarter brilliantly fine a mild a day in early autumn circumstance most of lad be willing to accept a omen of prosperous cruise captain winter object be to reach french coast a soon a possible then to work along to westward right round to spanish coast thence a far a gibraltar perhaps into mediterranean hoping somewhere on way might pick up something worth having at least obtain information relating to homeward outward bound convoy upon clearing portland therefore stood across channel on taut bowline on starboard tack making cape de la hague well on lee bow next morning at daybreak then shortened sail to fore aft canvas only taking in gaff topsail held on a be going with french coast close aboard to leeward until reached granville when having seen nothing worthy of attention tacked to westward eventually found off cape frehel easternmost extremity of saint brieuc bay be third day out have seen nothing men who appeared to think from past experience that ought to take at least one prize day be beginning to grumble at ill luck great therefore be enthusiasm when on following day breeze being fresh at about north north west time about five bell in forenoon watch large ship be seen to emerge from behind chien point then about eight mile distant couple of point on lee bow be coming along under larboard studding sail be watch on deck upon ship being reported to took glass at once went up to fore cross tree to get better look at so far a must make out be full rigged floated very deep in water exceeding whiteness of sail caused to suspect that be homeward bound from long voyage have somewhat look of dutchman to eye if so must probably afford very respectable picking to crew of hard working privateersman like ourselves when first seen be steering course must lead about mid way between island of jersey guernsey before returned to deck seemed to that have hauled up point two have braced yard correspondingly further forward game of course be to get between land if possible before declaring so that if happened to be what suspected might be prevented from running in taking shelter under gun of one of numerous battery french have thrown up along coast to cut out from might involve in heavy loss of men therefore gave order to make sail to alter course at once went down below to skipper who be lying down wounded head still troubling good deal reported stranger to immediately followed on deck at news took good long look at ship through telescope while be doing so took in studding sail hauled wind ah remarked skipper have made out evidently quite like look suppose captain think that having hauled wind will now make sail in chase of if happen to be enemy know trick worth two of that did quite right mr bowen not to shift helm let stand on three mile a be going then will show who what be just so there go bunting dutch a thought be beginning to feel little anxious perhaps must ease mind bit if be to run tricolour up to gaff end mr bowen did so kept flying for next half hour by time dutchman have be brought well out on weather beam about six mile distant retreat cut off then hauled down french flag made sail still however holding on upon same tack by time that have got topsail topgallant sail flying jib small gaff topsail set stranger be about two point abaft weather beam at once tacked in chase be signal for immediate display of confusion on board dutchman ship immediately set royal flying jib when found that must not do bearing away sufficiently to permit of setting larboard studding sail again of course a soon a bore away bore away too steering such course a must enable to gradually converge upon have hardly be in chase hour when large ship appeared in sight ahead steering toward approaching other rapidly a be quarter of hour sufficed to discover that be frigate undoubtedly french stood on however few minute longer trying to devise scheme for slipping past without being brought to evidently must not do people suspected clearly intended to have nearer look at if must so a be altogether too big craft for to tackle be reluctantly compelled to abandon chase heave about to ensure own escape now became turn to play part of pursued for a went in stay frigate fired gun to ascertain whether be within range most probably hoisted ensign made sail in chase shot twelve pounder judged to be by sound of gun fell short yet at same time came near enough to satisfy that have not turned tail moment too soon captain winter at once jammed schooner close upon wind vessel heading up about west north west for chop of channel in hope of out weathering out sailing frigate wind have shown disposition to freshen day be by time piping up so spitefully that have be obliged to furl topgallant sail haul down flying jib a soon a hauled wind moreover there be nasty short jump of sea on into dolphin plunged to knight head time weather be therefore in frigate favour very soon to extreme annoyance discovered that frenchman be slowly surely gaining upon for when frigate have be in chase about hour fired gun shot from reached within twenty fathom of be capitally aimed too must get topgallant sail flying jib on again mr bowen shift small gaff topsail for big one will never do will be within range in half hour then if fellow happens to wing will be done for stick will never bear sir answered look at topmast now be bending like fishing rod a be unless rig preventers pretty quickly will lose in opinion then get up preventers at once dear fellow answered skipper be a smart a please about job one thing be quite certain be that unless can drive schooner little faster will be nabbed perhaps sir said if be to keep schooner away about point must go along more freely be looking good point higher than frigate at present be hugging wind so closely that have life in be losing a much a gain skipper looked at frigate astern then up at weather leech of own topsail be lifting at plunge of schooner perhaps be right george said at event suggestion be worth trying so man to helmsman at same time peering into binnacle keep away to west by north nothing higher west by north nothin ' higher sir answered man easing weather helm couple of spoke a turned away to see to preventer back stay being rigged chapter five french frigate preventer back stay for benefit of uninitiated may explain be simply extra rope intended to take portion of strain so relieve ordinary back stay whenever became necessary to carry very heavy press of canvas be already cut fitted that have to do therefore be to send upper end aloft attach to respective spar by shackling eye to stout iron collar on spar fitted especially for purpose set up lower end by mean of runner to ring bolt in stanchion thing be done five minute sufficed for job then reset topgallant sail flying jib shifted gaff topsail effect soon became apparent for few minute after have concluded work frigate fired gun shot from only reached to within about thirty fathom of be inclined to attribute result however quite a much to having eased schooner away trifle a to extra canvas that have packed upon believed must have done quite a well if not better without for poor little craft seemed pressed down buried by enormous leverage of wind upon sail be heeling over so much that be difficult to maintain one footing upon steeply inclined deck lee scupper be afloat at lee roll white yeasty seething from lee bow brimmed to level of rail sometimes even toppling in over be magnificent sea boat be now driving so unmercifully that at plunge into hollow of sea buried sharp nose completely taking green water in over lee weather bow by ton at time so that became necessary to close fore scuttle to prevent water from going below a for spray flew over in cloud coming right aft wetting mainsail a high up a second reef band gun from frigate served to conclusively demonstrate that be at least holding own topmast be bending like fishing rod at savage plunge of schooner quite expected to see one of go over side skipper too be very uneasy a must see by anxious glance that continually flung aloft at length when frigate have fired yet gun shot from fell at about same distance astern of a preceding one have done turned to said be very well george a far a go if wind must only drop little might snap finger at fellow astern at like way that topmast be whipping about up there if so much a rope yarn part will lose a sure a fate then may bear up for french prison a soon a please frigate keep popping away at in hope suppose that lucky shot may wing see why must return compliment be just out of reach of twelve pounder think long eighteen ought to be capable of pitching shot aboard just bowse up to wind'ard a far a will go let see what will do ay ay sir answered gun ought to reach if can wing though ever so slightly may scrape clear after lay aft here of get tarpaulin off long tom pas word for gunner soon got gun into position captain of man who have seen great deal of service on board man o ' war from have deserted just before joining dolphin tried shot at frigate gun be splendidly aimed be fired just second too late a schooner stern be dipping result be that shot flew straight for frigate struck water distance ahead of very good mason for first attempt remarked skipper approvingly try again lad gun be sponged loaded again fired time shot hulled frigate fair square striking about foot below larboard hawse pipe now remarked skipper try again fine fellow ought to do something worth powder time word be hardly spoken when frigate bore almost square up for moment let fly whole weather broadside at one of shot fell short moment that have fired luffed up into wake once more again mason pointed long gun fired time perhaps because be too careful shot flew wide striking water distance to leeward a thought astern of frigate keep cool mason keep cool man warned skipper that shot be well meant show that have got range to nicety be in too much of hurry try again mason mopped forehead with handkerchief although wind be piercingly cold gun be reloaded then mason pointed levelled with utmost care when be done taking lanyard in hand stepped back to utmost length of line with arm outstretched stood for more than minute squinting along sight of gun suddenly pulled lanyard gun belched forth torrent of flame smoke a stood looking at frigate through own telescope saw small round hole appear in foot of fore topgallant sail moment topgallant mast doubled over went hanging down by rigging under lee of topsail with topgallant sail royal attached hurrah shouted in ecstasy of delight winged by be fortunate men heartily echoed cheer one two of playfully patting mason on shoulder by way of encouragement most excellent shot remarked skipper owe glass of grog for mason will have lad by by not now must keep head perfectly clear until have done with gun try again be certainly very smart set of fellow aboard frenchman for sooner have topgallant mast fallen than hand be in rigging on way aloft to clear away wreck again mason levelled gun taking long careful aim a before time shot struck sill of frigate lee bridle port entering port doubt raking deck for considerable portion of length that did enough damage to greatly exasperate french captain seemed almost certain for presently bore away again treated to broadside shot of fell so far astern that looked a though be now creeping away from mason now seemed to have got hand in for next shot hit frigate bowsprit end a fair a though have specially aimed at knocking cap to piece causing jib boom to go over to leeward completely disabled frigate so far a chasing to windward be concerned a with loss of jib boom also lost use of jib pressure of after sail at once throwing up into wind until be aback at once went to work to take in sail upon mizzen mast presently boxed off again captain knew that to think of catching now be out of question presently wore round hauled up to northward eastward on easy bowline people swarming on forecastle a busied in securing jib lad gave three rousing cheer a saw frigate bear up appeared that have not quite done with yet for a men ceased cheering skipper very quietly remarked now be turn fellow have given anxiety now that have opportunity will return compliment mean to teach that can not bully poor hard working privateersman with impunity take in topgallant sail flying jib gaff topsail mr bowen then stand by to 'bout ship men responded to with cheer of rapturous delight have have opportunity to take good look at frigate a wore round have made out to be vessel of thirty six gun audacity of idea of dolphin actually chasing such ship exactly suited taste of people be stupendous practical joke to entered into with glee spirit of so many overgrown school boy sail be quickly shortened then hove about steered after frenchman first thing to be done be to get long gun over to windward be soon accomplished then mason went to work once more first second shot be miss third one plumped slap in through frigate cabin window next shot struck gig be hanging at frigate weather quarter tearing bottom out next passed through main topsail after came four miss in succession to unspeakable disgust of hand who chaffed poor mason so unmercifully that almost lost temper over skipper thought opportunity good one to serve out glass of grog to gun crew have effect of restoring harmony presently long tom began to speak again shot struck fair upon frigate stern almost instantly flew up into wind with appearance of something having gone wrong with steering gear remained head to wind for so long time at skipper caused own helm to be put down topsail laid to mast lest must stand on too far get within range of gun be not moment too soon for a rounded to fired whole of larboard broadside at shot making water spout round one of actually striking hull be however so far spent that did damage lying almost broadside on to a frigate now be presented very pretty mark for target practice long eighteen be brought to bear upon most effectively shot after shot gave a fast a men must load almost one of struck somewhere mason blood be now thoroughly up be making reputation a crack shot knew saw by increasing care with time sighted piece that be striving to do something specially good presently did taking unusually long careful aim at length gave smart tug to lanyard immediately sprang aside to watch result did by great horn spoon shouted delightedly even a spoke saw white splinter fly from frigate mainmast head topmast swayed aft tottered for moment came down by run delight of men soul of whom be by time on deck be sight to see cheered shouted laughed patted mason on back be in midst of variety of ludicrous antic expressive of supreme gratification when broadside rattled out from frigate time shot went humming close over head drilling dozen hole in canvas showing that have drifted within range of gun immediately filled on schooner hauled off to respectful distance for have fancy for being reduced to same plight a frenchman moment that considered safe from gun again hove to resumed attention with long gun be now in very pretty mess on board frigate managed at length to box off again time bore up for land making a though must run in behind saint riom island immediately bore up in chase running parallel with taking care to keep just beyond range of broadside plied with long gun again so effectively that twenty minute afterwards foremast went over bow broaching to once more lay completely at mercy there exclaimed skipper in tone of great gratification will do with gun have done enough for honour think have given thorough good licking so may a well be off can not take continued in answer to exclamation of astonishment at decision on part be altogether too big fish for net if be to haul down colour must rehoist directly that in running down to take possession of have got fairly within range of broadside at close quarter must simply sink in ten minute be sorry can see nothing for to leave unless have plan to suggest mr bowen be really very much afraid that what say be only too true sir answered mournfully suppose must compel to haul down colour by pegging away at with long gun a be fairly in power now naturally must seize opportunity might present to effect recapture at same time seems thousand pity to leave now that have given such terrible mauling why not keep pounding away at little longer perhaps may yet hit upon plan by to secure possession only think of what feather must be in cap if must capture fine frigate like take into port be very true answered skipper must see that reference to credit of such exploit have touched in weak spot well continued will not give up yet awhile frigate be unmanageable at present will continue so until can get sort of jury mast rigged for'ard so will fill on schooner make stretch to windward until can get into raking position then drop down upon mounseer see what can do with be risky business lucky shot may cripple at moment must then be done for however nothing venture nothing have ' so fill topsail mr bowen will make bid for glory although be not business decision be received with enthusiasm by men who at once went to work with hearty good will to execute order that skipper now rapidly issued filled upon schooner reached away to northward eastward on easy bowline keeping just beyond reach of frigate gun making play diligently time with own long eighteen aiming for stump of foremast so a to embarrass frenchman a much a possible in attempt that might make to rig up jury spar french captain be game to backbone helpless a be to retaliate upon omitted effort to extricate from difficulty by be surrounded what must not have given at moment for single gun powerful enough to have reached a be fired at at frequent interval for apparent purpose of ascertaining whether have inadvertently ventured within range noticed that shot fell further away from must not at first comprehend a own shot continued to strike time at length thought have hit upon explanation of mystery mentioned to captain winter belief be that french captain be gradually reducing charge of powder in hope that by so doing must tempt to draw nearer under impression that be well out of range when perhaps by well directed broadside with full powder charge might succeed in unrigging when capture by mean of boat must be easy matter be not however to be so easily tempted at length by dint of great exertion probably at cost of many men frenchman succeeded in cutting wreck of foremast when by furling canvas upon mizzen mast managed to once more get frigate before wind heading in for land now came opportunity for be by time dead to windward of antagonist sooner be before wind than too kept away gradually closing with keeping long gun playing upon until there be hole in stern big enough to have driven coach through a soon a be near enough opened fire upon with two stern chaser at very first fire shot came in through bow raked fore aft killing one man wounding three others with splinter be sent flying about ear finding that have approached too closely immediately hauled wind began to sail to fro athwart stern keeping up brisk fire upon with long gun raking at shot went on for about quarter of hour during repeatedly returned fire without effect then lucky shot from cut main yard in two in sling be once more helpless broaching to lying with bow well up to wind reduced to nothing hope of escape by running in under land anchoring within shelter of gun of battery after receiving three four more shot from actually hauled down colour surrendered to unmitigated delight of lad who cheered hoarse over victory now came delicate question of taking possession fully realised that be only superior power of long eighteen have enabled to accomplish astonishing feat of compelling frigate of thirty six gun to haul down colour to schooner mounting le than third of armament felt that only chance of securing peaceable possession of prize now that have surrendered be to maintain advantage conferred upon by superiority be therefore at length decided must go on board prize with forty men to take possession while schooner remained hove to out of range of frigate gun near enough to open fire again with long gun must meet with difficulty from french crew instruction be to go on board secure crew then fire three blank cartridge in quick succession a signal have obtained possession upon schooner be to close render possible assistance chapter six be compelled to abandon prey lowered two cutter gig then picking out forty men arming with cutlas brace of pistol apiece shoved off to take possession of prize there be rather nasty short choppy sea running fortunately be to windward only have to run down before a neared frigate became increasingly apparent to that be exceedingly fine handsome ship tonnage according to estimate being not far short of nine hundred ton have be knocked about good deal more severely than have anticipated a drew still nearer be astonished to perceive that of scupper be running blood took about hour to pull down to when went alongside under lee met with opposition whatever in boarding somewhat to surprise must confess for a matter of fact did not believe that have really surrendered hauling down of colour being in opinion only ruse to get within reach of gun in however a turned out be mistaken did commanding officer injustice clambered up frigate lofty side without let hindrance when sprang sword in hand down upon deck be met by mere lad beardless face deadly pale head bound up in blood sodden bandage right arm hanging helpless broken by side with left hand tendered to sword in silence then turning away burst into tear a looked around must well understand cause of poor young fellow emotion be not only that fine handsome ship brand new a turned out only commissioned few day previously be perfect wreck aloft dead wounded be lying about deck especially in vicinity of stump of foremast in heap bulwark be shot through through wheel be smashed to piece there be long scoring fore aft deck showing path that eighteen pound shot have ploughed up in destructive passage even be not worst of for when turned to young officer tried to soothe by utterance of platitude having reference to fortune of war informed that although have that morning be ship junior lieutenant be now senior surviving officer captain other lieutenant being among killed to think ejaculated bitterly that must have be compelled to strike to insignificant craft a pointing to schooner added did not fight fair never gave chance have once fairly come within range of gun must have blown out of water precisely agreed be well aware of monsieur therefore preferred to fight at respectful distance now continued a have relieved of command let beg to lose time in going below to surgeon to get hurt attended to be sure that france can ill afford to lose so brave man a poor fellow smiled wanly at clumsy compliment with bow turned away to follow suggestion while went to work to get prisoner disarmed secured below be managed without difficulty french appearing to be too utterly downcast broken spirited to dream of resisting after having hauled down colour be not surprised at when shortly afterwards learned that out of crew numbering two hundred eighty four have lost no le than seven officer sixty three men killed eighty eight officer men wounded be astonishing more so when came to reflect that loss damage have be inflicted by one gun then be to be remembered that unfortunate frigate have be under fire of one gun for close upon five hour dusk of short winter day closing down upon shortly after have boarded prize name of by way be musette having secured prisoner fired three blank cartridge agreed upon a signal when dolphin ran down sent end of hawser aboard for purpose of taking in tow also put very nearly whole crew aboard retaining merely enough hand to work in order that might have a much strength a possible for purpose of rigging up jury mast have be in tow of schooner hour when captain winter came aboard in boat to say that be rather too heavy for to manage breeze having be steadily freshening day raising sea caused schooner to strain to alarming extent with so heavy craft a frigate hanging on to therefore went to work to get sail upon prize forthwith having routed out main staysail set found that in strong breeze then blowing even small amount of canvas be sufficient to place frigate under command therefore cast off from dolphin craft thereupon shortened sail to boom foresail fore staysail so that might not run away from even under short canvas be able to sail round round during whole of night stood to northward eastward night long too be hard at work watch watch getting up jury spar result of labour being that by daybreak next morning have got very serviceable jury foremast in place enabling to set fore staysail also main topsail in place of foresail with head sail be also enabled to give frigate close reefed mizzen topsail spanker with canvas began to move through water at quite respectable pace be to say about four knot per hour however be not for carpenter have be hard at work through night preparing jury fore topmast jib boom while have got spare main yard swung aloft slung by mid day therefore be enabled to set fore topsail jib mainsail further increased speed by four bell in afternoon watch island of jersey be in sight broad upon lee bow six mile distant at eight bell tacked ship being anxious not to draw too close in with french coast in then disabled condition a sun went down that night weather manifested tendency to improve by midnight wind have softened down to gentle breeze barely gave steerage way through water finally died away altogether when sun rose next morning clear bright dolphin ourselves be boxing compass not cable length apart in be rather provoking a be exceedingly anxious to get prize into port off hand delay be a nothing compared with disagreeable circumstance that there be three exceedingly suspicious looking sail in sight about ten mile to westward of apparently consort for must see good deal of signalling going on between of must make nothing be ship brig large lugger cut of canvas left little room to doubt that be french of course be quite possible that might three be perfectly harmless merchantman there be certain smart knowing look about eminently suggestive of privateersman if be character there must be doubt that must find very objectionable dangerous neighbour immediately that breeze happened to spring up so little did captain winter like appearance that immediately after breakfast calm seeming likely to continue for few hour ordered own gig to be lowered went away in to get nearer look at there be not much danger in course a gig be beautifully light splendidly modelled fast pulling boat exactly suited for such service not in least likely to be overtaken by boat such a of three vessel in sight might be expected to carry did not therefore greatly concern with skipper movement gave whole attention to getting of additional jury spar aloft in order that if possible frigate might be brought into something like fighting order by time that breeze must come be busy pointing new main topmast when boatswain who be in top hailed deck to say that lugger brig have rigged out sweep be heading in direction while ship have lowered boat sent ahead to tow went up into mizzen topmast cross tree taking glass with soon discovered that report be only too correct for when reached perch three craft be heading straight for lugger churning up water with sweep coming along at quite smart pace brig following close behind ship in tow of own boat bringing up rear effectually disposed of theory that might possibly be merchantman be far too heavily manned to be anything privateer men o war be perfectly clear that be fully bent upon paying visit afterwards appeared that captain winter did not suspect new development until time after stranger have got into motion then observing that three vessel kept head persistently pointed in direction that appeared to be nearing much faster than at first inkling of truth dawned upon ordered crew to pull easy that might reserve strength for spurt in case of need nevertheless continued to pull toward until have arrived within gun shot of lugger crew of at once opened fire upon when having ascertained force of squadron returned with speed to having meanwhile made up mind how to act discovered that lugger mounted six six pounder brig showed five port of side weight of metal must not ascertain since gun be run in port closed ship mounted sixteen gun apparently nine pounder now be force altogether too strong for to cope with even have not be hampered with prize to look after for unlike case of frigate force be distributed among three vessel instead of being concentrated on board of one only while captain winter be always ready to trust something to chapter of accident to risk good deal upon chance that lucky shot might seriously disable single antagonist became different matter altogether when there be three craft to contend with therefore reluctantly came to conclusion that prize must be sacrificed in order to ensure own safety therefore pulled straight to dolphin ordering whole of boat to be lowered manned sent alongside frigate coming on board to superintend operation upon have decided first act be to order whole of frigate boat to be stripped of oar rowlock bottom board when be done be lowered prisoner wounded a well a sound sent down into when a soon a have satisfied that whole of frenchman be out of ship frigate boat be towed about mile away cast adrift meanwhile in obedience to instruction have collected inflammable material must lay hand upon have set ship on fire in four place with result when dolphin boat returned alongside prize to take off be well alight with smoke pouring in dense cloud up through opening in deck took short time to leave moment that be once more on board schooner sweep be manned vessel put upon northerly course direction having be chosen in consequence of discovery that light air have sprung up be coming down from northward eastward must place dead to windward of formidable antagonist by time that reached at moment when dolphin began to move lugger be seven mile away bearing due west brig being about mile astern of ship perhaps mile astern of brig very shortly afterwards flame burst up through frigate main hatchway hour later be blazing from stem to stern so that although have lost there be chance of again falling into hand of french breeze be long time in finding way down to so long indeed that after waiting full half hour with cat paw playing upon water within biscuit toss of helm be ported schooner headed straight for fringe of delicate blue marked dividing line where calm wind be contending together for mastery be reached in about quarter of hour when after feeble preliminary rustling canvas filled sweep be laid in began to move through water at speed of two half knot per hour heading up nearly due north while lugger brig at same time kept away in hope apparently of intercepting ship despatched two of boat to rescue of helpless compatriot adrift in frigate boat lugger be very fine evidently very fast vessel of class be making desperate effort to close with with such success at end of half hour became evident that unless light fickle breeze freshened somewhat in interim couple of hour must see within gun shot of however gave concern whatever for be far more than match for alone although brig also be doing best be drawing away from so steadily that of dolphin quite reckoned upon being able in due time to fight take lugger before consort must come up to assistance six bell in forenoon watch have just struck when frigate blew up with dull heavy boom not nearly so loud a have expected to hear concussion be terrific causing schooner to quiver to keel while effect upon languid breeze be such a to completely kill for three four minute at end of time came creeping stealthily along water again about hour later reached lugger immediately laid in sweep hauled close to wind in pursuit of be at time under plain sail to royal flying jib creeping along at speed of about four half knot lugger being about point abaft lee beam two mile distant from looking up about point higher than in eagerness to close with by noon have become apparent that have advantage in point of speed so that lay with to make good escape not a pleased have however lost one valuable prize through inopportune appearance of lugger consort be by mean disposed to go off empty handed if must help therefore quietly unostentatiously checked sheet weather brace just sufficiently to permit wind to spill out of canvas thus deadening way somewhat men then went to dinner little ruse have desired effect lugger having closed up to within mile by time that men be ready to turn to again a schooner have long ago be cleared for action galley fire be now extinguished crew went to gun in readiness for coming struggle at same time helm be eased up trifle began to edge down upon antagonist just about time brig caught first of breeze at once crowded sail in chase be therefore time for to set about work in earnest if did not desire to have to reckon with a well a lugger nevertheless still withheld fire skipper being determined not to begin until must make short work of mr bowen said to when be within about mile of lugger want to take fellow with a little damage a possible to spar rigging because if happen to be much cut up may find so seriously hampered a to have difficulty in getting away from other two be good enough therefore to go round deck direct men to aim with utmost care at port so that shot may sweep deck drive men from gun after will be easy matter to run alongside carry with rush expect people be already so tired with long spell at sweep that will not have much stomach for hand to hand fight have there open fire so be time to show colour proceeded to bend on hoist ensign with own hand while turned away to carry out instruction single shot that lugger have fired flew fair between mast cutting lee topsail brace damage however be repaired in le than five minute by hand who sprang aloft neatly spliced re rove brace meanwhile lad have carefully levelled pointed gun now only awaited word to fire soon came from skipper whereupon five gun in larboard broadside rang out together five neat hole in lugger bulwark testifying to accuracy with have be aimed lugger almost instantly replied with starboard broadside again shot went humming over time without doing damage probably have very keen desire to engage single handed be anxious to cripple so give time for brig to close to support in anxiety to do have pointed gun so high that shot have flown over altogether lad be quite wide awake enough to understand importance of making short work of lugger therefore handled gun very smartly giving enemy two broadside in exchange for one be now close enough to observe that second of two broadside have dismounted one of lugger gun hurrah lad exclaimed skipper look alive load again if be smart will just have time to give broadside board in smoke stand by fore aft with grappling iron heave a touch will lead boarder mr bowen so be good enough to take charge of ship be interrupted by broadside from lugger time crashed in through bulwark immediately felt be hurt sharp stinging burning pain just above left elbow indicating locality of injury proved to be mere trifle however large splinter having be driven into flesh quickly pulled out hurriedly bound up wound with pocket handkerchief a be doing so captain winter gave word to helmsman to up helm run aboard see that be hurt mr bowen said turning to nothing very serious hope mere scratch sir thank replied nothing worth speaking about so much better answered skipper be ready there with gun then fire a touch then follow everybody sail trimmer fire two vessel collided with considerably more violence than have anticipated so much so indeed that shock sent reeling to deck whereby just escaped being shot through head by volley of musketry with frenchman greeted arrival at same moment broadside again crashed through through lugger bulwark with hearty cheer on side terrific hullabaloo on part of french lad leapt aboard lugger taking denial succeeded in clearing deck after obstinate fight of about minute during several rather severe hurt be given received on side chapter seven attack upon abervrach harbour unwounded prisoner be quickly secured below wounded on side being a quickly transferred to dolphin in order that might more conveniently be attended to by worthy surgeon after prize be placed in charge of second mate portland man named john comben made sail in company brig be at time about mile distant on lee quarter while ship be about mile half distant just open of brig stern captain winter stood looking wistfully at two vessel for long time at length turned away said regretfully be afraid will have to be content with what have got george if there be only one of must care very much of be must tackle unhesitatingly two of together be rather too big mouthful for so make sail let get back to weymouth a quickly a can if frenchman be to heave in sight while two be so close to might find hard matter to take care of ourselves to say nothing of lugger brig ship clung persistently to skirt whole of day although gradually drew away from during night lost sight of late next evening arrived in weymouth harbour without further adventure prize cerf of saint brieuc proved to be very fine vessel quite worth taking still prize money accruing from capture did not amount to very much captain winter came to conclusion that with so many vessel of own nationality already swarming in channel that locality must no longer be regarded a very profitable cruising ground therefore determined with mr white full approval to prosecute operation further afield trying atlantic first of afterwards if did not yield satisfactory result pushing right across a far a west indie decision arrived at pressed forward preparation with speed week later be once more ready for sea sailed early on saturday morning with moderate breeze at west having cleared bill of portland stretched away for french coast close hauled on starboard tack making land near abervrach harbour shortly after mid day on following monday stood in to within mile of land then tacked be about ten mile off shore when look out reported large sail on weather beam coming down under studding sail being watch on deck went up on to topsail yard to have better look at be about ten mile dead to windward of at time be steering course to take between land be evidently merchantman of about six hundred ton burden thereabout floating pretty deep in water have appearance of being french having completed observation went down reported to skipper who immediately gave order to tack ship that might get nearer view of be done when got round be found that stranger bore broad on weather bow happened to be under easy sail at time captain winter at first decided not to increase spread of canvas hoping by mean to impress neighbour with belief that be in nowise concerning about must not do clearly distrusted for be sooner round than edged away toward land making for abervrach harbour hour later have mortification of seeing craft by time determinable a barque enter harbour anchor under gun of one of two battery guarded entrance hoisted french colour steered a though too be about to enter harbour skipper be altogether too wary to venture inside so when by observation have ascertained that must about place without exposing schooner to fire of of battery tacked stood off shore again a though working along coast be about six bell in afternoon watch a breeze be light flood tide against made very little progress of little wasted a much a thought dared without exciting suspicion object being to remain in neighbourhood until after dark then attempt cutting out expedition harbour be snug enough place excellently adapted for purpose of sheltering shipping from attack of enemy entrance being guarded by two six gun battery one on headland mounting thirty two pounder combined fire of battery effectually commanding entrance two battery be apparently that have to fear be quite enough nay more than enough for be capable of sinking much bigger craft than dolphin in le than ten minute be battery therefore that have to reckon with in first place after talking matter quietly over in cabin be ultimately decided that a soon a be dark enough to conceal movement canvas must be taken off schooner must be allowed to drive under bare pole along coast back to eastward until once more abreast of harbour entrance when anchor be to be let go then sharp look out be to be kept for barque if there be sign of making attempt to slip out to sea again before two o'clock in morning boat be to be lowered skipper with hand must be spared be to pull in surprise battery spike gun then dash aboard barque bring out night happened to be dark with overcast sky thick drizzle of rain be therefore excellently adapted for purpose having arrived within about mile half of land first part of programme be carried out by furling everything allowing schooner to drive up coast until deeper blackness in shadow indicated land revealed that be off harbour mouth here anchor be let go a precaution have be taken to prevent light from showing on board schooner have good reason for hoping that presence in particular spot be unsuspected anchor watch be set with instruction to keep sharp look out at once report to skipper anything of unusual suspicious character when hand turned in for purpose of securing a much rest a possible prior to execution of important task that have set ourselves nothing having occurred during earlier part of night hand be called at four bell in middle watch cup of hot coffee biscuit be served out to man then who be to go away in boat be told off armed after skipper made short speech explaining nature of service upon be about to engage how be proposed to execute after boat be got into water pulled away with muffled oar for shore have be arranged that skipper must tackle battery on eastern side of harbour mouth while be to deal with one on western headland a be deemed possible that despite effort to mislead on shore appearance during afternoon might have awakened sufficient amount of uneasiness to cause watch to be set for be further arranged that landing must be effected if possible on outside beach since if be expected must almost certainly be looked for somewhere along more sheltered shore inside harbour expedition numbered sixty men told thirty in division upon shoving off from schooner two division at once separated skipper bearing away to eastward while hauled up for point about mile a nearly a must guess to westward of western battery night be even thicker darker than have be when brought schooner to anchor off harbour mouth there be cold dismal rain persistently falling breeze having freshened up considerably be now sweeping over sea with dreary wintry moaning sound distinctly accentuated discomfort of situation while have knocked up sea threatened to render landing work of very considerable difficulty danger became increasingly apparent a drew closer in with land roar of surf upon rocky beach ghostly white gleam flash of fringe of breaker exciting within feeling of very lively apprehension a to safety of boat pulled cautiously in to within about fifty fathom of beach then turned boat round bow on to sea while looked anxiously about for suitable spot at to beach allowing to drift shoreward meanwhile soon became evident that if desired to land outside harbour mouth must be necessary for to seek more favourable spot for purpose surf being so heavy shore so thickly cumbered with rock just where be that attempt at beaching boat must only result in destruction possibly loss of several life therefore hauled off again short distance directed search somewhat further westward when after traversing line of beach for somewhere about mile found in sort of miniature harbour about fifteen fathom wide formed by projecting reef of rock under lee of forthwith effected landing without slightest difficulty left two men in boat to take care of keep afloat then having satisfied a well a must that ammunition have be kept dry in serviceable condition led rest of party up steep slippery face of low cliff beyond beach breathless scramble of three four minute carried to top remained be for to follow edge of cliff to eastward when must in due time find at battery be primary object of attack result of procedure amply demonstrated wisdom of skipper arrangement for when reached battery did rather sooner than have expected found absolutely unguarded at rear sentinel three in number being so posted a to watch harbour entrance only where rest of garrison be must not at moment discover feeling certain that be somewhere close at hand became necessary to proceed with utmost caution therefore formed up little band under shelter in deep shadow of projecting angle enjoining upon most absolute silence entered battery alone for purpose of reconnoitring gained inside without difficulty gate having be carelessly left unfastened at once found in semicircular court yard formed by gun platform of battery sod revetment surrounded platform be about eight foot high be apparently case mated for immediately in front of a entered be door two window through latter of streamed into blackness of night feeble ray of barrack lantern pyramidal pile of round shot be stacked here there about gravelled court yard upon approaching one of passing hand over shot came to conclusion that five gun dimly made out a shapeless mass of blackness upon platform be thirty two pounder three sentry wrapped in greatcoat stood motionless one in centre one at extremity of platform facing to seaward judged from listless attitude that be anything on alert access to platform be obtained by two broad flight of stone step one at extremity be work of two three minute for to ascertain particular having done returned to men gave most careful instruction how to proceed then led into battery where while main body silently divided stole round in shadow of platform to guard room door about ranged two others whom have especially picked for purpose drew off boot in stockinged foot crept silently a shadow up on to gun platform where of crouched behind gun waiting for signal have arranged to give selected a victim sentinel who mounted guard in middle of platform because be most difficult man to approach other two being posted close to head of two flight of stone step knew that by time have reached men must be quite ready fellow stood close to middle gun on lee side appeared to be sheltering a well a must from wind rain by crouching close to carriage back be toward therefore have difficulty whatever in approaching did in crouching attitude until be near enough to touch flapping skirt of coat then drawing up to full height taking deep breath coughed loudly a signal to two men at same instant clapping one hand over sentinel mouth seizing musket in other a drove knee into small of back bore irresistibly to ground utter sound if value life hissed in ear in french whether be that caution be effective that poor fellow be too utterly surprised astounded to speak certain be that lay perfectly quiet with knee on breast hand clutching throat while carefully laid down musket drew gag line from pocket wherewith to secure subdued scuffling to right left scarcely audible above rush of wind roar of breaker on outside beach told that other two sentinel be being similarly dealt with there be outcry whatever in le than five minute have three of securely gagged bound hand foot next thing be to secure remainder of garrison did without difficulty simply flinging open guard room door dashing in cutlas pistol in hand upon sleeping soldier seizing musket stood neatly ranged in rack along one of wall there be terrific outcry jabber among astonished frenchman for minute two with show of disposition to resist pointed out to that there be only thirty of to twenty six of that be armed while be not that be not in humour to put up with nonsense with resolute attitude of men have effect of very speedily reducing to subjection have brought hammer handful of nail with next business be to spike gun occupied very few minute when be done returned to guard room with intention of withdrawing men a glanced round room however caught sight of small bunch of key hanging against wall thinking that might possibly belong to magazine spirit of mischief suggested to propriety of destroying battery altogether instead of merely temporarily disabling so took down key lighting lantern of there be several proceeded to investigate be a have anticipated key be of magazine store room entering former soon found that there be ample stock of powder in keg made up into cartridge to wreck entire structure there be also coil of slow match piece of cut off taking outside lighted for purpose of ascertaining rate at burnt be soon done whereupon cut off enough to burn for about twenty minute opened keg of powder emptying one of in heap in middle of floor buried one end of slow match in pile taking other end outside then returned to guard room marched prisoner surrounded by own men outside battery when having assured that hand be safe informed frenchman be about to blow up battery recommended to run for life at same time directing own men to let go frenchman needed second bidding away went down slope like startled deer tumbling over other in anxiety to escape from effect of anticipated explosion to great delight amusement of people in le than minute have vanished in darkness frenchman thus disposed of ordered own men to make best of way down to boat there to wait for then re entered battery have be arranged between skipper that of must after taking respective battery display lantern light of sort on parapet a signal to other first act therefore upon returning to battery be to light lantern place where must be seen from other battery at same time be shielded from wind rain while doing noted with satisfaction that captain signal be already displayed so comforted with assurance that battery be now rendered harmless descended to court yard with difficulty succeeded in igniting slow match waited only long enough to make quite sure that be burning all right then made bolt of for life overtaking men just a reached beach found boat right perfectly safe men in charge growing very uneasy a tide be rising fast over reef of rock sheltered little cove in be lying very nasty awkward sea be beginning to roll in occasioning boat keeper great deal of trouble anxiety in endeavour to prevent boat being stove be well that end well however boat have thus far escaped lost time in tumbling into shoving off just a did so terrific glare lit up sky for instant accompanied by violent concussion of rock upon of be standing followed by deep thunderous boom battery have blown up presently above seething roar of sea moaning of wind caught crashing sound of falling fragment of masonry earth thud of heavy gun dislodged from resting place upon demolished platform meanwhile wind sea have be steadily increasing until have grown to be what sailor expressively term regularly dirty night be sooner clear of sheltering reef of rock than be struck by comber pretty nearly half filled boat happened to be in other boat be astern of faring little better men however bent to oar with will in about ten minute by keeping boat stem on to sea forced way out through broken water be enabled to head for harbour toward wet to skin half dead with cold of piercing bitter wind made best of way just inside harbour entrance about mid channel fell in with skipper two boat have arrived few minute earlier be lying upon oar waiting for thus reunited skipper briefly exchanged detail of result of respective effort after gave way in line abreast for spot where expected to find barque pulled for quarter of hour failed to discover although skipper be equally confident that must be close to spot where have seen at anchor then after brief consultation be agreed that boat must separate search for pistol shot from lucky boat being signal arranged to notify that search have be successful plan rather first part of be at once put into execution boat pulling away in different direction from others although diligently searched in likely direction frequently encountering one of other boat barque be nowhere to be found not to needlessly spin out adventure may suffice to say that fruitlessly hunted over harbour until daylight when became evident that in mysterious manner vessel have contrived to give slip make good escape have probably occurred during time that skipper have be busy with battery most curious part of be that comben second mate left in charge of schooner declared that although have never relaxed vigilance for instant from time of leaving until return on board of men who shared watch with have seen anything of craft thus have arduous dangerous most trying night work for nothing for with escape of barque work upon battery became absolutely useless to so in very good humour shifted into dry clothing weighed anchor shaping course to northward westward then went to breakfast chapter eight fall in with convoy next three day be spent in dodging about chop of channel during saw nothing except few homeward bound british merchantman of armed quite capable of taking care of british line of battle ship by be chased for six hour have little difficulty in escaping by jamming schooner close upon wind unsophisticated reader may perhaps be inclined to wonder why must have be chased by one of own men o war why being chased must have taken trouble to escape from fact however be that dolphin be altogether too rakish looking craft to be mistaken for plodding merchantman long low beamy hull taunt tapering spar broad spread of superbly cut canvas proclaimed sea rover a far a eye must distinguish a ensign carried be at time indifferent guarantee of vessel nationality be imperative duty of men o ' war when falling in with craft to make sure if possible that be not enemy danger to commerce friend two decker be therefore quite justified in endeavour to get alongside obtain sight of paper have possessed assurance that delicate attention must have ended there people must have be quite welcome to come aboard overhaul schooner paper to heart content unfortunately have such assurance there be at time of be now writing very great difficulty in procuring men enough to adequately man ship of war there be therefore alternative left to government to resort to process of impressment process naval officer be too often apt to adopt with scant discrimination in anxiety to secure full complement for ship deemed justified not only in pressing men ashore even in boarding merchantman of own nation upon high sea impressing so many men out of instance be by mean rare of trader being subsequently lost through being thus made so short handed that crew be insufficient in number strength to successfully battle against bad weather crew of vessel furnished with letter of marque be nominally protected from impressment be fully aware that protection be only nominal altogether insufficient hence came about that british privateer be always very much more anxious to escape from man o ' war flying colour of own country than be to avoid ship flying of enemy now to return to story on fourth day after abortive adventure in abervrach harbour wind hauled round from eastward heartily tired of disgusted with ill luck gladly squared away before to seek better fortune on bosom of broad atlantic for fortnight stretched away to southward westward when sighted passed lofty height precipitous cliff of flores corvo in neighbourhood of captain winter determined to cruise for week being customary for homeward bound ship from southward to endeavour to make island so check reckoning wind meanwhile have gone round be now blowing very moderate breeze from southward with clear sky bright sunshine pleasantly mild temperature cruised for eight day off azores sighting only three vessel during whole of time a be british be of course of use to then intensely disappointed at continued ill luck hauled wind with freshening breeze from south west stretched away to westward on larboard tack captain winter having determined to look for better fortune in west indian water for first two day after quitting neighbourhood of azores made excellent progress then steadily falling barometer accompanied by lowering sky rapid increase in strength of wind warned to prepare for bad weather up to time have be carrying topgallant sail flying jib small gaff topsail with steady freshening of wind approach of night threatening aspect of sky skipper deemed prudent to stow light canvas to take down reef in mainsail topsail be well that precaution be taken for during night wind increased to strength of gale with very heavy dangerous sea when morning came found snugged down to jib with bonnet off reefed foresail close reefed mainsail be at time looking very black wild to windward sky along south western horizon being of deep slaty indigo hue swept by swift flying streamer of dirty whitish grey cloud while leaden grey sea scourged into waste of steep foam capped ridge deep seething wind furrowed valley have already risen to height a to completely becalm low canvas time

falling hand be set to work to send down yard house topmast while be still possible to do so task be dangerous one have plenty of strength men working with will be accomplished within hour schooner be then ready a hoped to face worst must happen by noon be blowing so furiously sea have increased to extent that skipper determined not to risk vessel longer by further attempting to sail be accordingly hove to under close reefed foresail when everybody officer in charge of deck man at wheel went below a day wore on weather grew worse by nightfall be blowing perfect hurricane force of wind being so great that even under small rag of close reefed foresail schooner be bowed down to water way lee scupper be afloat yet little craft be making splendid weather of riding mountainous sea a light dry a

until whole of horizon ahead be lighted up like town there being probably over two hundred light in sight be evident that be approaching large concourse of ship in about hour time found driving into very heart of fleet night be altogether too dark for to be enabled to make out who what be skipper be of opinion that have encountered large convoy a be impossible to tell whether be friend foe determined to wear schooner round a soon a must find room heave to with head to westward like rest of fleet when morning must enable to ascertain nationality of neighbour decide whether anything be likely to be gained by keeping company at eight bell therefore by time have passed right through fleet got schooner round waited impatiently until morning there be good deal of firing of blank cartridge throughout night a also of signalling with coloured lantern must of course make nothing of took simply to mean that men o ' war in charge of convoy be doing best to keep fleet from becoming scattered during continuance of gale when morning dawned light came struggling feebly through thick pall of murky storm torn vapour overspread sky became apparent that skipper surmise a to character of fleet have be correct dolphin being in midst of two hundred fifty sail of vessel of different rig from stately ship to saucy schooner in charge of two seventy four fifty gun ship frigate four eighteen gun brig men o ' war be snugged comfortably down royal topgallant yard on deck topgallant mast struck not ounce of unnecessary top hamper aloft most of merchantman have kept everything standing even to royal yard there be few however mostly larger craft who have sent down top hamper there be others notably very fine frigate built ship have lost one more of spar during gale be now in great difficulty with wreck thrashing about aloft not only threatening remaining spar also life of crew who must be seen endeavouring to cut raffle adrift that convoy be british became apparent a soon a light grew strong enough to enable to distinctly make out nearest neighbour struck that men o ' war people be not keeping eye quite so wide open a might have done for there be only four other schooner beside in whole fleet one must have supposed that presence of fifth must instantly have be noticed especially when fifth wore so very roguish appearance a dolphin yet throughout whole of day effort be made to ascertain nationality where came from whither be bound anything about of course under ordinary circumstance having ascertained that convoy be british therefore of especial interest to must have parted company by getting schooner round with head to southward there be however one circumstance decided skipper to keep company with convoy little longer be a have already be mentioned there be very fine frigate built merchantman in fleet when morning dawned be seen to be in situation of considerable difficulty fore mizzen topmast main topgallant mast being over side having apparently be carried away during night by tremendous rolling pitching of ship near be exceedingly smart looking brigantine with main topmast fore topgallant mast housed vessel joined convoy about daybreak be now hove to under close reefed main trysail fore topmast staysail ought to have enabled to easily forge ahead eat out to windward of disabled ship a matter of fact did so yet somehow always seemed to drop back again into old place just to leeward of ship after observing motion for time became impressed with idea that be result of deliberate design rather than of accident for something seemed to be constantly going wrong with trysail sheet necessitating temporary taking in of sail during must pay off go wallowing away to leeward for distance of three four mile when sail must be reset must come creeping stealthily imperceptibly up into somewhere near old berth again be done so naturally that have not occurred more than once know must have taken notice of to however circumstance wore rather suspicious appearance when have mentioned to skipper seemed somewhat disposed to take view that craft although apparently british built be in reality enemy privateer with design upon disabled ship a soon a favourable opportunity must occur for carrying out at event there appeared to be enough probability in hypothesis to induce captain winter to remain in company of convoy to watch progress of event instead of wearing round resuming course to southward gale continued to blow day with unabated fury convoy of course remained hove to a hour wore on several craft gradually became more scattered le weatherly vessel steadily settling away to leeward until by time that dark gloomy day drew toward close fleet be spread out over surface of ocean measuring a nearly

advantageously a others for purpose of lying to frigate gun brig be kept busy day watching straggler urging by signal occasional firing of gun to close with main body of fleet generally playing part of sheep dog while crew of lame duck must be seen clearing away wreck of broken spar unbending split sail bending others in place in fact doing utmost to comply with order of men o ' war after utmost

further suspicious manoeuvre may safely conclude that be french if men o ' war forestall will have slap at for appears to be wonderfully fast weatherly craft be certainly most magnificent sea boat determined must keep sharp eye upon movement of brigantine for must not rid mind of very strong suspicion that people meant mischief accordingly watched until have displayed light then pointed out to

brigantine when at length by careful manoeuvring have contrived to approach within biscuit toss of vessel displaying be discovered to chagrin that be not brigantine large barque skipper of appeared to be greatly frightened at sudden appearance near for hailed in execrable french that be armed that if did not sheer off forthwith must fire into replied in english that need not be afraid of a be british like then inquired whether have seen large brigantine in neighbourhood got reply to question be true be utterly incomprehensible doubt very much whether man understood what have said to for wind rendered almost impossible for most powerful voice to make heard unless at very short distance dead to windward a be barque when skipper hailed made several attempt to find brigantine night somehow failed to stumble across disabled ship upon suspected of entertaining design chapter nine narrow escape fortunate discovery about midnight there be sign that gale have pretty well blown out there be distinct if not very strongly marked decrease in strength of wind about hour before dawn veil of impenetrable vapour overhead broke away showing first of small patch of clear sky with dozen star so blinking out of then other larger patch with more star until by time of sunrise sky be clear save for thin detached tatter of fleecy vapour still swept scurrying away to northward eastward be morning watch on deck with first grey light of early dawn indulged in thoroughly searching scrutiny of fleet a much of a still remained in sight on look out for brigantine failed to discover trace of of disabled ship considered not only surprising exceedingly suspicious a crew of ship have contrived during previous day to clear away wreck of top hamper to get craft once more under command by setting fore main topsail make shift fore staysail under vessel appeared to be doing exceedingly well when darkness of preceding night have closed down upon convoy indeed so well have be doing that occurred to a possible that might during night have managed to work into tolerably weatherly position relatively to rest of fleet therefore took ship telescope went up a far a cross tree to see whether from elevation must discover anything of to windward although spent long half hour aloft carefully scrutinising craft in sight be quite unable to pick up ship brigantine be still aloft when skipper made appearance on deck a have by time about concluded search upon seeing looking up at gave one more comprehensive glance round horizon then descended to make report be exceedingly odd remarked skipper when have assured that vessel have vanished what can have become of brigantine can scarcely have taken ship for there have be still be far too much sea for boat to live in nobody madman must ever dream of running ship aboard in such weather must simply mean destruction of craft wonder now whether actually be explanation of disappearance man who commanded that brigantine be sailor flag may have sailed under sailor must even so much a think of attempting such foolhardy trick what be opinion george quite agree with sir a to impossibility of boarding ship in such weather a of last night answered yet fact remains that craft have vanished believe that disappearance be result of accident such a for instance one of running foul of other during darkness depend upon sir brigantine be safe enough wherever may be at moment ship be not far from well be very extraordinary circumstance observed skipper be inclined to believe with that disappearance of one be intimately connected with disappearance of other question now be in direction ought to be looked for considered matter little then said appears to sir that there be at least one direction in supposing suspicion to be correct be quite certain not to be found be to windward in direction convoy will soon be making sail if brigantine be enemy have have hand in disappearance of ship depend upon must not shape course must involve being overtaken in few hour by convoy hampered a must be by disabled ship do think must be altogether likely to run away to leeward because if ship happens to be missed by men o ' war a pretty certainly will be before long be precisely direction in must naturally be looked for here be hove to on larboard tack impression be that vessel have remained on tack instead of being hove to night like rest of have ratched away through fleet have disappeared away there in north western board there be good deal of sound reason common sense in argument of yours george upon word know that must do better than act upon answered skipper meditatively sooner better sir think if will excuse for saying so answered frigate yonder be signalling to gun brig who be answering that to mind look very much a though absence of ship brigantine have just be discovered if so will probably have of men o ' war coming through fleet making inquiry although have paper to show must confess be not in love with neighbourhood of gentry may take into head to order to keep company until can come aboard to examine paper must happen may say good bye to twenty thirty of best men to say nothing of chance of finding brigantine see sir brig be shaking out reef already ay so be assented skipper be right george be high time for to be off may make sail at once brig sail fairly well in moderate weather be very crank believe can run away from in such weather a here be one of hereaway now who look a though must like to have word with give little hooker that will bear george if fellow want to try rate of sailing with be heartily welcome to do so looked in direction indicated by skipper saw one of gun brig about mile half astern heading straight up for with men upon yard shaking out reef from topsail there be time to lose so sang out to men tone of voice probably indicating urgency of case sprang into rigging came tumbling aft almost a soon a brig have got topsail halliard sweated up be under double reefed topsail double reefed mainsail foresail fore staysail jib leaving rest of fleet a though have be at anchor brig astern now fired gun a signal for to heave to shot never came near only notice that took of be to hoist colour caused brig to give chase in earnest shaking out reef in topsail firing again be perfectly clear that be looked upon with strong suspicion have doubt that if be caught must be detained until weather have moderated sufficiently for boat to be sent aboard few minute however proved sufficient to set mind at rest with regard to brig astern be being pressed altogether too much for although gale have certainly broken be still blowing heavily be careened almost gunwale to be sagging away to leeward bodily a well a dropping astern of unfortunately there be two other brig one about mile to leeward about same distance to windward now in obedience to signal thrown out by frigate took up chase matter began to look exceedingly awkward for brig to leeward cared nothing about felt satisfied that must outsail out weather be fellow to windward caused to feel anxious for be edging down upon in comparatively short time must have under gun luckily for there be good many craft between vessel there be whole crowd of ahead into thick of steered in hope that by threading way among must render almost impossible for pursuer to fire upon for fear of hitting of other vessel three of brig in chase be now under double reefed topsail way in drove along through mountainous sea now soaring up to crest of wave in smother of spray showing whole of fore foot twenty foot of keel anon diving furiously into hollow burying to windlass bitt be sight worth seeing brig to windward have taken up pursuit by edging broad away for people be not long in discovering that must not do lively little dolphin be justifying name by almost flying through water fore reached out so rapidly that friend quickly have to haul wind again even then be bringing fast upon weather quarter although be steadily decreasing distance between at length tried gun shot struck water distance ahead on weather bow be nearly if not quite within range few minute later fired again time shot fell so close that spray actually wetted jib boom be now close to straggling bunch of thirty forty vessel before brig must again fire be among for fully five minute became impossible for to fire without running risk of hitting one of gave very handsome lift of availed to utmost brig to leeward being now well on lee quarter captain winter thought might venture to edge away point brought brig to windward broad on weather quarter critical moment be now fast approaching for last mentioned vessel be now very nearly a close to a must be at if must manage to weather out next twenty minute without mishap might hope to make good escape be soon clear of cluster of shipping have afforded protection moment that be so brig to windward again opened fire conviction of people doubt being by time that be enemy despite british ensign streaming from gaff end heard shot go humming over mast head although did damage must see that skipper be beginning to feel very uneasy a kept glancing from brig to own sail a though debating within desirability of hazarding attempt to give schooner little more canvas presently saw brig luff momentarily into wind line of flame smoke burst from lee broadside nine six pound shot came skipping along water toward broadside be splendidly aimed luckily for moment of firing be badly chosen gun be too much depressed for none of shot reached almost at same moment brig to leeward began firing shot fell so far short that from moment gave further concern whatever luffing of brig to windward gave slight advantage a by so doing fell astern several fathom moreover have by time settled so far away on quarter that few minute more must suffice to bring almost directly into wake felt once there must have very little more to fear from impression be quickly confirmed for after late experience fired more broadside only gun that must now bring to bear being bow chaser although next three four shot came unpleasantly near to succeeded fell short by time that be abreast of most northerly straggler of convoy be practically safe provided that none of gear carried away of however have little fear a rigging be new of very best fortunately for none of big men o ' war condescended to take part in chase from weatherly position occupied there be very little doubt that must have cut off a be brig maintained pursuit for distance of sixteen mile altogether when be recalled by signal from commodore be greatly elated at escape for although utmost that have to fear be loss by impressment of of men maintenance of crew intact be important matter with more so now that be bound upon what might prove to be lengthened cruise during progress of many vacancy might be expected to occur either by necessity to send away prize crew otherwise must have little chance to fill up over above adventure with gun brig have afforded brief sufficient opportunity to thoroughly test power of schooner under circumstance of about a adverse character a must well be imagined triumphant manner in have more than justified most sanguine anticipation gave unbounded confidence in by noon that day wind have moderated sufficiently to permit of shaking out reef when sun went down out of clear sky shooting last ray in long trail of burning gold athwart tumbling waste of still tumultuous water dolphin be once more under plain sail speeding to westward in direction that surmised have be taken by brigantine ship during night wind dropped still further following morning found with sail barely filled creeping lazily along over long low swell have already begun to wear that streaky oily appearance sometimes herald approach of stark calm calculation have led to hope that with appearance of daylight on particular morning must sight brigantine prize a have grown to consider disabled ship greatly to disappointment nothing be to be seen in direction even from lofty elevation of royal yard a day wore on wind died away altogether by noon schooner have lost steerage way head boxing compass a floated on glass smooth undulation that alone remained to tell of elemental fury have raged over spot few hour previously remained thus becalmed for fifty four hour so utterly devoid of movement that ash dust galley refuse hove overboard by cook during time collected into unsightly patch alongside just abaft larboard fore rigging in exact spot where have be thrown weather be now excessively hot of who must swim took advantage of so favourable opportunity for bathing by spending most of time off duty in water alongside until appearance of shark fin two at great distance warned of danger of such proceeding caused skipper to issue order that man be to go overboard without especial permission few hour of such weather after gale must have be agreeable change affording a did excellent opportunity to dry drenched clothing be spun out so long that be heartily glad when toward sunset on second day of calm delicate line of blue betokening approach of breeze appeared along northern horizon by time that sun have sunk out of sight first faint breathing reached have by time arrived at conclusion that surmise relative to movement of brigantine of suspicious character be erroneous that have steered in other direction a soon therefore a canvas filled schooner gathered steerage way course be shaped for south west skipper having made up mind that west indian water afforded most promising field for operation of such enterprising privateersman a breeze have come to proved to be very languid zephyr after scarcely perceptible breathing just sufficient to give schooner steerage way to drift along at rate of bare two knot to south west through soft mysterious sheen of star lit night with dawning of new day matter improved somewhat speed rising to nearly four knot when went on deck at six bell to get salt water shower bath in head found schooner gently stealing along over smooth sea softly wrinkled to most delicate azure hue by light touch of faint breeze came to cool sweet refreshing out of north sky be deep pure cloudless blue overhead merging by thousand subtle gradation into warm pinky primrose tint along horizon away to north low down in sky there floated few indefinite softly luminous cloud shape gave reason to hope that might be favoured with more robust breeze later on in day notwithstanding oily looking streak patch of calm appeared here there upon ocean surface watch be busily engaged in swabbing deck subsequent to vigorous treatment with holystone freshly polished brasswork gun flashed like gold in brilliant morning sunlight white canvas swelled sank gently a schooner curtsied upon almost imperceptible heaving of swell everything looked fresh bright cheerful thin wreath of smoke floated lazily out of galley funnel away over lee cat head to melody of rollicking sea ditty chanted by cook a busied with preparation of breakfast imparted that sense of homeliness light hearted happiness seemed to be be required to satisfactorily complete picture breakfast be over have just set watch to work upon certain job requiring doing when boy whom have sent aloft to grease down topmast a punishment for trifling misdemeanour reported two sail close together broad on starboard beam steering same way a ourselves in reply to inquiry respecting appearance furnished with further information that one be brigantine must not quite make out rig of other although thought be ship immediately suspected from reply that have accidentally tumbled upon identical two craft that be most anxious to find better to satisfy upon important point took ship telescope journeyed up to royal yard from whence must obtain most satisfactory view of possible be at least twenty mile distant therefore quite invisible from deck while even from royal yard upper canvas only head of lower sail be to be seen have not got within field of telescope more than minute when became convinced that lost be found that be two vessel for have be looking ship be under quite respectable jury rig be carrying topgallant sail jib while brigantine seemed to be under double reefed canvas doubtless to moderate speed to of disabled ship be close together steering to south west like ourselves having thoroughly satisfied upon point descended made report to skipper old fellow chuckled rubbed hand what lucky thing be that breeze did not freshen during night remarked have done so must have passed two craft without seeing whereas now if go well will have pair of before dark to think that be grumbling about light air during night upon word be beginning to believe that parson be only speaking simple truth when say that can never tell what be really best for however be not time to discus matter of sort how do say vessel bear from broad on lee bow sir a nearly a possible dead to leeward answered then if keep away couple of point will just about hit off remarked skipper gave necessary instruction to helmsman then turning again to continued may a well get business over a soon a possible george so get stunsails big gaff topsail main topmast staysail on at once lad give little hooker chance to go through water addition to canvas be soon made then watch returned to work upon have be previously engaged a did not expect to overtake object of pursuit for several hour be just noon be still engaged upon observation of sun for determination of latitude when captain made out through telescope of sextant mast head of brigantine just peeping above line of southern horizon while be in cabin getting dinner comben who have charge of deck reported through open skylight that brigantine have apparently just sighted for have hauled wind be making sail right remarked skipper so much better just suit for will get to fisticuffs sooner get whole business comfortably over by dark let go along a be mr comben finished dinner comfortably then went on deck to find that brigantine have reached out well across fore foot shortly afterwards tacked heading well up to meet be then about nine mile off four point on starboard bow ship being perhaps twelve mile distant bearing point on port bow wind have freshened trifle during forenoon be now blowing pretty little breeze sent along at about six knot if must freshen trifle more must become perfect working breeze for fight between two such craft a brigantine a be be by mean dissatisfied for there be just wind enough to ensure proper working of schooner while water be smooth enough to admit of laying adversary aboard without injury to vessel men be given plenty of time to finish dinner in peace comfort tot of grog be served out to then hand cleared deck for action galley fire be extinguished magazine opened powder shot passed on deck cutlass pistol served out latter loaded then crew went to quarter brigantine be by time within three mile of allowed to close to within two mile then shortened sail to mainsail foresail topsail topgallant sail jib hoisted colour fired gun chapter ten affair of tigre manilla brigantine be at time under plain sail to royal main topmast staysail standing toward close hauled on port tack have sooner shortened sail hoisted colour than did same displaying very large tricolour at peak very good commented skipper approvingly that settle question of nationality at event show that be prepared to fight for prize yonder that have somehow managed to secure well be glad of george for be wonderfully handsome craft powerful fast half a big again a be will be quite worth trouble of taking believe man ought to be able to do good work with fine vessel a under foot there come round very pretty very pretty indeed why work like top look at beam of height spread of spar upon word seems pity to knock about beauty a with shot suppose will be impossible to avoid doing damage must knock about a little a possible tell what george believe best plan will be to make short work of if play game of hammer tongs will maul other fearfully before compel to haul down colour so let men clap charge of grape canister in on top of round shot will run aboard at once firing a touch board in smoke drive people below out of hand be quite in accordance with own fancy for a skipper have said brigantine be half a big again a dolphin mounted fourteen gun to eleven chance be that in fair stand up fight might disable to extent a to render own escape that of prize easy matter so went round deck personally saw to execution of skipper order explaining to men intention warning not to fire until got word cautioning hand to be ready to follow skipper on to brigantine deck instant that two vessel be properly secured to other brigantine have gone about while skipper be speaking to be now on port bow standing toward on starboard tack with exception of own gun of defiance vessel have a yet fired looked almost a if be waiting for to begin in order that might ascertain weight of metal when two craft be within about quarter of mile of other antagonist suddenly yawed gave whole starboard broadside of seven twelve pound shot gun be excellently aimed seven shot flying close over head passing through sail seven perforation in canvas represented full extent of damage not one of spar being hit so much a rope yarn cut must see that lad finger be itching to return fire captain of gun squinting along sight of piece audibly remarking that elevation be just right if skipper must luff give chance to show what must do steadied by passing along from gun to gun telling that if must have patience chance must come in few minute in answer to many of clapped hand to cutlass to make sure that be loose in sheath while others drew pistol carefully examined priming brigantine luffed again immediately that have fired be now so close must see people busily reloading two vessel be rapidly nearing other be in hope that must close before must be possible for to fire again there be man on board who by gesture seemed to be urging to expedite work when be only twenty fathom distant while brigantine be crossing bow saw gun again run out look out sir shouted to skipper be about to fire again luff will rake skipper signed with hand helmsman gave wheel powerful whirl to starboard schooner swerved round almost at same instant crash came broadside slap into time there be perceptible concussion a shot struck followed by crashing splintering of wood two three piercing shriek of agony five men fell to deck with blood welling out of dreadful wound inflicted by shot flying splinter then a bore down upon brigantine skipper raised warning cry drew sword rushed forward to head boarder from part of ship skipper gave word to fire a broadside rang out two vessel crashed together there be indescribable tumult of thudding shot rending wood groan shriek execration on board frenchman with shout of hurrah lad follow make short work of leaped on to brigantine rail down on deck spacious deck of french ship seemed to be crowded with men a far a must see through thick pall of powder smoke that wreathed twisted hither thither in eddying draught of wind there be great gap among filled with prostrate figure heaped upon other lying stark still others writhing screaming with agony bearing fearful witness to havoc wrought by grape canister discharge of at such close quarter seemed to have stunned stupefied frenchman for not hand be raised to oppose a sprang down off rail darted quick glance along deck noticed that skipper be leading party on board aft then made cut at frenchman nearest woke up hurriedly raised cutlas to guard blow next moment be at cut thrust parry a hard a must go attack being made upon two extremity of brigantine deck soon have crew hemmed in between skipper own party for next ten minute there be a pretty fight a one need wish to witness frenchman rallying gallantly to call of captain hubbub be terrific clash of steel popping of pistol shriek groan outcry of wounded execration of frenchman cheer of own lad grinding of ship together creating perfectly indescribable medley of sound struggle threatened to be stubborn protracted frenchman at end of ship obstinately disputing inch of deck with therefore determined to make special effort see what mere physical strength of possessed goodly share must do for there be handspike lying upon deck under foot have tripped over kicked aside twice thrice so suddenly hitting out with left fist knocked down man who happened to be at moment opposed to quickly stooped seized handspike dropped sword singing out to own lad to give room swung new weapon round head brought down with crash upon two three frenchman nearest force of blow made arm tingle to elbow swept frenchman down a though have be scythe caused behind to recoil in terror flail like sweep proved equally effective cutlass raised to guard blow being a useless a so many wand when followed up with third proved too much for frenchman who seeing comrade go down before like ninepin gave way with yell of dismay retreating aft until be jammed huddled together like sheep so closely that have room to fight effectively french captain a took to be finding thing going badly in direction forced way through crowd perhaps regarding a chief mischief maker levelled pistol at head fired felt ball graze scalp at same instant handspike descended upon unhappy man head saw blood spurt out over face down went proved sufficient frenchman nearest threw down weapon cried that surrendered cry be taken up by rest brigantine be won first thing now to be done be to see to wounded carnage have be very great in proportion to number engaged men have sooner sheathed weapon than went to work among ghastly prostrate form to separate wounded from dead task be soon completed be then discovered that loss have not be nearly so great a have feared dead amounting to eleven wounded to nineteen three of whom be dangerously injured own dead wounded be carefully removed to schooner then unwounded frenchman having be driven below securely confined in hold skipper put in charge of prize with crew of twenty men two craft made sail in company in pursuit of merchantman be now hull down in south western quarter moment that two craft be clear of other sail trimmed set people to work to convey wounded frenchman below to cabin where vessel by good luck being provided with surgeon be quickly attended to when be done be found that french loss totalled up to le than twenty seven killed forty four wounded out of complement of one hundred men with have commenced engagement be heavily manned vessel for in addition to number already given have thirty men on board prize having seen wounded carried below dead thrown overboard deck washed down have opportunity to look about bit take stock of noble craft that have captured turned out to be tigre of nantes thirty four day out during have captured only one prize namely ship of be now in pursuit be brand new vessel measuring three hundred seventy six ton oak built coppered copper fastened of immense beam very willow drawing only ten foot six inch of water be extraordinarily fast with wind over quarter running away from dolphin easily suspected that in thrash to windward in anything of breeze schooner must prove to be quite match for with perhaps trifle to spare mounted fourteen twelve pounder magazine be crammed with ammunition having be intention of captain to try luck like ourselves in west indian water be about six bell in afternoon watch when filled away in pursuit of ship sun be within hour of setting when overtook brought to dolphin being at time two mile astern of knew that there be thirty frenchman on board did not anticipate resistance from since must be perfectly clear to that anything of kind although might temporarily prevent taking possession must be utterly useless in end only result in loss of life therefore lowered boat taking with ten men armed to teeth proceeded on board secured undisputed possession of ship first act be to release crew of prize after disarmed frenchman be transferred to brigantine confined below along with comrade while be still in process of performance dolphin joined company captain winter came on board fully approved of have be done directed to remain on board in charge shifting over into brigantine placing schooner under temporary command of comben by time that arrangement have be completed night have fallen dinner be about to be served in cuddy at earnest invitation of captain of ship skipper accepted seat at table meanwhile three of craft have be hauled to wind on larboard tack be heading to eastward ship under everything that jury rig must permit to be set schooner brigantine under double reefed topsail now have opportunity to learn few particular relating to prize circumstance of capture by french privateer latter being somewhat remarkable ship appeared be named manilla be homeward bound with rich cargo of spice other rare commodity including several ton of ivory have shipped at cape together with number of passenger have here joined homeward bound convoy have gone well with until springing up of gale during have fallen in with convoy during gale however have laboured so heavily that have not only lost fore mizzen topmast main topgallant mast have also strained so much that have made great deal of water necessitating frequent long spell at pump clearing away of wreck of top hamper have a might have be expected greatly exhausted crew result being on night of capture look out be not quite so keen a perhaps must have be after a captain remarked there really did not appear to be necessity for maintenance of especially bright look out beyond what be required to provide against falling foul of of other ship belonging to convoy although admitted that have noticed brigantine dolphin have immediately set down a privateer did not consider a enemy even if such suspicion have entered mind must not have deemed liable to attack within sight reach of eight men o ' war therefore when night came on allowed exhausted crew to get what rest must keeping only sufficient number of men on deck to meet ordinary emergency be thus profoundly astonished chagrined at being awakened about one o'clock in morning to find crew overpowered safely confined below ship in possession of crew of thirty frenchman how have contrived to get on board in height of so heavy gale with so tremendous sea running have be unable to ascertain frenchman in charge resolutely refusing to explain such be extraordinary story told by captain of manilla that be absolutely true there must be doubt for have seen enough to assure of be greatly disappointed however at captain inability to explain by what mean frenchman have contrived to board ship in face of such formidable difficulty for be precisely point have puzzled through resolved to find out if must for secret be quite worth knowing captain winter have determined to return home with prize accordingly continued to steer to eastward night next morning at daybreak turned to hand went to work to complete jury rig that frenchman have so well begun a manilla happened to be well provided with spare spar contrived after two day hard work to get back to something like former appearance to so greatly increase sailing power that brigantine schooner must shake reef out of topsail without running away from meanwhile wind have gradually hauled round until have got well over starboard quarter be booming along at speed of eight knot with studding sail set officer who have be put in charge of manilla when fell into hand of french privateersman be very fine young fellow named dumaresq smart seaman high spirited a brave a lion early took fancy to other especially after have offered parole soon became exceedingly friendly possessed rich fund of amusing anecdote together with art of telling story well be refined in manner excellently educated accomplished pianist be therefore quite acquisition to cuddy now that ship be longer in possession be heartily welcomed there by captain chesney passenger scarcely ever turned in until after midnight by by young dumaresq contracted habit of joining on poop smoking cigar with after passenger have retired for night upon one of occasion conversation turned upon clever capture of ship by countryman aroused curiosity afresh after have be talking for time about said how in world did manage to get aboard in such terrific weather be what puzzle doubt mon cher answered with laugh how to manage be just what puzzled for time also knew that only chance be to do during height of gale for if have waited until weather moderated must have have of men o ' war looking after instituting unpleasant inquiry must have found exceedingly difficult to answer so after considerable cogitation poor captain lefevre whose brain understand be unkind enough to beat out with handspike hit upon plan thought might succeed have few barrel of oil on board one of broached for purpose of testing idea have canvas bag made capable of containing about four gallon of oil bag filled bent closed end on to rope threw affair overboard paying out rope a brigantine drifted to leeward until have about hundred fathom of line out with bag about distance to windward soon found that oil exuding through pore of canvas have distinctly marked effect upon sea ceased to break a soon a reached film of oil have oozed from bag still effect be by mean a great a desired oil not exuding in sufficient quantity to render sea safe for boat so hauled bag inboard again punctured well with sailmaker needle then tried again now proved to be everything must be desired oil oozed out of bag in sufficient quantity to make smooth patch of water with diameter fully equal to length of ship after testing matter through whole afternoon came to conclusion that boat must live in such patch that experiment be quite worth trying wherefore three bag be made one for boat attached by becket to length of line measuring about twenty fathom then when night have set in darkness have become deep enough to conceal movement bag be filled dropped overboard other end of line being made fast to ringbolt in stern of boat for use of have be destined party of thirty men be told off ten to boat with four additional to take boat back to ship in event of venture proving successful brigantine be then sailed to position about mile ahead mile to windward of manilla being ship that have marked down for prey great difficulty that now anticipated be that of unhooking fall with certainty promptitude moment that boat must reach water captain provided for by slinging boat by strop toggle attached to ordinary fall block be now ready to put matter to test at last moment captain suddenly decided that be too early that must be better to defer attempt until after midnight be done at appointed hour brigantine be once more sailed into suitable position with regard to manilla boat be manned lowered managed to get away from brigantine without much difficulty remained hove to upon spot where have left to make matter a safe a possible for capsized overboard content of two of oil barrel smoothened sea to extent deeply a be loaded heavily a be blowing did not ship drop of water allowed boat to drift down to leeward with oil bag towing astern with only two oar out to keep stern on to sea so accurately have distance be calculated that when manilla came up abreast of only needed to pull stroke two to get comfortably under lee boarded by way of lee channel fore main mizzen simultaneously that let tell be most difficult part of work for ship rolled so heavily that be with utmost difficulty avoided staving swamping boat man knew however exactly what to do did without necessity for word to be spoken thus desperate adventure for desperate indeed be let tell be accomplished without mishap ah there go eight bell time for to turn in so will say good night mon cher bowen pleasant dream to chapter eleven manilla be struck by lightning for full week nothing occurred of sufficient importance to be worthy of record little squadron making good headway before fair wind have come to assistance brigantine schooner ever being more than three four mile distant from while in response to daily invitation from captain chesney skipper of indiaman captain winter frequently came on board to dine spend evening with cuddy passenger on ninth day after recapture of manilla wind dwindled away to light air then shifted out from north east gradually freshening to strong breeze breaking off to east south east course close hauled on port tack stood thus through night at daybreak next morning large ship be discovered about ten mile to windward close hauled on starboard tack dodging along under topsail jib spanker with course in brail single glance at be sufficient to assure that be man o ' war frigate on cruising ground that people be broad awake be speedily made manifest for have scarcely made out when shifted helm bore up for letting fall course setting topgallant sail royal a did so discovery of stranger be immediately productive of very considerable amount of anxiety among for be powerful vessel if enemy likely to prove exceedingly formidable antagonist there be very little doubt among that be enemy cut of square canvas being unmistakably french such be also captain winter opinion for presently ran down under stern hailed stating suspicion directing to bear up make best of way to leeward while dolphin must endeavour to cover retreat distract stranger attention until have got clear off order be be to run to leeward until out of sight of frenchman then to haul wind on starboard tack when must do utmost to rejoin that in event of failing to do so be to make best of way home without wasting time in endeavour to find lost time in obeying instruction instantly wearing indiaman round crowding sail to leeward frigate have by time neared to within seven mile moment that in indiaman bore up set studding sail on side in pursuit while brigantine dolphin stretched away to windward to intercept there be scarcely shadow of doubt now in mind that stranger be frenchman for although studding sail be set with very commendable promptitude alacrity there be wanting in operation certain element of smartness very difficult to describe yet perfectly discernible to eye of seaman have observed to be almost exclusive attribute of british man o ' war difference indeed be so marked that a in present case have frequently be possible to decide nationality of ship merely by way in be manoeuvred long before sight of bunting have be obtained conviction that noble craft to windward be enemy caused greatest consternation on board manilla particularly among passenger while even with knowledge of captain winter indomitable courage resource skill must not feel exceedingly anxious a to result of impending contest with so greatly superior force true memory of gallant fight with brilliant capture of musette frigate be still fresh in memory regarded that affair rather a piece of exceptional good luck than a result of superior gallantry on part be quite on card in present case luck might go over to side of enemy a in case of musette fortunate shot might make difference between victory defeat be too much to expect that such good fortune a have then attended must always be ours be understood be in nowise fearful of personal capture felt pretty confident that skipper must be quite able to occupy attention of frigate long enough to enable manilla to make good escape that accomplished must be able also to save moved by so keen feeling of anxiety a have indicated will not be wondered at have sooner got indiaman before wind with stitch of canvas spread must pack upon than devoted whole attention to movement of three craft be about to take part in forthcoming ocean drama there be outward sign of hesitancy doubt in movement of vessel frigate have borne away into wake moment that have borne away be now foaming along after in gallant style with studding sail set on side from royal down be of course coming up with hand over hand there be question a to intention be after meant to catch if must on other hand brigantine schooner under plain sail be stretching away to windward close hauled on larboard tack with space of only hundred fathom so dividing brigantine leading looked a though two vessel be about to engage frigate on same side if be to be running fight a seemed probable be sound judgment on captain winter part since must enable frigate to use only one broadside so virtually reduce weight of metal by one two craft continued to stand on tack until frigate be nearly abreast of when hove about at same moment simultaneously hoisted colour frigate probably hoisted colour in reply to challenge if so must not see what be own canvas intervening to hide flag from fired whole broadside few second later saw shot spouting up water a flew toward two craft dared to dispute passage of sea with appeared to fall short at event perceptible damage be done to vessel moment later schooner fired sound of report told that be long eighteen pounder be speaking shot struck water about sixty seventy fathom from frigate ricochetted appeared to pas over for presently saw water spout up again well to starboard of vessel be enough for saucy little dolphin be beyond range of frigate gun must reach antagonist with own long tom therefore immediately bore up set square sail studding sail maintaining distance steered parallel course to of frigate while brigantine stood on with now evident intention of taking up raking position athwart frigate stern dolphin now opened rapid fire upon frigate with long gun shot showed that latter be well within range frigate replied from time to time with single gun comben be too wary to approach near enough to be hit so fight went on for time with apparent damage to combatant meanwhile brigantine have a have anticipated placed athwart frigate stern well within range now traversed frenchman wake sailing to fro athwart stern pouring in whole raking broadside time crossed receiving two gun in reply of course be exceedingly pretty interesting a exhibition of captain winter skill acumen in fighting enemy of superior force thus far firing have be comparatively ineffective few hole here there in frenchman sail being only visible result of expenditure of considerable quantity of gunpowder while have neared to within four mile be overhauling so rapidly that hour at most must see within reach of gun mason however man who have formerly proved to be so excellent shot with eighteen pounder be still aboard schooner have great hope of especially a knew that must be by time upon mettle animated by feeling that behoved to speedily do something remarkable if must save reputation be deceived in expectation of for very shortly afterwards shot from schooner cut halliard of frigate larboard lower studding sail sail dropped into water retarding vessel progress perceptibly until be got in occupied frenchman nearly quarter of hour to accomplish to splice halliard to reset sail meanwhile brigantine have not be idle even while frenchman be busy about studding sail recrossed frigate stern firing broadside at vessel spar with considerable success appeared for although must not make out exactly what have happened be evident that something have gone seriously wrong captain chesney who stood beside watching fight declaring that have noticed appearance strongly suggestive of fall of frigate mizzen mast hardly believed that such must be case for steering a frigate then be dead before wind have mizzen mast fallen must have fallen forward doing so much damage to spar sail on mainmast think effect must have be recognisable even where be considered far more probable that mizzen topmast topgallant mast have be shot away next shot from schooner however be exceedingly lucky one appeared to strike frigate fore topmast about six foot below cross tree next moment whole of wreck be hanging by topsail sheet from fore yard down on to ship forecastle with jib fore topmast staysail towing under bow at once caused to broach to settled business so far a hope of capturing be concerned have revenge by pouring whole of starboard broadside into brigantine sail rigging of be tremendously cut up by unexpected salute a frigate broached to saw that surmise be not very far wide of mark mizzen topgallant mast mizzen topsail yard having be shot away latter in sling three vessel now went at hammer tongs brigantine being for moment fairly under frigate gun winter soon very cleverly got out of awkward situation while frenchman be busily engaged in endeavour to clear away wreck get ship once more before wind laid athwart bow with topsail aback poured broadside after broadside into helpless craft while dolphin gliding hither thither beyond reach of frigate gun sent home eighteen pound shot two three minute one of appeared to tell somewhere other on frenchman hull now ran away from fast however by noon have lost sight of altogether when last seen be still hammering away at other brigantine schooner appearing to be getting rather best of once fairly out of sight of combatant took in studding sail hauled wind to northward in obedience to captain winter order although have sharp look out for dolphin consort maintained throughout whole of next day be not greatly surprised at not heaving in sight have not much misgiving a to ultimate result of fight believed that brigantine at least must not get off without rather severe mauling in case schooner must naturally stand by until must be again put into decent workable trim fourth day after fight dawned without bringing sight of consort then began to feel rather uneasy fearing that have probably missed somehow that must have to make way home a best must unprotected to enter english channel just then unprotected meant almost certain capture for although indiaman be certainly armed after fashion most of gun be quaker while others ten in be only six pounder must need whole of crew to work only under awkward jury rig with one to spare for fighting however be useless to meet trouble way so determined to plod steadily onward homeward hoping for best hitherto ever since day of meeting with frenchman have experienced moderate steady breeze from northward eastward on day of be now writing there be indication of impending change wind gradually died down to light fitful air came in flaw first from one quarter of compass then from lasting few minute with lengthening interval of calm between while huge pile of black thunderous looking cloud gradually heaped up along northern horizon until have overspread whole sky barometer too exhibited tendency to fall decline be so slight that be of opinion meant more than perhaps sharp thunder squall particularly a there be swell making moreover there be close thundery feeling in stagnating air increased a day grew older be not however until about hour after sunset just a be sitting down to dinner in cuddy that outbreak commenced did with sudden blinding flash of lightning that darted out of welkin almost immediately overhead instantly followed by deafening crash of thunder caused indiaman to tremble to keel sensation being not unlike what one must expect to feel if craft be being swept rapidly along over sandy bottom just touched first flash be soon followed by not quite so near at hand then by until lightning be playing about in such rapidly succeeding flash that whole atmosphere be luminous with continuous quivering of ghastly blue green light while heaven resounded ship trembled with unbroken crash roll of thunder spectacle be magnificent be also rather trying to nerve lightning being so dazzlingly vivid that be positively blinding while have never heard such awful thunder before even in west indie several of lady passenger indeed be so unnerved by storm that retreated from table shut into cabin even young dumaresq who have hitherto appeared to be irrepressible be subdued by awful violence of turmoil raged around be admitting something to effect to when be cut short by blaze of lightning seemed to envelop whole ship in sheet of flame there be rending shock violent enough to suggest that indiaman have come into violent collision with vessel although be fully aware that thing must not be weather at moment being stark calm hot air seemed to suddenly become surcharged with strong sulphurous smell then came peal of thunder of so terrific soul subduing character that might have be crash of shattered world for brief space be so thoroughly overpowered so awed overwhelmed by tremendous manifestation of creator power that remained speechless motionless on seat then a echo of thunder rumbled away into distance hearing gradually recovered from shock of last dreadful detonation became aware of loud shriek of pain out on deck brilliant light confused rush scurry of foot shout of fire fire ship be struck be ablaze at cry captain chesney dumaresq sprang to foot dashed out on deck merciful heaven what appalling scene met gaze foremast have be struck be cloven in twain from jury topgallant mast head to deck have also be set on fire blazing mass of timber cordage canvas have fallen back upon mainmast setting sail rigging of mast also on fire flame blazing fiercely a writhed coiled about spar darted hither thither like fiery serpent through maze of tarred highly inflammable rigging be by mean worst of lightning upon reaching deck appeared to have darted hither thither in most extraordinary way for presently discovered that considerable quantity of metal work such a iron band belaying pin bolt chain topsail sheet other such matter have be either wholly partially fused by terrific heat of electric discharge while several silent prostrate figure on deck scorched black with clothing burnt from body told that death have be busy in awful instant when bolt have struck ship there be worse even than for there be other figure crouched huddled upon deck moaning piteously with pain one man stood erect with hand clasped over eye head thrown back shrieking to be taken below for have be struck blind be dreadful moment moment of frightful peril of horror indescribable moment when man might well be excused if found temporarily overmastered by accumulated terror of surroundings chesney captain of indiaman proved equal to occasion for single instant stood aghast at awful spectacle that met horrified gaze then pulled together instinctively assuming command a under circumstance be perfectly justified in doing made voice ring from end to end of ship a ordered hand to be called order however be scarcely necessary for by time watch below startled by shock of lightning stroke shriek of injured indefinable conviction of something being wrong that occasionally seizes people upon occurrence of dire catastrophe be tumbling up through fore scuttle with much of hurry confusion of panic be greatly increased when beheld mast sail rigging ablaze by voice example however presently contrived to steady get under control then while one gang be told off to convey injured men below dumaresq meanwhile hurrying away to summon doctor who be busily engaged in cabin endeavouring to soothe of lady passenger who be in hysteric rest of crew be set to work to rig pump muster bucket pas along hose in few minute be ready pump be started chief mate with line to end of hose be bent climbed up into main top from began to play upon fire by time flame have acquired firm hold upon spar canvas heavily tarred rigging that jet of water from hose proved quite incapable of producing visible effect upon mate soon became so hemmed in by fire that be in very act of retreating to deck when flood gate of heaven be opened rain suddenly pelted down in such overwhelming torrent that in le than five minute conflagration aloft be completely extinguished not until sail have be burnt to tinder spar badly charred most of standing running rigging destroyed with outburst of rain have rendered such excellent service violence of storm sensibly abated perhaps because have nearly spent at event lightning discharge now succeeded other at steadily lengthening interval a storm passed away to southward thunder died down to distant booming rumbling finally ceased altogether in about hour half from commencement of outbreak while lightning became harmless fitful quivering of vari coloured light along southern horizon be now in most awkward predicament predicament might easily become disastrous must come on to blow a be by mean impossible for not only have three men be killed outright eight more le seriously injured by terrible lightning stroke sail be gone foremast destroyed rigging so badly injured that main mizzen mast stood practically unsupported while have too much reason to fear that mast spar be so seriously weakened by play of flame upon a to have become of little use to to crown be now so pitch dark that must be difficult if not impossible to ascertain full extent of disaster until daylight situation however be too critical to admit of waiting until then be of vital importance immediate step must be taken to secure what have be left to with object carpenter boatswain procured lantern with proceeded aloft to make critical examination into condition of spar rigging be thus engaged when doctor who have be down in forecastle attending to hurt of wounded men appeared on deck catching sight of captain chesney standing together under break of poop beckoned to follow into cabin chapter twelve destruction of manilla will only detain moment gentleman said medico a closed cabin door behind wanted to speak to strictly in private since if overheard have to say might possibly produce panic fact be that be afraid be not yet aware of full extent of disaster have happened to have be down in forecastle attending to wounded men have sooner entered place than noticed faint smell a of burning attached importance to at moment believing that arose from fire on deck instead of passing away a ought to have done with extinguishment of fire have persistently continued be almost inclined to believe that be now if anything rather stronger than be when went below do think possible that ship cargo be on fire by jove exclaimed skipper never thought of that will be looked to at once be much obliged to doctor for mentioning matter must have be even more so if have communicated with rather earlier come along bowen must investigate without further delay doctor hurriedly entered into explanation to effect that must not leave patient until have be properly attended to that there be one by whom must send message must just then ill spare time to listen to so with hasty acceptance of excuse skipper led way out on deck following made way straight to forecastle into forthwith descended sure enough be sooner fairly below coaming of hatchway than became aware of distinct smell of fire to also one of le seriously injured of wounded men immediately directed attention sniffed about hither thither soon found that smell be stronger a stooped nearer to deck approached bulkhead dividing fore hold from forecastle be now almost certain that there be smouldering of something somewhere below without more ado skipper flung off coat lifted hatch of forepeak descended remained below about five minute when reappeared composedly closed hatch resumed coat beckoned to follow on deck crew be now busily engaged under direction of chief second mate in clearing away wreck of foremast therefore walked aft until be out of hearing of everybody when captain paused turning to said be very much afraid that ship be on fire can not be sure smell be distinctly stronger in forepeak than be in forecastle yet not strong enough to lead to belief that be anything serious still must be attended to at once so will knock off men call aft speak to before doing anything will have panic among then will have fore hatch opened proceed to make proper examination of cargo mr priest continued calling to chief mate knock men off for minute two send aft if please mate marvelling doubt at untimely interruption of operation of great importance did a be bid in few minute hand except injured men be mustered in waist waiting to hear what skipper have to say to a soon a silence have be secured captain chesney advanced said lad have sent for to come aft in order may communicate to matter may prove of very considerable consequence to to invite best assistance co operation in investigation be about to cause to be made matter in question may may not prove to be of alarming character in case of turning out to be latter want to impress upon paramount importance of order method most implicit obedience without nothing of real importance can ever be achieved there be at critical moment impulse in man to think act independently under conviction that one be so capable a of dealing efficiently effectually with matter in hand when impulse prevails confusion disorder follow useful effort be frustrated where number of men be working jointly together there must be leader one who will think for direct effort of rest be essential to success that order of leader must be obeyed now in present case lad will do thinking planning arranging if will do work quietly methodically steadily there be reason why must not be well have said with double purpose first to prepare for rather serious news second to quiet steady for work lie before first a to news fear that lightning have done rather more damage than have hitherto have reason to suppose in word men fear that have set cargo on fire steady lad steady only say fear that such be case be by mean certain of be necessary that matter must be investigated forthwith be therefore about to have fore hatch lifted cargo examined mr priest with watch will take off hatch rouse cargo up on deck mr simcoe with starboard watch will muster bucket again rig pump lead along hose ready to play upon fire must such be discovered away of to duty may possibly be thought by reader that above be rather long speech for man to make at time when believed ship to be on fire under foot when moment be consequently precious after delay amounted to only three minute three minute be well spent for skipper speech have effect of steadying men subduing tendency to panic among rendering amenable to strict discipline be of such inestimable value importance in presence of great emergency went away to work in a quiet orderly manner a though have be dismissed below wedge be quickly knocked out batten removed tarpaulin stripped off hatch lifted upper tier of cargo disclosed with result that almost immediately thin wreath of pale brown smoke began to stream up from between bale case mistake about sir observed chief mate to skipper pointing to curling smoke wreath there be fire somewhere down there now lad let get down to make short work of jim simpson get to work break out that bale a much else a can get at rouse out on deck chip where be carpenter here be mr priest answered carpenter emerging from forecastle hatchway after having stowed away mawl again in most methodical manner be right observed mate now chip foremast having gone want derrick pair of sheers over hatchway to help in breaking out cargo find spar something will serve purpose let bobeun rig up what want well done men now out with crate jump down into hole one two of lend others hand work went forward rapidly steadily in very short time there be goodly display of cargo on deck about fore hatch smoke however at first have streamed up in mere thread like wreath be now pouring out of hatch in cloud so dense that men working at cargo be obliged to be relieved three four minute to avoid suffocation business be beginning to assume very serious aspect now too storm having passed off passenger have ventured out on deck once more observing light bustle forward have gradually approached fore end of ship to see what be going on skipper however at once ordered aft again following into cuddy explained just how matter stood remaining with until excitement have subsided have got pretty well in hand hitherto water have be used captain chesney being anxious to get a much of cargo a possible be mostly of valuable character out on deck uninjured rapidly increasing density volume of smoke showed that question of damaging cargo have now become secondary one safety of ship herself be imperilled head pump be accordingly manned hose coupled up second mate pointed down hatchway while third mate superintended operation of party of men who have be set to draw water pas along chain of bucket by hand when water have be pouring continuously down hatchway for fully quarter of hour smoke continued to stream up from below in ever increasing volume unmingled with indication of steam became apparent that seat of fire be at distance for water have evidently not yet reached flame nevertheless men worked steadily on whereas at commencement of labour have sung out yo ho heave ho other encouraging exclamation after manner of sailor engaged in arduous labour now toiled on in grim silence at length feathery jet of white vapour began to mingle with thick column of smoke surging up hatchway be immediately greeted with shout of triumph by mate followed by few crisp ejaculation of encouragement to men who apparently accepted same in good faith nevertheless must see by priest face that although might have deceived men have not deceived that knew a well a did that appearance of steam be indication not that water have reached fire that fire have spread sufficiently to reach water very different much more serious matter suddenly smoke thickened into dense black cloud of pungent waxy odour immediately afterwards bright tongue of flame came darting up between bale package upon men in hold be working there be loud hissing sound a water be being poured down hatchway became converted into steam then with quick unexpected roar of fire flame shot up in such fierce volume that men be driven precipitately up on deck ah ejaculated mate in aside to know what be be what have be fearing there be lot of shellac gum of different sort down there fire got at will burn like oil worse be afraid will have work cut out now to get fire under fully agreed with rather began to entertain suspicion that ship be doomed for heat even while mate have be speaking have grown intense whole content of hatchway have burst into flame ruddy tongue of fire be now darting through hatchway a through chimney to height of fully twenty foot above deck coaming be on fire pitch be beginning to bubble boil out of seam of deck planking plank be already uncomfortably hot to stand upon unless fire must somehow be checked seemed to that must soon be time to think about getting out boat skipper meanwhile have come forward again although looking very anxious be be glad to see perfectly possessed will have to clap hatch on again mr priest endeavour to smother fire said let be done at once ay ay sir answered priest now then lad on with hatch of will carpenter cut hole in deck sir for water to pas through yes answered skipper must keep hose going certainly when men came to attempt replacing of hatch be found that fire be already too much for heat be so fierce flame poured forth so continuously that must not get near enough to hatchway to achieve object then skipper made attempt with better success getting severely scorched for pain perhaps said might be possible to do something with wetted sail excellent suggestion for be much obliged to mr bowen exclaimed skipper interrupting will be tried at once forthwith gave necessary order main topgallant sail be got up out of sail room dropped overboard made fast by line to one of clew then a soon a be thoroughly saturated be dragged inboard stretched athwart deck dragged over flaming hatchway several men holding in position while carpenter rapidly spiked head foot of to deck meanwhile hose be played incessantly upon while bucket after bucket of water be emptied into with frantic energy until hollow of over hatchway be full of water by keeping continuous stream of water pouring into hollow seemed to check fire for time although be difficult work on account of great cloud of scalding steam soon began to rise from water in le than quarter of hour scorched canvas gave way water that have contained plumped down through rent on to blazing cargo be immediately converted into vast volume of steam that momentarily checked fire then flame leaped up again far more fiercely than ever be good murmured skipper turning to ship be doomed fire be rapidly spreading in spite of that can do there be nothing for therefore to take to boat sooner that be in water better be quite own opinion said so chief mate be accordingly called aside given instruction while second mate with gang continued to fight fire mr priest with few picked men went to work to provision water several boat preparatory to getting into water long boat be exception to arrangement stood on chock upon top of main hatch under ordinary circumstance be hoisted out by mean of yard tackle on fore main yard arm now however that foremast be destroyed be no longer possible to handle in way only plan suggested be to launch bodily off deck afterwards bailing out such water a must probably ship during operation be accordingly done very successfully in about two hour time boat be alongside with oar rowlock baler mast sail other gear complete a much provision water a there be room for after allowing space for necessary complement of passenger crew indiaman be well provided with boat so there be room for everybody without overcrowding while preparation have be going on captain chesney have be in cuddy stating condition of affair to passenger directing to prepare for forthcoming boat voyage by dressing in warmest clothing providing with such extra wrap a must be useful at night during severe weather also permitted to take small package of valuable with explaining at same time that must be prepared to throw overboard must boat prove to be dangerously deep in water must bad weather come on at length being ready process of embarkation in boat began gangway being used for purpose first of crew of long boat first cutter descended into respective boat stood by to receive other occupant long boat be particularly fine roomy craft with accommodation enough to take woman child in be now accordingly ushered down accommodation ladder being called by name by skipper who stood at gangway with list in hand ticked off by light of flame a person left ship be at starboard gangway meanwhile simcoe second mate at port gangway be receiving men who have be injured by lightning have set ship on fire be taken into second cutter full complement be made up with bachelor passenger a soon a two boat have received full number be ordered to pull away from ship far enough to allow two other boat to come to gangway in like manner quickly received human freight hauled off so work went on until everybody skipper have left ship gig with eight hand being at gangway to receive whole of fore part of ship to within few foot of main hatchway be by time roaring blazing fiery furnace flame of reached a high a main topmast head part of fore deck have fallen in heel of bowsprit have be consumed causing spar with attached to plunge into water under bow deck planking a far aft a gangway be almost unendurably hot to stand upon while small tongue of flame be constantly springing into existence here there about in most extraordinary way a timber ignited with intense heat there be consequently not moment to lose a captain chesney very rightly insisted upon being last to leave ship wasted time in making way down into gig be to command into have already passed few trap sextant skipper meanwhile have gone into cuddy to take final look round be absent nearly five minute be growing so anxious about be at point of leaving boat again to hunt up when appeared at head of gangway poor fellow seemed to be dreadfully cut up a allowed glance to wander fore aft noble ship now ablaze almost to spot upon stood with thick jet of black smoke little tongue of flame forcing way through seam at hundred different point have commanded vessel ever since left stock have conducted safely to fro over thousand of mile of ocean through fair weather foul have studied until have come to know quality that possessed good bad have taken pride in first found ample excuse for last have grown to love almost a man love wife child now moment have come when must abandon to devouring flame have already seared destroyed beauty be fast reducing to charred shapeless shell of blazing timber involuntarily a seemed to doffed cap a man might do in presence of dying standing there in gangway with figure in bold relief against glowing furnace of flame dense volume of heavy wreathing fire illumined smoke while eye seemed to wander hither thither about burning ship a though unable to drag away at fire burst through deck close to where stood fiery flake be falling thickly about mainmast be tottering ominously be obviously full time to be gone such hint be not to be ignored replacing cap upon head with one hand a dashed other across eye slowly descended ladder gave word to shove off men who have latterly be growing very anxious fidgety lost time in obeying order be none too soon for gig have barely left gangway when mainmast fell over side with loud crash fierce up darting of million of fiery spark followed by great spout of flame seemed to indicate that mast in falling have torn up considerable portion of deck poor skipper who have sunk down beside in stern sheet of boat shuddered violently heaved heavy gasping sigh a mainmast struck water close under boat stern raising splash nearly drenched to skin half minute must have be too late murmured with ghastly smile well continued so far a poor old ship be concerned duty be done there be still heavy responsibility resting upon inasmuch a that life of people depend almost exclusively upon judgment foresight put aboard long boat please chapter thirteen gig be caught in gale did a skipper have requested receiving young dumaresq into gig in place then several boat lay upon oar awaiting further order captain chesney seemed to be very reluctant even now to quit neighbourhood of burning ship therein considered that be displaying sound judgment for weather be still stark calm movement might make must have to be executed with oar must soon result in greatly fatiguing men without commensurate advantage moreover indiaman be now blazing beacon light from must be distinctly visible at distance of at least thirty forty mile in direction must be sure to attract attention must craft be in neighbourhood probably leading to steering in direction a soon a breeze must spring up in case might hope to be picked up that be in mind be evident for presently summoned boat about pointed out to occupant possibility of rescue by remaining in neighbourhood of burning ship then went on to say reckoning at noon showed that be then a have since remained seven hundred twenty mile south west by south from island of corvo one of azores be nearest land there be small town called rosario upon island where if can reach have doubt can obtain succour therefore intend to steer for corvo not only for reason have mentioned also because most homeward bound ship endeavour to make azores therefore stand very good chance of being picked up at moment now gentleman of who be in charge of boat will be pleased to remember that course be north east by north distance seven hundred twenty mile will also be pleased to remember that boat be to keep company a long a weather will permit unless otherwise ordered by now a intend to make start until to morrow morning have better arrange watch in boat secure rest that can very sensible recommendation be at once adopted round a far a gig be concerned sleep appeared to be out of question strong glare of light from burning ship although boat have hauled off to distance of fully mile from still more novelty excitement of situation seeming to have completely banished slumber from eyelid at length toward two o'clock in morning by time indiaman have become mere shell of ship blazing furnace from stem to stern light breeze sprang up from north north east almost dead in teeth for voyage to azores order be passed along for boat to set sail make short reach for purpose of maintaining position near ship be done then only bad quality that boat appeared to posse rapidly declared be one staunch well built finely modelled boat excellently adapted for work in respect save one in present case be of very great importance keel be so willow that have grip of water result of be that a quickly discovered must not turn to windward gig have be built with especial eye to speed be least serious offender in respect indeed so long a water remained managed to hold own with trifle to spare long boat probably from size superior depth of body came next others sagged away to leeward from first despite utmost effort of in charge consequently in order to remain in company be obliged to bear up run down to within hour from moment of making sail be mile to leeward of ship with steady freshening of breeze continued to increase distance from day at length broke disclosing sea ruffled to hue of purest sapphire flecked with little ridge of snowy foam by whipping of now fresh breeze under sky of blue dappled with small wool like white cloud came sailing up squadron after squadron out of north east at speed told of fiery breeze in higher reach of atmosphere sharp look out for gleaming canvas of passing ship be at once instituted without result about hour later skipper who be short distance to leeward of waved to close when have done so long boat gig ran down in company to other boat in succession captain chesney ordering a passed to follow until finally found near jolly boat be most leewardly boat of little flotilla then closed round long boat have be hove to skipper standing up in stern sheet addressed gentleman said be a may well imagine great disappointment to to discover that boat exhibit such very poor weatherly quality since render plain that unless something can be done to improve in respect will be useless for to think of carrying out original plan of making for azores in teeth of present foul wind plan have occurred to that may possibly have effect of helping boat to go to windward must like to try if answer well good if doe not be afraid there will be nothing for for to try for canary be considerably further away from than azores also lie much further to southward consequently afford better chance with wind a now be now a to plan for helping boat to turn to windward be fitted with bottom board be of opinion that if triangular bottom board in stern sheet be suspended over lee side amidships by mean of short length of line bent on to two of corner arrangement will serve a lee board boat will go to windward although speed may be slightly decreased at event must like to give plan trial so get bottom board rigged at once gentleman if please somewhat after fashion of affair have arranged so saying skipper exhibited long boat board fitted to serve a lee board forthwith dropped over side secured by couple of stout lanyard other end of be made fast to boat thwart appeared to require little arranging leeway of boat pressing close to side retaining there in proper position other boat be not long in following skipper example five minute sufficed to get lee board into action then squadron hauled wind with object of beating back to neighbourhood of ship value of captain chesney idea soon became apparent for in le than hour have reached far enough to windward to enable to fetch ship on next tack did not go about for just at time wreck burnt to water edge suddenly disappeared leaving trace of late presence dense cloud of mingled steam smoke gradually swept away to leeward astern of boat be on starboard tack be kept so throughout day that being leg upon must do best with wind a then be at noon observation of sun be secured skipper having chronometer chart with showed that be eleven mile nearer to destination than have be when left ship be great slice out of distance of more than seven hundred mile be by mean discouraging taking into consideration distance that have lost during night a for passenger particularly woman child be in wonderfully good spirit seeming to regard boat voyage rather a pleasure trip than serious matter that really be breeze continuing to freshen at length became necessary for long boat to haul down reef in order that might not outsail run away from remainder of flotilla despite everybody be most strenuous effort boat manifested decided disposition to become widely scattered be only by faster sailers heaving to occasionally that sluggard be enabled to keep in company proved so serious obstacle to progress just before sunset long boat again displayed signal to close when have done so skipper informed that in view of great difference in sailing power of several boat withdrew prohibition a to parting company that from moment boat must be at liberty to do best that must for appeared to that be most sensible decision to arrive at since taking into account long distance to be traversed determination to regulate progress of entire squadron by of slowest boat must necessarily entail very serious lengthening of period of exposure privation for in faster boat sail be accordingly made by long boat ourselves when darkness closed down upon scene gig be leading by about mile long boat coming next remainder stringing out astern at distance varying from three quarter of mile to twice a far must not be supposed on first day in boat novelty of situation caused to feel indifferent to possibility of sail heaving in sight on contrary one man in boat be told off for especial purpose of keeping look out for one felt to be serious misfortune up to nightfall nothing have be sighted for to tell whole truth regarded possibility of reaching corvo canary a mighty problematical trusting for eventual rescue very much more to chance of falling in with ship being picked up about eight bell of second dog watch wind have be gradually freshening day freshened still more piping up occasionally in so squally fashion deemed prudent to again haul down reef by midnight have become necessary to take in second reef sky having clouded over with thick rather dirty look to windward while wind came along in such heavy puff staunch boat a be gig have work cut out at time to keep lee gunwale above water moreover short steep choppy sea have be raised that proved very trying to boat driving sharp stem viciously into throwing frequent heavy shower of spray over that not only drenched to skin also necessitated continuous use of baler fortunately be not very greatly crowded so that despite weight of party that of provision water boat be fairly buoyant shipped nothing heavier than spray heart ached a thought of poor woman child cooped up in long boat pictured to myself too probable piteous condition of cold wet misery a night wore on weather grew steadily worse morning at length dawned upon hove to under close reefed canvas with strong gale blowing high steep dangerous sea running there be prospect that there be worse to come for sun rose a pale wan shapeless blot of sickly light faintly showing through veil of dim grey watery vapour streaked with light coloured patch of tattered scud swept athwart louring sky at furious rate while sea have that greenish turbid appearance be often noticeable a precursor of bad weather none of other boat be anywhere near so far a must be made out one of men be still standing on thwart steadying by mast looking for when suddenly made heart leap pulse quicken by flinging out right arm pointing vehemently a yelled sail ho couple of point on lee bowl ship sir steerin large under to'gallant sail let get look at answered a clawed way forward noticing with consternation a did so that despite continuous baling have be kept up water be fully three inch deep in bottom of boat that lower tier of provision be in consequence most probably spoiled man having first carefully pointed out to exact direction in be to look for stranger climbed down off thwart so made room for to take place immediately did yes there be precisely a man have said full rigged ship scudding under topgallant sail be fully seven maybe nearer eight mile away although rather on lee bow at moment when first sighted in consequence of gig having just then come to be in reality still trifle to windward of of course be utterly useless to hope that must by mean at disposal attract attention at distance a looked almost despairingly at noticed that did not appear to be travelling very fast occurred to that there be just ghost of chance that by bearing up running away to leeward upon course converging obliquely upon own might be able to intercept if not that might at least be able to approach nearly enough to make seen be worth attempting thought for even though in event of failure must find in end many mile more distant from corvo than then be attached little importance to conviction now being stronger than ever that only hope of deliverance lay in being picked up rather than in being able to reach azores other land noting carefully therefore bearing of stranger especially fact that appeared to be running dead to leeward with squared yard made way aft again took tiller watched for favourable opportunity succeeded in getting gig before wind without shipping very much water once fairly before wind boat be able to bear considerably greater spread of canvas than while hove to indeed increase of sail immediately became imperative necessity in order to avoid being caught pooped by sea moreover have to catch that ship if must therefore shook out couple of reef then went to breakfast treating to a good meal a circumstance must permit gig being double ended modelled somewhat after fashion of whale boat scudded well no longer shipped water condition therefore be greatly improved running before gale a now be strength of wind be not so severely felt did chill of blast penetrate saturated clothing so cruelly a while be hove to clothes gradually dried upon baled out boat in course of hour so began to experience something approaching return to comfort meanwhile at frequent interval bearing distance of strange sail be ascertained spirit rose a with observation chance of ultimately succeeding in intercepting grew more promising result of observation however be unwelcome discovery that stranger be travelling at considerably faster pace than have at first credited with that only nicest most accurate judgment with regard to own course must enable to close with that in however be not sufficient to occasion very grave anxiety for have whole day before what have most greatly to fear be further increase in strength of wind unhappily there be only too much reason to dread that might happen if indeed be not in process of happening already for sky astern be rapidly assuming blacker wilder appearance while be unquestionable that sea be increasing in height breaking more heavily last be serious misfortune for in double sense for on one hand increased danger of boat being pooped while on other materially reduced progress low sail becoming almost completely becalmed boat way slackening time that settled into hollow of sea so greatly did retard that at length despite undeniable fact that gale be increasing shook out last reef attempted hazardous experiment of scudding under whole canvas for short time did fairly well although heart be in mouth time a boat soared upward to crest of sea blast struck with furious sweep filling sail with jerk threatened to take mast out of taxing skill to utmost to prevent from broaching to capsizing must not do be altogether too dangerous experiment to be continued be no longer question of skill in handling of boat be tempting providence courting disaster for wind be freshening rapidly so have to haul down reef again even after have done seemed to be scarcely better off than before meanwhile however in midst of peril anxiety have satisfactory assurance that be steadily nearing ship for have risen until when gig happened to be simultaneously hove up on crest of unusually heavy sea must catch glimpse not only of whole of canvas also of sweep of rail throughout length might now hope that at moment keen eyed sailor might notice tiny sail call attention to nay there be just possibility that have happened already for presently became aware that ship have taken in topgallant sail of course might mean nothing more than mere ordinary precaution on part of commander anxious to avoid springing of spar might also point to conclusion that momentary doubtful glimpse of have be caught by somebody that officer of watch while sceptical of belief have shortened sail for time to afford opportunity for further investigation whichever might happen to be improved prospect of eventual rescue be glad thankful accordingly question now uppermost in mind be whether have have not be seen by anyone on board ship of felt convinced that have wish doubtless being father to thought for own part be exceedingly doubtful for a rule to however most shameful dastardly exception have come under own notice sailor be always most eager to help distressed brother even at cost of very great personal inconvenience peril knowing believed have only momentary exceedingly doubtful view of be caught step must at once have be taken on board ship to further test matter one for instance must probably have be sent aloft to get more extended view of ocean surface nay be by mean unlikely that officer might have taken duty upon have searched ocean with aid of telescope in of case must soon have be discovered when sight of small boat battling for life against rapidly increasing gale already extremely dangerous sea must doubtless have resulted in ship hauling wind to rescue nothing of kind however happened continued perilous run to leeward upon course be slowly converging upon of ship with feeling of growing doubt angry despair at blindness of whom be pursuing rapidly displacing high hope have be aroused in heart at first sight of thrice welcome ship held steadily on way that must do be to follow with wind smiting down upon more fiercely minute while succeeding wave a overtook curled angry hissing crest more menacingly above stern of deeply laden boat be wild reckless desperate bit of boat sailing conviction rapidly grew upon that must not last much longer must soon be compelled to abandon pursuit succumb to catastrophe momentarily threatened if must hold out long enough to attract attention of blind bat yonder might yet be well when at length desperate race have carried to within about two half mile of ship occasional glimpse of whole of hull must be caught when be at same instant hove up on ridge of sea there be perceptible indication that have be seen by anybody aboard there be truck flag halliard fitted to mast of gig consequently have mean of hoisting signal even if have possessed such mean must probably have be useless because if sleepy lubber have not noticed sail exhibition of comparatively small flag must hardly be likely to attract attention be still in midst of anxious discussion a to what must possibly do to make ourselves seen when end came to pursuit furious squall of wind rain swooped down upon there be crash mast thwart unable to endure additional strain thrown upon gave way mast lurched forward went over bow sail at same moment unusually heavy sea overtook broke in over boat stern filled half way to thwart thought now that be over with fully expecting that next sea must also break aboard completely swamp boat leave to swim for few brief agonising moment then to vanish for ever yet with never slumbering instinct of self preservation put tiller hard over a crest of wave swept forward then frantically threw out oar over stern with to sweep boat round head to sea how be achieved know not to day so furious strength did throw into work actually succeeded in almost accomplishing object be to say got boat so far round that when next wave met bluff of starboard bow be presented to although more water came aboard be not sufficient to very materially enhance peril of situation meanwhile rest of occupant seized baler bucket that somebody have be thoughtful enough to throw into boat when preparation be being made to leave burning indiaman cap even hoot first thing in fact that came handy began baling for life chapter fourteen shadow of death mast sail of boat have gone clean over bow into water must in probability have be lost to for fact that shroud still held being case boat rode to a to sort of floating anchor keeping stem on to sea trim be such that bow be considerably more above water than stern may have have something to do with fact that although sea be now higher more dangerous than ever water no longer broke into dumaresq however be of opinion that floating mast with sail attached served in measure a breakwater for sea to expend most dangerous energy upon after discussing matter little further be determined to submit theory to test of experiment shroud be accordingly unbent mast hauled alongside when boat again began to ship water moreover oar over stern at once became necessary to keep bow on to sea experiment satisfied that impression be something more than mere fancy at once went to work to further test there be six oar in boat portion of equipment be painter six fathom in length securely lashed together whole six of oar mast with sail still attached in sort of bundle by middle using end of painter a lashing when everything have be made secure veered away painter until whole of be out bundle of oar what not be floating about five fathom ahead of boat served a drag again bringing gig bow on to sea comparatively short period of observation sufficed to convince that arrangement did indeed serve also a appreciable protection to boat by time that be done rain have nearly ceased presently cleared up to leeward revealing ship once more under double reefed topsail now broad on larboard quarter hopelessly beyond possibility of being overtaken even have dared to resume chase after recent experience in face of terrible weather none of dreamed of attempting be cruelly bitter disappointment to to reflect that have be so near to possibility of rescue yet have missed caught rumbling note of more than one sea blessing invoked upon head of crew who ought to have seen apparently did not be useless however to cry over spilt milk to murmur against mysterious decree of providence business now be to do lay in power to keep boat afloat enable to ride out gale so baled dry trimmed trifle more by stern to enable to present bolder bow to sea then piped to dinner now arose fresh cause for distress apprehension for when came to look into state of provision be found that pretty nearly everything be spoilable have be ruined by salt water that have shipped bread especially being almost reduced to pulp picked out least damaged portion however ate with chunk of raw salt beef washing down whole with sparing libation of weak grog after felt in somewhat better spirit oh cold misery of be drenched to skin wind seemed to penetrate to very marrow moreover there be hope of slightest improvement so long a gale continued for even though rain have ceased air be full of spindrift scud water fell upon in drenching shower while cooped up a be within circumscribed dimension of small boat there be possibility of warming by exercise active movement of sort sea be running too dangerously high to admit of taking to oar keeping warm by expedient that must do to mitigate misery be to huddle closely together in bottom of boat so shield a far a possible from piercing wind drenching spray have be able to smoke matter must not have be so bad with have mean of obtaining light so there crouched hour after hour teeth clenched chattering with cold drenched clothing clinging to shivering body gale howling over head with ever increasing fury while sheet of salt spray lashed relentlessly like whip of steel so utterly miserable did become at length even ceased to rise occasionally to take look round to see whether perchance sail might have hove in sight believe that of companion in suffering found temporary refuge from wretchedness in short snatch of fitful sleep at event caught at interval sound of low muttering a of sleeping men a for exhausted though be must not sleep anxiety on behalf of poor wretch who be in way under command who be certainly dependent to great extent upon experience judgment seemed to have driven sleep for ever from eye so lay there hour after hour now flung aloft until whole ocean to limit of horizon lay spread around anon sweeping down back of giant billow until seemed that boat be about to plunge to ocean bed passage of hour be marked by increasing greyness haggardness in face of companion while more hopelessly despairing expression came into eye at length however shortly before sunset welcome break appeared in sky to windward gleam of watery yellow light spread along horizon pall of murky vapour broke up into detached mass small gradually widening patch of blue sky appeared here here finally got momentary glimpse of sun through break in cloud just a great luminary be on point of sinking below western horizon greeted blessed sight with cheer of reviving hope for knew that gale be breaking that with moderating of wind sea must once again be able to take active step toward preservation while apart from that finer weather must at least afford relief from present suffering misery about hour later there be noticeable diminution in strength of wind by midnight have become merely moderate breeze sea no longer broke dangerously sky cleared star beamed benignantly down upon there be prospect of being able to resume voyage on morrow although so far a weather be concerned matter be greatly improving with suffering from cold be still very acute for night wind seemed to penetrate right through wet clothes to strike colder than ice upon skin be now burning with fever a for envied more fortunate companion who be able to sleep be deadly weary worn out with prolonged watching anxiety exposure eye be burning head throbbing with fever consumed while teeth be chattering with cold to extent must scarcely make speech intelligible wild fantastic irrelevant fancy be whirling confusedly through brain found simply impossible to fix mind upon important question of direction in ought to steer upon resumption of voyage for impression now forced upon that poor captain chesney have committed error of judgment in adhering to determination to make for azores after breeze have sprung up from direction placed island almost dead to windward only alternative of making for canary appeared to be open to same objection although in considerably lesser degree then arose question if be mistaken in thus deciding what ought to have done to in then disordered condition of mental faculty must find satisfactory reply at length while mentally groping for solution to knotty problem sank into feverish semi somnolent condition eventually merged into sleep when again became conscious sun be flashing first beam across surface of heaving water now no longer scourged to fury by lashing of gale just ruffled to deep tender blue by gentle breathing of soft breeze from north east very heavy swell be still running of course no longer broke there be nothing whatever to prevent resuming voyage at once saving question whither matter however called for first most imperative attention be own condition be still suffering greatly from effect of prolonged exposure in still damp clothes must hope for little amelioration until garment be once more dry healthy action of skin restored so to facilitate suggested that must strip spread out clothing to thoroughly dry in sun now ardent beam while drying process be in progress must go overboard indulge in good swim greater portion of party thought advice good enough to be acted upon in few minute seven of be in water swimming vigorously round boat other three be unable to swim imitated so far a to strip pour bucket of water over other water felt pleasantly warm in comparison with temperature of air remained overboard for nearly hour then scrambled back into boat again rubbed ourselves other vigorously with palm of hand while body be in process of being dried by joint action of sun air finally donned clothes again being by time quite dry feeling much refreshed in way considerably better for bath next business be to go to breakfast bread be by time so completely destroyed a to be quite uneatable therefore threw overboard made meagre unpalatable meal off more raw salt beef washed down a before with weak grog while meal be in progress brought up question have be vexing during previous night namely direction in must steer have be giving matter best consideration during time have be overboard indeed dumaresq have be discussing together a swam industriously round round boat agreed in conclusion that appearance of sky warranted belief that be on very margin of north east trade wind if not actually within influence if be indeed case appeared that proper course for to adopt must be to bear up run for west indie instead of attempting to reach azores even canary for while corvo be only seven hundred twenty mile from spot where indiaman be destroyed while teneriffe be about thirteen hundred eighty mile saint thomas in west indie fifteen hundred mile from same spot must reckon with tolerable certainty upon reaching latter island in about twelve day if breeze now blowing actually happened to be young trade wind while under same supposition be exceedingly doubtful when if ever must succeed in reaching azores canary island be altogether too momentous question for to settle off hand upon own responsibility so laid matter before whole boat company inviting to decide by preponderating vote found that majority agreed with in opinion that might be on fringe of if not actually within influence of trade wind when came to question of bearing up running for west indie great distance to be traversed seemed to frighten be hardly prepared to face prospect of nearly fortnight in open boat even although might reckon with tolerable certainty upon fair wind moderate weather time pointed out that stock of provision be wholly inadequate for such voyage unless be prepared to go upon exceedingly short allowance forthwith appeared to consider by adhering to captain chesney plan must stand better chance of falling in with being picked up by ship a to whether must make for azores canary be pretty unanimously of opinion that despite much greater distance of latter if be a supposed within influence of trade wind must stand much better chance of fetching after further discussion be definitely determined to shape best course must for teneriffe important matter settled that have to do be to lash mast thwart in place again haul mast oar alongside get inboard make sail did forthwith for next five day sailed comfortably enough to eastward making on average about eighty five mile in twenty four hour during not single sail have be sighted then wind gradually died away fell stark calm obliged to take to oar whereas during gale have suffered greatly from cold wet complaint now be of intense heat for cloud have passed away leaving sky vault of purest blue out of sun blazed down upon relentlessly for about eleven hour out of twenty four coupled with exertion at oar possibly profuse perspiration induced thereby provoked continuous thirst have mean of satisfying for immediately upon determination to make for teneriffe have carefully gauged stock of provision water have placed ourselves upon very short allowance of to make matter still worse setting in of calm immediately rendered imperatively necessary to still further reduce already far too scanty allowance there be nothing for however to toil on hour after hour with ever decreasing strength only redeeming feature of case being knowledge must now chance to sight ship must not possibly sail away from so long a calm lasted when calm have continued for twenty four hour during pulled continuously to eastward relieving other at frequent interval reflection almost ceased to afford comfort for found that short common hard work together be exhausting strength with such alarming rapidity that unless sighted hoped for sail pretty speedily must have strength left with to pull to when twelve hour have passed over head cloudless breathless blazing morning have dawned upon men with one accord laid in oar protesting utter inability to longer keep up exhausting work of pulling boat argued with entreated threatened alternately without avail turned deaf ear to lay down in bottom of boat where almost instantly fell into restless troubled sleep be to say except dumaresq who recognised a clearly a did vital necessity for to push onward a speedily a possible after discussing situation for while therefore threw over couple of oar placing boat compass between foot where must see paddled wearily painfully onward until noon when ceased that might have opportunity to take observation for determination of latitude while be still engaged upon operation men awoke a soon a have ascertained latitude went to dinner if dinner must be called consisted of small cube of raw meat measuring about inch way a much tepid fetid water a must half fill neck of rum bottle have be broken off from body to serve a measure after dinner men again stretched out either in bottom of boat on thwart once more sought surcease of suffering in sleep again dumaresq threw out oar toiled at until sunset be cruel work nothing short of such urgent necessity a ours must have induced to do then men awoke again apparently somewhat refreshed by day rest went to supper fact that dumaresq have be working at oar through scorching day while have be sleeping seemed to awaken sense of shame in of after supper took to oar of own accord announcing determination to rest henceforth through day to work night plan be at once compelled to admit have much to recommend so while men pulled pretty steadily on through night dumaresq took watch watch at tiller breathless morning dawned went to breakfast men then lay down to sleep a on previous day while dumaresq laboured at oar until noon when gallant young frenchman be compelled to give up declaring that must not pull stroke even though life depended upon must of course hing single handed so after dinner lay down together sleep of utter exhaustion soon fell upon when next awoke men be already astir getting supper appeared to from look in face that must have be better pleased have dumaresq remained asleep after supper threw out oar frenchman sat together in stern sheet moodily discussing situation marvelling at strange ill fortune in having sighted one solitary sail ever since destruction of indiaman fact be remarked dumaresq in low tone that have made terrible mistake in deciding to try for teneriffe ought to have acted upon suggestion to bear away for west indie have done so must have be more than half way there by time if indeed have not already be fallen in with picked up a be be now clear enough that if a believed be on edge of trade wind have lost again may be many day before will get breeze must be case be belief that not one of will ever see dry land again note condition at moment observe companion when abandoned ill fated manilla be stout sturdy crew of willing obedient men whilst now be gang of gaunt savage outlaw no longer amenable to discipline rendered ferociously selfish by starvation did observe fell gleam of animosity with regarded when awoke evening helped ourselves to share of provision there have be hint of violence thus far mark word bowen unless be rescued within next forty eight hour boat will become scene of ghastly tragedy ah mon dieu look at dumaresq have brought lip close to ear while speaking accompanying turn of head have permitted eye to glance over shoulder into water astern of boat a uttered closing exclamation pointed to boat wake there not two fathom away from rudder must be seen two large shark form clearly indicated in phosphorescent water steadily following boat swimming at distance of about three foot below water what did say continued dumaresq shadow of death be hovering over boat shark see will follow until get prey chapter fifteen dying of hunger thirst must confess that sudden appearance of two ferocious monster of deep excited within feeling of intense horror uneasiness for have heard so much about alleged mysterious instinct by shark be said to be enabled to foresee approaching death of one more member of crew have listened to so many apparently authentic story confirming belief in creature power have grown to be quite prepared to believe that there might be something more than mere superstition at bottom of now almost appeared a though be to have opportunity of learning by personal experience what amount of truth there really be in gruesome theory after first shock of horror have passed reason common sense whispered that presence of visitor instead of being constant horror menace to might by good luck be converted into valuable source of food supply accordingly at once informed men that there be two shark following inquired whether of must suggest plan for capture of one of fish immediately discovered however must have done better to have said nothing for announcement excited utmost consternation while proposal to attempt capture of one of fish be ridiculed a something approaching height of absurdity tom hardy weather beaten seaman who have be knocking about in part of world for thirty year from time when first plunged hand into tar bucket at age of fourteen at once rose from thwart where be pulling stroke oar looking over head of dumaresq stared intently down at fish for few second then resumed seat remarking ay mate what mr bowen say be true enough there be two of 'em mean that two of here party be goin ' to lose number of mess afore long mark word see if come true a to catchin ' of shark why have got hook to catch with if have 'twould be of use to try fish ai to be caught be astarn of for purpose there will stay until purpose have come to pas have knowed sort of thing to happen afore be once aboard of brig called black snake hailin ' from liverpool tradin ' between west injies guinea coast 'd made fine run across from barbadoes be within week run of old calabar river when fell calm with just a have done now there be nothing matter with none of at time a'ter 'd be becalmed about week let tell ye mate ai nothing so very much out of common in latitoods second mate fell sick took to bunk have be there not two hour when somebody sings out a there be shark under counter go to work to try catch mate be to be

so much a look at well be obliged to give up at last a be haulin ' in line unbendin ' hook heard chief mate say to skipper settle poor hobbs hash anyhow how d mean ' say skipper short angry like why say mate mean that hobbs wo get better that shark know be just waitin ' for ' oh nonsense ' say skipper be surprised mr barker to hear hintelligent man like sayin ' such thing march off down below go into second mate cabin to see how poor chap be gettin ' on about twenty minute a'terwards come up on deck again tell mate a poor mr hobbs have got yaller fever mate take notice that skipper be just then lookin ' so extra well about hour a'terwards go below again by by steward come for'ard lookin ' pretty frightened can tell ye say a skipper be sick too wonder whether there be shark come for a

more be a managed to reach sand hill alive weird story told with impressiveness of man who knew to be speaking truth emphasised a be by persistent presence of two remorseless brute under own stern affected listener powerfully at close there be not one of will venture to say be firmly convinced that at least two of party be doomed continued pulling to eastward until nearly midnight night relieving other at oar at short interval when suddenly one of men peter green by name dropped oar with choking cry rolled off thwart fell prone into bottom of boat place be immediately taken by within quarter of hour man too be obliged to give up so one after other succumbed until only dumaresq be left have not be tugging at oar five minute when frenchman cried be good mon ami be gastados ' a spaniard say be expended worn out rose to foot staggered heavily aft sank down in stern sheet with groan gasping cry of water water for love of god give mouthful of water will die poor fellow have of course be receiving same allowance a rest of small quantity of putrid fluid now remaining in bottom of breaker be of such priceless value must not give more without inflicting grievous injustice injury upon rest nevertheless must not sit there see die so drew single allowance from cask explaining to men a well a own parched throat must allow must forego own allowance next time that be due raising head poured into mouth bitterly grudging drop be ashamed to say a did so there be only enough to just moisten cracked lip dry black tongue such a be seemed to revive somewhat squeezing hand gratefully settled more comfortably on thwart presently appeared to sink into state of semi unconsciousness that perhaps partially served in place of sleep must gladly have followed example if must be impossible stubborn constitution seemed to defy destructive wear tear of prolonged hunger thirst suffering be beyond power of language to portray craving hunger be so intense that believe must have eaten enjoyed food however revolting must have obtained while thirst be so overpowering that be with utmost difficulty combated temptation to open vein moisten parched burning tongue throat with own blood equally difficult be to resist temptation to take long cool satisfying draught of salt water lapped so tantalisingly against side of boat shimmered so temptingly in starlight around knew what consequence of such act must be by resolute exercise of will power remaining to contrived to overcome longing yet so excruciating be torment that felt must do something to alleviate even though alleviation be to be of briefest therefore determined to try experiment stripping off clothing plunged garment one by one into water alongside until be saturated when donned again cool wet contact of with dry burning skin seemed to afford relief to tormenting thirst encouraged by small measure of success next cut strip of leather from one of boot dividing into small piece placed one at time in mouth masticating a well a must finally swallowing will perhaps convey to reader idea of intensity of hunger when say that actually enjoyed piece of leather that unendurable craving for food be in appreciable degree appeased by to extent sufficient indeed to enable to lie down actually fall asleep remember that dream night be of feasting drinking of profusion of appetising viand choice wine spread upon long table that stood under welcome shadow of umbrageous tree close to border of sparkling stream of sweet crystal clear water when awoke sun be again rising above horizon into sky of fleckless blue reflected by ocean of glassy calm unbroken by faintest discoverable suggestion of flaw of wind anywhere upon mirror like surface companion be also stirring of contenting by merely grasping gunwale of boat so raising body that must look round for moment then sinking back with moan of despair at sight of breathless calm blank horizon while others two three whose strength still sufficed for extra effort painfully raised upon foot scanned horizon with longer more searching gaze for sail there be nothing to be seen however in whole visible stretch of ocean save fin of two shark haunted so remorselessly so with inarticulate muttering of despair hoarse broken curse at ill fortune so persistently dogged prepared to devour last insignificant ration of food consume last

order discipline obedience indeed be at end distinction of rank no longer existed ordinary restraint of civilisation be discarded frightful situation have reduced to condition of wild beast entreaty that matter might be dealt with in something like judicial form might a well have be urged upon empty air there be not much difficulty in identifying culprit be welshman named evans poor pitiful sneaking creature one of under steward belonging to manilla who have systematically shirked share of work done best to evade share of hardship from very first although when taxed with crime at first strenuously denied manner belied word presently flung upon knee with tear protestation of inability to resist temptation have suddenly come upon acknowledged theft abjectly besought forgiveness very much doubt whether in then frame of mind must have be induced to forgive miserable creature certainly have desire to inflict punishment upon beyond what must derive from undisguised expression of contempt abhorrence not so more immediate companion however evans have sooner confessed than with hoarse howl of fury self constituted judge whipped out sheath knife while in paroxysm of terror wretched steward leapt to foot hastily retreated forward shrieking for men followed ere must intervene there be scuffle rapid rain of blow smothered groan splash alongside next instant welshman head reappeared above water about fathom away from boat face grey distorted with fear skinny hand outstretched in vain endeavour to reach gunwale of boat then almost in self same instant before one benumbed sens found time to realise ghastly tragedy there be rapid swirl of water alongside ear splitting yell miserable man be dragged down ensanguined patch in deep crystalline blue few transitory air bubble alone marking spot from have vanished involuntarily glanced astern there be one shark fin now visible shame upon men shame upon cried emerging from temporary trance of stupefaction seemed to have seized while frightful tragedy be in progress have taken human life branded yourselves a murderer for what simply because poor craven of fellow appropriated small morsel of putrid meat few

sky with gesture eloquent of frantic despairing appeal poor tortured creature suddenly collapsed fell senseless athwart gunwale of boat with arm hanging down into water dragged quickly inboard again be not second too soon for have scarcely done so when remaining shark be alongside glaring up at with look of fell longing in cruel goggle eye of seemed to say intended to have prey sooner later although have baulked of for present dreadful exhaustion of reaction from late excitement now seized upon rest of one by one wearily sank down again into respective place in boat then told men by what mean have obtained temporary relief during night advising to try same method presently be sitting in wet clothes ravenously chewing away upon strip of shoe leather nobody thought of again having recourse to oar indeed strength have now so completely melted away that doubt very much whether single man in whole of boat company saving perhaps must have laid out oar unaided blazing hot breathless day lagged slowly along hour seeming to spin out to more intolerable length than last with moment suffering grew more nearly unbearable until toward evening seemed to be going mad for most fantastic idea went crowding through whirling brain now then caught muttering most utter nonsense now laughing now weeping moaning like child anon found kneeling in stern sheet supporting body upon one arm a gesticulated with other while apostrophising that demon shark be there two of again three remember laughing to myself uproariously noticing at same time with sort of wonder what wild eldritch gibbering laugh be at thought of how shark yes there be three be certain of must jostle hustle other in greedy haste to get at be to simply stand up topple over gunwale into water how easily how ridiculously easily might do too laughed again at absurdity of taking so much trouble enduring such frightful extremity of suffering to preserve life might be so readily got rid of wondered dully why have be so foolish a to go through when might be put end to in single moment why asked must remain longer in boat with great red flaming eye staring so mercilessly down upon out of brazen sky when laughing blue water smiled so temptingly up into eye wooed to cool embrace there must be no more hunger thirst down there relentless sun to torment century after century by darting fiery beam down upon uncovered head through hissing seething brain plunge misery must be at end must make that plunge must seek cool cerulean depth must ah have forgotten devil what be waiting for be growing

strange to say no longer felt hungry craving for food be gone place be more than supplied by increased agony of thirst seared vitals a with fire lip be dry cracked tongue felt shrivelled hard in mouth tried to speak to dumaresq who be lying in bottom of boat with glazed eye turned up at star must give utterance only to husky hissing sound there be movement on part of of form be dimly discernable huddled up in bottom of boat whether be dead only asleep knew not cared life everything connected with have lost interest for be dying knew longed only for end to come might be delivered out of misery

gradually however very gradually twilight brightened with returning life reason found beginning to identify surroundings became conscious of rhythmical rising falling swaying movement accompanied by creaking grinding sound wash gurgle of water outside planking formed two of three wall of triangular apartment in found somehow recognised movement sound a familiar then heard voice at distance shouting something must not distinguish answered by two three voice almost immediately overhead there be noise of rope being thrown down upon planking further outcry of voice accompanied by creaking

not sleeping very heavily for awoke at first call came to side of bunk at once perceived that be not man have before seen fellow voice manner be surly in extreme a bent over gruffly demanded in scarcely comprehensible french patois what wanted answered in french must like something to eat drink whereupon produced from sort of cupboard in darkest corner of forecastle bowl large can of soup together with wooden tray of flinty biscuit old iron spoon pouring liberal quantity of soup into bowl plunging spoon into handed to placed bread barge within reach again composed to sleep soup be quite cold surface be covered with floating lump of congealed grease nevertheless after rejecting grease consumed whole of soup together with about biscuit felt very much better for by by watch be called heard men swarming up from 'tween deck abaft forecastle presently pock marked friend of repulsive countenance kindly eye descended into forecastle to relief of surly dog who have handed soup thought must be good opportunity to learn something with regard to character of craft on board found also to obtain insight into circumstance under be picked up therefore proceeded to put few question to new comer by mean of elicited following information from vessel have picked up be privateer schooner jean bart of morlaix commanded by captain henri renouf exceptionally brave skilful seaman must appear if story of success a told by rene ollivier be to be believed indeed if understood guileless rene aright be chiefly if not wholly due to success rather one result of extreme short handedness of jean bart caused by loss sustained in recent engagement captain henri renouf have troubled to rescue in first place afterwards to issue order effort must be made to restore to health strength being intention to make good of loss by enrolling a member of crew little further questioning on part resulted in discovery that have be picked up four hour previously to return to consciousness boat having be sighted right ahead at daybreak after springing up of breeze have followed period of calm of unprecedented duration in experience of on board jean bart eight of have be found in boat of whom six still exhibited faint sign of life six have be domiciled in schooner forecastle simply placed in charge of two of crew vessel not carrying surgeon to recover not a fate might decide upon learning from friend rene date upon have be picked up made little calculation by arrived at conclusion must have lain absolutely unconscious in boat something like thirty hour during one of number have mysteriously disappeared probably by jumping overboard in fit of delirium during conversation with ollivier dumaresq awoke joined in upon assisted by repulsive looking really sympathetic french seaman contrived to get out of bunk reach chest alongside dumaresq bunk be much gratified to find that gallant young fellow although still terribly weak be making satisfactory progress further research resulted in discovery that saved from gig be in addition to dumaresq tom hardy peter green henry anstey philip sendell four of whom be thorough staunch british seaman who except when driven mad by hunger thirst be to be implicitly depended upon be very great relief to to find so many of have survived for apart from other consideration foresaw that if captain renouf intention towards be such a ollivier have stated to be complication be likely to arise of such character that strongest possible mutual support must be necessary to enable to face mere fact that fellow renouf have in so off handed manner arranged destiny of six of fellow creature without even formality of consulting in matter rendered exceedingly uneasy such proceeding seeming to indicate headstrong overbearing exacting character with must be exceedingly difficult to deal of course so far a dumaresq be concerned arrangement be not so objectionable must probably be quite willing to work passage to next port with who be english be quite matter worst that renouf have right to do be to treat a prisoner of war to impress into enemy service must simply be outrage yet be not infrequently done not only by french also by own countryman before further development be possible however must be necessary for to become well strong again there be always hope that before time must have arrived jean bart might fall in with enemy be captured hope however be not destined to be fulfilled on third day after recovery of sens being once more well strong enough to move about determined to take bull by horn forthwith with purpose sent message aft by ollivier to captain renouf expressing desire to personally thank for rescue of survivor of boat crew to make arrangement for obtaining parole by way of reply to received curt intimation captain renouf be in cabin be to proceed thereto forthwith in response to summons at once mounted to deck for first time flinging keen hurried glance about found be on board slashing schooner fifty sixty ton bigger than dolphin be tremendously beamy craft flush decked fore aft be armed with ten twelve pounder in broadside battery with thirty two pounder between mast truly formidable craft of kind be evident moreover that be manned in accordance with armament for watch on deck although did not stay to count mustered fully forty men a ruffianly looking set of scoundrel a ever set eye on glance over side showed that vessel be regular flier for although there be moderate breeze blowing craft be close hauled be going along at pace of fully nine knot so smart vessel so heavily armed manned ought to have be pride of captain must detect trace of such feeling deck being dark with dirt while general air of slovenliness pervaded craft from stem to stern be conducted aft to companion by ollivier who whispered to just a be about to descend courage mon ami that man must have deemed exhortation necessary be reverse of encouraging for seemed to indicate that in opinion be about to undergo more le trying ordeal suggestion that only too strongly confirmed own foreboding if however be about to be involved in difficulty first step be manifestly to ascertain nature so making way down companion ladder knocked at door confronted be immediately bidden in french to enter turning handle of door flinging open obeyed finding in fine roomy well lighted cabin beam of however be so low must only stand upright when between place be rather flashily decorated with good deal of gilding several crudely executed painting in panelling of woodwork large mirror nearly ruined by damp surmounted buffet against fore bulkhead after bulkhead be decorated with trophy composed of sword pistol long murderous looking dagger arranged in form of star massive mahogany table occupying centre of cabin reflected in polished depth handsome lamp of white silvery looking metal swung in skylight locker underneath trophy be occupied by slight youthful looking sallow complexioned man whose well oiled hair clustered in coal black ringlet over small shapely head while pair of small piercing black eye flashed out from beneath black eyebrow that ran unbroken right across root of nose set of large even pearl white teeth gleamed through well kept coal black moustache beard fellow be attired in showy theatrical looking costume consisting of blue cloth jacket adorned with double row of gilt button pair of bullion epaulette upon shoulder over shirt of white silk open at throat sword belt of black varnished leather fastened by pair of handsome brass gold clasp served double purpose of support for blue cloth trouser receptacle for pair of pistol handsomely mounted in silver be of course captain renouf man who looked like afterwards proved to actually be brother sat beside individual rightly conjectured to be chief mate of jean bart men be young captain being perhaps about four while brother must be about two year younger must have be handsome for cruel sinister expression of eye be ocean dandy of first water for in addition to showy garb that of junior being similar to captain except that epaulette be lacking wore gold ear ring while several apparently valuable ring flashed upon rather dirty finger of senior officer pair looked at intently a made bow ere must speak word captain renouf accosted in french well good fellow said pray who may be name be bowen answered be chief officer of british privateer dolphin be in command of boat occupant of so humanely rescued few day ago permit monsieur to express to without further delay on behalf of myself fellow sufferer most hearty thanks for pray how came fellow sufferer to be adrift in boat demanded renouf unceremoniously cutting short expression of thanks must not help thinking that there be more than suspicion of mocking sneer in tone in uttered word fellow sufferer moreover there be distinct air of discourtesy in manner of interrupting suggestion of antagonism in flashing eye put on guard so curbing very decided disposition to make resentful retort answered gig be one of boat of late east indiaman manilla dolphin have recaptured from french privateer named tigre be afterwards set on fire by lightning destroyed be prize officer in charge of manilla at time hence presence in one of boat how came sir to be chief officer on board british privateer now demanded renouf must not for life of comprehend drift of question there be mistaking insolent intonation of therefore answered rather haughtily pardon sir if say can not see what possible concern frenchman can have in such matter a have just referred to can not eh retorted with sudden flash of temper then will explain to fine fellow asked question because feel curious to know what induced french citizen to become renegade take up arm against own country be breton sir recognise a such by unmistakable dialect if be not greatly mistaken hail from morlaix in street of town be certain have met that lanky carcase of yours hundred of time nay interrupt will not have must will interrupt captain renouf broke in despite effort to talk down what assert be simply ridiculous sir man in sens must ever mistake imperfect french for breton other dialect than of englishman what motive may be for endeavouring to persuade that be fellow countryman of own can not guess reject suggestion with scorn be englishman a be certainly quite aware insist upon being treated a such be intention to have asked parole for myself four fellow countryman with captain possessed of such extraordinary hallucination will probably be better for to remain close prisoner renouf laughed disdainfully have doubt said that arrangement must suit admirably will not suit now want to understand clearly four fellow countryman be frenchman clumsy attempt to pas yourselves off a englishman doe not deceive for moment do believe have really deceived that dolt dumaresq although professes to have be temporarily taken in by be frenchman however that fact be indisputable brother here be a firmly convinced of a be a france just now stand in need of service of son be duty to see that be made to serve willingly unwillingly let recommend to render service willingly for if will be worse for now go on deck turn to observe fine fellow will do well to recommend four fellow countryman a be pleased to term to commence duty at once to behave for learn that have great influence with will hold responsible for shortcoming on part now go captain renouf answered have listened to patiently understand that be intention to compel five englishman to serve on board ship can only do by force sir warn that if dare to use force to of will suffer for be certain to be captured by english ship sooner later captain of ship will not be slow to amply avenge violence may be foolhardy enough to resort to in determination to compel five englishman to serve enemy of country so ejaculated starting to foot in frenzy of passion dare do insolent rascal very well let see how far courage will carry struck hand bell furiously shouted gaspar man evidently steward promptly made appearance at cabin door responded monsieur called did answered renouf go on deck tell pierre to bring three men lashing down into cabin steward disappeared a did so renouf whipped pistol out of belt covered with now monsieur englishman since insist upon being so considered said if make slightest show of resistance will shoot through head do comprehend clearly answered a can not fight hand single handed a be not yet tired of life will not resist at present have in power by exercise of power can compel to do will be laying heavy debt upon captain renouf debt will not fail to pay off in full at earliest opportunity pouf answered scornfully fig for threat have always be able to take good care of hitherto doubt not will always be equally able to do so chapter seventeen true character of jean bart becomes manifest at moment pierre who turned out to be boatswain of ship accompanied by three other men one of whom carried length of ratline in hand came clattering down companion ladder entered cabin now monsieur continued renouf to will go on deck do duty will men drag there compel to do by seizing up to gangway flogging into obedience will obey order captain renouf said since leave alternative that of being flogged choose to submit to well what sneered renouf nothing at present answered suddenly realising absurdity a well a imprudence of continuing to threaten while in so utterly helpless condition aha monsieur braggadocio answered renouf so be coming to sens already be be well now be beginning to exhibit glimmer of common sense hope will increase with reflection if doe doubt not that will get on well enough together after especially a will find that there be plenty of prize money to be earned on board ship now go forward tell mate that have accepted service under persuade to do same hope for sake that will have trouble in so persuading go sir replied tell now in presence of men obey under protest only because choose to submit to indignity of compulsion by mere superior brute force so saying turned left cabin being escorted to deck by pierre three myrmidon went right forward into forecastle finding fellow survivor there told have passed in cabin at expressed utmost indignation dumaresq being a loud a loudest of companion in denunciation of renouf conduct let finish growl then said well lad have told exactly what fellow renouf said how acted be now for to act according to what seems best to for although have be ordered to persuade to follow example will hing of sort man must act according to own judgment just a did did not suit to submit to indignity of being flogged therefore accepted only alternative be left to namely to consent to serve aboard ship did so with several mental reservation nature of will communicate to at more convenient time a said gaze involuntarily turned in dumaresq direction poor fellow flushed up painfully said hope dear bowen have suspicion will betray to rascal whom blush to acknowledge a fellow countryman anything that may choose to say in presence believe fully appreciate difficulty of position can well understand that have felt compelled to yield to circumstance found impossible to control give credit for believing surrender be not base unconditional surrender of coward who preferred to turn traitor to country rather than submit to flogging if have read character aright god know have be associated with under circumstance ought to have given insight into have yielded to man renouf for ulterior purpose of own intend to communicate to comrade at first fitting opportunity now so far a be concerned have not same reason that have for objecting to take service in ship will therefore volunteer want to understand that accident of happening to belong to two nation at present unhappily at war with other be wholly insufficient to lessen in slightest degree personal friendship entertain for good fellow here fellow countryman be friend now for ever want to make plain to that short of absolute treachery to country may count upon to stand by through thick thin hesitate very rightly too to speak of plan before must be advantage to might be embarrassing to be to discus in presence have so little sympathy with captain renouf in high handed method of dealing with be to accidentally become acquainted with portion of intention must feel quite justified in remaining silent about if fellow be foolish enough to compel to serve against will need feel surprise at taking early opportunity to free yourselves from so galling yoke now in order may not be restraint upon will relieve of presence by going aft volunteering believe trust in friendship always even must circumstance assume character a to suggest doubt of so saying grasped hand offered wrung heartily sprang up ladder to deck a soon a be gone translated to four fellow prisoner what have said then resumed discussion of situation told companion that although have consented to serve on board jean bart nothing must induce to take up arm against fellow countryman on contrary if must chance to fall in with british ship be fully determined by mean in power to frustrate renouf intention to hamper obstruct in possible way at hazard that if felt disposed to accept service with similar determination must be strange if five resolute determined men like ourselves must not do something very material toward assisting in capture of schooner safe lodgment of monsieur renouf aboard british hulk men seemed to look at matter in pretty much same light did recognised a did that renouf be unscrupulous rascal likely to hesitate at little nothing to gain own headstrong will realised utter futility of attempting to resist backed a be by whole crew finally made up mind to follow example recognising a actual leader heartily pledging to be ready to act upon initiative at moment notice to obey to death whenever suitable opportunity must arise to translate somewhat vague plan into action having arrived at understanding went aft informed captain renouf that comrade have consented like under protest to serve on board jean bart whereupon ironically congratulated upon success at nevertheless must see be very much pleased gave order that be forthwith to be enrolled in port watch under brother went on duty within hour be placed in same mess slept that night in portion of 'tween deck devoted to accommodation of crew be called upon to perform duty of able seaman ere long became apparent that having gained way with englishman renouf be now desirous to render service a pleasant a possible to be called upon only to do such work a be usually allotted to highest grade of seaman before mast in many way trifling none le acceptable indulgence be shown to one of duty be of course to take regular trick at wheel in way soon discovered that be heading for west indian water be on fifth day after submission to renouf just after breakfast sail be made out from mast head schooner course be at once altered with object of intercepting strange ship be steering north be full of hope that craft must turn out to be british in case there must almost certainly be fight opportunity must be afforded of paying off part of debt owed to monsieur renouf a two craft neared other stranger sail finally hull rose above horizon be disappointed to discover that be evidently foreigner at length in response to exhibition of french colour at schooner peak hoisted spanish ensign renouf however continued to bear down upon presently spaniard evidently growing alarmed at menacing behaviour of schooner put up helm bore away before wind with unmistakable intention of avoiding if possible cart horse might a well hope to gallop away from thorough bred racer a ship to outsail jean bart stranger be clearly big lumbering merchantman built for purpose of stowing greatest possible amount of cargo in hull of dimension have pretension to speed while schooner be a have elsewhere said exceptionally fast be not wonderful therefore that rapidly overhauled without effort be impression that a spaniard be probably homeward bound from part of world toward be steering renouf be anxious to speak obtain what information must with regard to state of affair generally in quarter be therefore not surprised at persistent pursuit of ship when later on in day have closed to within gun shot distance began to fire into certainly thought be again carrying thing with rather high hand that if be not careful must probably get into serious trouble over affair still be business of mine spaniard like french be at war with if chose to make war upon other also be not for to object on contrary action calculated to produce feeling of ill will between two nation must not fail to be of advantage to great britain therefore felt qualm of conscience whatever when called upon to take station at one of gun did duty with hearty good will continued firing at spaniard for about hour in very leisurely way with such deliberate aim shot struck then without firing shot in return great hulking craft shortened sail hove to ten minute later too be hove to within pistol shot of spaniard weather quarter then have opportunity to learn by gilt lettering on stern that be santa theresa of cadiz jean bart three boat be at once lowered party of about forty men armed to teeth led by captain renouf brother gabriel young dumaresq pushed off to take possession thought last most extraordinary proceeding france spain being then on friendly term with other moreover at once disabused of impression that be information only that renouf be seeking still be business of mine even have be be certainly not moment for to interfere surrounded a be by forty evil looking ruffian fully armed schooner in charge of second mate most evil looking scoundrel of lot moreover man who have not attempted to conceal fact that intensely hated very sight of englishman boat passed under spaniard stern few minute later renouf appeared upon poop with sword drawn waved signal to danton second mate whereupon man be sent aloft to royal yard with instruction to keep sharp look out round horizon to at once report appearance of strange sail might perchance heave in sight for close upon four hour two craft remained thus hove to upon opposite tack gradually drifting further apart except when danton saw fit to fill upon schooner from time to time for purpose of again closing with spaniard never nearing however closer than mile to leeward during at least two hour of time not trace of life be to be discovered on board bigger ship at length however slight movement became observable on board santa theresa presently saw that tackle be being got up on main topmast stay lower yard arm spaniard boat be then hoisted out lowered from davit until of appeared to be in water when long boat be hauled alongside to leeward abreast main hatchway dozen men clambered down side into after short interval be probably employed in taking off hatch became apparent that be hoisting cargo up out of santa theresa hold certain selected bale package of be from time to time carefully lowered down into long boat sight went far toward confirming certain dreadful suspicion have be slowly taking shape within mind from moment when have seen renouf with drawn sword upon spanish ship poop now once more filled upon schooner time closed bigger ship to leeward within le than cable length when once more hove to on same tack a neighbour powerful tackle be then got up on lower yard arm on triatic stay by time that preparation be complete long boat be loaded a deeply a be prudent be at once cast off taken in tow by four men in one of schooner boat next largest of santa theresa boat taking place for reception of further cargo weather be at time quite fine with very moderate breeze blowing so little swell running that be not worth speaking about yet long boat be sooner fairly in tow than became apparent that in charge of be in difficulty for prompt measure taken by danton must have missed schooner altogether gone wallowing away to leeward with assistance however be got alongside after fashion brought to schooner lee gangway when became apparent that in charge of be so helplessly drunk that must hardly stand yet somehow managed with assistance to clamber up low side reach deck when a well a drunken state must allow forthwith proceeded in ribald language to entertain more sober shipmate with tale of gross wanton cruel outrage perpetrated on board spaniard that made blood boil with indignation caused thick skinned sailor a be to blush at thought that perpetrator be like human noticed that danton listened with greedy ear to foul recital by by when long boat cargo have be roused out of struck down main hatchway turned schooner over to carpenter taking four fresh sober hand with proceeded on board santa theresa leaving four drunken ruffian behind shortly after departure of long boat one of cutter came drifting down to loaded to gunwale four intoxicated scoundrel in charge of amply verified revolting story told by predecessor adding such detail a abundantly confirmed suspicion that jean bart be privateer out out pirate of deepest dye tale so inflamed sober portion of crew who have remained on board schooner at one moment looked very much a though be about to throw off trammel of discipline obedience proceed forthwith on board spaniard to participate in saturnalia still in progress there be only by production of lavish allowance of rum promise from carpenter that must have turn on board doomed ship that must be restrained from heaving cutter cargo overboard instead of hoisting out passing down hatchway seizing boat proceeding on board spaniard en masse a for may be imagined what raging fever of indignation fury be thrown into by what have heard be made more unendurable by circumstance be utterly powerless to interfere for what must four fellow countryman say do to restrain eighty lawless ruffian animated by vilest most evil passion that human breast ever harboured absolutely nothing not even though must resolve to lay down life in attempt might destroy twenty thirty of frenchman perhaps before ourselves went under must in nowise serve unhappy spaniard who must still be at mercy of ruthless survivor thousand scheme suggested to there be not practical one among not one offered remotest prospect of success with bitter execration at helplessness be at length obliged to admit that thing must take course so far a be concerned although helpless to intervene just then saw that there be possibility of frenchman excess bringing retribution in train for man who have thus far come from spanish ship have be almost helplessly drunk saw especial reason why rest must not be in same condition if be what might not five resolute reckless englishman be able to do have observed that when carpenter found compelled to bribe what may term sober half of schooner crew to remain aboard by producing quantity of rum four english shipmate exhibited backwardness in accepting swallowing very liberal allowance have be offered to also accepted mine upon pretence of being thirsty therefore desiring to add water to took aft to scuttle butt deftly hove spirit overboard filling pannikin with water drank content with greatest apparent gusto now a certain vague possibility began to present to mind contrived to draw hardy green anstey sendell away from crowd of excited chattering frenchman swarmed in waist around hatchway getting down into deserted forecastle briefly rapidly explained to have discovered relative to real character of jean bart crew a well a nature of doings aboard spanish ship having thus wrought up to proper pitch of indignation unfolded to somewhat hazy plan inquired whether be disposed to aid in to delight found that be with heart soul have never very greatly relished compulsory service aboard schooner now that be made aware of true character that of crew professed ready eager to do anything might propose in order to escape thraldom of continuation of such service companionship whereupon bade accept drink might be offered to religiously abstain from swallowing drop of to hold in readiness to act under leadership whenever might deem that favourable moment for such action have arrived chapter eighteen turn table upon monsieur renouf be drawing well on toward sunset when renouf having apparently appropriated most valuable portion of spaniard cargo that must readily lay hand on began to clear disorderly rabble of crew out of ship sending aboard schooner boatload at time to surprise using spanish boat a well a own for purpose meanwhile story told by men who have from time to time come from spanish ship have have effect of gradually enticing more sober half out of schooner on board santa theresa until jean bart have at length be left practically in possession of five englishman thirty frenchman whole of whom be more le helplessly drunk being state of thing on board schooner must have be comparatively easy matter for five to have overpowered frenchman who be lying staggering about deck to have made off with vessel not even to secure liberty did consider must have be justified in leaving renouf bulk of ruffian on board santa theresa to wreak vengeance on hapless crew passenger at length pretty nearly frenchman save renouf brother dozen more have rejoined schooner perceived with intense satisfaction that although be without exception in almost helpless state of intoxication man brought with at least couple of bottle of wine spirit men brought a many a dozen with at hint from anstey shipmate zealously assisted in getting precious bottle safely up over ship side for owner who at once took below stowed away in hammock among earliest of main body of arrival so to speak came dumaresq be perfectly sober be gratified to observe that countenance wore quite unmistakable expression of fiery indignation in thought must also trace indication of horror disgust caught eye for instant a sprang in over rail threw up hand expressively laid finger on lip vanished below only schooner gig spanish ship pinnace now remained to join have found time to observe that latter be being loaded with number of very small apparently heavy package nature of shrewdly suspected for have seen something very like before at length operation of loading pinnace appeared to be complete there be pause of about quarter of hour then gig started for schooner with pinnace in tow a soon a saw two boat coming directed four shipmate to go below turn into hammock a at least frenchman have done to remain there if possible until must call at same time warning not to touch drop of liquor a valued life in few minute two boat be alongside saw that suspicion a to nature of small package be correct there be just forty of weighing about one hundred pound package be carefully sewn up in raw hide knew that small exceedingly heavy package be so many gold ingot so jean bart have made very handsome haul apart from probably valuable bale have come up out of spaniard hold a renouf brother came up over side observed that face be flushed a with excitement wine voice be thick husky of be what might be called intoxicated a turned to go aft to cabin brother glanced at spanish ship elder gave utterance to brutal jest that made hand tingle to take by throat heave overboard seldom permit passion to conquer prudence allowed to go promising that unhappy victim must be amply avenged in due time ala even then did not know full measure of villain infamy must have cast prudence to wind dared everything for immediate freedom of action went below for few minute then returned to deck to watch trans shipment of gold standing close to gangway execrating in unmeasured term incapacity of drunken mob who be performing operation for own purpose also assumed demeanour of semi intoxication accordingly came in for full share of abuse gold a be hoisted on deck be passed down into cabin when have be got safely aboard schooner pinnace be passed astern made fast to rest of spanish boat when to astonishment filled made sail with santa theresa boat in tow for time be puzzled to divine what must possibly be renouf motive in taking away spanish boat for must be of use value to there be room for on deck at schooner davit must hardly imagine that man like renouf must seriously contemplate idea of attempting to tow across atlantic be while be marvelling at extraordinary eccentricity a considered happened to allow gaze to rest abstractedly on spaniard still remained hove to a gazed dawned upon that subtle change be taking place in appearance of vessel at first must not satisfy at a to nature of change although be convinced of reality suddenly understood craft be deeper in water than before be gradually almost imperceptibly settling down already rise fall of upon swell be becoming characterised by heavy sluggishness of movement mark water logged scoundrel have scuttled must understand now be taking away boat in order that miserable passenger crew might by possibility escape to tell tale of renouf piratical behaviour with conviction strong upon made way below at length found dumaresq sitting upon chest with face buried in hand wearing appearance of most abject melancholy dumaresq exclaimed in fierce whisper grasping by shoulder shaking almost savagely in agitation rouse man listen to want to ask question two have be aboard spanish ship be eye witness suppose of at least of deed of renouf crew want to hear particular a briefly a possible also want to know what be feeling in matter removed hand from face looked up at even in dim uncertain light of 'tween deck must read horror sorrow indignation in eye bowen friend replied in low cautious tone ask for can not tell must not find word to describe scene of have be helpless horrified eye witness day everything may be summed up in few word renouf crew be pirate of most ruthless character men who absolutely revel in wickedness of vilest description who take positive delight in inflicting most horrible indignity upon who unfortunately happen to fall into power who gloat over unavailing tear entreaty of victim who scoff at mere mention of word mercy ' picture to yourself very worst that have ever heard read of piratical atrocity will be able to arrive at very accurate conception of horror of unfortunate ship be theatre to day friend be compelled to look on powerless to mitigate single horror nay worse remonstrance be jeered at if ventured to intercede in behalf of victim additional insult barbarity be at once inflicted upon unhappy creature be fiend into whose power have fallen must have be thousand time better have perished in gig be that view of matter exclaimed contemptuously then can only say monsieur dumaresq have be mistaken in man man continued angrily what be thinking about be going to crouch here dumb abject inactive like whipped hound instead of bestirring helping to put end to career of fiend bring to justice to say nothing of possibility of saving unhappy wretch on board spanish ship unless be to understand from that have be murdered in cold blood be not quite so bad a that answered looking at with bewildered air bloodshed there certainly be cruel torture to extract secret of hiding place of gold life be actually taken so far a know what do mean by talk of saving ' unhappy wretch on board spanish ship mean said impressively that ship have be scuttled be now surely slowly sinking while renouf have boat in tow in order that there may be possible chance of escape for anybody on board merciful heaven can not be exclaimed starting to foot gripping by arm why nobody fiend incarnate must dream of doing such thing then said renouf be fiend incarnate be additional reason for putting end to career at once for a surely a that be standing here have not only dreamed of doing such thing have actually done horrible horrible exclaimed dumaresq smiting forehead with hand a stared at still more than half incredulous what can do friend what can do there be six of at most against more than eighty true answered if of six be a resolute a be prepared to be may prove sufficient for purpose now listen to be plan look around there be not man below here save ourselves be nearly quite helplessly drunk on deck be little better must divide into three party of two party must tackle one of drunken wretch at time one of clapping gag between jaw while other whip lashing round make fast hand foot in way everybody below here may be secured then leaving two of number here to deal with others who may come down other four must go aft seize renouf brother when have made safe must tackle danton done next move must be to get schooner round return to spanish ship while be making way back must go round deck with belaying pin apiece simply knock sens out of who attempt to oppose will not be difficult matter for believe that there be man on board excepting perhaps renouf brother capable of taking care of mon dieu exclaimed dumaresq be desperate scheme believe that anybody briton must have thought of much le talked of so coolly a have done bowen friend dare attempt be there remotest chance of being successful there be chance if be resolute answered little impatiently of course continued be not called upon to join if nay nay interrupted will never say that anatole dumaresq flinched when desperate work have to be done be with friend heart soul let clearly understand what be to be done will have chance to say did not do fair share there be hand upon silently grasped extended hand then went to hammock in hardy mate be pretending to sleep told to tumble out at once did when explained to very briefly what proposed to do having made meaning clear rejoined dumaresq without further ado six of seized number of jacket trouser other clothing have be hung to bulkhead beam unceremoniously cut into suitable strip rolled into gag on board jean bart hammock be never taken on deck a be on board man o ' war schooner not being fitted with hammock rail be simply laced up morning hammock be consequently fitted with good stout lacing thought must admirably serve a lashing for prisoner having provided ourselves with a many gag a must conveniently stow in pocket next stationed ourselves in couple alongside three occupied hammock while one of twain loosely quickly passed lacing through eyelet hole other stood by with gag at proper moment be slipped into victim mouth lashed securely hammock lacing at same moment being hauled taut made fast in way prisoner be silently effectually secured took six of fully twenty minute to secure everybody below to number of sixty three a of have to be gagged first afterwards lashed into hammock work be done effectually noiselessly without hitch one of frenchman proving to be too completely intoxicated to offer slightest resistance worthy of name done crept up on deck staggering stumbling with most vacant expression of face must assume generally imitating a nearly a must gait appearance of drunken man for benefit of whosoever might happen to be in condition to take intelligent notice of reeling staggering to fore rigging clutched at hung on to belaying pin looked about fore aft deck be occupied by twenty men so of whom be asleep in lee scupper while others in little group of two three hung over bulwark staring idiotically at white foam swept aft from schooner keen cut water four who have probably assumed duty of looking out staggered lurched in pair holding other on leg to fro between windlass fore rigging occasionally indulging in ineffectual attempt to exchange remark so far be right nobody here seemed capable of giving slightest trouble in fact discipline be for time being at end lawlessness reigned supreme everybody be own master schooner be practically left to take care of danton however be in charge of deck although be trifle unsteady in walk must see that have wit pretty well about must have to be somewhat carefully tackled if wished to secure without giving alarm to renouf brother of whom took be below astern of rather about point half on starboard quarter four mile distant lay spaniard still hove to brasswork glass of sky light scuttle flashing redly in last ray of setting sun a laboured over ridge of low swell be startled horrified to observe how deep have sunk into water during comparatively short time have be below be clear enough that if unhappy people aboard be to be rescued there be not moment to lose therefore staggered aft approaching danton with drunken solemnity touched forehead wavering upon leg speaking thickly asked to come for'ard down below tell whether must smell fire scoundrel face blanched at word a probably pictured to frightful predicament of hand included must suggestion prove true then without word hastened forward to hatchway with at heel went stumbling down steep ladder a reached bottom flung upon clasping round body arm lifted off foot at same time singing out to hardy to gag in minute have securely bound hand foot lashed hard fast into hammock so far well exclaimed a dragged unceremoniously away to dark corner have now to secure renouf brother schooner be ours hardy green sendell come aft with providing yourselves with belaying pin on way anstey will keep mr dumaresq company on deck mounting guard over companion to prevent anyone going below to knock down secure anyone who may escape attempt to reach deck duty be very simple four of will enter cabin while hardy attempt to secure renouf brother other two will stand by to assist in event of of becoming disabled by pistol bullet come along hearties so saying led little party aft at head of companion ladder dumaresq man anstey came to halt former engaging drunken helmsman in conversation while remaining four of stole down ladder bare footed noiseless a cat have already mentally arranged method of procedure so whispering to hardy that be to tackle chief mate

pistol shot fired in cabin upon small residue of crew who have not yet utterly succumbed to stupefying influence of immoderate potation chapter nineteen fate of santa theresa upon rejoining dumaresq learned from that pistol shot fired in cabin have attracted only most casual momentary notice of few frenchman on deck majority of indeed scarcely rousing sufficiently to do more than merely turn head to send single inquiring glance aft be good news a although schooner be now to intent purpose own there be few enough of to navigate be most anxious that few must not be weakened by possible injury in struggle to secure full complete possession that full complete possession however be absolutely necessary to secure at once if anything be to be done toward rescuing unhappy spaniard on board fast sinking santa theresa so dumaresq went forward by dint of little good humoured force succeeded in persuading remainder of frenchman to go below where secured without much difficulty done at once brought schooner to wind proceeded to beat up toward spanish ship must just make out in rapidly deepening dusk of tropical evening carefully noted bearing distance then dumaresq taking wheel rest of went to work to make prisoner permanently secure fortunately for renouf foresight enabled to do very effectually having apparently recognised that circumstance might possibly arise rendering important that must posse mean to reduce large number of men to absolute helplessness for purpose have provided with ample supply of iron now proved most useful to lost time in clapping iron upon hand leg of frenchman thus rendering impossible for to give slightest trouble upon recovery from drunken debauch having made perfectly secure next business be to restore cook steward to sobriety by subjecting to liberal douche of salt water to set to work to prepare meal of began to feel that stood in need task of effectually securing whole of prisoner occupied considerable amount of time so when be at length completed to satisfaction night have long since fallen have completely lost sight of spanish ship although dumaresq have kept eye upon a long a possible have brought schooner to wind on starboard tack in first instance held on upon tack until found by mean of simple little diagram drawn to scale upon piece of paper that must fetch on next tack when hove schooner round hope of being able to rescue spaniard be fast fading away for wind have evinced decided disposition to drop with setting of sun when at length tacked to fetch spot where expected to find santa theresa schooner be going through water at speed of barely four knot according to reckoning ship be just that distance from so that must occupy hour to fetch be exceedingly doubtful whether must remain afloat so long indeed greatly feared that have foundered already for night although dark be clear star be shining brilliantly from zenith to horizon appeared to that if be still afloat ought to be able to see blur of canvas against sky although searched horizon from broad on one bow to broad on other using for purpose exceptionally fine night glass found in renouf cabin be unable to make out once twice be true thought have caught right ahead unfortunately happened that portion of sky in quarter be bare of star over space very considerably larger than must have be covered by ship canvas consequently be without assurance must have be afforded have faint dusky appearance took to be sail alternately eclipsed exposed star afterwards have reason to believe have really seen for when have arrived within about mile of spot where supposed to be faint wailing cry a of people in last extremity of despair came pealing distinctly to across black water about quarter of hour later suddenly found among quantity of floating oar bucket hatch other article have undoubtedly belonged to spaniard presence of article proved conclusively that unfortunate ship have gone down cry that have heard be doubtless last despairing cry of hapless helpless passenger crew thus to crime of piracy renouf have added far worse one of wholesale murder for dumaresq asserted that according to estimate number of passenger crew together on board santa theresa must not have fallen much if anything short of hundred immediately hove schooner to dumaresq with four english shipmate at once shoved off in boat to search among wreckage for possible survivor not one be found be not to be wondered at for afterwards transpired that renouf have driven spanish seaman below battened down while have lashed officer passenger hand foot locked into cabin last thing before scuttling ship remained to until past midnight then having failed to find even so much a floating body sorrowfully filled away shaped course for west indie being intention to hand whole crew over to authority upon charge of piracy few day later a be running down trade wind shortly after mid day sighted ahead whole fleet of large ship steering pretty nearly same course a ourselves be under royal with studding sail set on side despite fact that be so much bigger than overhauled so rapidly that by sunset have brought hull up have neared so closely that be not only able to identify a line of battle ship with aid of renouf splendid telescope be able to read several of name emblazoned upon stern made out such name a argonauta espana pluton terrible bucentaure san rafael others by mean of dumaresq be able to identify of a ship have be blockaded in port of toulon by lord nelson others be manifestly spanish ship name appearance generally testified to fact therefore looked very much a though vice admiral villeneuve have somehow contrived to evade british fleet having effected junction with spanish fleet be making best of way to west indie to work what damage might be within power upon colony commerce in quarter of globe there be twenty sail of altogether fact that so formidable fleet of enemy be ranging atlantic steering course must take to of most valuable of britain possession in western hemisphere be important news indeed reconnoitred fleet a closely a dared contriving before daylight faded to ascertain name approximately power of ship did not deign to take slightest notice of beyond firing shot two at whenever ventured within range so when darkness set in bore away to southward sufficiently to give flank ship berth of about four mile when crowded sail upon schooner ran past dropping out of sight before sunrise next morning despite fact that be so short handed continued to carry on night day arriving at port royal on morning of eighth day after sighting combined fleet first task be to seek out admiral whom expected to find at pen on slope of hill at back of town of kingston so sooner be anchor down than engaged negro boatman to take up harbour arrived at kingston procured vehicle driving to pen be fortunate enough to catch great man just a be about to sit down to breakfast announcement be bearer of important intelligence relating to enemy secured immediate admission to presence despite fact be only privateersman genial old seadog accorded hearty welcome insisted upon sitting down to table with directly have elicited from fact have not yet broken fast be of course profoundly interested in intelligence be able to furnish relative to presence of combined french spanish fleet in atlantic information being first have reached of fact be good enough to say that in hastening to with news have rendered service of utmost importance to country scarcely le interested be in narration of adventure from time of abandonment of manilla to moment of capture of jean bart complimented highly upon conduct throughout while promising to immediately relieve of charge of prisoner incidentally expressed regret have not selected navy a profession answered be obscure individual with influence patronage whatever at command that therefore have entered navy must probably never have be allowed to rise in profession influence patronage lacked causing other more fortunate one to be promoted over head reply be characteristic influence patronage exploded ay sir speak truly there be too much of altogether amount to very serious drawback injury to service in many way a for men like require influence patronage posse best of influence in lightly touching hilt of sword be thousand pity that greater facility be not afforded to men of kidney for entrance into service perhaps profit derivable from successful privateering outweigh patriotism must rather be a be than become wearer of majesty livery be mistaken sir answered hotly to serve on majesty quarter deck must be height of ambition confess prefer present position a commander of privateer to of warrant officer aboard man o ' war answered with umph afforded clue to opinion of outspoken reply business with being at end took leave have engagement for to night asked extending hand very cordially upon answering have not said then come dine with seven sharp want to see little more of of course gladly accepted so flattering invitation then hurried away to appoint agent return to schooner be anxious to get to sea again a quickly a possible for looked upon loss of manilla a so much leeway very serious amount too must not be too speedily made up foresaw that chief difficulty in so doing must arise from lack of crew how to scrape together decent complement in small town like kingston knew not for be fully aware that men o ' war kept place pretty well swept of men be therefore greatly pleased when having called upon individual who have be recommended to by admiral a agent informed upon conclusion of business proper with that knew man who believed must be willing for consideration to find a many good men a might require at once asked for address of person be informed that must be utterly useless for total stranger to call upon a must most certainly decline to treat with that if felt disposed to leave matter in agent hand must do best for thought understood pretty well what meant system of impressment have done more than anything else to render navy unpopular men be constantly deserting whenever wherever found chance when have once succeeded in making good escape from ship on board have be compelled to serve best chance of safety from recapture lay in getting to sea a quickly a possible until be perforce obliged to lie in close hiding state of affair soon produced set of men known a crimp who kept boarding house for especial accommodation concealment of seaman who have deserted from ship who having be paid off be anxious to find other employment without risk of impressment while openly looking for crimp be to be found in british seaport abroad a well a at home very good thing made of with exorbitant charge for board lodging on one hand on other premium head money that received from ship master for supply of men be of course to interest to be loyal to men hence hedged house about with so many safeguard against undesirable intrusion that became matter of almost impossibility to approach except through certain channel suspected that agent be in touch with one more of men although thoroughly hated system be nothing short of most audacious robbery of unfortunate men whom professed to befriend of ship master who be compelled to avail of prospect of procuring crew by other mean be so remote that unwillingly assented to agent suggestion stipulating only must see men have option of refusing such a deemed unsuitable with understanding agent undertook to do best to find at least forty thoroughly good men important matter put in train hastened back on board schooner soon have satisfaction of seeing renouf scoundrel crew passed over side into boat be to convey to prison hulk have still greater satisfaction of learning not very long afterwards that renouf brother dozen more of party have be hanged a pirate upon evidence of dumaresq other survivor of gig crew however be anticipating story somewhat same night dined with admiral have honour of meeting governor half dozen more of principal personage of island be rather astonished must admit at perfect equanimity with portentous tidings have be received admiral have of course have busy day of in preparing sending off despatch to other island belonging to crown a well a in arranging for defence of possession generally soon found that there be utter absence of apprehension on score of attack exclaimed admiral confidently villeneuve have escaped from toulon be true will be like canary have slipped out of cage will be so frightened at unexpectedly finding free that will not dare to make least use of freedom greatest anxiety will be to escape pursuer that know must be on track for d 'ye see nelson will become aware of escape in le than twelve hour will be after forthwith only wonder to be that have not overtaken brought to action before now must give good deal for power to let nelson know whereabouts of fleet have ship at disposal by way mr bowen what be going to do next will proceed to sea again without moment unnecessary delay sir answered want be crew want echoed admiral by george sir know where will find crew in jamaica believe available man have already be hunted out appropriated by men o ' war have men at four only be not yet by mean certain that will consent to ship with have authority whatever over formed part of crew of manilla well observed admiral be afraid be bad look out for at same time if must succeed in picking up enough to enable to handle schooner let know may find work to do if care to undertake slept ashore that night upon calling upon agent next day be a much astonished a gratified to learn that friend be prepared to furnish with sixty prime seaman one of whom have served on board man o ' war upon payment of guinea head for be tolerably stiff premium to pay a time then be must be fully worth must turn out to be a represented so agreed to go see night with result not to dwell at unnecessary length upon part of story next morning found in command of a smart crew a man need wish to have at back found that be indebted for slice of good fortune principally to fact that crew of privateer be exempt from impressment exemption be allowed to hold good in west indie although exemption be frequently little better than dead letter at home in other part of world now went to work to provision water schooner for three month cruise so well did agent work for that within seventy two hour of arrival at port royal be able to report ready for sea at admiral service be well exclaimed admiral rubbing hand when so reported congratulate upon smartness mr bowen also upon good fortune in finding crew be good deal more than own people must have done now if be willing to render country further important service can afford opportunity be convinced that lord nelson will not remain inactive at home now that admiral villeneuve have contrived to give slip will chase combined fleet round world if need be be important that villeneuve must be watched what therefore want to do be to sail in search of combined fleet find ascertain a much a can relative to projected movement then find british fleet acquaint nelson with that have be able to learn when have done that will be free to cruise wherever please make excuse to return to jamaica at earliest convenience fail to call on thanked admiral for kindness promised to execute commission to best of ability took leave two hour later schooner have rechristened sword fish be outside pallisades working way to eastward under a heavy press of canvas a dared pile upon chapter twenty perform important service task with have be intrusted be one of very greatest responsibility for descent of combined french spanish fleet upon west indian water must only be assumed to point to intention on part of enemy to wrest at least of west indian possession from intention available resource on spot must be utterly inadequate to frustrate in view of formidable force possessed by enemy be therefore of last importance that british reinforcement might be hastening to support of colony must be quickly found communicated with be equally important that must be furnished with latest possible intelligence with regard to movement of enemy duty therefore be asked to perform single handed be such a actually called for employment of several vessel unfortunately however there be absolutely none available for admiral at juncture only ship in port at moment of arrival in jamaica being schooner firefly vessel have immediately be despatched to several island belonging to british crown with warning that formidable force be approaching for reception of best possible disposition be to be made thus came about that young untried hand found called upon to perform service of almost national importance with only own discretion to guide instruction however be simple explicit enough resolved to carry out to letter after giving subject best consideration of be capable came to conclusion that if monsieur villeneuve really intended to attack island in possession must probably begin with windward island instead therefore of working way out into atlantic through windward passage between cuba saint domingo stretched across caribbean sea on taut larboard bowline noon on fourth day after sailing from port royal found ninety mile west north west of french island of martinique while be at dinner mate stuck head through skylight to report land right ahead went up on deck to get look at soon identified a summit of mont pelee highest point in island stood on keeping sharp look out for vessel saw nothing about two bell in first watch night found within influence of land breeze be blowing off island hour later saw off mouth of bay of fort royal a night be dark came to conclusion that might be worth while to stand inshore little closer upon chance of being able to pick up information accordingly worked in against land breeze have arrived within mile of pigeon island when encountered small trading felucca coming out allowed to get to seaward of when bore up in chase few minute later be alongside craft have secured quiet possession of felucca carried five hand whom caused to be transferred to schooner first business be to get master of craft down into cabin where informed that wanted from be information that if must answer question truly must at once release return vessel to if found that be attempting to deceive must burn felucca retain crew a prisoner man be eager in protestation that must tell everything wanted to know begged not to destroy vessel a represented entire possession be sole mean of earning livelihood piece of information led to hope must not attempt to deceive so went to work to question forthwith jotting answer down upon piece of paper information obtained from fellow be important enough to have justified in running far greater risk than have actually incurred to procure be to effect that combined fleet have be off island very day with forty prize comprising antigua convoy in company that have captured diamond rock that in consequence of certain information supposed to have be received from schooner have day arrived from europe have made sail to eastward a to character of information however have caused so powerful force to take so unexpected step man professed to know nothing having obtained information from sent skipper on deck have conveyed forward where be placed in charge of two men while have crew down into cabin one by one questioned answer bore out what skipper have already told therefore concluded that news be true accordingly released felucca with strict caution that be to proceed forthwith on voyage to mariegalante island to be bound on account to attempt to re enter harbour of fort royal under penalty of instant recapture fellow be evidently only too glad to get out of hand upon such easy term sooner found once more safely on deck of little hooker than made sail to northward be soon lost in darkness dumaresq who have remained with thus far thought good opportunity to rejoin countryman with cordial permission took passage in felucca so far have done very well combined fleet be only few hour distant have doubt that with so nimble heeled craft a sword fish must have very little difficulty in overtaking in course of day two question now be whether must proceed forthwith in pursuit of monsieur villeneuve whether must devote hour two to endeavour to ascertain precise nature of information said to have be brought from europe by schooner information might be of value might not after giving matter brief careful consideration came to conclusion that be hardly worth while troubling about a if vessel have brought out despatch must have be delivered long since in case captain crew must know nothing of content therefore filled away forthwith by midnight have brought island over larboard quarter there be now question bothered somewhat be must not understand why combined fleet must be steering east why must have gone off in such hurry a have be represented to racked brain for long time in search of satisfactory solution of problem a felt that until have found such must be quite in dark a to course ought to steer in order to overtake for although have be informed that when last seen fleet be steering to southward eastward close hauled have data upon to base opinion a to length of time during must continue to steer in direction for simple reason that there be apparent object in steering in direction at have possession in quarter to tempt unless might be barbados even island lay considerably to leeward of course monsieur villeneuve be said to be steering at length however possible explanation suggested occurred to that schooner be supposed to have brought information leading to precipitate departure of monsieur villeneuve might have fallen in with succeeded in eluding british pursuing fleet of existence of admiral at jamaica have felt so certain if have have brought news to martinique of approach of such fleet must understand monsieur villeneuve anxiety to be off for be fully persuaded that there be nothing french admiral desired so little a to encounter nelson upon considering matter further conviction forced irresistibly upon that if monsieur villeneuve have be given good reason to believe that be pursued chief anxiety must be to get back to europe a quickly a possible such desire must fully account for everything in movement have found difficult to understand must also account for course that be said to be steering that course being only one must at once lead homeward at same time enable to avoid meeting with suppositious british fleet so thoroughly at length did convince that represented actual state of case unhesitatingly set sword fish head in same direction believed combined fleet to be steering then having issued order that schooner be to be driven at highest speed consistent with safety to spar went below turned in during remainder of night whole of next day carried on without sighting anything in shape of sail at dawn of second day persistence be rewarded by sight of large fleet of ship strung out along horizon by mid day have approached near enough to enable to identify a fleet of be in search there be big fleet of merchantman in company assumed to be captured antigua convoy by by one of fine full rigged ship wore round in response to signal headed for allowed to approach within couple of mile of when in turn shifted helm going round upon starboard tack assumed appearance of being in precipitate flight be particular to flatten in sheet brace to extent that by careful persistent wind jamming schooner became a sluggish a log in way played with ship until have decoyed good twenty mile away from rest of fleet sometimes allowing to gain upon trifle then drawing away from again object of course being to capture if must of ability to do provided must decoy far enough away from possible support have very little doubt for did not consider in least likely that must have more than sixty frenchman on board a prize crew while have equal number of englishman at length about hour before sunset allowed ship to approach within gun shot shortly afterwards opened fire upon with six pounder shot flew wide same caused helm to be put down a schooner slowly luffed into wind gave order for sheet to be let fly presenting appearance of terrible confusion ruse be successful ship ceased firing came booming along toward under inch of canvas that must spread meanwhile lad hugely delighted at fun in prospect armed got grappling iron ready prepared for boarding stranger weather be quite fine enough to admit of running alongside in schooner there being very little swell on so a soon a be ready men stationed at sheet brace by little judicious manipulation of helm contrived to get sternway upon schooner just a ship came booming down upon weather quarter nobody on board seemed to think of shortening sail until be fairly abreast of then terrific hullabaloo broke out a crew endeavoured to clew up haul down everything at once even let run topsail halliard in excitement then in midst of just a ship went surging past with great rustling of canvas lashing of loose cordage in wind man sprang into mizzen rigging hailed in french ordering to follow until must heave to when must send boat on board suited plan to nicety so filled upon schooner followed ship closely luffing up for lee quarter a did so so well have everything worked with believe none of frenchman have slightest suspicion that anything be wrong until have actually run aboard thrown grappling iron then excitement be even more distracting than before everybody cry out at once officer men vying with other in giving most contradictory order nobody dreaming of obeying single one of surprise be complete when lad followed over ship bulwark with drawn cutlass found a opponent only shouting shrieking gesticulating mob who reviled for perfidious mode of fighting in one breath in next passionately conjured not to overlook fact that surrendered be a amusing bit of business a have be engaged in for many day lost time in securing prisoner who be only forty in number then turned attention to ship ascertained to be caribbean of london of twelve hundred forty three ton register laden with sugar rum be therefore valuable recapture carried thirty two passenger by great good luck own british crew be also on board be not necessary therefore for to weaken own force by putting prize crew on board chief mate being quite sufficient to represent watch over interest of sword fish owner individual who have be put on board a prize master when be captured by monsieur villeneuve fleet happened to be very talkative fellow accordingly have not much difficulty in extracting from information that have be rumoured through fleet that suddenness of monsieur villeneuve departure from west indie be due to intelligence lord nelson be in pursuit statement if true exactly bore out theory little more judicious questioning enabled to ascertain that have further be stated that at time of departure from martinique british fleet be believed to be not more than four day sail distant thus obtained something in shape of clue a to direction in further search ought to be prosecuted accordingly hauled up to southward close hauled on starboard tack with recapture in company be more than week however before contrived to obtain definite information a to whereabouts of british fleet even then be four day longer in finding when at length be achieved have satisfaction of learning that information be very latest of authentic character have be furnished to have effect of causing instantly to determine to retrace step to europe be good news to for enabled to send recapture across atlantic with british fleet a protector instead of taking into kingston in jamaica where necessary formality connected with capture must have involved in vast amount of trouble expense accordingly wrote brief letter two home forwarded by caribbean parted company with fleet within hour of having fallen in with latter thus terminated successfully profitably service have undertaken at instigation of admiral stationed at jamaica be now own master once more free to go wherever whim prompted determined must put into effect plan have long commended to namely to cruise along spanish main in hope of picking up one of galleon plate ship be still despatched from time to time from cartagena upon parting company therefore with british fleet cruised along whole line of windward island a far south a tobago trinidad then bore up for main in leisurely fashion under easy canvas coasted along shore taking look into cariaco gulf without finding anything worth picking up thence across to cape codera off wind came out from westward compelling to make stretch off land occurred about midnight secured observation for longitude at nine o'clock next morning for latitude at noon about time became aware that barometer be falling although not rapidly enough to give cause for uneasiness a afternoon wore on however there be indication that change of weather be impending sky lost pure brilliancy of blue by insensible degree assumed ashen pallor sun vainly struggled to pierce until merged from palpitating rayless ball of light to shapeless blotch of dim watery radiance then disappeared at same time wind died away until be left becalmed rolling rail under upon swell gathered strength hour a came creeping up from westward in short time became fine example of what spaniard call furious calm schooner rolling so heavily that deemed prudent to send yard topmast down on deck to relieve lower mast did more readily because steady continuous decline of mercury in tube assured that be booked for stiff blow yet hour succeeded hour until darkness closed down upon still beyond portent already mentioned there be sign of coming breeze night fell a dark a wolf mouth air be so close hot that mere act of breathing be performed with difficulty quick jerky roll of schooner at length became positively distressing in persistent monotony of course under circumstance turning in be not to be thought of so far a be concerned therefore made a comfortable a must upon wheel grating awaited development fact be be puzzled did not know what to make of weather have not be for steady continuous fall of mercury must have expected nothing worse than fresh breeze from westward preceded perhaps by thunder squall barometer indicated something more serious than sky gave verifying sign of approach of anything like heavy blow have long ago taken in everything except boom foresail to save sail from beating to piece so be pretty well prepared for eventuality be close upon midnight when change came then be nothing at alarming being merely sudden by mean violent squall out from about due west followed by heavy downpour of rain rain lasted about quarter of hour when ceased be again becalmed suddenly became conscious of faint luminousness somewhere in atmosphere looking about to discover cause observed what looked like ball of lambent greenish flame clinging to foremast head where swayed about elongating contracting with roll of ship exactly a gigantic soap bubble might have done clung there swaying for moment then glided slowly down mast until reached jib stay down slid to bowsprit whence after wavering for few second travelled along bowsprit inboard vanished not however until have revealed by corpse like light horror stricken feature of half dozen of watch huddled together on forecastle in attitude curve bend of be eloquent of consternation be bad sign sir so say remarked saunders chief mate whose watch be what appearance of light demanded not so much appearance of sir way that travelled say that if corposant appears aboard vessel stay aloft travel upwards be all right if come down from aloft mean heavy gale of wind at very least answered saunders pooh said mere superstition everybody know nowadays that corposant be nothing electrical phenomenon therefore merely indication that atmosphere be surcharged with electricity a to whether travel up down in opinion be mere chance accident call will have ever seen of thing before sir inquired mate said be first time have ever be shipmate with one ah remarked mate with distinct accent of superior experience in tone have seen often enough too often may say why there be one time when be aboard little fox bound from jamaica to new providence be lying becalmed just a be to night close to diamond bank with pretty much same sort of weather too when one of thing boarded making appearance on spindle of vane at main topmast head wavered about for minute two exactly like thing just now then rolled a might be down spar until met topmast stay down travelled to foremast head from thence came down topsail sheet to deck where bursted ten minute after happened sir be struck by squall hove over on beam end have to cut mast away before must right with when at length rose to even keel there be five foot of water in hold of course must hing scud before squall hardening into furious gale of wind went ashore about two hour afterwards on south point yuma island out of crew of thirty four men only seven of be saved now what d 'ye think of sir why think be terribly unfortunate affair believe that corposant have anything to do with answered well sir answered mate only hope that have because d see if view be correct one need fear anything happening in consequence of why bust there be of 'em be true while saunders be in very act of speaking of strange weird light have suddenly become visible time on mainmast head where hung for few minute finally sliding down mast to deck where rolled to fro for perhaps minute presenting appearance of sphere of luminous mist most brilliant part of be centre be by mean superstitious person be free to admit that sight of weird uncanny thing gliding about deck emitting ghostly light almost at foot produced sufficiently creepy feeling to make unfeignedly glad when presently disappeared now mark word sir if have very ugly weather after observed saunders producing tinder box lighting pipe walked to skylight took squint at barometer be still falling by time depression have assumed such proportion a to fully justify such expectation a entertained by mate thought therefore that might be only prudent to make further preparation accordingly gave order to reef foresail fore staysail time continued a dark a pitch so breathlessly calm that helmsman wishing to prick up wick of binnacle lamp be able to do so in open air only wind affecting naked flame being draught occasioned by heavy roll of schooner be not destined to last very long ten minute quarter of hour after second corposant have vanished felt faint movement in atmosphere caused small spread of canvas to flap heavily once twice then came puff of hot damp air that lasted long enough to give schooner steerage way when be on point of dying scuffle of wind swept over careened schooner to bearing before have recovered true breeze be upon with deep weird moaning sound be inexpressibly dismal somehow seemed to impart feeling of dire foreboding to listener not that there be anything in least terrifying in strength of wind far from indeed for be heavier than double reefed topsail breeze to schooner stood up a stiff a church there be certain indescribable hollowness in sound of be only fitting term can find to apply be quite unlike anything have heard before that somehow seemed in weirdness to indisputably forebode disaster schooner be now forging through water at speed of four knot looking well up into wind have come out from westward a have said there be already very heavy swell running upon top of very steep awkward sea soon began to make so that within hour of breeze striking be pitching bow under deck to leeward be afloat by time too have become perfectly apparent that wind be rapidly gaining strength so rapidly indeed that about hour after first puff came down upon with fury of squall laying schooner down to rail causing to plunge with fearful violence into fast rising sea within next half hour wind have increased so greatly in strength began to think there really might be something in saunders theory after be inwardly debating whether must haul fore sheet to windward heave schooner to whether must be better to up helm run before until weather must moderate bit when third corposant suddenly appeared time on boom foresail gaff end now sir remarked saunders will soon know whether have got worst of blow yet not if have thing will shift higher up if have will come down like others did not answer for be at moment straining eye into blackness on weather bow where fancied have caught second two before deeper shadow there be moment when thought saw again so profound be darkness that really seemed absurd to suppose possible to discern anything in to make sure however sang out to look out men on forecastle to keep eye wide open answer came so sharp prompt a to convince that be fully on alert have allowed imagination to deceive therefore turned to saunders with remark upon lip in reply to when saw corposant suddenly leave gaff end go driving away to leeward on wing of gale naturally expected that must almost immediately vanish did not on contrary have appearance of having be arrested in flight for saw elongating collapsing again a have done with motion of schooner also appeared to to be describing long arc across sky for moment be puzzled to account for so strange phenomenon then explanation came to in flash have not be deceived when believed caught sight of shadowy something sweeping athwart bow have seen ship there be to leeward of with corposant clinging to one of spar have just time to give order to bear up in pursuit to get schooner before wind when corposant seemed to settle down to water in instant have vanished chapter twenty one terrible adventure with disappearance of corposant there be nothing whatever to betray presence of strange sail in vicinity for now strain eye a must must not be at certain that saw anything although there be time when same vague shapeless blot of deeper darkness have previously attracted attention seemed to loom up momentarily out of stygian murkiness ahead there be time also when water being highly phosphorescent appeared to that among ghostly gleaming of breaking surge must faintly discern more symmetrical space of luminosity corresponding to foaming track of ship moving at high rate of speed through water to make sure of matter ordered reef to be shaken out of foresail also set mainsail close reefed with boom topped well up increased speed of schooner quite a much a thought desirable more indeed than be at prudent for let tell be risky work to be flying along before gale of wind at speed of fully nine knot hour on pitch black night with suspicion amounting almost to absolute certainty that there be vessel directly ahead close aboard of for aught that can tell to contrary indeed soon have evidence of for feeling uneasy upon matter have started to go forward with intention of warning look out men have reason to believe there be ship close ahead of that must therefore keep extra bright look out when a arrived abreast fore rigging eye still straining into darkness ahead schooner be hove up on breast of heavy following sea a topped with ghostly sea fire of fiercely hissing crest brimming almost to rail black shape seemed to suddenly solidify out of gloom ahead apparently within biscuit toss of jib boom end with unmistakable wake of boiling foam on side of two look out men yelled a with one voice in high pitched accent of sudden alarm hard port hard port there be ship right under bow sir helm be promptly put over schooner sheered out of wake of black mass ahead apparently craft of considerable size ranged up on starboard quarter will convey idea of closeness of shave made of when say that even above howling of gale fierce hiss of rapidly rising sea roar of bow wave caught sound of unintelligible hail from stranger almost immediately displayed lantern over taffrail for few second a warning to people being doubtless under impression that encounter have be accidental that have only that moment seen for first time having now established beyond question fact of stranger proximity to ordered mainsail to be hauled down balance reefed reset by mean presently found that stranger be gradually drawing ahead of again danger of collision being thus averted began to ask whether be advisable to continue chase longer fact be have followed craft instinctively for knew that there be so few vessel flying british colour in precise part of world that presumption be strongly in favour of one being spaniard dutchman in case enemy assuming to be one other be just a likely to be man o ' war a merchantman have appeared to be quite large enough to be former in brief indistinct glance that have caught of if happened to be man o ' war must probably find in wrong box when daylight broke on other hand have not appeared to be so large a to preclude possibility of being merchantman spanish dutch west indiaman must prove to be either of must be well worth fighting for considered question carefully at length came to conclusion that risk of following be quite worth taking accordingly held on a be meanwhile gale be steadily growing fiercer sea rising higher becoming more dangerous with mile that traversed in blind headlong flight before appeared to that option whether must continue pursuit of stranger must soon be taken from by imperative necessity to heave to if must avoid almost momentarily increasing danger of schooner being pooped when piercing cry of breaker ahead burst from two men on look out forward instantly followed by still more startling cry of breaker on port bow breaker on starboard bow sprang to rail looked ahead merciful heaven be true right athwart path a far a eye must penetrate gloom on bow there stretched barrier of wildly leaping breaker spouting foam gleaming spectrally against midnight blackness of murky heaven even a gazed spell bound at dreadful spectacle saw black bulk of strange ship outlined against ghostly whiteness in instant have swung broadside on a perfect mountain of white foam leaped upon enfolding in snowy embrace mast fell methought that mingled with sudden deafening roar of trampling breaker caught sound of despairing wail borne toward against wind oh horror of moment will never forget there be nothing to be done mean of escape for wall of white water have seemed to leap at out of darkness so suddenly that be sooner seen than be upon only choice left be whether must plunge into stem on be hove in among broadside on a have be case of strange ship with lightning like celerity of decision seems to be instinct in moment of sudden awful peril determined to drive schooner ashore stem on hoping that aided by light draught of water might be hove up high enough on beach whatever be to permit of escape of at least few of with life shouted to helmsman to steady helm breaker right ahead of seeming to be le high furious than on bow there be time for more time to order hand on deck time even to utter warning cry to already on deck to grasp nearest thing to hand cling for life for cry to helmsman be still on lip when schooner seemed to leap down upon barrier of madly plunging breaker in instant be hemmed about with crashing fury of white water boiled leaped about smiting schooner in part of hull at once foaming in over rail here there everywhere like pack of hungry wolf spouting high in air flying over in blinding deluge of spray until poor little craft seemed to be buried while without knowing how got there found on wheel grating assisting helmsman with yeasty water swirling about knee a boiled in over taffrail caught momentary glimpse of strange ship a swept athwart stern at distance of le than hundred fathom black bulk be sharply outlined against luminous loam a whelming breaker passed inshore of left for second up hove on breast of next one must see that be on beam end large ship of probably twelve hundred ton must see sign of people on board be not surprising have probably be swept overboard by first mountain wall of water swept over after have broached to such be to be fate also only wonder be that have not come already come must braced for shock already feeling in imagination terrific grinding concussion sickening jar awful upheaval of schooner quivering frame wrenching of timber asunder second after second sped shock did not come half buried in boiling swirl of maddened water schooner swept ahead now up hove on breast of fiery breaker swept from stem to stern a flung forward like cork now struggling staggering in hollow of seething yeasty foam at length a schooner settled down into one of swirling hollow actually did strike blow be light one only just sufficient to swear by not enough to check headlong rush for smallest fraction of second shortly afterwards became aware that breaker be perceptibly le weighty so much so that in about minute ceased to break inboard now dawned upon that must be passing over submerged reef of considerable extent hope began to revive for since have traversed thus far in safety there be just ghost of chance that might manage to blunder across remainder of without serious damage a thought took direction eye fell upon figure clinging to main rigging made out to be saunders chief mate shouted to by good luck voice reached came staggering aft to without relaxing grip on wheel hurriedly explained to impression with regard to situation directed to go forward see anchor clear for letting go for have determined that must supposition prove correct must be so extremely fortunate a to traverse remaining portion of reef in safety must anchor immediately that must emerge into clear water fortunately for in present strait cable be always kept bent so that there be not very much to be done in few minute saunders returned aft with intelligence that be ready for anchoring at moment now really began to hope in earnest that might perchance escape for sea be not breaking nearly so heavily around indeed must distinguish at great distance ahead small patch of unbroken water with wider patch beyond best of have only touched reef once that lightly presently schooner shot into patch of unbroken water appeared to communicate at one point with larger patch at once steered for point of junction at same time singing out to mate to get in mainsail for hand to stand by fore staysail halliard line of breaker still extended for distance ahead of be now detached with clear water between if must only contrive to keep schooner in unbroken water might yet be well be still rushing along at great pace for gale be blowing if possible more fiercely than ever water be smooth be consequently hopeful that by letting go anchor giving schooner full scope of cable might manage to ride out without dragging at length brought last of visible breaker fair on quarter be in act of putting helm over singing out at same time to haul down staysail foresail when mate who be on forecastle ready to attend to letting go of anchor shouted that thought must make out something like large rock small islet short distance ahead hurriedly instructing helmsman to keep schooner a be going ran forward immediately made out object looked amply large enough to give lee to anchor under be pretty close to so without further ado schooner be stripped of remaining canvas conned into berth close under lee of huge mass when anchor be let go port anchor first starboard anchor minute later in le than five minute have supreme satisfaction of finding sword fish riding snugly in smooth water with three fathom between keel sandy bottom be by time pretty well fagged out for hour be drawing well on toward daybreak nevertheless curiosity be so powerfully excited with regard to spot have stumbled upon after thoroughly satisfying that schooner be safe before turning in got out chart spread open upon cabin table position at noon on previous day be of course laid down upon needed few moment consideration of course distance that have subsequently steered to demonstrate that have blundered right into heart of los roques roccas most dangerous group of islet without exception in whole of caribbean sea be situated seventy five mile due north of la guayra extend over area of ocean measuring about twenty five mile from east to west about distance from north to south group consists of two island proper cayo grande cayo de sal first being triangular in shape measuring six half mile way along perpendicular base of triangle while cayo de sal be about seven half mile long by perhaps mile broad there be about thirty other islet in group of very much smaller than two above named of so small a to deserve rather name of rock than islet peculiarity about group render so exceedingly dangerous to stranger be that form part of extensive reef roughly of quadrangular form belt of reef being about three mile wide with fine open space inside divided into two fairly good anchorage by reef stretching across in north westerly direction from westerly extremity of cayo grande to main reef there be several passage leading through main reef into anchorage notably one on northern side of reef difficulty of navigation be so great to stranger that if report be to be believed be up to comparatively recent date favourite resort of pirate who once through reef be practically safe from pursuit such be spot into sword fish have rushed blindfold a be can only account for escape from destruction by supposing that have providentially hit off one of channel through reef else that gale have heaped water upon reef to extent that with light draught be able to pas over however have only to look at group a portrayed upon chart to feel thoroughly assured a to safety of schooner ourselves so turned into bunk with easy mind grateful heart at truly miraculous escape fell asleep moment that head touched pillow when steward came to call at seven bell gale be still raging furiously about four bell in forenoon watch break in sky appeared to windward shortly afterwards there be noticeable decrease in strength of wind meanwhile break in cloud widened patch of blue sky appeared here there extending rapidly when noon arrived be able to get meridian altitude of sun conclusively demonstrated truth of surmise that be anchored in rocca group rock sheltered be forty foot high about twenty acre in extent situate nearly in middle of northern anchorage astern of at distance of four mile lay cayo grande with cayo de sal about same distance on larboard beam now that be daylight be perfectly simple easy matter to identify surroundings with aid of chart by time that dinner be over gale have so far moderated that in sheltered position have become perfectly safe to lower boat therefore ordered away gig taking ship telescope with landed upon rock have afforded so welcome timely shelter climbed to summit to see whether portion of wreck of unfortunate stranger have be in company with during preceding night still hung together to surprise found that quite considerable portion of be visible indeed at time appeared to must see almost if not whole of hull a be eight mile distant must not be at certain of sea appeared to be still breaking heavily over at time seemed to have beaten almost entirely across reef there being little broken water between to circumstance attributed fact that be still in existence spent quite hour upon summit of rock gazing upon strange wild scene by be surrounded when at length rejoined boat wind have moderated to extent although be still rather too strong for eight mile pull to windward there be reason why must not sail a far out a wreck to see whether of crew still survived therefore returned to schooner procuring boat mast sail started upon expedition be rather late in getting away so that took until within hour of sunset to work up to wreck even then must not approach nearer than within cable length because of broken water got near enough to enable to make out that be armed ship have look of small frigate took to be spanish although hull be not nearly so much battered about a have expected must be there be sign of life aboard at be not surprised when looked at broad belt of still angry surf through have beaten saw enough to determine to pay wreck visit before leaving group accordingly when got back to schooner saunders have made ataunto once more during absence made arrangement to weigh beat up to wreck immediately after breakfast next morning by daylight wind have dwindled away to gentle breeze while sea have gone down to such extent anticipated difficulty whatever in boarding wreck be disappointed for when reached craft shortly after six bell in forenoon sea be no longer breaking over even round breaker now being confined to outer fringe of reef imagine if can astonishment at seeing man wretched ragged scarecrow of fellow looked to be on poop who a drew near began to wave signal to with frantic energy appeared to be desperately afraid that have not seen that having seen must still not trouble to take off for be waving large dark cloth when first made out continued to do so until boat be almost alongside bumped against wreck in wake of mizzen chain main fore chain be under water instant that bowman hooked on man who seemed to be only survivor of wreck came slipping sliding down steeply inclined deck until stood just above when stood for few second staring down upon in silence then cried in piercing voice say for love of god be english ay ay hearty have guessed right first time answered pray who in name of fortune be what ship be for answer fellow plumped down upon knee clasped hand before lifted up eye to heaven by movement of lip supposed to be engaged in prayer thanksgiving one two of men in boat with laughed third must need display wit by calling out profane jest silenced sharply for there be intense abandonment in strange man manner behaviour showed to be under influence of extraordinary emotion presently rose to foot scrambling down into boat with most astonishing activity grasped hand pressed to lip fervently then looked in face said oh sir thank god most humbly heartily for great mercy to poor miserable sinner will take away with sir will not leave aboard here to fall into hand of enemy again sir sir be englishman say tongue be english have kind good face sir take with make slave if will let not fall into hand of incarnate fiend spaniard again have fear good fellow answered of course will take with not a slave a shipmate if will have not yet answered question asked who be what ship be who be repeated staring wildly at why used to be called isaac hoard to home in exmouth among shipmate for last five year ever since have be in hand of accursed spaniard have known other name than heretico ' ship reiterated be spanish yes sir be spanish answered poor fellow who looked half mad a well a haggard thin almost like skeleton be fine frigate forty eight hour ago named magdalena now vengeance of god have fallen upon crew lie wreck while one of have perished gone to own place how happens that survive while rest of crew have perished demanded by mercy of god inhumanity of spaniard answered made slave of crew at whose beck call be from beginning of morning watch until four bell in first watch when day work be over used to lock into cell under forecastle so that when ship struck be unable to rush on deck with rest of so life be saved well said appears that have story to tell may be well worth listening to at future time now tell do know where frigate be last from whither be bound yes answered hoard can tell that sir sailed from cartagena five day ago be bound to cadiz with despatch at least such be talk among crew with despatch ejaculated good now do happen to know where despatch be to be found sir answered hoard have never be abaft mainmast until to day if will believe even know cap'n name expect despatch will be in cabin along with other paper of value that may have have in possession quite so most likely be remarked will go on board give craft overhaul jump on deck couple of to lend hand in case must need catch turn with painter somewhere so saying climbed up on ship poop with considerable difficulty owing to exceedingly steep slope of deck made way to companion descended at foot of ladder found confronted by bulkhead a soon found partitioned off captain quarter from other part of ship opening door faced entered fine handsome cabin magnificently fitted up very little damaged except that two gun have evidently be in seemed to have broken adrift gone through vessel side gun on weather side having smashed handsome mahogany table to smithereens in passage athwart cabin there be stain of wet on sofa on lee side on carpeted deck showing that water have entered through breach in ship side that with smashed table hole in side constituted visible damage in cabin there be bulkhead in front of with open door in through caught glimpse of stern window together with certain indication that cabin into be looking be in probability captain state room here if anywhere thought must be most likely to find despatch constituted chief object of search accordingly made way into after cabin handsome roomy cot slung on starboard side confirmed impression that must be captain private sanctum at once looked round for likely receptacle for paper of importance other article of value have not far to look close to door against bulkhead stood massive handsome cabinet writing table so placed that light from stern window must fall over sitter shoulder on to table right up against starboard side of ship stood large chest of drawer with top arranged a dressing table against port side be book case with glazed door three four of pane of glass being smashed so completely that several of volume have tumbled out on to floor took up one two of book opened must make nothing of content being in spanish be sealed language to book case be full of book from top to bottom so be clear that be useless to look there for document desired to find therefore turned to next nearest object be writing table be fitted with sloping top evidently lifted nest of capacious drawer occupied back of affair above writing desk while large cupboard on side formed base with room for man leg between two tried top cupboard drawer be locked article be so solidly constructed that at once saw must be useless to think of breaking open without proper tool therefore sang out to two men on deck to take boat return to schooner for carpenter bidding bring with everything necessary to pick number of lock otherwise open drawer cupboard while boat be gone turned attention to dressing table chapter twenty two hoard communicates to very important information too be very substantial handsomely made piece of furniture material being spanish mahogany unlike writing table drawer be unlocked opening one after other found to be full of apparel shirt of finest linen silk stocking brand new suit of uniform coat breech in short everything necessary to complete toilet of man in very pink of fashion hanging by belt from one of several brass hook screwed to bulkhead saw very handsome sword with gold hilt took down examined drawing weapon from sheath to do so blade proved to be of toledo make magnificent piece of steel so elastic that by exerting considerable amount of strength succeeded in bringing point hilt together when released blade at once straightened out again a perfectly a before experiment steel be elaborately damascened with most beautiful intricate pattern in gold altogether weapon so irresistibly took fancy that unhesitatingly appropriated forthwith shirt stocking too few other article of clothing looked a if must fit promised to make very welcome addition to rather meagre wardrobe so made up into good sized bundle for transference to schooner by time that be done boat be alongside again with carpenter presently that individual came clawing way below with tool showed what wanted done immediately set to work so substantially put together be table so strong intricate lock appertaining to that man be compelled to virtually take whole affair to piece before must get at content trouble be amply worth taking for found despatch locked in iron box sealed with great seal of governor of cartagena together with several other important looking document subsequently proved to be of utmost value in fact a knowledge of spanish be altogether too imperfect to admit of determining what paper be valuable be valueless took one must find be not however there be five order what be knew not be handsome enough being elaborately set with superb jewel to show that late captain of magdalena be man of very considerable distinction also magnificent pair of long barrelled pistol barrel of be damascened like sword last not least oaken casket strongly bound with heavy handsomely worked iron clamp hinge also sealed with seal of governor of cartagena upon being broken open be found to contain quantity of uncut gem among recognised ruby of extraordinary size fire valuable needle to say unhesitatingly appropriated for twofold reason that if did not must certainly go to bottom of sea when ship broke up a probably must in few day in next place be spoil of enemy to of sword fish have a valid title a anybody having at length thoroughly ransacked captain cabin proceeded to overhaul rest of ship devoting indeed practically whole day to work nothing else be found worthy of mention except chest containing thousand gold spanish dollar in what took to be purser room a for rest of ship everywhere forward of stump of mainmast be so strained battered a to be nothing better than basket water washing in out of a lay removed from wreck dollar casket of gem few other matter seemed to be worth taking still have daylight enough left to find way out through northern channel sunset night therefore found once more at sea heading for jamaica having determined to place despatch other document found on board wreck in admiral hand without loss of time trade wind be again blowing blowing strong too so that by carrying on night day made passage in exactly three day almost to minute from roccas have satisfaction of handing despatch to admiral same night jolly old fellow be at dinner when presented be entertaining number of officer naval military upon name being announced at once ordered to be admitted directed knife fork to be placed on table for received with much cordiality also introduced to guest must see that presence be deemed intrusion by most of naval men especially who be not only jealous of privateersman be also very much inclined to look down upon a inferior being to there be one two exception however notably honourable augustus montague first lieutenant of frigate calypso then in port former most amiable genial young officer with nonsense at about while lieutenant mr birdwood be a fine fellow in way a have ever met admiral thanked most warmly for despatch handed over at once to secretary for translation have intense satisfaction of learning before left pen night that document be deemed of sufficient importance to justify immediate despatch to england by frigate admiral be kind enough to invite to sleep at pen excused fact being that schooner rigging needed overhauling supply of store water required replenishing therefore slept in kingston that night having arranged first thing next morning for supply of store water went aboard to give order to send down topmast have rigging lifted interview with man that have taken off wreck of spanish frigate suddenly altered plan way that came about be reached schooner about ten o'clock in morning at once gave order to mr saunders who forthwith set hand to work then went below to cabin to write letter home to be forwarded by frigate be to take spanish despatch whilst be thus engaged timid hesitating knock came to door come in shouted forthwith entered man hoard carefully closing door behind beg pardon cap'n bowen for interrupting began there be matter must like to speak to about if ai making too bold not at hoard answered be matter important wo wait see be very busy just now can give a long a like afternoon well sir answered man fidgeting uneasily with cap be for to say whether be important not be about galleon be loading at cartagena for spain understandin ' that schooner be privateer thought that maybe 'd like to have try for if so sir 'd advise beggin ' pardon for bein ' so bold not to start so much a rope yarn of vessel rigging mayhap will be too late for galleon by george man exclaimed be important news indeed why in world did not speak to about before well sir answered see way of be five year ago belonged to brig mary rose of plymouth be slaver in one of run across to coast caught fire burnt out of took to boat two day afterwards boat be in bein separated from others in strong breeze be picked up by spanish ship called san sebastian be taken on to cartagena be wild set can tell perhaps be wildest wickedest of lot offended spaniard because scoffed laughed at for plumpin ' down on marrow bone prayin ' in stiffish gale that fell in with instead of goin ' to work to shorten sail take care of ship mate did that for while prayed 'd offended mortally never forgave so first thing that doe when arrived at cartagena be to denounce a heretic be clapped into prison what happened to mate never knowed never saw of 'em again a for if will believe sir five year have be in hand of spaniard have be in hell wanted to convert so said way that went about be to make life burden to put to work in chain on road sent into country away from coast to work in mine even tortured if will believe cap'n bowen saw poor fellow eye grow wild begin to blaze a spoke of suffering for four year never have chain off hand leg except when be bein ' tortured there continued pulling together did come down into cabin to tell about sufferin will tell sir that by god mercy same sufferin did convert not sort of conversion that spaniard wanted to bring about conversion humbly trust have caused to see repent of former wicked life not what old adam be strong in yet at time sir wo deny be never stronger than when think of wrong sufferin that have endured at spaniard hand be just nothin ' else be kept lip closed while about galleon be told sir that must forgive enemy return good for evil be exactly what have be trying to do ever since set foot aboard of schooner a soon a ever came to myself be able to understand 'd escaped from enemy be once more safe under flag of dear old england devil come to say now time isaac to be revenged upon enemy to pay off for little of misery that have be makin suffer five year that have in power know that be goin ' to send away galleon hopin ' by keepin ' well to south'ard will escape capture know too that cargo to be rich one over above cargo be to ship astonishin quantity of gold precious stone brought down to coast from peru of course know that cap'n bowen lad lay wait for maybe get if be to tell about if be to get only think what blow loss of 'd be to spaniard why 'ud be so tremendous heavy that 'ud go good way towards payin ' off for that have made suffer 'ud be fine bit of revenge now must ' now know well enough that cravin ' for revenge be wrong have be fightin ' against with strength somehow wo do cap'n wo do temptation be too great for miserable sinner be smote forehead despairingly with hand feel that ca keep quiet let galleon slip by gold jewel that be goin ' to ship have be dragged out of god earth by god creature with sufferin tear blood more than man can measure say that ai right that spaniard must have if heap of treasure be to get safely across atlantic into spaniard treasure chest must just encourage to strive for more then there must be more tear more blood more despair more life rendered burden curse to owner if treasure that keep sendin ' across to old spain be to be taken from then perhaps 'd cease to collect poor unhappy wretch who be made to dig for must have peace above beyond want cowardly cur to suffer in return for sufferin that have inflicted upon thousand be good deal better than love wealth then make 'em suffer by takin ' from 'em love life make suffer horror of death by goin ' against with fire steel let know pain horror despair of feelin that be not only goin ' to lose treasure that stand good chance to lose life a well above cap'n let be there to witness anguish taunted gloated over when 'd made misery such that begged to finish off at once have done with now want to pay off of debt to 'em do be really terrible to witness frenzy of passion fury into unhappy man goaded a recalled past suffering spoke of who have made endure eye gleamed flashed like of savage beast face went deadly pale lip contracted into snarl showed clenched teeth actually foamed from mouth at last hand clawed air a though saw spaniard before be reaching for throat thought duty to check so maniacal intensity of hatred said to come come hoard will never do understood to say just now that have be converted from error of way have become christian do call christian like to hate with such intensity a exhibit bible say that must love enemy bless who curse do good to who despitefully use how do reconcile present feeling with such injunction a ah groaned sinking back upon locker from have risen in excitement have there sir ca reconcile be just where be ca forgive enemy ca love 'em ca bring to do good to 'em have tried have kept lip closed have prayed have done that man can do be good will never be able to rest until have seen cruel haughty overbearin wretch brought low be enemy of god man because drive poor weak soul to curse maker for permittin ' such cruelty have done over over again good lord forgive sir ai in man power to forgive spaniard who be got into power ca believe that impossibility be expected of believe that passage quoted just now be ever meant to apply to spaniard at well said be afraid that question be altogether too difficult one for to argue with have better see clergyman discus whole matter with have wandered somewhat from original subject be galleon what more can tell about when be to sail be said answered hoard that be to sail exactly fortnight after magdalena be why have made so bold a to come down tell about now if start to overhaul rigging be afraid that will not be ready in time to catch be big ship sir close upon sixteen hundred ton must call ought to know for magdalena laid within cable length of for more than week be heavily armed too mount twenty eight eighteen pound carronades carry on book complement of close upon two hundred men name be nostra senora del carmen ah answered musingly then be likely to prove pretty tough customer not too tough for schooner crew sir exclaimed hoard eagerly why sir one englishman be equal to six spaniard day a to gun little management will keep schooner out of way of shot besides sir suppose 'd engage in regular hammer tongs fight proper way will be to let pas ahead then run alongside carry by boardin ' will be slow ship from look of for lord sake continued anxiously go to say to think that be too big for if think that be get man o ' war to help have only to repeat in proper quarter what have told will be certain to get help want doubt interrupted drily if undertake matter at will undertake single handed meanwhile be so well worth consideration will countermand order for overhauling rigging so if have nothing more to tell at present hoard just ask mate to step below will ay will most gladly sir answered hoard be quite sure cap'n bowen continued pausing with hand upon handle of door that when have have time to think about matter will make up mind to have try for senora with turned left cabin presently in obedience to message saunders came down gave instruction then proceeded with letter have to considerably abbreviate in consequence of rather heavy demand hoard have made upon time however got finished in time for calypso be vessel selected by admiral for conveyance of spanish despatch to england have satisfaction of placing in hand of honourable augustus montague of receiving assurance that must undertake to forward to destination upon arrival home during afternoon boat came alongside schooner with note from admiral inviting to dine with evening invitation being accentuated by statement that have news of importance for despatched acceptance by boat have brought information in due time once more found within hospitable portal of pen a usual room be full of guest after dinner host found opportunity to invite into office for short time when learned that important news referred to in note of invitation consisted simply of intelligence gleaned from spanish document taken by out of wreck of magdalena confirming hoard story of galleon have told for twofold reason said admiral when have read out from translation extract relating to galleon in first place be a usual without ship upon can lay hand departure of calypso to day depriving of only vessel have in fit state to go to sea in next place a brought news think only right that must be one to profit by so there be if will take advice will not remain in port single hour longer than be absolutely necessary may miss if what paper state be true a have doubt be be ship worth taking good deal of trouble to find thanked admiral for information deemed best to let understand be indebted to only for detail shortly afterwards took leave having suddenly made up mind to sail same night if found that store water have be sent aboard afternoon a promised reached schooner about half past ten o'clock found hand excepting mate turned in saunders be considerably surprised to see a did not expect aboard night upon questioning with regard to store water informed that have come alongside almost immediately after departure for kingston there be consequently reason why must delay moment within hour have got up anchor be bowling away to southward westward before land breeze before daylight high land of jamaica have sunk beneath horizon have caught trade wind now became necessary for to form sort of plan of operation for purpose determined to consult with hoard a soon therefore a have secured sight for longitude after breakfast sent for came down into cabin have sent for hoard said because a doubt already guess have made up mind to have try for galleon a understood to say that have spent time ashore at near cartagena occurs to that may be able to furnish with valuable information want to ask first whether while be in cartagena harbour heard anything said that might lead to suppose spaniard deem so far possible that news of galleon may have spread far enough to lead to captain taking extra precaution against capture by steering course right out to sea instead of making best of way to eastward along land a far a say point gallina think cap'n understand what be in thought answered man sir never heard anything that 'ud seemed to point to imaginin ' that news of ship be likely to get to enemy ear at same time doubt from what be rumoured about amount of treasure that be to ship that skipper will do everything wit will teach to keep out of road of cruiser privateer however ai very valuable information to give because will have guessed a much a be afraid that ai able to tell more except that will never do for schooner to be seen dodgin ' about anywheres near cartagena if be seen once suppose harm must come of especially if happened to be under fairish amount of canvas because 'ud probably be supposed that be bound south to gulf of darien if must happen to be seen twice 'ud be up with for time at least 'd be pretty sure to delay sailin send something out to watch a to cuttin ' out cap'n be afraid must be done besides 'ud be use to try unless treasure be aboard suppose will ship that until hatch be on be ready for sea so that can up anchor make start directly last ingot hoisted in quite so assented will doubt be mode of procedure on other hand may be ready for sea even to having treasure on board yet not sail for day two because be quite clear to that for reason other believe galleon to have very fair prospect of safely reaching destination must keep back until must send home under convoy now if entertain belief a that seems to highly probable that of big official will embrace so apparently safe opportunity to take passage home in might not be ready quite so soon a ship now if must happen what be to prevent cutting out do happen to know what cartagena harbour be like sir inquired hoard beginning answer to question by asking said have never be near have ever seen chart of of course have sir answered companion for simple reason that spaniard wo let chart of be made for fear that must get into enemy hand can tell what be like sir be about eight mile long with width varyin from four mile down to about one half be completely landlocked by island of tierra bomba form seaward face of there be only one channel called boca chica about cable length wide by ship can get in out just abreast narrowest part of here channel there be battery called san fernando battery mounting twelve sixty eight pounder so see sir that cuttin ' ship out of cartagena harbour ai to be thought of be there other fort battery anywhere along shore of harbour asked thought flitting back to exploit at abervrach sir answered hoard in surprise at question 'd find san fernando more than enough if be to try to get in be always on watch whenever there be craft headin ' for harbour wo let pas until port cap'n have be off to be satisfied that be right well said must have clearer information than have be able to give must ascertain precise date fixed for sailing of galleon must have look at cartagena harbour so may be able to judge for what will be best mode of action now how be to be done oh sir answered hoard so far a getting news be concerned will undertake to do for speak spanish like native contrived to make friend two here there among fisherman porter people of class in spite of priest soldier there be one man in particular named panza took blame of something that did one day when be fellow prisoner be flogged instead of being at time abeost dead with fever be fisherman life in little village of albornos four mile out of cartagena will do anything for know nobody exceptin ' prison authority know that be shipped off aboard magdalena so all have got to do be to get ashore make way to hut tellin ' that have escaped from prison god know be truth will hide a long a like to stay with tell news into bargain well perhaps that might be managed if be not afraid to venture back among enemy said lord bless sir ai afraid not bit of answered hoard priest soldier belief to be aboard magdalena so a long a keep out of sight will take precious good care to do will be right very well then said can settle detail of scheme later on next question be how be to get view of cartagena harbour ah sir that will be very difficult dangerous matter be reply yet continued correcting know what may be done without so very much risk a'ter if weather be favourable only way that must do must be to land durin ' night on tierra bomba remain on island day viewin ' harbour from top of hill stand pretty nearly in centre of island 'd have to conceal among bush a there be very few people movin ' about on island 'd not be so very likely to be seen then boat have to come ashore for next night schooner have to be kept well in offing during daytime must be able to obtain good uninterrupted view of harbour from point name demanded first rate sir must be better answered harbour be spread out like map below ye 'd see from one end to t'other of ay 'd see galleon lying in small inner then will risk exclaimed decisively there be new moon coming on in about week time so that night will be dark therefore favourable to adventure thank hoard be want with now will have chat with when reach coast chapter twenty three plan most daring hazardous enterprise run across to main be uneventful on sixth morning out from port royal made point gallina arriving off cartagena twenty hour afterwards by great good luck weather happened to be favourable for immediate embarkation upon adventure so after further final chat with schooner be headed in for land night be dark a pitch sky being overcast there be gentle breeze blowing off land affording smooth water for delicate operation of landing there be time to be lost wanting only four hour to daylight by time must be necessary that schooner must have secured good offing so having under hoard pilotage stood in until lead gave twenty one fathom at point hoard informed that might consider mile from land gig be lowered with crew armed to teeth shoved off second mate being in charge with hoard sitting on side of in stern sheet former still acting a pilot paddled gently in with muffled oar in course of about ten minute boat gently grounded on narrow strip of smooth sandy beach at base of low rugged cliff in willow bay here hoard landed second mate receiving instruction to be at same spot with boat small supply of cooked provision night at midnight to remain couple of hour when if saw nothing of of be to return to schooner until next night stood on beach until boat have shoved off again be lost in darkness when turned away hoard leading proceeded to climb face of cliff be by mean difficult matter a ground although somewhat precipitous be grass grown thickly dotted with low sturdy bush five minute sufficed to reach top when found facing hillside rising on right to very respectable height however be not hill to hoard have alluded in conversation with to reach latter must have to walk about mile informed so having paused for minute two to get breath after unwonted exertion struck inland passing over spur of hill on right dipping down into willow valley along passed steering southerly course for pair of steep lofty hill summit of be within mile of other more southerly of two be one for be bound hour steady climbing carried to top of when lay down in long grass among bush regardless of insect possible reptile snatched catnap while waited for daylight at daybreak roused up making way to clear space on very summit of hill looked abroad at scene seaward ocean stretched away vast plain of delicate blue to horizon twenty mile in offing made out speck of white gleaming in brilliant morning sun decided must be schooner then turning back upon sea have hilly foreground of island before sloping away to right left in front of down to smooth placid water of spacious harbour on right be boca chica only entrance to harbour narrow winding channel with sort of bar at inner extremity whereon hoard informed there be scarcely four fathom of water nevertheless viewed from elevation occupied navigation of channel appeared simple enough submerged sand bank on side of showing up quite clearly through blue water at inner extremity of channel lie outer harbour sheet of water roughly circular in shape measuring four mile across in direction noticed few small shoal dotted about here there in outer harbour there be only one appeared to be at dangerous that one be to be easily avoided northern boundary of outer harbour seemed to be pretty well defined by cluster of decidedly dangerous shoal stretching right across from island of tierra bomba to mainland with fairly wide channel of deep water between north of lay what might be termed intermediate harbour be sheet of water of about area of outer harbour with good clean bottom plenty of water be formed by shoal uniting island of tierra bomba with mainland reef of rock projecting above sand rendering boca grande once main entrance to harbour quite impassable by anything larger than boat then inside again rendered especially safe snug by being inclosed by two long low projecting spit with narrow channel between be inner harbour having area of about three quarter of square mile with plenty of water for largest ship head of harbour wash wall wharf of town of cartagena indeed doe more for a hoard informed divide town into two nearly equal part tide flowing right through for distance beyond in inner harbour lay quite fleet of small coasting craft towering high among must be made out tall spar of galleon immediately in front of on opposite side of harbour country be low swampy thickly covered with scrub bush among must be made out whitewashed mud wall of village of buenavista gospique albornos in latter of hoard friend panza have habitation fishing boat from village be dotted over bay have probably be out night having pointed out to several object of interest in noble scene stretched around companion intimated that time have arrived for to leave a intended to get passage across to mainland forthwith then make way to town for purpose of acquiring information cautioned to keep bright look out for chance straggler to carefully avoid for assured that if discovered must certainly be dragged off to town probably meet with same fate that have suffered finally undertook to return if possible next night to spot whereon then stood adding must fail to appear be not to be alarmed watched make way down hillside lost sight of among bush finally made out again with aid of glass just a be entering little hamlet on harbour shore of island watched sauntering hither thither among dozen so of hut composed hamlet saw engage in conversation with several people at length observed making way down to beach accompanied by couple of men trio entered boat pushed off watched crazy craft heading straight across harbour to village of gospique from whence concluded must make best of way to albornos have now rest of day before in to look round make observation determined to do so to utmost extent of ability be by time hungry thirsty so before doing anything else sought out comfortable spot in shadow of clump of bush sat down to discus portion of viand have be careful to bring with then meal finished produced pencil paper proceeded to very carefully draw map of harbour preserving a accurately a must just proportion of feature marking shoal in proper place a also battery guarding entrance channel position of village dotted here there along shore have taken precaution to bring small pocket compass with found most useful a mean of laying down bearing of various feature from point of observation by drawing whole roughly to scale judging distance a accurately a possible freely using pocket compass found that by end of day have secured sketch map have appearance of being fairly accurate not soul came near throughout day several small craft passed out of into harbour afforded verification of hoard statement a to extraordinary precaution observed by authority one of being obliged to heave to until boat from battery have boarded large ship apparently spanish indiaman also arrived pretty late in afternoon so have opportunity of witnessing for manner in such craft made way through channel to inner anchorage at length when sun be within hour of setting observed fishing boat under sail emerge from among group of islet block approach to village of albornos presently became evident that be making for island on highest point of be perched brought telescope to bear upon for time be unable to distinguish occupant sail being in way at length however one of moved forward stood for few minute under lee of sail boat being by time more than half way across be able to recognise ragged habiliment worn by hoard when took off wreck of magdalena have resumed for occasion sun be just dipping beneath western horizon shadow of island of tierra bomba have enshrouded water of harbour in soft dusk when boat entered willow lagoon at north eastern extremity of island grounded on low swampy shore saw hoard disembark stand talking with companion for few minute then boat shoved off again made way to about mid channel when crew doused sail proceeded to shoot net meanwhile have lost sight of hoard behind hill lay between lagoon where have landed saw more of until suddenly appeared against star lit sky only few pace from well sir said a ranged up alongside have got news for mistake greatly doubt whether will be very acceptable how so exclaimed have anything gone wrong well exactly know about gone wrong ' be reply way of be galleon be finished loadin ' hatch be on gold be expected to arrive in town to morrow evening if doe will be got aboard day after to morrow next day three hundred sojers be to be marched aboard of will then sail for europe three hundred soldier exclaimed incredulously wonder that consider vessel capable of making way home without convoy ay may well say so sir be reply seems that whole thing have be planned out for long time three hundred sojers be to go home a invalid so hear relief have arrived to day in injieman mayhap saw come into harbour a'ternoon be be expected three week so friend panza tell well said be a say news indeed be most fortunate thing that came ashore a did have simply dodged off on waiting for galleon to come out three hundred soldier must have done for say that gold train be expected to arrive to morrow be expectation pure conjecture have reason for oh have reason enough for sir so understand answered hoard see shippin off of here gold be talk of town nobody thinkin ' of anything else everything that happens concernin ' be knowed at once over place be how got news panza have heard about a soon a see start talkin ' about not knowin ' 'd be shipped off in magdalena just let talk puttin ' in question here there until 'd found out about a to gold train think there be much doubt about because news in town be that runner came in from barranca morning with message from commandant that train have arrived there last night might be expected at cartagena time to morrow most likely pretty late in evening be wondering whether 'ud be possible for to lay in wait for train somewhere on road get hold of gold way plan ai good because three hundred sojers be to go home in ship be comin ' down with sixty men again three hundred be rather long odds yes agreed too long for purpose at event for have doubt that rascal must make stubborn fight for even if must succeed in capturing gold must certainly lose good number of men while want to get gold ship too without loss at if can be managed ay sir answered hoard see how can well have plan said perhaps with knowledge of place will be able to tell what chance there be of being successful first of do happen to know how many men be stationed in battery there that guard entrance channel yes sir think can tell pretty nearly answered hoard because d 'ye see afore be sent aboard magdalena be one of slave have to man water boat took daily supply of fresh water there bein ' none on island how many men well must say that countin ' hand officer men together there be matter of nigh on to eighty of more than sir certainly not more than eighty call eighty will not be very far wrong over mark trifle if anything very well then said be plan say that gold be to be put aboard galleon day after to morrow fact of shipment must be absolutely established in order that may be so propose that will remain ashore if think can do so without fear of discovery witness for loading of then when be aboard ship will make best of way across to island wait for at spot where landed last night will come ashore with boat whole of crew except idler fully armed then if gold have be shipped will land on little strip of sandy beach at seaward end of channel noticed to day march across point take battery spiking gun when be done will pull up harbour board galleon carry out to sea before soldier be embarked very thing sir very thing exclaimed hoard delightedly what fool be not to think of simple plan a yes sir will do doubt sojers be sure not to be put aboard night will give day two to rest after journey down country not for sake of men sir because officer will want then think that plan will do asked yes sir do have doubt about be confident answer then in case said will go aboard schooner to night leaving ashore to find out news can will not come ashore to morrow night because there appears to be need le frequently that schooner approach land le will be danger of discovery night after to morrow at midnight will be at spot where landed with boat fully prepared to capture battery so must find mean to meet there be quite sure that will run risk by remaining ashore oh yes sir will be right never fear for know town now know how to take care of how will manage sir supposin ' that happens to be blowin strong with wind on shore when want to land night after to morrow doe that ever happen here inquired considerably taken aback by suggestion do sometimes sir not often answered hoard mostly land breeze spring up about eight o'clock blow until about seven in mornin well answered after considering awhile in case that mention appears to that best plan will be to make boldly for channel four boat keeping abreast so a to show a little a possible let wind blow past battery land in little bay about mile inside noticed big rock only one jutting out of sand there to day must be very good spot at to meet yes sir know rock well have seen hundred of time remarked hoard ca do better sir unless wind happens to be off shore if be other plan will be best very well then be understood said now how will manage about getting back to mainland oh remarked companion will have to stay on here island night panza will keep look out for take across to morrow morning then said have better walk with a far a beach get fresh stock of provision that will bring ashore how be off for money in case must want why fact be have got be goin ' to ask to let have sir might come handy be reply happened to have few dollar have taken precaution to slip into pocket before leaving ship handed to then sauntered slowly toward spot where boat be to meet went on board schooner night devoted whole of following day to preparation for great coup setting hand to work sharpening cutlass cleaning pistol effectually muffling boat oar rowlock in fact making possible provision must think of to ensure success next day made men rest day so that might be fit for long arduous night work may be imagined that kept exceedingly anxious eye on barometer throughout day for realised that weather must have much to do with making marring of fortune on eventful night mercury remained steady in tube until close upon sunset then began to drop little drop continuing until have gone down nearly three tenth of inch scarcely knew what to make of whether to expect shift of wind strong breeze whether merely meant rain thunder storm sun however have scarcely set when got hint of what be to come in shape of bank of dark purplish slate coloured cloud began to pile along eastern horizon edge a sharply defined against clear sky a though mass have be clipped out of paper be to be treated to thunder storm pretty severe one too if promise of cloud be to be relied upon have be hove to day twenty mile in offing under mainsail jib only so that by keeping canvas low might escape observation from land although have little fear of unless anyone happened to have wandered up to top of one of hill of tierra bomba from must have be possible to see moment that sun have fairly disappeared below horizon sail be packed upon schooner proceeded to work in toward land chief anxiety now being lest thunder storm must gather break before have succeeded in effecting landing in case stood very fair chance of being discovered of finding everybody on alert to give warm reception reached in on starboard tack until be within about two mile of punta de canoas when hove about reached along land to southward by time thunder cloud have completely overspread sky be a dark a inside of cavern storm might burst upon at moment hung off however at length much to relief found close to northern extremity of tierra bomba within mile of shore be so dark that be quite impossible to see anything land merely showing a slightly deeper shadow against intense blackness of overcast sky have so thoroughly studied natural feature of harbour surroundings during day sojourn ashore now seemed to be perfectly familiar with therefore have hesitation whatever in hauling schooner in under lee of island until be actually becalmed when lead giving depth of barely four fathom let go anchor stripped schooner of canvas not furling however simply passing few turn of gasket so everything might be ready for making sail again at moment notice be now according to judgment for a have said must actually see nothing in willow bay where hoard have landed three night previously believed moreover that be so close to land a to be completely shut in hidden from north from south needle to say have long ago issued order to extinguish unnecessary light for be indispensable to be closely masked there be therefore nothing to betray to sight whereabouts a to sound sheave tackle be in least likely to be used have be so thoroughly greased that worked in absolute silence while men although shod for tramp across narrow point at southern extremity of island have lashed thick wad of oakum to sol of shoe consequently moved about deck a silently a ghost moreover boat have be so thoroughly prepared hour beforehand for expedition that there remained nothing whatever to be done to lower into water unhook tackle shove off when let go anchor still wanted good hour to midnight nevertheless so anxious be lest threatening storm must break lightning betray movement determined to man boat forthwith beach if necessary believing thus must run le risk of detection precaution must be understood be adopted not so much from apprehension of ultimate failure for have determined to have galleon because wanted to save men now summoned saunders down into cabin read over to instruction have carefully prepared for guidance during earlier part of day explained to fully then handed paper men who be to accompany on expedition be next mustered in 'tween deck sent to supper after weapon be carefully inspected liberal quantity of ammunition served out to then when have satisfied that be right made little speech explaining what purposed doing how wanted done when having enjoined to observe most absolute silence light be extinguished hand groped way on deck boat be lowered manned shoved off boat attached by painter to one ahead so that might not part company in profound darkness be presently found however that precaution be unnecessary water being so brilliantly phosphorescent a to afford guidance be needed indeed there be altogether too much luminosity to please be even closer to shore than have imagined for have not be under way five minute when gig in led way grounded upon sand a did so became aware of weird gaunt looking figure clad in rag standing at water edge close to boat stem all right cap'n be hoard sir explained figure in low hoarse whisper a sprang ashore gripped fellow by throat there be nothing to keep continued a relaxed grip upon so came right on here thinkin ' that mayhap 'd be little bit afore time must want to be kept waitin everything be just a right sir a if 'd planned whole thing gold be shipped senora have be hauled out to manzanilla anchorage ready to sail a soon a sojers be shipped to morrow morning commandant be givin ' farewell festa a call to officer to night so that chance be not one of 'em will think of goin aboard until daylight good heaven exclaimed what carelessness what folly must have thought must have be afraid to leave so vast amount of treasure unguarded why so sir demanded hoard believe that whole thing have be kept a secret a grave so must have be too for wreck of magdalena so expect such attack a be preparin ' for 'em a to anybody ashore attemptin ' to meddle with ship why 'd sooner jump overboard drownd theirselves so that ai so very wonderful a'ter to mind that belief gold to be perfectly safe besides there be san fernando battery who 'd ever dream of bein attacked took well said seems fairly reasonable a put hoard still can not understand such extraordinary lack of precaution of course be so much better for what about crew oh be aboard sir will be turned in sound asleep by time anchor watch a likely a not be reply do happen to know how many muster asked panza told that 'd heard said that full complement be two hundred twenty six men countin officer if can only manage to surprise get aboard afore alarm given reckon that will give so very much trouble answered hoard must risk that remarked now a happen to be here there be nothing to detain may therefore a well be moving sooner that get battery business over better very well sir be quite ready answered hoard suppose did happen to think of slippin ' cutlash pair of pistol anything into boat for sir continued oh yes did said thomson coxswain of gig will fit out have better come in gig with a will probably want to act a pilot right sir will do that with pleasure in life be answer therewith clambered noiselessly into boat made way aft to stern sheet where presently found with naked cutlas in hand edge of be testing with thumb mumbling satisfaction at condition now shoved off gig leading gave way at long steady stroke for southern extremity of island reached within hour although be pull of fully three mile arrived at low point leaving boat in charge of couple of men landed a be marwilling men upon beach blackness of night be momentarily dispelled by blaze of vivid lightning flashed from cloud immediately overhead almost simultaneously with flash there came crash of thunder seemed to make solid ground beneath foot vibrate tremble be horribly annoying for to advance upon battery in midst of storm of lightning be almost certainly to betray while time be now of importance being anxious to be aboard galleon not much later than two o'clock in morning that being hour when man be supposed to sleep soundest to be least liable to awake prematurely however there be nothing for to wait so hurriedly ordered men to lie down behind ridge of sand formed junction of beach with grass land there crouched with lightning flashing quivering about for fully quarter of hour then down came rain not in drop in sheet with lightning flashing darting quivering hither thither through until appeared to be enveloped in gigantic diamond so exquisitely beautiful be glancing colour of lightning through rain of course be wetted to skin in instant did not very greatly matter a pistol ammunition be carried in waterproof case moreover rain afforded excellent curtain under cover of to advance so at word from men sprang to foot pushed rapidly forward battery be quarter of mile from spot where have landed so accurately have taken bearing that in about five minute after began to move structure loomed up dark grim before hoard have informed that landward side be protected by deep moat connected with sea spanned by drawbridge be for bridge be keeping sharp look out be so close aboard of before saw that three four pace sufficed to carry to sentry box at landward end just a reached box vivid flash of lightning revealed interior there bolt upright stood tall spanish grenadier with musket resting in corner of hut close to hand realised instantly that briefest period of hesitation now meant undoing for a have seen soldier have also undoubtedly seen so man sooner stood revealed before than with one bound be in sentry box with one hand grasping throat to prevent from cry out while with other seized musket passed out to man next behind soldier struggled manfully did utmost to free throat held fast in so fierce grip ere many second be over felt sink powerless to ground to lash hand foot together like trussed fowl with own cross belt to gag with good sized stone secured in mouth by strip slashed from own coat be work of two three minute when at length satisfied that fellow be secure harmless emerged from box have satisfaction of finding that tom hardy now acting a schooner second mate have promptly followed example by securing sentry at far side of drawbridge be now consequently in possession of structure too without slightest alarm having be given to garrison in minute hand of stood inside battery be fine solid earthwork with casemates very like battery that have seized at abervrach harbour unlike french battery however casemates be open with exception of four two of be converted into officer quarter while other two constituted magazine in shelter of open casemates artilleryman be slumbering soundly in hammock despite storm with musket piled under shelter of verandah ran along front of casemates to posse ourselves of musket to heave into moat be work of few minute when be done went up on to platform with own hand effectually spiked one of gun be most unaccountable thing to that whole garrison must have slept so soundly through terrific crash roar of thunder blaze of lightning did perhaps because be accustomed to kind of disturbance a thunder be practically continuous have difficulty in carrying out operation without single clink of leather covered hammer being audible battery be now useless for hour at least since have be so fortunate a to render so without of garrison becoming wiser thought must be advantage to leave in ignorance for few hour longer therefore quietly withdrew men taking two gagged bound sentinel with effected orderly retreat to beach chapter twenty four capture of nostra senora del carmen arrived at boat lost not moment in tumbling into getting under way again for time be now precious commodity there being still journey of four mile before ere galleon must be reached once fairly clear of boca channel must be able to use sail have taken precaution to have placed in boat then must make good progress while men must be resting first question for consideration however be what to do with two prisoner be speedily settled by hoard who suggested that must be landed upon small islet called brujas island situate on opposite side of harbour lying little out of regular way did of course first casting loose taking gag out of mouth although be thus freed from actual physical restraint remained a harmless a before so far a be concerned for brujas island be uninhabited separated from mainland by two channel although only narrow be so dangerous in consequence of shark with harbour be infested that spaniard be not at likely to imperil life by attempting to swim there be therefore harmless enough so far a be concerned until morning when probably passing fisherman might be attracted by cry must release whether released not have very little fear that must attempt to return to battery give alarm there fact that have allowed to be surprised made prisoner must be accounted by officer unpardonable crime probability be that when released from island must take to forest make for interior to escape punishment by time that have landed two unfortunate men thunder storm have passed away to seaward crash of thunder have become modulated to booming rumble steady drenching downpour of rain have set in cloud overhead however be not nearly so heavy black a have be previous to outbreak of storm there be sufficient light to enable to see where be going accordingly shoved off from brujas in high spirit hoisting sail headed up harbour land wind be blowing although not very strongly when have be under way about hour began to look out for galleon hoard be first to see probably because knew best of where to look for moment that be sighted gig sail be lowered a signal for other boat to close round immediately did when repeated in low voice order have already given before leaving schooner in order that man might know exactly what duty be expected of do then having thus refreshed man memory gave order to draw cutlass paddle quietly alongside few minute sufficed to take to galleon fine stately noble looking craft be towering out of water like line of battle ship lofty mast wide spreading yard seeming to pierce sky lose among few star now came twinkling mistily out here there overhead got alongside without being challenged to great surprise half of boarding to port other half to starboard in le than minute be on deck gliding softly noiselessly a shadow here there securing fore scuttle others companion sky light while others again be briskly swarming up shroud to loose canvas carpenter with axe specially sharpened for occasion at once stationing by cable ready to cut at sign from while two men placed at ponderous highly ornamented wheel singular circumstance that have succeeded in getting alongside without being challenged be fully accounted for by fact that not single soul be on deck when have glided in over galleon lofty bulwark if anchor watch have be set men composing have a hoard have predicted quietly ignored duty in absence of officer by turning in leaving ship to take care of surprise be complete galleon have fallen into hand without so much a single blow being struck of course there be crew below to be reckoned with still meanwhile be close prisoner asleep even in event of awaking at once proceeding to force way on deck must be time ere must be able to break out by time if went well must be far enough from neighbourhood of town to render prospect of assistance from quarter practically out of question what most feared be that somebody on board one of many craft be anchored in immediate vicinity might notice operation of loosing setting galleon canvas suspecting something to be wrong man boat go ashore to give alarm in case must soon have three four swift galley after when be likely enough to find in exceedingly awkward scrape that however be danger that have to face after be not so very great for if anchor watch be being kept on board galleon how much le likely be that watch must be kept on board comparatively valueless coaster by be surrounded have carefully explained to crew beforehand what be that have to do have also given instruction that whole of work be to be carried forward in absolute silence one calling out unless necessity for so doing be urgent consequently from moment when first dropped in over bulwark not sound save soft patter of muffled foot be heard aboard galleon until first topsail then course be let fall when of course there arose sound of canvas fluttering in wind to excited imagination seemed loud enough to wake dead then came sharp cheep cheep of sheaf upon pin a topsail be sheeted home yard mast headed followed by still louder flapping of canvas a jib be hoisted then came dull heavy crunch of carpenter axe a smote at cable suppose be sound awakened galleon crew for while carpenter be still hacking away there arose from interior of fore scuttle loud knocking muffled sound of voice angrily demanding that hatch must be lifted hoard however have be standing by in expectation of something of sort moment that there came pause in knocking shouting heard informing prisoner that ship be in hand of english unless spaniard immediately ceased row whole lot of must be quickly subjected to certain dreadful pain penalty imperfectly understood threat however have desired effect of quieting prisoner who promptly subsided into silence be somewhat difficult matter to get so big ship under way in rather thickly crowded anchorage be obliged at outset to make rather long complicated stern board entailed two three very narrow shave of fouling one of craft be in way sky however be clearing fast star be shining brightly through great rapidly increasing rift in cloud affording enough light to see what be about moreover land breeze be piping up strong whistling shrilly through rigging so that a soon a be able to swing yard get headway upon lumbering old wagon of craft managed well enough contrived to scrape clear of everything too without attracting very serious amount of attention only one hail apparently from somebody more than half drunk saluting a glided with slow stately movement out of anchorage toward somewhat contracted passage between island of tierra bomba main once fairly clear of anchorage shipping encumbered crowded sail upon old hooker be soon booming down toward chain of shoal at rate of fully seven knot now hoard once more made useful by undertaking to pilot through shoal did very successfully hugging brujas island pretty closely then bearing almost square away for boca chica channel short half hour sufficed to carry to inner end of here utmost vigilance be called into play in navigation of sharply winding passage managed to achieve successfully still being dark silent in san fernando battery a passed after anxious ten minute have satisfaction of feeling nostra senora del carmen rising falling ponderously upon swell of open caribbean in anticipation of possibility that might be pursued now shaped course due west right off land that being in opinion direction in be least likely to be looked for when have be running to leeward for about hour have made offing of nearly four mile burned three portfires simultaneously a preconcerted signal to schooner that be well that be to follow hour later came foaming up on weather quarter hailed now hove to sent alongside boat have hitherto be towing astern a soon a be hoisted in filled away once more still standing straight off land so that when day dawned have satisfaction of finding that have run coast out of sight have of course long ere secured prisoner numbering in two hundred twenty six men now problem be how to get rid of for did not at care to have so many men aboard who must require to be constantly watched in order that might not rise upon overpower at unguarded moment happily problem be soon solved for about noon sighted trading felucca bound from porto bello to santa marta schooner brought to a proved to be fine roomy craft hove to lowered boat transhipped prisoner into despite protest of unhappy captain who called saint to witness that food have on board must not suffice to feed so many men more than couple of day at most objection met by pointing out to that must bear up for tolu on gulf of morrosquillo must easily fetch in twenty four hour so left to settle matter in whichever way seemed best to a soon a have parted company with felucca be fairly under way again set to work to search for treasure of actual presence of on board have a yet have time to satisfy hoard be of opinion that must be found stowed away in strong room beneath cabin deck in position usually occupied by lazarette there sure enough found room solidly built structure of hard timber fully six inch thick plated with iron door being secured by three massive iron bar passed through thick iron band secured at end by heavy iron padlock six in keyhole of be sealed with great seal size of palm of hand seal broke without particle of hesitation reverence for great personage who have caused to be placed there then instituted hunt for key resulted a have feared must in failure key be doubtless at moment at cartagena in possession of unfortunate captain of ship in hand of official to whose custody treasure have be confided there be nothing for therefore to set armourer to work upon padlock by dint of hard work managed to get off door open by eight bell in afternoon watch room when opened proved to be apartment measuring about five foot way be lined inside a well a outside with thick sheet of iron be more than half full of gold ingot be to say ingot be packed in row of twenty athwart room there be five row of twenty constituting tier ingot be stored eight tier high so that if lower tier contained same number of ingot a top tier a be pretty certain to be case there be eight hundred ingot of solid gold weighing approximately hundredweight ingot being made uniformly of size weight in order that might be conveniently transported from mine to coast by mean of train of indian be struck dumb with astonishment admiration a stood gazing at pile of dingy package ingot being tightly sewn up in wrapper of raw hide must scarcely believe eye for moment twenty ton of gold why there be fabulous fortune before reckoned value roughly found that at then ruling price of gold value of package before approximated well on toward three million sterling be there be heavy oaken iron bound case measuring about two foot square by about foot half high presumed contained uncut gem hoard have told be to be sent home in lumbering old treasure tub man alive when came to realise in measure approximate value of wealth tell be frightened fairly terrified to think be now responsible for for upon devolved task of conveying enormous wealth safely across ocean delivering into hand of owner to be by subdivided into share to of be entitled believe never realised so vividly a at moment manifold peril of sea peril of fire of tempest of shipwreck of enemy to think that have be intrusted to bottom under most favourable circumstance must hardly be expected to get up speed of ten knot consequently be open to capture by first fast sailing picaroon happened to fall in with be positively frightful to merely contemplate such very likely eventuality thank goodness thought that danger be easily provided against going on deck immediately ordered ship to be hove to launch hoisted out also signalled schooner to close be lovely evening water quite smooth gentle westerly breeze blowing determined therefore to seize opportunity to transfer whole of treasure to sword fish in hold of craft considered must be far safer than where be then that done determined to make way first to jamaica to pick up few more hand to help in working galleon then to make best of way home without risking loss of by engaging in more fighting however tempting might be opportunity men went to work cheerily easily divining motive for transhipping treasure being of course in own degree a anxious for safety a be moreover galleon launch be fine big lump of boat so managed to tranship whole get safely stowed away before sundown night resumed command of schooner turned command of galleon over to saunders who be thoroughly steady reliable fellow at midnight a arranged by prior to leaving galleon craft hauled up to northward for jamaica then found that so slow be galleon with wind anywhere on quarter schooner under mainsail stay foresail jib be quite able to keep pace with even when be carrying topgallant sail above galleon set nothing promised long wearisome voyage across atlantic doubly justified in transhipping treasure to schooner nevertheless looked forward with great deal of pride to day when must take prize into weymouth harbour be early day however to think of a yet for there be whole of atlantic two third of caribbean between ourselves home with who must say how many chance of shipwreck capture before distance must be traversed a though to enforce recollection of latter contingency more effectively upon dawn next morning revealed long snake like two masted craft hovering five mile to windward by by made out to be one of pestilent war galley be apt to prove such formidable antagonist to give so much trouble in such moderate weather a be then experiencing judged that galley be under sail when first sighted have come out from cartagena in search of from fact that did not at once bear down upon hung persistently to windward conjectured that be not alone that have one more consort somewhere to windward that upon fully identifying galleon must lower sail out sweep be off to windward for help to tackle be most anxious to prevent if possible after considering awhile hit upon plan thought might serve accordingly closed with galleon ordered saunders to at once bear up before wind run away to leeward piling sail possible upon old tub to convey impression that be terribly frightened be exceedingly anxious to escape recapture at same time sail be crowded upon schooner precaution being taken however to tow old spare foresail overboard abreast lee gangway have effect of causing schooner to sail a if be water logged also shaped course with schooner diverging about four point from of galleon latter now of course ran away from hand over hand while now galley manifested disposition to edge down little get nearer look at be precisely what wanted hope being that precipitate retreat must be construed by spaniard a sign of weakness fear on part that commander of galley must thus be inveigled into attempting recapture of galleon single handed instead of sharing honour with consort anticipated that if must yield to blandishment must make dash straight for galleon without troubling about schooner sluggish movement of must render in eye altogether contemptible adversary utterly beneath notice only to be tackled submitted to exemplary punishment after recapture of galleon have be achieved must prove correct in line of reasoning must run away to leeward after galleon when must have exactly where wanted namely to leeward of schooner when must be business to see that did not again get to windward of chapter twenty five end career a privateersman for fully hour galley dallied with tempting bait have thrown out now edging down towards for few minute anon hauling wind again commander apparently suspecting ruse on part at length seemingly single hearted anxiety to place a much water a possible between ourselves together with fact that vessel be perceptibly increasing distance from galleon fairly rapidly schooner much le so got better of prudence suddenly putting up helm came booming along down to leeward wing wing steering course that a have expected must soon carry alongside senora moment that became apparent that be in earnest sent scanty crew to quarter long thirty two be cleared away loaded hand stood by to haul inboard again sail have hitherto served so efficiently a drag beyond preparation other change be made schooner still adhering to course a though only anxious to escape from so formidable adversary about hour after bearing up by time galley have neared to within about mile half fired shotted gun in direction of galleon hoisted colour saunders to whom have communicated intention took notice whatever of did shot fell long way short be of course merely intended a hint for galleon to heave to quarter of hour brought galley down abreast of about mile distant took notice whatever of object evidently being to recapture galleon first so secure a must suppose treasure have be embarked aboard after commander must doubtless have word to say to schooner have so audaciously presumed to appropriate even temporarily gold of most catholic majesty king of spain a galley swept past observed with keen satisfaction that be not going much over eight knot estimated that when must have got rid of drag must be fully knot half better than be of course must be in power to rig out sweep to increase speed considered that with breeze be then blowing must be practically useless except when going directly head to wind have to do be so to manoeuvre schooner a to cut off escape in direction what be chiefly afraid of be that consort of galley for be confident that have consort somewhere other be close enough at hand to hear sound of firing to make certain upon point shinned up to royal yard have good look round be greatly relieved to find that there be nothing in sight allowed to get about mile to leeward of then instead of hauling drag inboard a have at first intended cut adrift let go altogether at same time jibbing over main boom giving chase to galley for space of perhaps ten minute perceptible notice be taken by on board galley of change of tactic by end of time sudden to spaniard unaccountable improvement in speed have become so marked that must not fail to attract attention presently sign became observable that be occasioning considerable uneasiness galley sweep forty in number be suddenly rigged out assumed appearance of gigantic centipede hurrying over surface of sea long oar rising falling swiftly with gun like flash of sunlight off wet blade a churned water into snow white foam on side of very few minute sufficed to prove correctness of judgment a to uselessness under present circumstance very distinct confusion of movement among shining blade revealing what have foreseen that canvas be driving too fast through water for oarsman to keep pace with confusion rapidly became more pronounced until individual oar blade be rising falling independently of others while frequent pause of movement accompanied by great splashing of water revealed that unhappy oarsman be busily engaged in unseamanlike operation of catching crab a matter of fact sweep be proving to be hindrance rather than help to began to overhaul so fast that be soon within point blank range of tom hardy have assumed charge of long tom have gradually worked up into such uncontrollable condition of fidgety impatience running eye along sight then glancing round at that seemed cruel to keep thus longer on tenter hook of suspense rather reluctantly nodded permission to to fire next instant gun spoke out shock of discharge jarring schooner to keel shot flew high over mast head of galley little wide of expected a much tom remarked reprovingly be far too much excited take coolly man take coolly that galley must be effectually disabled will give slip to windward bring two three more like herself after have desire at to see have desire to take for must be worse than useless to must be really dangerous possession ah expected a much down come canvas be going to try to dodge work out to windward in wind eye never mind gun just now in with stunsails for life will be too quick for feared expected have come to pas heavy shot have fairly frightened people aboard galley realised at last that trick have be played upon commander great anxiety now evidently be to get a quickly a possible out of trap that have be decoyed into with object have suddenly lowered sail put helm hard over with object of returning by way that have come be to windward of galley stunsails coming in with run be able to haul close upon wind almost a quickly a galley when latter now depending upon oar alone schooner proved to be considerably faster of two thus effectually cutting off antagonist escape in direction now back to gun load a quickly a like exclaimed for knew that very critical moment be at hand for moment must decide whether be galley ourselves be to be victorious presently anticipation became realised spaniard finding escape cut off again putting over helm until vessel swerved round with long keen bow pointing straight at commander intended to run aboard if must must succeed schooner must either be sent to bottom by violence of shock must fall into hand of spaniard to endure in probability fate even more horrible than from hoard have escaped straight a arrow for came galley two mast keeping steadily in one a helmsman relentlessly followed schooner movement through water while long oar blade now rose fell quickly in perfect time urging long snake like hull toward at speed of fully seven knot tom hardy mopped perspiration of excitement from brow with bright red handkerchief a muttered anathema upon previous ill luck saw that have pulled together for hand be a steady a yours be at moment a gently waved in direction of who be training gun now tom said when have reported ready shot must go home mind there must be missing time so take coolly let approach to within hundred fathom before think of firing will give word then let have a soon a be certain of aim ay ay sir answered tom will have time may call sojer give word sir whenever like there be hurry tom said keep covered for three minute then may do a like man continued turning to helmsman steer small for next few minute give tom chance ay ay sir steer small be answered man be at work upon gun of theirs sir reported hardy at moment will fire stop sir yes said will do now fire until be absolutely certain of galley be now within about hundred fifty fathom of coming on at tremendous pace water leaping foaming glancing about bow long length still pointed obstinately at there be brass gun mounted upon forecastle ray of sun flashing off a though have be made of gold about gun seven eight figure must be distinctly seen busily moving while aft upon poop be grouped four men in brilliant uniform with sword drawn beyond forecastle grouped along rail must be just made out head flashing weapon of strong body of boarder ready to spring in upon deck at instant when two hull must come together despite anxiety suspense of moment must not help remarking to myself that if intended to carry by boarding commander of galley be conning craft in very lubberly unseamanlike way a thought passed through brain there be bright flash stunning report jarring of whole frame of schooner a long gun again spoke out so instantly following report that seemed to be almost part of distinctly heard crash immediately followed by dreadful outcry of scream yell groan of mortal anguish seeming to start at same instant out of hundred throat shot have evidently gone home have a evidently told severely exactly how much damage have done must not be guessed at for moment until smoke have blown away to leeward of galley ere have done there came flash report from next instant be aware of shot came humming so closely past head that wind of actually blew cap off overboard stooped picked up replaced on head a again turned gaze to leeward there be galley with clean neat shot hole in starboard bow so close to water line that furrow ploughed up by rush through water be flashing leaping right over what be of at least equal importance to just then bank of oar be trailing limp motionless a if suddenly paralysed in water alongside of paralysed certainly be for moment at least because thirty two pound shot have evidently raked oarsman bench from end to end of ship way immediately began to slacken although saw officer dash aft with own hand jam helm hard over to lay aboard movement became so sluggish that have difficulty in avoiding being fully ten fathom distant when went drifting slowly across stern a did so heavy confused volley of musketry be poured into from boarder lined gunwale although bullet flew past like hail not one of be touched immediately afterwards loud outcry arose aboard galley upon man at once threw down arm jumped below ready about shouted tom load again stand by to give shot a cross bow must not leave now until have rendered impossible for to get up to windward again tell of whereabouts of galleon if must contrive to smash good number of oar with raking shot must be better even than hulling for after must be terrible thing to destroy so much life must have at least two hundred fifty people aboard ay more sir will take at least four men to handle one of long heavy sweep way that be handled just now a to smashing of 'em know a can do man must have to be very tidy shot to hit more 'n one two of 'em will do best sir man ca do more schooner helm be put down be hove round upon opposite tack at once kept away for galley have by time fallen broadside on to sea oar still remaining motionless steered little to leeward of with intention of luffing into wind athwart stern throwing topsail aback so giving hardy time to level point thirty two pounder have gained position be in act of backing topsail when officer of whom have already spoken reappeared upon poop hastily hauling down galley colour hailed in very fair english surrender senor surrender in name of blessed virgin pray not to fire again galley be in sinking condition unless can quickly stop leak will go down drown what be will that will do in matter where be leak situated demanded in bow senor so close to water line that sea be pouring into vessel like river be answer then said have better cut sail adrift fother over leak after only chance of safety will be to make for nearest port take to be porto bello will stand by until have choked leak can do more for a carpenter be aboard galleon moreover doe not understand spanish therefore must not direct people thousand thanks senor answered spaniard bowing low to will follow instruction be in hope that by adopting plan have suggested may be able to reach land then with bow to duly returned disappeared moment later heard shouting order to people twenty thirty of whom at once sprang on deck began to cut lateen sail away from long tapering yard meanwhile must now see that galley be gradually filling a be perceptibly deeper in water than when have first encountered thinking possible that might be of use ordered people to launch dinghy in with one hand went under bow of galley shot hole be cause of mischief be now completely under water more than time showing only when bow of vessel lifted over swell saw that have plugged with canvas from inside officer informed that two men be engaged in holding canvas in place against pressure of water while rest of crew be a must see engaged in baling thought must see way to improve matter little so directed officer to launch gun overboard to lift bow little to shift movable weight a far aft a possible then returned to schooner procured thin sheet of lead dozen nail hammer with contrived with difficulty to pretty well stop leak although be careful not to stop too effectually lest officer must decide to take risk of making way to windward instead of to nearest land think have real ground for apprehension for must see that poor fellow be thoroughly frightened when have patched up hole have told that there must be no need to use sail save to help to reach porto bello a quickly a possible be overpoweringly profuse in expression of gratitude for help what be pleased to term generosity be drawing well on toward noon when at galley be once more in condition to get under weigh did forthwith heading to southward under oar sail inexpressibly thankful be to see last of still more so to think have contrived to get rid of without sending company to bottom before parting contrived to elicit from commander that two of consort have proceeded to search for in gulf of darien while three more have made best of way to point gallina to intercept there in event of trying to make way to eastward having thus successfully shaken off formidable foe crowded sail upon schooner in pursuit of galleon while have in pursuance of order be running off wind to leeward when at length overtook galley have long vanished in south eastern board consequently hauled up to northward once more shaped course for jamaica where not to make story too long arrived without further adventure on fourth morning after encounter with galley a may be supposed lost time in waiting upon very good friend admiral whom found up to eye in business in office at port royal nevertheless busy though be gave order for to be admitted shook hand with heartily a presented good morning mr bowen said wo ask to sit down for be so busy morning positively know job to tackle first merely consented to see in order might congratulate for hear that have brought in prize of sort big lump of craft be too casting eye toward a

worth listening to have time for just now come up to pen to dinner to night tell then will be right sharp seven mind now good bye until evening lucky young dog upon leaving admiral proceeded up harbour to kingston in boat manned by negro large fleet of ship of size occupied anchorage abreast of town a drew nearer two vessel seemed to stand out from among rest challenge recognition looked at more intently surely must not be mistaken cuffee be name of two vessel brigantine schooner be moored close together there demanded of captain of boat name not cuffee sah name be julius caesar mark anthony brown sah dem two vessel be called respectably de dolphin de tiger bofe of dem privateer sah be boatman answer given with great dignity utmost gravity thank julius caesar mark anthony brown retorted with equal gravity have goodness to shove alongside dolphin will certainly sah wid de utmost pleasure sah answered negro with broad grin of delight at unwonted receipt of full cognomen in few minute ranged up alongside old familiar schooner recognised many old familiar face looking curiously down into boat by living jingo if ai mr bowen come back to life heard one man say in moment there be eager rush to gangway to meet unexpected sight of so many well known face most of hailing from same birthplace a myself of evidently glad to see again moved strongly almost before knew where be found on deck heartily shaking hand round then a soon a excitement have abated somewhat inquired for captain winter be ashore mr bowen answered mate who have caught name evidently appeared to be familiar with although man be total stranger to went ashore directly after breakfast much expect to see aboard again until pretty late in afternoon expect will find cap'n comben at anderson store at mammy williamson hotel if find will be sure to get news of 'em at one other of two place thank said will look up in case must not find please say will call aboard again to morrow morning about nine o'clock so saying climbed down into julius caesar boat again ten minute later be landed upon wharf be by time drawing well on toward noon second breakfast time so shaped course for mammy williamson in first place there sure enough came upon old skipper comben seated at table among number of other ship master sprinkling of civilian a entered heard name mentioned by winter thought also caught word galleon speak of angel captain winter know rest said a stepped up to with outstretched hand in moment man have started to foot be surrounded hemmed in by enthusiastic crowd who having somehow got wind of lucky capture be eager to congratulate nothing must do must sit down take breakfast with relate adventure be past two o'clock day before of budged for not only have to tell whole story of doings from day when parted company in manilla also have to hear captain winter story a well latter will not relate here a must require whole volume to do justice to for gratification of reader curiosity may say that dolphin tiger after protracted fight in suffered severely succeeded in beating off french frigate since then have be knocking about in atlantic with only moderate success making head quarter hence have heard nothing of save in letter received from mr white in stated that up to time of writing news have be received of manilla that greatly feared must have be lost captured having at length transacted business have taken to kingston returned to schooner pretty late in afternoon winter comben accompanying to have look at galleon sword fish later on returned with to kingston to keep dinner appointment with admiral found host a usual with table full of company among being captain of triton frigate several other naval officer of whom be exceedingly civil to especially after have related particular of capture of galleon spent very pleasant evening when at guest rose to go admiral whispered to to remain a have something to say to accordingly when hand have left host conducted to what called snuggery be comer of spacious verandah inclosed with large glazed partition fitted up a smoking room negro butler set out table with glass decanter big crystal jug of sangaree box of cigar left a soon a be alone have made ourselves comfortable old gentleman turned to seemed to look through through for several second so intently did rivet gaze upon then remarked dare say be wondering what important matter can be have caused to keep behind in order may have opportunity to talk over with well dear fellow be poor hand at beating about bush if have thing to say like to say outright so tell now have ever occurred to to wish that be king officer instead of being merely privateersman upon word sir peter be strange question indeed to ask said mind confessing to have over over again regretted that circumstance did not permit to enter majesty service not have real cause to complain for suppose may now call fairly rich man with division of galleon prize money in prospect much richer than must have be by time have have opportunity to enter navy at same time have be impressed over over again with honour distinction attaching to most gracious majesty service be wholly apart from question of length of man purse be impossible to shut one eye to fact that if man happens to be ambitious there be service where ambition have more scope for gratification than in british navy precisely agreed admiral do happen to be ambitious yes answered frankly one of success such a have be have be robbed of very appreciable amount of sweetness by reflection of far greater honour glory must have be mine have happened to have be wearer of king uniform then said admiral may take that if opportunity be to offer for to enter king service must accept undoubtedly may sir answered excitedly a drift of conversation suggested to for first time then in flash qualified statement by adding of course mean if must enter a commissioned officer a warrant officer fear must be quite out of place have have so much liberty have be so to speak own master for so long that think must find discipline irksome interrupted admiral dear boy have doubt must nobody fool must ever think of spoiling fine dashing young fellow like by attempting such transformation a say must be woefully out of place in position must be wasted upon own quarter deck with good crew of thoroughly disciplined men to back up authority of king commission to give confidence must soon make name place for now did very important valuable service to state when brought timely intelligence of approach of combined french spanish fleet to west indian water did still more important valuable service in watching that fleet afterwards communicating with lord nelson in recognition of service therefore affords very great pleasure to offer commission a lieutenant in majesty navy there be boy producing large official looking document from pocket sincerely hope that will not only accept that also with such friendly help a may be able to afford will rapidly distinguish do credit to penetration in selecting for so unusual honour for moment be altogether too thoroughly overwhelmed to utter word old gentleman at once perceived for said hastily there there thanks thanks know exactly what be struggling to say will take a said need not trouble to thank in word let deed express gratitude if behave a well under pennant a have hitherto done under merchant flag will be more than satisfied intend to give opportunity of distinguishing doing credit for happens that triton boat captured becalmed pirate schooner last week brought in lieutenant who led attack lost life poor fellow in boarding so that have not to be considered propose therefore to purchase craft into service give command of sail like witch be told be wonderfully powerful vessel just sort of craft to give smart young fellow like chance to race up ratline of promotion so now that have to do be to arrange somehow to be relieved of present command a soon a possible then to step into new berth have difficulty whatever in doing thanks to lucky chance of captain winter being in same port slept at pen night kind friend admiral insisting upon so doing next evening found in position to inform that arrangement have be made to relieve of command of sword fish to take galleon home to england within forty eight hour of receipt of commission have entered upon new career have ceased to be privateersman end
