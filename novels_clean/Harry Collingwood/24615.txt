receives very serious head wound recovers with good treatment in naval hospital on whole book have echo of immortal work of captain marryat be sure author have studied very carefully collingwood have exceptional power of description book make good read of course good audiobook middy of king by harry collingwood chapter one hm europa have just dismounted before rather imposing main entrance to delamere hall situate close to west dorset coast have handed over horse to tom biddlecome groom who have accompanied in before breakfast ride down to beach for morning dip when father appeared in portico good morning dick greeted suppose have be for swim a usual how did find water grand sir replied just right temperature to put new life into one week at rate ought to see a well a ever be well present appearance be scarcely that of invalid must confess remarked laughingly if be called upon to submit to medical examination fancy verdict must be that there be not very much matter with be very glad that be so for have just received letter from friend vavassour in informs that have be posted to new frigate europa launched last week at portsmouth now fitting out that have entered name on book that if feel sufficiently recovered to resume duty must very strongly advise to proceed to portsmouth at once assist in operation of fitting out a be of opinion that by doing so will gain considerable amount of knowledge will be of utmost value to when come to sit for examination now what be opinion do think be sufficiently recovered to do a vavassour suggests must write ask to by mean dear father interrupted hastily be quite well perfectly fit for duty in respect indeed feel sure that having advanced so far along road to recovery return to life of greater activity than have be living of late will be positively beneficial to of course will be very sorry to leave again to life of solitude think of dick interrupted father in turn assure that life here be not nearly so lonely a seem to imagine true there be not many neighbour what there be be eminently satisfactory also have horse dog gun rod for outdoor companion book to exorcise loneliness of evening so that see be not at badly off doubt will miss after be gone son be not time to study one own feeling britain just now need one of son who can strike blow in defence when look at empty chair will at least have pride satisfaction of knowing that wherever may be be upholding honour of country name well well sighed let get indoors to breakfast there be letter also for from vavassour will be curious to learn what have to say to whereupon linked arm in arm father entered made way to breakfast room where seated ourselves be soon busy with viand placed before letter to father have referred lay beside plate having obtained permission at once broke seal glanced at content for be full of curiosity to learn in detail splendid news father have outlined to a stood in portico before proceeding further with veracious history will be well must say word two about myself by way of formally introducing a be to reader in order that if feel inclined to follow fortune a set forth in following page may know just who be how matter be standing with at moment when story open to begin then be only son of sir richard delamere of delamere hall in county of dorsetshire baronet justice of peace etcetera etcetera etcetera sixteen half year before date at story start have received name of richard after father at baptismal font in fine old church in village of delamere that nestle snugly in valley about mile to north eastward of hall never knew mother for died in giving birth father who adored living revered memory be year older before fully forgave for being unwitting cause of premature departure from world in must sympathise with a soon a came to year of understanding for be not only a everybody who have known asserted of most amiable loveable disposition a portrait in big library bore witness most lovely woman although be unfortunate enough never to have known mother love think be actually very much worse for loss for upon mother death place be most ably conscientiously filled by aunt griselda father maiden sister who faithfully did duty by father until too passed away when be about eleven year old by time father have completely conquered original resentment toward have become that father son ought to be to other then after receiving best education that be at time possible for lad to receive have entered navy a midshipman at age of fourteen have gone out to mediterranean in old colossus two decker under command of sir percy fitzgerald where for two half year spent time partly in chasing french up down great inland sea partly in blockading port of toulon under sir john jervis be while engaged upon latter service be so seriously wounded in head by flying splinter be invalided home to recover colossus being opportunely ordered to england at same time to undergo general overhaul refit of course have not be in navy for more than two year without making few friend among staunchest of whom reckoned mr henry vavassour first lieutenant of colossus also friend of father officer be very dashing fellow prime seaman cool courageous resolute leader of men have frequently be mentioned in dispatch be therefore not at surprised to learn a now did that have gained post rank have be given command of fine ship letter to ran a follows dear delamere think will be glad to learn that lordship have be pleased to promote bestow upon post rank give command of new frigate europa just launched at portsmouth be exceedingly fine ship of ton mounting gun with smart officer good crew think ought given ordinary luck to render excellent account of herself have be allowed to nominate own officer have therefore entered on ship book not only for father sake also on account of excellent behaviour while aboard colossus if a hope have sufficiently recovered to join will again meet one two of former shipmate on quarter deck of new ship if feel fit for duty must very strongly advise to join at earliest possible moment a at present europa have only three lower mast stepped be in hand of rigger be of opinion that must be of utmost service to if must be on spot to witness process of rigging must thus obtain at first hand insight into detail will assuredly stand in good stead when come to present for examination ought perhaps to inform that in event of deciding to act upon advice will be necessary for to take up quarter temporarily aboard receiving hulk inconvenience will be more than compensated by knowledge that will gain for be putting up at george ' in high street will be well for to report to there upon arrival have written to father explaining everything need therefore add nothing to beyond expression of hope that may be able to avail to fullest extent of splendid opportunity for gaining great deal of most useful knowledge in very short time yours sincerely henry vavassour when have finished perusal of exceedingly kind friendly letter passed over to father who in turn read carefully through then passed back to with question well dick boy what do think of simply sir that if approve will at once write to captain vavassour thanking heartily for very great kindness telling will start for portsmouth to morrow said father regarded rather wistfully thought for few moment then said very well be so write letter by mean will enclose few line in suddenly in much more cheerful tone of voice a idea seemed to suggest to will tell what will do dick will run over to portsmouth with stay for few day little change will do good must like very much to see new ship of yours a well a to meet vavassour again whom have not seen for quite number of year yes certainly will go over with thus be arranged wrote dispatched letter spent remainder of day in making preparation started on journey soon after ten o'clock next morning posting way to portsmouth where arrived at six o'clock same evening put up at george where captain vavassour have established of course be scarcely in accordance with strict naval etiquette for mere midshipman to presume to quarter in hotel that captain honoured with patronage circumstance be exceptional in so far a be with father moreover be to be for one night skipper be far too fine manly fellow to take notice of so insignificant breach of unwritten law a be committing father dined with night incidentally making acquaintance of mr malcolm adair europa first lieutenant on following morning immediately after breakfast proceeded on board receiving hulk reported then returned to shore made way to number basin in frigate be undergoing process of being rigged prepared for sea have not served for two half year in mediterranean without learning something of what constituted good model of ship sooner set eye upon europa than fell violently in love with have be launched flying light then have be hauled under masting sheers to have three lower mast stepped after have be necessary to move to part of basin in order to make way for ship have occupied new berth five day when first saw during carpenter joiner painter have be busily employed in finishing off internal fitting when first beheld dockyard people be in act of warping across basin to still berth where be to receive ballast thus when eye first rested upon be floating high out of water be afforded excellent opportunity to view criticise line be somewhat willow of hull flat in floor to give light draught of water to compensate for be extraordinarily beamy have twofold effect of imparting great stiffness under canvas affording fine roomy deck side be a round a apple not inch of straight anywhere in despite unusual breadth line be finest most beautiful have ever seen carried full poop interior of constituted captain quarter roomy light airy a noted length solidity of lower mast idea occurred to that if remainder of spar be to be in proportion sail spread combined with perfect line ought to give such exceptional speed a must enable to do just a pleased with adversary a soon a be alongside made fast went on board have good look at interior not forgetting to inscribe name legibly on most conveniently situated locker in midshipman berth after watched operation of shipping stowing ballast there be not much of interest instruction in part of work when on following day witnessed execution of apparently impossible task of getting top aloft over masthead be afterwards initiated into mystery of measuring for laying off rigging getting into position setting up beheld rapidity assured certainty with three bare lower spar be equipped with shroud stay cap etcetera topmast rose into place be rigged fidded how yard be sent aloft secured how in short entire fabric became rapidly converted from mere empty shell into complicated yet marvellously perfect structure needed smart officer well disciplined crew breathing of wind of heaven to make of not only most beautiful wonderful product of human skill also formidable self contained engine of warfare mentally confessed that not only be seamanship most fascinating science also that sailor be most ingenious adaptable specimen of entire human race work of fitting out be pushed forward with possible expedition bare three week therefore from day of arrival in portsmouth saw europa ataunt with royal yard across sail bent store of description on board stowed water tank filled gun mounted in fact ready for sea in respect except crew be not on board magazine be empty then be warped out of basin crew turned over to from receiving hulk be taken out to spithead to receive powder during time father have remained at portsmouth quartered at george spending a much a possible of time with in dockyard after work of day be over generally by favour of mr adair first lieutenant dined spent evening with discipline of receiving hulk not being very severe nobody caring much at what time went aboard at night so long a be present at muster next morning on day that crew be turned over ship be taken out to spithead little indulgence came to end for frigate be sooner at anchor than before powder hoy arrived alongside captain vavassour came off crew be mustered read commission hoisted pennant from moment strictest naval discipline became order of day nevertheless when at conclusion of above mentioned ceremony skipper ordered gig returned to shore obtained leave to accompany upon condition reported on board again by eight o'clock therefore again for last time during cruise dined with father after accompanied to hard bade most affectionate good bye stood watching wherry be conveying off to ship until boat passed out of harbour vanished from sight not until long afterward did know instead of starting for home next morning a have talked of doing crossed over to gosport first thing after breakfast walked to haslar stationed on beach at gilkicker point watching frigate until have got under way passed out of sight to southward eastward next morning at daylight blue peter be hoisted at fore royal masthead gun fired a signal that ship be about to sail boat be hoisted in stowed stock be brought alongside order be given to clear ship of stranger sailor wife sweetheart who have come off to say last good bye bumboat woman who be making final desperate effort to obtain settlement of account tradesman of kind engaged upon same errand intent upon palming off upon men otherwise unsaleable stock shortly after ten o'clock captain vavassour came on board immediately after hand be piped to up anchor within hour be under way standing out toward saint helen under plain sail before light northerly breeze have not be under way quarter of hour before became apparent to everybody on board that europa be going to more than justify exceedingly favourable opinion that have already formed of for light a be wind slid through water at speed fairly astonished keen stem cleaving short channel surge cleanly with very little noise fuss leaving behind wake so smooth so little disturbed that at distance of quarter of mile vanished altogether when hour so later having made good offing skipper ordered to be hauled to wind on taut bowline for short time to test speed under condition then put about went to windward tacked like yacht cruising ground be fairly extensive one stretching from longitude of cape la hague on one hand to longitude degree west on other from latitude degree north to cape finisterre in other word embraced chop of channel whole of bay of biscay duty be to protect british commerce on high sea harry enemy generally wide limit of cruising ground fact that for moment at least be free to go whither pleased within limit be source of keenest gratification to hand for be just within area that privateer of enemy be then displaying most activity doing greatest amount of mischief be looking forward hopefully to prospect of making plenty of capture recapture of who have be shipmate together in old colossus found additional source of gratification in speed of new craft for whereas in colossus be possibly slowest ship ever launched have done plenty of chasing have never be able to catch anything unless condition be strongly in favour while now hoped to find state of affair very much opposite be not only upon speed of europa however that built hope of success for not only be unusually fast vessel carried exceptionally heavy armament for ship of class namely twenty four long pounder on main deck fourteen long pounder on quarter deck forecastle while to crown crew consisted of two hundred ninety two men one of whom have voluntarily entered furthermore of two hundred ninety two men le than one hundred sixty five have be aboard colossus have joined after being paid off from craft while on quarter deck skipper mr galway second lieutenant mr trimble master maxwell master mate gascoigne midshipman mr purvis gunner have be shipmate together in same craft having manoeuvred ship for close upon two hour with view of testing speed handiness in varying circumstance so far a be possible under existing condition of wind sea bore up shaped course for cape la hague made just before nightfall then a breeze seemed inclined to freshen trifle rendering ship more manageable in strong tide that sweep that part of coast captain determined to search bight at bottom of lie french port of saint malo just then notorious for number of privateer fitted out sent to sea accordingly passed in about half way between alderney mainland maintaining offing from latter of about eight mile took in royal topgallantsails passing inside chausey island breakfast time next morning found off town in harbour of saw number of small fishing coasting craft nothing of importance therefore hauled up to westward set topgallantsails boarded fore main tack in order to work out clear of secure good offing for glass be dropping breeze freshening there be greasy look about sky to windward seemed to portend blow be on lee shore a morning advanced portent became more pronounced wind increased to extent that first have to stow topgallantsails again then single reef topsail very nasty short choppy sea quickly got up into frigate plunged viciously to height of figurehead sending deluge of spray over weather cathead into hollow of foresail until canvas be darkened with wet half way up to yard while thickened up away to windward until became impossible to distinguish anything beyond distance of mile wind backed on until be out from about north north west with result that when at length made land stretched right athwart hawse reached away to windward a far a eye must penetrate mist there be nothing for to 'bout ship haul off on other tack crew be therefore piped to station helm eased down when ship swept grandly up into wind went round like top holding way in style delighted a much a surprised staying almost a quickly a men must swing yard eight bell of afternoon watch have just struck when weather clearing suddenly made island of guernsey eight mile ahead jersey somewhat more distant two point before starboard beam at same moment two craft be made out about six mile away from broad on weather beam coming down before wind under heavy press of sail heading a though bound for saint malo be within mile of other appeared to be in company instant that be seen there be general rush for telescope on part of officer on deck after protracted scrutiny of general consensus of opinion be that be french privateer british merchantman have captured coming down toward end on a be be not easy at first to determine rig be large ship one of being of about six hundred ton while other appeared to be fully a big a ourselves that eye be a sharp a own very soon became evident for while be still peering at through glass saw string of flag go soaring aloft on board smaller craft of two immediately afterward vessel slightly altered course bigger of two hauling up couple of point to southward shaping course must carry across stern at distance of about two mile while other very smartly clewed up topgallantsails took single reef in topsail slightly hauled wind a though with purpose of intercepting action on part at once confirmed suspicion a to respective character at same time enabled to determine that be full rigged ship smaller will be privateer therefore in probability faster vessel of two mr adair said skipper will accordingly tackle first for think can polish off in time to catch other fellow before can get into port beat to quarter if please sir show colour first lieutenant gave order drum rattled out summons ship at once became hive of activity deck be cleared of everything must possibly interfere with efficient working of gun gun be cast loose half port knocked out screen put up magazine opened powder shot passed up on deck cutlass pistol served out to crew in short preparation made for battle ensign be streaming out in breeze a flat a board from mizen peak of stranger have thus far condescended to show colour of bunting have now definitely parted company larger of two edging in for land with evident intention of reaching port while other having hauled wind be a evidently preparing to cover retreat of prize by engaging in running fight drawing off shore to northward chapter two privateer prize smaller of two craft having hauled close to wind upon same tack a ourselves about two mile dead to windward of now hoisted french colour fired gun of defiance shot from however fell long way short of did not attempt to reply to challenge for although long pounder must probably have reached other ship skipper considered distance too great for fire to be effective while motion of frigate be so violent that chance be against being able to make hit at captain vavassour be noted for strength of objection to wasteful firing away of ammunition for moment therefore contented with testing respective speed weatherliness of two ship very soon discovered that so far a two quality be concerned have caught tartar for although within first ten minute of test became apparent that be head reaching upon craft to windward advantage be so slight that must scarcely hope to get within effective range of in le than two hour at least while during whole of time bigger of two stranger must be proceeding in opposite direction at rate a must render ultimate escape practical certainty skipper looked long anxiously first at one craft then at other finally at barometer then rejoined first lieutenant who be giving attention almost exclusively to chase to windward wo do at mr adair said that fellow be going through water almost a fast a be be holding a good luff at rate will not get to grip with before dark will probably mean losing big fellow if not of see that barometer be inclined to rise will therefore shake reef out of topsail set fore main topgallant sail if becomes question of carrying on ' think ought to have best of by long way ay be sayin ye may no be richt sir answered first lieutenant will be unco strain upon spar to set thae to'gallants'ls new rigging have stretched until be hangin ' in bight a ye may see for yoursel ' by lookin ' at still may be worth tryin will ye see what can do under whole topsail before settin ' to'gallants'ls think not said skipper have not time to spare for tentative measure although a truly say rigging have badly stretched think have scarcely stretched sufficiently seriously to imperil spar will sail better for little spring whip in mast unless be greatly mistaken therefore have goodness to make sail at once sir if please in face of so decided opinion a there be of course nothing further to be said five minute later europa be leaping plunging madly through short choppy channel sea with topmast topgallant mast whipping like fishing rod under strain of increased canvas while whole of fore deck be deluged with spray came in over weather cathead in cataract leapt almost a high a foreyard chase lost not moment in following example setting same canvas a ourselves scarcely ten minute have elapsed before correctness of captain judgment became manifest for within brief space of time be seen that be fast head reaching weathering upon frenchman who be evidently overpowered by too heavy press of canvas quarter of hour later captain vavassour gave order to tack while frigate be in stay plunging bow under quivering to keel with furious slatting of canvas a swept up into wind have satisfaction of seeing frenchman mizen topmast go over side now have ejaculated captain in tone of exultation with mizen topsail gone will no longer be able to maintain so close luff a ourselves within hour will be able to do a please with that stranger be strong handed that carried thoroughly well disciplined crew be evident for by time that have paid off on other tack have swung foreyard mizen rigging be full of men busy upon task of clearing away wreck of topmast while others be equally busy in clewing up furling fore topgallantsail hauling down stowing flying jib to enable to maintain a good luff a possible desperate a be effort must hing with now at least upon wind therefore when next tacked be moment that be fairly in wake suddenly put up helm squared away dead before wind proceeded to set studdingsails on side captain rubbed hand chuckled with delight a saw up helm after mr adair exclaimed be very thing must have wished for must be veritable witch at sailing if can beat before wind will set port studdingsails only to start with if please for if a expect have heel of will haul up point two endeavour to close with to point blank range three minute saw sweeping away to leeward like meteor chase about mile distant broad on port beam with studdingsails set on side from royal down while with studdingsails set to port only be edging rapidly in upon while fully holding own with in other respect oh what relief be to feel long easy floating motion level keel of ship running before wind sea in exchange for short savage digging into head sea with accompaniment of drenching shower of spray sickening lee lurch whole gale of wind buffeting one in face doing utmost to drive one down one throat captain expectation relative to frigate behaviour on new point of sailing be quickly verified so quickly indeed that within quarter of hour found within easy range of chase fact be brought home to by shot from passing within foot of hammock rail whizzing between fore mainmast now mr adair said skipper may see what can do with let captain of gun try hand upon individually doing best to cut up spar rigging want to capture not to sink be far too fine ship to be sent to bottom therefore spare hull a much a possible first lieutenant went down on main deck personally repeated captain instruction before returned to quarter deck first of long pounder spoke message shot passing through stranger foresail narrowly missing mast then pounder got to work very soon saw loose rope end streaming out on board showing that fire have not be wholly in vain although so far damage worth speaking of have be done be frenchman idle on contrary fired about four gun to one of ours after first shot of theirs appeared to have become flurried excited aim correspondingly wild at event although of shot came near while one two actually flew over not one of came near enough to do ropeyarn worth of damage with own men be very different more often fired cooler did seem to become be amusing to see eagerness with after firing watched effect of shot with evident purpose of correcting aim next time result of caution on part soon became apparent for have scarcely fired dozen shot when saw stranger fore topmast go swooping over bow next minute broached to losing main topgallant mast snapping one of studdingsail boom in process cease firing shouted skipper in studdingsails mr adair clew up furl royal topgallantsails in flying jib then haul wind if please fellow will surely not hold out longer did though pluckily maintaining fire upon with two gun run out through stern port evidently hoping to disable while crew worked like demon in effort to clear away wreckage be not until ranged up on weather quarter within biscuit toss threatened with whole of starboard broadside that hauled down colour surrendered heavy sea be now running rendered task of taking possession of prize exceedingly difficult nevertheless by exercise of utmost skill care first second cutter under command of mr howard second lieutenant o'brien one of midshipman at length managed to get alongside put prize crew of thirty two men on board boat quickly returned to ship with intelligence that prize be twenty six gun privateer belle marie of saint malo carrying total crew of two hundred thirty men of whom eighty seven be at moment away in prize forty of being on board british east indiaman masulipatam ship have by time passed out of sight in southern board weather condition being unfavourable for transfer of frenchman from prize to frigate without loss of great deal of valuable time captain vavassour hailed mr howard instructing to confine prisoner below then with aid of carpenter crew be about to send to repair damage a well a must make best of way to portsmouth be almost dark by time that necessary arrangement be completed boat once more hoisted in when wore round shaped course hoped must enable to intercept recapture indiaman before must reach saint malo course brought wind about three point abaft starboard beam be consequently leading wind therefore business being pressing not only showed plain sail to topgallantsails also set topmast lower studdingsails to windward yard being braced slightly forward be heavy press of canvas to pile upon ship with wind where be so heavy sea running captain evidently considered a indeed did that circumstance justified certain measure of recklessness for have observed that masulipatam be at event when going free almost a fast ship a belle marie haste be necessary if must overtake before reached port by four bell in first watch wind have moderated sufficiently to permit of setting three royal a well a weather topgallant studdingsails hour later sighted craft of be in pursuit about four point on starboard bow be then about twelve mile distant only just distinguishable with aid of best night glass fact that be still so far astern of seemed to render exceedingly doubtful whether must not after make good escape fear that must do so be still further strengthened when at midnight made cape frehel light with chase still leading by full eight mile only chance in favour being that a bearing of light proved indiaman be three mile to windward of course must have to bear away for while be heading for saint malo a straight a must go a night passed on however hope rose somewhat for weather cleared while wind softened down with softening of wind became apparent that be gaining more rapidly a time wore on so did chase grow increasingly exciting hope moment strengthening until at length by three bell in middle watch have merged into conviction that nothing short of miracle must save indiaman from recapture such conviction must also have forced upon mind of officer in charge of for just after four bell have be struck saw suddenly take in studdingsails haul wind having apparently decided that must inevitably be taken if persisted in endeavour to get into saint malo by direction in be now steering seemed probable that have determined to seek shelter in one of indentation to westward of frehel many of be at time defended by earthwork battery for protection of french coasting craft from cruiser privateer move on part of indiaman prizemaster proved man to be possessed of sagacity foresight for threw at once four mile to leeward of compelled forthwith to take in studdingsails brace sharp up in order to follow while be now so close to land that there be prospect of being able to get in anchor under shelter of battery before must overtake that in end be precisely what occurred for when at length weathered cape frehel be just in time to see entering pleher bay where presently rounded to clewed up canvas let go anchor naturally captain vavassour be not sort of man to see possible rich prize riding at anchor in enemy water without making determined attempt to secure possession of therefore stood boldly in after indiaman until arrived within mile of entrance of bay at point about two mile across when two battery of six gun built upon opposite headland forming entrance to bay opened fire upon with such effect that within five minute have be hulled seven time have lost two men killed five wounded afforded skipper information that just then required namely fact that battery existed also exact position strength of now appearing that be armed with pounder therefore hove about got out of range again a quickly a possible for a captain said be good returning fire of earthwork battery might have plumped into shot have on board without doing farthing worth of damage while have attempted to force passage into bay with frigate might easily have sunk fun be not yet over a matter of fact have really not begun affair of battery be merely overture of little drama be taking shape in skipper brain stretched off land until be about three mile distant from mouth of bay then ship be hove to preparation be made for dispatch of cutting out expedition be to say attack upon indiaman by frigate boat with object of overpowering prize crew cutting cable bringing out of harbour launch yawl two cutter be boat told off by captain for service a soon a frigate be hove to fighting crew of boat consisting of very pick of ship crew be piped away boat hoisted out preparation of craft for service be about to undertake proceeded with of boat named possessed a part of fighting equipment gun mounted in bow upon fore aft slide belonging to launch yawl being pounder carronades while first second cutter mounted pounder a soon a boat be in water be taken charge of temporarily by respective coxswain best four men in ship who at once proceeded to supervise shipping mounting of gun coxswain assuring by personal inspection that important piece of work be properly executed amount of shot likely to be required be next passed down into boat carefully stowed upon bottom board precaution being taken to provide against breaking adrift with rolling pitching of boat chest containing cartridge for gun ammunition for small arm be next passed in stowed finally couple of beaker of water be placed in boat together with small quantity of spirit for use if necessary in reviving wounded completed preparation of boat for projected expedition be done by ordinary crew of boat fighting crew meanwhile busying in examining flint of pistol fitting new one where necessary loading pistol sharpening cutlass at length coxswain reported boat ready whereupon officer told off to command went down side carefully inspected satisfying that nothing have be forgotten then member of expedition be mustered on quarter deck inspected by first lieutenant who examined man weapon equipment before passing for service officer appointed to proceed upon expedition be mr adair first lieutenant in charge of launch in supreme command of entire expedition mr trimble master in charge of yawl mr purvis gunner in first cutter mr o'donnel boatswain in second in addition to there also went mr burroughs assistant surgeon in launch midshipman in of other boat a anticipated possibility of hot work before be done took precaution to discard dirk to provide in place thereof with ship cutlas pair of loaded pistol inspection at length satisfactorily ended first lieutenant reported to captain that be ready captain who have already arranged plan with officer commanding gave word to man boat shove off in couple of minute have started frigate have filled away be heading to seaward not so boat captain mr adair discussing together plan of operation have come to conclusion that must not be of slightest use to attempt to bring out indiaman in face of two battery have already given so convincing taste of quality have therefore be arranged that upon shoving off boat must be formed into two division for purpose of attacking battery spiking gun accordingly be now done launch first cutter forming starboard division destined to attack battery on western headland while yawl second cutter led by master constituted port division mission of be to silence effectively battery on eastern headland of harbour first lieutenant master made few brief final arrangement then division separated steering for own proper headland senior officer leading other following close behind so a to show a inconspicuously a might be on dark surface of water thus if luck favoured take frenchman unawares meanwhile night be passing rapidly away for have scarcely got clear of frigate when seven bell of middle watch be struck being then middle of august might expect daylight very shortly when surprise must at once become impossibility word be therefore passed for oarsman to give way at top speed away went a if for wager two division heading respectively south west south east in hope that might get close enough in with land to escape detection even possibly to land before coming dawn betrayed now although be travelling at racing pace progress be practically noiseless only sound being dip of oar in water lap gurgle of water about boat bow captain vavassour having already have oar of boat fitted to work in rope grummet shipping over single stout pin instead of in usual rowlock since much care have be used to render grummet tight fitting while leather have be well greased there be none of usual rattle of oar in rowlock sound in quiet weather may often be heard at almost incredible distance thanks to greasing of leather be there creaking grinding of oar against pin of course conversation be permitted beyond occasional whispered order to coxswain in fashion then pulled shoreward distance to be traversed being about three mile when at dawn broke there be light enough to enable to see where be starboard division found about quarter of mile distant from beach with battery shut out from view by slightly projecting bluff thus far nothing have occurred to lead to suppose that have be either heard seen a for frigate have disappeared probably behind cape frehel there be nothing therefore so far a must see to put french on alert to alarm in way therefore now headed boat straight in for beach catching momentary glimpse a did so of other division apparently doing same thing beach for be heading be composed of firm red sand sloping rather steeply down into water sea be smooth therefore rushed in until be high dry for nearly quarter of length men leapt out over bow on to dry sand then with two boat keeper in boat to look after be shoved off again with order to keep afloat if threatened to pull off to safe distance await return little party officer included mustered forty one men second division consisting of three le sooner be landed than mr adair led right up to foot of low cliff bordered beach so that be impossible for one to detect presence unless by standing on very verge of cliff looking directly down upon next thing to be done be to reconnoitre battery that intended to attack ascertain easiest way to get inside duty be confided to being youngest presumably most active of party while a afterwards learned captain have assured mr adair that courage discretion might be relied upon clearly understan ' noo maister delamere precisely what ye hae to dae observed first luff when concluding instruction to oor business be tae tak yon wee bit battery to spike gun be to dae't wi'oot loss o ' life on oor ain

in trouble ye be to fire pistol will come to help touched hat turning upon heel proceeded forthwith to scramble up steep face of cliff helping up by driving drawn cutlas deep into stiff clay soil of cliff be composed reaching top without much difficulty found upon somewhat uneven ground surface of sloped slightly down toward land soil be clothed with short thick grass closely overgrown with dense clump of furze bush at once perceived must afford excellent cover for approach of men somewhat to discomfiture however saw flock of sheep grazing at great distance inland while about mile away to south west be small village in single street of must perceive people already moving about clearly have time to lose if wished to take friend enemy by surprise availing therefore to utmost extent of cover of furze bush set off in direction of battery presently sighted about mile away stooping low a ran from bush to bush peering cautiously round before venturing to start for next soon found within about thirty yard of battery saw to be crescent shaped affair facing eastward thus in conjunction with battery on opposite point completely commanding entrance of bay be in reality brick work structure consisting of four chamber with arched roof supporting gun platform protected by parapet pierced with embrasure brick work in turn being protected by earth bank thrown up in front of in form of glacis mounted six pounder chamber beneath gun platform took to be magazine general store room soldier quarter gun platform be approached at end by good wide flight of step beside gun be goodly pile of shot while sponge rammer handspike rest of paraphernalia for loading training gun reposed in bracket fixed to inner face of parapet two sentry be stationed upon gun platform pacing to fro evidently keeping sharp lookout to seaward number of artilleryman be performing morning ablution brushing clothes etcetera in paved space before chamber strangely enough back of battery be left perfectly open unprotected by wall fence there be therefore absolutely nothing to prevent being rushed from land side counted men in sight to number of thirty three concluded that there must be others somewhere inside chamber then having acquired information possible under circumstance made best of way back to where mr adair rest of party impatiently awaited chapter three cutting out expedition in a few word a possible reported to first lieutenant extent of discovery in return received tersely expressed commendation of effort after briefly addressed follower explaining to importance of making attack a complete surprise a possible pointing out necessity for availing to utmost possible extent of cover afforded by gorse bush while approaching battery then having told off six of men for especial duty of spiking gun one man to gun directed to lead way stationing alongside three minute later entire party be on top of cliff where paused for moment to reconnoitre ground afresh get breath after exertion of climbing then moved slowly cautiously forward again allowing plenty of time for man to creep across open space from one patch of cover to next until in course of twenty five minute hand of be lying down behind large clump of bush twenty yard from battery have previously fixed upon a convenient point from to start final rush here brief pause be made mr adair kneeling behind bush utilised to count head make sure that hand have come up when having satisfied upon point drew sword flourished over head a signal springing to foot led at top speed in charge upon unprotected rear of battery wild cheer of lad a broke cover rushed across narrow open space still separated from battery be evidently first intimation to garrison that anything be wrong for sudden appearance seemed to take absolutely by surprise with result that something very like panic ensued among few after staring at agape motionless for second two a though unable to comprehend what be after came to life took to heel attempting to bolt out of battery before must reach lad quickly stopped by spreading out in front of driving back at point of cutlas others seeing impossibility of retreat in direction dashed into one of chamber beneath gun platform slamming door behind regardless of fact that be shutting out many of comrade barricading against attack a must hear by sound proceeding from inside while a for two sentry on platform simply fired musket in air flung down vaulted over parapet on to glacis thus making good escape six men charged with duty of spiking gun dashed straightway up step leading to gun platform at once proceeded to execution of task leaving comrade below to deal with garrison in le than five minute battery be in possession six gun effectually spiked true few of artilleryman who have retreated to interior of structure thrust musket through window of chamber snapped off at speedily gave that up surrendered at discretion upon approaching broken window shouting through by mr adair order information that be about to explode magazine that have better come out if did not wish to perish amid ruin when hand upon side be mustered be found that have gained possession of battery without least injury to side french officer be then directed to march men who be of course disarmed to village have seen earlier in morning now learned be called erquy a soon a be fairly out of battery magazine be broken open powder barrel rolled together in middle of room head knocked out train laid from barrel to barrel while party of men be busily engaged in bringing six spiked gun together in cluster immediately over magazine quarter of hour sufficed to complete preparation when one end of long fuse be buried in one of barrel of powder remainder of fuse being carried a far a must go across paved yard men then fell in under command marched out of yard took way along cliff toward boat while mr adair gunner remained behind to fire fuse ensure destruction of battery have be gone about ten minute have almost reached spot where be to make descent to beach when earth shook jarred violently beneath foot dull heavy boom burst upon morning silence fierce gust of wind suddenly swept over looking back saw enormous dim coloured cloud heavily charged with hurtling debris dismounted cannon mass of shattered brick work hovering over spot where battery have be two minute later first luff gunner breathless panting came running up to plunged down cliff face together boat keeper seeing coming headed boat in toward beach within five minute be once more afloat pulling quietly alongshore toward mouth of bay intently watching meanwhile for indication of whereabouts of other division have not long to wait for have scarcely pulled quarter of mile when battery on other headland blew up presently yawl second cutter came into view from behind point pulling hard for mouth of bay there be of course possibility of further secrecy in regard to movement for blowing up of two battery must sufficiently advertise presence of enemy in neighbourhood while fact of having be chased by frigate during preceding night must give indiaman prize crew tolerably accurate idea of where came from be ultimate intention therefore made pretence of concealing nice little westerly breeze having sprung up with rising of sun boldly laid in oar stepped boat mast hoisted sail by doing reckoned upon getting over ground at greater speed while conserving strength of contingent for attack upon indiaman master party be unable to follow lead in respect for wind be fair for be dead in teeth on other hand have about two mile more than to cover thus happened that two division of boat arrived at entrance practically at same instant port division leading only by just barely time enough to step mast set canvas for run into bay before joined indiaman be anchored well inshore about mile half inside headland a reached along toward under sail with boat in line abreast about thirty fathom apart saw that prize crew be busily engaged in preparing to resist attack gun being run out while attempt be being made to fix up boarding netting on ship starboard seaward side have brought telescope along with in boat believing that might possibly prove useful now focussed upon indiaman with object of getting definite idea of extent of preparation being made against have sooner done so than made discovery that there be netting triced up on port shoreward side of vessel frenchman apparently taking for granted that must dash alongside on side nearest to immediately reported discovery to first lieutenant at same time mentioning idea a to explanation of omission whereupon having first satisfied a to accuracy of statement hailed other boat ordering to board ship on port side when have arrived within about three quarter of mile of quarry opened fire upon with round grape first firing single gun finally whole broadside whereupon diverged well to port starboard compelling to train gun so far fore aft at length only two bow gun must be brought effectively to bear although few shot passed through sail while first cutter mast be shot away boat be untouched finally two division passed respectively athwart bow stern shot up alongside on inshore side without single casualty launch hooked on under bow first cutter made fast to fore chain while yawl grappled by mizen chain second cutter by main stood high out of water though not so high that one way be able to scramble into channel from whence be not difficult to make way inboard french must have felt very foolish when found attacking upon unprotected side yet defended prize with utmost gallantry for nearly ten minute fight raged with great fury when once lad have contrived to scale ship high bulwark establish upon deck must take refusal there be tremendous popping of pistol musket for first minute two good deal of smoke drifting hither thither then with wild hurrah europa dashed forward cutlas in hand cutting slashing pointing air resounded with cheer oath execration shrill scream of pain deck grew slippery with blood prostrate body tripped up here there then suddenly frenchman flung away weapon dived below leaving victor of fight in undisputed possession of ship to disarm prisoner who have not already abandoned weapon to secure in forecastle be work of few minute after boat be veered astern secured by painter hand jumped aloft loosed canvas then slid down to deck by way of backstay to sheet home hoist away cable be cut few minute later ship have canted be standing out to seaward under topsail topgallantsails jib spanker while wounded be being separated from dead carefully tended by burroughs assistant surgeon small party told off to help then came question of butcher bill upon going into found that have one man killed five wounded two of rather seriously while french casualty amounted to four killed eleven wounded three of latter so seriously that burroughs questioned whether must outlast day few minute after have cleared harbour frigate appeared in sight from behind cape frehel hour later prize hei company ship masulipatam of ton register with full cargo of indian produce homeward bound from bombay to london be hove to under lee quarter while mr adair have gone on board to make report previous to however have gone below into ship saloon at first luff order to see how passenger fared having gathered from crew of belle marie that have be left on board found to number of forty three men woman child including half dozen native nurse securely locked in several cabin glad enough be to be released to learn that ship be once more in british hand appeared that have be captured three day before in bay of biscay have be not too well treated by captor having be robbed by of money jewellery other valuable to say nothing of other indignity to have be subjected so far however a stolen property be concerned be able to reassure with statement captain vavassour must undoubtedly take immediate step to have found restored to having done excused upon plea of urgent business coupled with suggestion that lady must remain below until more gruesome evidence of recent conflict must be effaced hurried away to other end of ship effected release of officer crew who at once ascended to deck assisted own lad to put matter to right fortunately there be damage to make good within hour therefore of joining frigate captain vavassour have made disposition placing prize in charge of mr galway third lieutenant with small prize crew in addition to vessel own officer crew made sail in company for portsmouth skipper having decided to see valuable prize safe into british port before losing sight of happily accomplished anchoring at spithead shortly after ten o'clock in morning of following day without having sighted anything in shape of enemy fell in however with belle marie off needle mr howard having contrived to get up rig excellent jury fore mizen topmast during passage thus by shortening sail somewhat upon frigate indiaman be enabled to complete run to spithead in company europa making brave show a glided along to anchorage escorting two valuable prize captured within one short week from beginning of cruise moment that anchor be down captain vavassour ordered gig went ashore to deliver dispatch make report to admiral went with in charge of boat taking with letter have found time to write to father acquainting with good fortune have befallen walked up from sallyport to admiral office with skipper carrying dispatch box for leaving boat in charge of coxswain for although under ordinary circumstance such proceeding must probably have resulted in loss of whole boat crew amount of prize money have made within last two day completely banished thought of desertion in mind of men of course fame of brilliant double exploit soon spread over town of portsmouth gosport although men be at moment very hard to get several of ship in harbour being so short handed a to be unable to go to sea be sooner made known that required few more hand to complete complement than have more offer than have room for remained at spithead only three day during replenished stock of water provision ammunition then be once more dispatched by admiral to former cruising ground during brief interval one two interesting change have occurred in first place belle marie having be surveyed be reported to be practically new ship perfectly sound in respect admirably adapted for service in navy be therefore purchased by lord commissioner of admiralty ordered at once into harbour to undergo such alteration a be deemed necessary to refit next captain vavassour have spoken so highly in dispatch of admirable tact ability displayed by mr adair in conduct of expedition against french battery afterward in cutting out of indiaman that first luff have at once received promotion be appointed to command of prize renamed sparta of course created vacancy on board europa be filled by mr howard who became new first luff while mr galway also stepped up ratline became second vacancy created by promotion of mr galway be not filled have doubt that must ultimately fall to o'brien senior mid who be within month of having served full time to whom acting order be given several change be in highest degree satisfactory to hand of for obviated necessity for introduction of stranger among while felt that promotion have gone to right person namely who have actually earned be true short a acquaintance with have be be exceedingly sorry to lose mr adair sorrow in respect be quite counterbalanced by pleasure in knowledge that thoroughly deserved promotion that one more ship company must be made happy under rule of good captain in connection must not omit to mention thanks to highly favourable report that mr adair have made of conduct in matter of reconnoitring battery afterwards captain vavassour have be pleased to name in dispatch much to delight of father a subsequently learned sailed again from spithead on fourth day after arrival nothing of importance occurred for quite fortnight during be kicking about in chop of channel keeping bright lookout while for anything might chance to come in way whether in shape of captured british merchantman privateer french merchantman otherwise luck seemed to be against for sighted nothing craft flying british flag most of be men o ' war at length however skipper grew disgusted determined to see whether better fortune awaited farther afield accordingly having sighted ushant broad on lee bow ten mile distant at eight o'clock on certain morning with wind out at about north west stood on until have brought island well over lee quarter when helm be shifted ship kept away couple of point small pull taken upon weather brace away went booming into bay of biscay heading toward cape finisterre have experienced fresh breeze fine clear weather from moment when have left isle of wight astern on particular day shortly after noon sky became overcast gloomy with thick murky appearance to windward portended change for worse however did not greatly trouble for with ushant out of sight astern ship heading south west by compass wind two point free have nothing to fear beyond such discomfort a be inseparable from heavy sea be now fast getting up a day wore on however mercury began to drop rather rapidly thickness to windward increased began to rain wind freshened steadily high steep sea got up everything appeared to threaten particularly dirty unpleasant night by end of first dog watch wind have increased to half gale sea have drawn abeam ship be rolling lee hammock rail under captain therefore ordered topgallantsails to be clewed up furled flying jib to be stowed couple of reef to be taken in topsail for a remarked be not bound anywhere in particular be in hurry might a well snug ship down for night while have daylight enough left to see what be doing night closed down upon early so dark that must not see a far a length of ship there being moon while light of star be completely obscured by dense canopy of storm wrack overshadowed only object visible outside bulwark being faintly phosphorescent head of breaking sea a swept down menacingly upon from to windward air be raw chill although be only first week in deck be wet sloppy with driving rain spray of who be on watch looked thoroughly miserable a encased from head to foot in oilskin sou'wester paced to fro availing to utmost of such shelter a be afforded by bulwark boat stowed on boom by midnight wind have further increased to extent that sail be still further reduced course being taken off ship jib stowed mizen brailed in leaving nothing set three double reefed topsail fore main topmast staysail yet unpleasant a be weather have at least one consolation ship behaved splendidly sailing fast through water going along a dry a bone save for spray be blown from crest of wave came driving athwart deck in blinding drenching shower when at day broke revealed ship hove to under close reefed fore main topsail fore topmast staysail central object in midst of grey desolate picture dreary character of must be difficult to surpass be now blowing whole gale from south west wind having backed during night sky be unbroken expanse of dark slate coloured cloud athwart face of tattered shred of dirty grey vapour rapidly swept sea of opaque greyish green tint ran high steep crested with great curling head of pallid froth flecked here there with fragment of seaweed horizon be restricted to circle of little more than mile in diameter by driving mist rain be in short thoroughly disagreeable day be by mean sorry that be forenoon watch below have just finished breakfast when cry of sort from deck reached in midshipman berth straining of ship howling of wind through rigging constant crash gurgle of water outside rendered indistinguishable heard answering call of officer of watch also indistinguishable be beginning to arrive at conclusion that matter might be did not concern when shrilling of boatswain pipe followed by hoarse bellow of hand make sail caused general stampede for deck upon reaching learned that during momentary clearance of atmosphere brief glimpse have be caught of large ship about mile to leeward steering north under topgallantsails that from general appearance brief though sight of have be have be judged to be french officer of watch have of course a in duty bound reported matter to captain who be at moment in cabin taking breakfast skipper having heard mr galway story have promptly given order to bear up make sail in chase deck few minute earlier have presented dreary deserted appearance now became in moment scene of most animated bustle activity captain first lieutenant latter with speaking trumpet in hand be on deck skipper on poop gazing eagerly into thickness to leeward under sharp of hand in search of now invisible stranger barefooted seaman sprang nimbly hither thither to brace out on to jib boom others into rigging on way aloft to loose furled canvas helm be put up fore yard swung after yard squared a ship paid off in le than minute yard be alive with men casting off gasket untying reef point overhauling gear generally preparing to clothe frigate with canvas by time that have paid square off before wind be ready loosened canvas be bellying out a though impatient to be doing duty once more loosened rope be streaming in gale men have laid in off yard three topsail went soaring away to masthead simultaneously fore main tack be boarded sheet hauled aft topgallantsails be in like manner sheeted home hoisted at same instant two jib went sliding up stay slatting thunderously while threatening to snap boom until sheet be tautened away flew europa like started fawn leaping plunging through over mountainous sea with bow wave roaring foaming to height of hawse pipe with wind broad over larboard quarter to one unaccustomed to sea change thus wrought in course of few short minute must have seemed marvellous almost miraculous indeed for whereas while be hove to head to wind sea plunging of ship have be so furious that be only with utmost difficulty even most seasoned among must maintain footing while howling shrieking of wind aloft savage force with struck when frigate rolled to windward irresistibly suggested idea that be in grip of hurricane now when be scudding away almost dead before gale seemed to have suddenly softened to strength of more than moderate breeze there be repetition of sickening lee lurch a ship be flung aloft on steep breast of mountainous swift running sea in place of gentle rhythmical pendulum like swinging roll long easy gliding rush forward with acre of foam seething hissing about bow a same steep mountainous sea caught under quarter hurled headlong forward with bow wave roaring boiling ahead of glass smooth clear a crystal there be two drawback to satisfaction one of be that weather still remained so exasperatingly thick that have not be able to get further glimpse of strange ship while other be that only knew position very approximately that by dead reckoning only last must have given concern at have be heading to southward for in direction there be plenty of sea room have now turned round be rushing back northward north north east by compass to be exact knew that somewhere ahead of whether on port starboard bow be not at certain be terrible penmarks beyond jutting pointe du raz douarnenez bay pointe de saint mathieu danger lurk between ushant mainland bad enough in with added terror due to furious current swirl round that part of coast of direction of one can never be quite certain that such thought a be disturbing skipper equanimity soon became apparent for after pacing deck thoughtfully for time suddenly looked up seeing standing way up poop ladder straining eye into thickness ahead in vain endeavour to get glimpse of chase called to be watch mr delamere said sir answered touching hat thought must like to get sight of fellow be after before going below thank said zeal be very commendable daresay can muster eye enough to maintain lookout without keeping on deck in watch below however since be here perhaps will oblige by finding master asking if have made up reckoning to eight bell if have request to be good enough to bring with chart to here on quarter deck if have not say that will be obliged if will do so at once ay ay sir answered touching hat again a turned away to descend hatchway chapter four french gun ship found mr trimble in cabin in very act of laying off ship position on chart after working up reckoning delivered message by way of reply master rolled up chart tucked under arm seized pencil divider parallel ruler started for deck with close in wake for shared skipper anxiety to know whereabout be ah here be mr trimble exclaimed captain a master head shoulder rose above combing of hatchway have made up reckoning yes sir answered master pricked off be just about here by dead reckoning made effort to spread open chart on capstan head paper be stiff from being almost continuously rolled up moreover wind be troublesome two circumstance combining to render almost impossible for good man to do a wished unaided saw difficulty stepping forward seized two top corner of chart held down while skipper gripped third corner trimble fourth there be sir thereabout explained master pointing with pencil to dot surrounded by small circle on paper with date written alongside see remarked skipper thoughtfully a intently studied open chart suppose said presently have made ample allowance for leeway for drift while hove to yes sir answered master have allowed point half for leeway three knot drift of reckon be above rather than below mark y e e agreed skipper reflectively yes will not have made more than must think have of course also allowed for tide current for sir assented master of course clearly understand captain vavassour that current hereabout be very irregular therefore wish to accept position of ship a there laid down a merely approximate yes quite understand answered skipper now assuming position to be correct mr trimble can hing else think how far be from penmarks how do bear master took divider measured distance applied instrument to margin of chart announced distance seventy six mile good ejaculated skipper bearing master laid parallel ruler down on chart with edge passing through dot representing ship position also through penmarks then carefully slid ruler along surface of chart until same edge passed through centre of compass diagram read off bearing no'th east half east skipper turned sharply round to quartermaster how be head quartermaster demanded quartermaster glanced into compass bowl answered ' no'th east sir excellent exclaimed skipper why at rate mr trimble will pas outside ushant if keep on a be going now doubt sir answered master in opinion continued that be where fellow sighted while ago be bound to laid forefinger on part of chart where word brest be legibly printed ah ejaculated skipper be likely enough to be right will never get there even if have to drive frigate under water to stop hang wish weather must clear if only for moment allow to get sight of thank mr trimble will do released hold upon chart allowing corner have be holding to spring back curl up did same a ship took somewhat heavier roll than usual glanced out over bulwark at racing foam capped surge reared alongside at moment a if in direct response to skipper forcibly expressed wish haze thinned away somewhat to starboard revealing square abeam apparently about mile away dim misty grey shape faintly showing up through thickness to starboard sail ho cried excitedly pointing out there be sir even a word passed lip there came shout from lookout on forecastle of sail ho large ship broad on starboard beam ay ay see glass quick mr delamere answered skipper jumped for telescope drew tube handed over to impatient hand outstretched to receive by piece of good fortune atmosphere inshore of just then thinned away still more for few minute enabling to get tolerably distinct view of stranger captain vavassour glass in hand sprang up poop ladder with foot planted wide apart to give good grip of heaving deck applied telescope to eye followed might be at hand if required for long two minute stood intently studying stranger speaking to while gun ship heard mutter frenchman at steering parallel course to ourselves yes very likely making for brest rather stiff customer to tackle perhaps will not let that stop removed instrument from eye seeing at elbow handed back to thank mr delamere said will not require again so have better go below especially a there be probability that may have busy afternoon then descended to quarter deck where second lieutenant master be standing talking together near capstan gave quartermaster order to keep away point to eastward must have effect of causing to converge gradually upon frenchman when went on deck at eight bell be to find that atmosphere have thickened again to extent indeed that although be estimated that must now be within mile of french ship there be not faintest trace of to be seen skipper however considered that be now a close to a desired to be therefore ordered course to be changed back to north north east at moment when gained deck be giving mr howard instruction to let men have dinner then to put out fire clear for action keenness of crew to get to work be evidenced by fact that although men dinner be now ready be with utmost difficulty that must be persuaded to go below eat when at length went in obedience to captain imperative order returned to deck in le than ten minute at once set to work of own accord to put ship into fighting trim be evident to that master be greatly disappointed at not having be able to get sight of sun at noon must not help thinking that a time passed on be not only disappointed be beginning to grow more than trifle anxious especially a shortly after midday weather became more gloomy wind freshened very considerably betook to poop up down paced rapidly with hand behind back eye fixed abstractedly on deck except when raised from time to time to gaze long piercingly ahead at length four bell struck almost immediately afterward with further freshening of wind atmosphere cleared sufficiently to afford glimpse of french ship suddenly appeared with almost startling distinctness about three quarter of mile distant bearing one point before starboard beam dozen eager voice at same moment reported reappearance captain sprang up on poop to get look at be immediately joined by master who seemed to be making very earnest representation to what be must not hear for be now down on quarter deck have valid excuse for approaching nearer however whatever may have be captain vavassour be evidently disinclined to listen to for saw once twice shake head most determinedly pointing at same time at french ship still remained distinctly in view finally skipper left poop joined mr howard on quarter deck conversing very animatedly with for about five minute be while be thus engaged that master suddenly called down to intelligence that stranger have hoisted french colour upon gave order for own colour to be hoisted jumping up on poop went to flag locker drew out big ensign bent on to halliard with assistance of master ran up to mizen peak meanwhile men have long be at quarter ship ready for action be therefore not surprised to see first lieutenant descending to main deck evidently for purpose of conveying skipper final instruction to captain of gun be going to be running fight be about to open ball frenchman snatched that honour from for a be descending from poop to quarter deck after having hoisted ensign saw jet of flame cloud of smoke burst from stranger port side immediately afterwards heavy shot flew humming high over masthead almost immediately afterward three of starboard main deck gun spoke simultaneously a smoke from swept away ahead of heard captain of aftermost quarter deck gun cry out that three shot have hulled french ship for have seen splinter fly in three distinct place then at brief interval remaining gun of starboard main deck battery be fired seemingly without doing very much damage firing now became brisk on side french fired much quicker than did reason being a afterward learned that captain have given most imperative order to first lieutenant that gun captain be not to fire until have made sure of aim wisdom of soon became manifest for while french fired upon average three shot to one damage sustained by be very trifling while be not long before french ship sail rigging became good deal cut up to extent indeed that be obliged to clew up topgallantsails in order to avoid running too far ahead of adversary suddenly simultaneous discharge of three four of main deck gun be followed by cheer of delight from lad jumping upon carriage of one of quarter deck gun be just in time to see french ship mizenmast fall forward dragging down main topgallant mast with passing through main topsail mainsail in fall splitting from head to foot there be at once great confusion on board frenchman being thus deprived in moment of after sail immediately fell square off before wind about three point more to eastward than course be steering hurrah have now exclaimed skipper delightedly rubbing hand up with helm quartermaster follow weather brace mr galway square yard set topgallantsails again land can not be far off now must strike will drive ashore jump down on to main deck mr delamere request mr howard to train starboard gun a far forward a will go then to rake time luff change in relative position of two vessel caused by of squaring away dead before wind be that french ship be now almost stern on to broad on starboard bow about mile distant sprang down ladder on to main deck there found first luff superintending working of heavy gun men have stripped to waist to obtain utmost possible freedom of movement while hauling upon tackle flourishing handspike sponge rammer generally speaking have discarded hat knotting bandanna handkerchief round head in place of be eager to get to closer quarter with enemy be a merry a cricket bandying jest with other in interval of toiling at gun delivered message at same time seized opportunity to inquire whether casualty have occurred on deck mr howard informed that there have be none thus far with information returned to quarter deck reported to captain brief a have be visit below found upon return from that material alteration have occurred in relative position of two vessel during interval be gaining upon chase hand over hand have shortened distance between to short quarter of mile be a close a wished to go skipper having now determined to keep to windward be to say astern of frenchman alternately to luff bear away passing athwart athwart stern on opposite tack raking first with one broadside then other pouring in round shot grape be in act of giving order to clew up topgallantsails to haul down couple of reef in topsail so that might not gain farther upon chase when went up to to make report a soon a have finished delivered be again sent down to mr howard to acquaint with captain vavassour plan at expressed utmost satisfaction immediately ordering men in port battery have not yet be engaged to stand to gun upon return to quarter deck after second visit below men be laying in off yard after having hauled down couple of reef in topsail a soon a be down on deck sail trimmer be sent to brace helm be gently ported frigate be gradually brought to wind on starboard tack exposing port broadside to french ship a went surging athwart enemy stern whole of port battery main quarter deck gun be discharged into raking fore aft then helm be eased up frigate paid off came gradually to wind on port tack a again crossed stern french ship got full content of starboard battery with destructive effect if one might judge by battered appearance of stern quarter gallery being shot to piece one of stern window broken thus showing that pretty nearly whole discharge must have entered hull raked deck from aft forward now that have adopted plan of alternately coming to wind bearing away again began to realise for first time how hard be blowing for when hauled to wind ship be so heavily pressed down by canvas that at lee roll main deck port sill be brought down to within few inch of boiling sea task of working gun effectively taxed skill of seaman to utmost so much so that mr howard presently sent up message to skipper to ask whether must be possible to relieve ship to extent of taking mainsail off captain vavassour immediately issued necessary order clew garnet buntlines leech line be manned at moment that ship be running off wind tack sheet be eased up great sail most powerful in ship be handsomely clewed up a men appointed to furl made way aloft relief to frigate be immediately apparent at once became more lively buoyant if speed be decreased at decrease be inappreciable manoeuvre be executed during time that frigate head be being directed to southward for purpose of giving french ship content of port battery for second time gun have just be discharged when a smoke blew away saw that antagonist have put helm down be trying to come to wind upon port tack with object a supposed of returning fire a head swept sluggishly round began with apparent difficulty to come to mainmast went over side fell off again without having fired single gun sight of falling mast be greeted by lad with enthusiastic cheer then helm be put up to wear round upon other tack when master who time have be anxiously pacing poop suddenly ran to head of poop ladder shouted strike sir strike jumping upon breech of gun saw tricolour being slowly hauled down from ensign staff upon have be hoisted when mizenmast fell captain too sprang up beside in time to see flag go fluttering in over taffrail a be hauled down tremendous volley of cheering greeted intelligence of success joy be short lived for cheering have scarcely died away men turned to secure gun when master came rushing down poop ladder addressing skipper said be wonder that fellow have hauled down colour sir have made land will be ashore in ten minute see sir if will look intently past will catch occasional glimpse of leaping whiteness there clear somewhat do see breaker inshore of ay now may also see loom of land through haze skipper sprang half way up poop ladder glanced ahead finally ascended to poop from whence must get clear uninterrupted view ahead to leeward then holding on hat with one hand while shaded eye with other stared intently to leeward by jove trimble exclaimed to master who have followed be right be breaker be land yonder without doubt where in world be man must be mile to leeward of reckoning yes sir answered master there be denying that must remember if please that wind headed broke off couple of point hour ago have made lot of difference then there be doubt that strong breeze blowing dead on shore have created powerful in set sending bodily to leeward have be exceedingly anxious for last hour two for know part of french coast well be fully aware of extremely treacherous character where be man where be demanded captain with more than trace of anxiety impatience in tone of voice ah sir must tell better if must only clear enough to let see of detail of coast more distinctly answered master in tone of anxiety equal to captain own continued although can not say to within few mile precisely where be have not slightest doubt that be somewhere within limit of audierne bay audierne bay wind blowing gale from sou west ejaculated skipper with note of something approaching to dismay yes sir audierne bay repeated master be only there that must possibly have come within sight of land at hour of day perhaps must like to bring up chart captain vavassour yes pray do so answered skipper master have scarcely disappeared down hatchway on way to cabin when french ship having made ineffectual effort to round to have fallen off again have continued to run dead to leeward suddenly broached to terrific sea struck on port quarter turning broadside on to foremast went over side instantly dozen voice shouted excitedly frenchman be ashore sir yes there be doubt about for now sea a rolled in made clean breach over must see lift to rolling over at blow almost to beam end ay muttered skipper be close at elbow having followed might be at hand if required ay be ashore fast enough will never come off again for hour of such pounding a be now getting will make end of will be very lucky indeed if follow hillo mr delamere be that just find mr howard say will be obliged if can come to on quarter deck ay ay sir answered touching hat a started down poop ladder guessed must find first lieutenant on gun deck there be superintending securing of gun task needed to be done very carefully thoroughly for now that ship have be brought to wind be rolling pitching most furiously if one of long pounder must chance to strike adrift consequence might very easily be disastrous delivered captain message then followed first lieutenant on deck where joined skipper master who be already standing at capstan with chart spread open before on head have good sufficient excuse for lingering near therefore passed over to lee side of deck a became well trained midshipman consequently only caught word here there a staggered fore aft in lee scupper heard captain say something about audierne bay then little later master said something about land take westerly trend penmarks finally captain a though closing discussion said very well then will try while there be still room sooner better get mainsail on again at once mr howard surmised from last remark on part of captain that be about to make attempt to tack ship indeed be full time for something to be done for breaker be now distinctly visible for space of about two mile on lee beam seemed to be rather trending out athwart bow must therefore soon be necessary to get ship round on other tack by staying wearing so must be wise to make attempt while there be still room to resort to second expedient must first fail few minute later mainsail be once more set sooner be tack boarded sheet dragged aft than felt difference be tremendous for whereas have before be going along comfortably enough despite heavy rolling pitching moment that felt extra pressure due to expansion of large area of canvas to gale lay down to until at lee roll muzzle of quarter deck gun be buried in boiling yeast foamed swirled giddily past to leeward sometimes surged in through port filling lee scupper knee deep with water whereas have before ridden buoyantly over head sea with nothing worse than occasional shower of spray flying in over weather cathead frigate now plunged bow savagely right into very heart of quivering to keel with violence of shock raising very hurricane of foam spray about figurehead shipping green sea in ton over forecastle at dive while main tack groaned like giant in torment a seemed to strive to tear up very deck of ship keep clean full quartermaster let go through ordered skipper ay ay sir clean full be answered quartermaster a gave extra spoke of wheel while captain first lieutenant stood together close by weather bulwark watching behaviour latter grasping speaking trumpet in hand at length after eight ten minute of suspense skipper spoke here come smooth now think may try mr howard ay ay sir answered first luff placing trumpet to lip shouted hand 'bout ship wee wee wee wheetle eetle eetle e e shrilled boatswain pipe followed by hoarse bellow of hand ship up came men hurrying to several station first lieutenant paused instant flinging lightning glance fore aft deck cried ready ho through trumpet then turned to quartermaster said ease helm down gently to start with quartermaster will sail round a far a can then keenly watching behaviour of ship a swept up into wind presently signed with hand hard down cried through trumpet helm lee whereupon fore fore staysail sheet be let go overhauled meanwhile party of men on poop have dragged spankerboom a nearly amidships a must get presently square canvas be shiver slatting furiously causing ship to tremble to keel raise tack sheet be next order now came critical moment question must hold way long enough to cant in proper direction a luck must have just then there came hissing foaming down upon particularly heavy sea into frigate dived until be smother for'ard yet notwithstanding head continued to sweep round slowly be true still mainsail haul bellowed first luff through trumpet round swung after yard men bracing well up rounding in on main sheet now head be beginning to pay off slowly first lieutenant dash up on poop look over side have begun to gather stern way shift over helm quartermaster shout over with stand breathless awaiting result ah be better now pay off freely presently main topsail fill with loud flap fore tack head bowline of haul yell mr howard head yard sweep round be braced hard up fore main tack be boarded weather brace steadied taut weather lift bowsed up bowline hauled away go saucy europa on other tack having stayed triumphantly in wind sea must have compelled most ship to wear chapter five europa have narrow escape splendidly done mr howard very fine bit of seamanship exclaimed captain vavassour when at frigate be fairly round be once more going through water must allow to compliment to tack ship successfully in such wind sea a be mean feat in opinion slightest error of judgment single second of hesitation must have resulted in failure thank captain vavassour answered first luff flushing with pleasure at skipper praise feel intensely gratified at appreciation really make too much of sir be not to whom merit actually belongs to ship work a handily a little boat have such perfect confidence in really longed to try experiment although grant that know ship with must care to make same attempt under similar condition indeed agreed captain still be only by making experiment with new ship that can learn just how far may be depended upon to do certain thing at critical moment lesson be most useful one to learn seems inclined to clear bit think for surely be french ship see yonder there just clear of fore rigging yes sir be beyond doubt answered first lieutenant fancy will see good deal more distinctly few minute hence when bring more abeam driving of big chap like ashore without so much a single casualty on part ought to be feather in cap think for be a good a lost ship will never again leave that berth agreed skipper believe will indeed appears to that glass if please mr delamere handed instrument applied to eye for full minute more yes continued handing over telescope to mr howard think be not mistaken take squint at howard tell whether doe not look a though back have already broken in turn first luff peered long earnestly through tube at length lowering from eye said be rather difficult to speak with absolute assurance sir for sea break so violently over that be almost impossible to get sight of whole of hull at given moment still be inclined to say that not only be back broken that have actually parted in two amidships if will look at very carefully think will agree with that hull show distinct twist that after end have much heavier list than bow at moment eight bell struck a midshipman who be to relieve be already on deck a be pretty nearly wet through with spray that frigate be now throwing over in drenching shower went below to change to get cup of hot coffee two succeeding hour constituting first dog watch brought material change for worse in condition of weather for while haze have cleared away enabling to see land distinctly to leeward six mile distant wind have increased to extent that sail have be reduced to close reefed topsail reefed course while sea have risen in proportion be now so heavy that frigate be literally smothering forward at plunge fact be that be being terribly over driven yet skipper have alternative dared not relieve ship of inch of canvas for be on lee shore embayed land astern curving out to windward so far that farthest visible projection bore full point on weather quarter while chart told that beyond point dreaded penmarks stretched out still farther to windward moreover be almost a bad ahead for although point du raz seven mile distant then bore nearly three point on lee bow knew that stretching out to seaward from point there be dangerous reef with only comparatively narrow passage between equally dangerous reef stretching out to southward eastward from isle de seins be open question whether must be able to fetch passage pas through to appearance captain vavassour be perfectly calm collected yet looked decidedly grave thought seemed rather portentous that master must be companion latter appeared to be doing most of talking be clear to see that at least be distinctly anxious at length apparently by way of reply to few word from captain went below minute two later returned to deck with chart under arm then with long look into binnacle skipper passed into cabin together immediately seized opportunity to take squint at compass noting exact bearing of point on lee bow direction in ship be heading then went down below into midshipman berth where maxwell master mate be laboriously endeavouring to translate french book with aid of grammar dictionary here drop that maxwell exclaimed let have look at chart that may see what next hour two have in store for if be anything of physiognomist master be fervently wishing that be at home with wife family to night instead of where be while skipper too look anything cheerful have gone into cabin trimble have taken chart with well there be particular reason why must not do be there demanded maxwell why must be especially anxious now more than at other time thing be right on deck be ay answered up to certain point be reach down chart produce parallel ruler divider hearty want to get sort of notion of what be ahead of be frightened too then demanded maxwell a pushed away book reached up for chart certainly not answered be indisputable that ship be embayed on lee shore that be blowing whole gale of wind if therefore there be prospect of being obliged to swim for life presently must like to know hang man surely be not nearly so bad a be demanded mate a spread chart out on table oh be retorted gascoigne midshipman who have just come below in time to hear tail end of remark maxwell reply to be evident that have not be on deck within last hour must say that why man alive if must just pull together enough to become conscious of antic of hooker must understand that be being driven a ship ought to be driven without good sufficient cause there a frigate plunged dizzily rolling at same moment almost over on beam end quivering violently throughout whole fabric at shock of sea have struck while plate pannikin cup saucer knife fork book candle heterogeneous assortment of sundries flew from rack shelf with clattering crash constituted very pretty general average on deck what d think of noble knight of sextant just gather up wreckage son put unbroken thing back into place exclaimed maxwell also clap stopper upon jawing tackle younker have altogether too much too say for little here fleming to mid who be lying upon locker with hand clasped under head by way of pillow rouse bitt hearty make useful for once in way grab corner of chart hold down to table until give spell be now then delamere what be that want to know first of said prick off ship position a be quarter of hour ago there be point du raz very well when came below bore exactly north quarter east by compass distant say seven mile mark off bearing distance to start with maxwell did so making little dot with pencil on chart there be said now what next ship be heading north north west said what want to know be be going to weather point if so what lie beyond ah exclaimed maxwell a critical nature of situation began to dawn upon see rather will see in minute two gascoigne be on deck when log be last hove if be not ought to have be know be interrupted gascoigne be doing bare seven making two half point leeway whew whistled maxwell two half point be bad old girl ought to be ashamed of self respecting frigate ought ever to make more than two point leeway oh ought jeered gascoigne just go up on deck see how sea that hit knock bodily to leeward will tell different story friend well well will take word for time young man just to encourage bit know now let see how work out how did say be heading delamere ' west repeated ' west echoed maxwell seizing parallel ruler applying to chart two half point of leeway applied to right make north half east while point du raz bear bore north three quarter east um be going to be touch go ' with be afraid at rate for while will doubtless weather point all right there be that out jutting reef be a likely a not to bring up with round turn supposing must be lucky enough to scrape past inquired be there anything beyond need worry about be almost certain that heard master say something about le stevenets such name le stevenets repeated maxwell yes of course there be about two half mile to west of point see why old trimble need worry about for if ca weather there be plenty of room for to pas to leeward after having done will have plenty of time to decide upon next move be critical point put finger on point du raz be going on deck to see how thing look so saying maxwell rolled up chart put instrument away turned up collar of jacket sprang up ladder gascoigne fleming following upon arrival first thing noticed be that captain first luff master be standing together close under shelter of weather bulwark apparently holding sort of council of war weather thought looked somewhat more promising than have done when went below for sky to windward have broken displaying very wild stormy sunset be true yet fact that heavy lowering canopy of cloud have broken up at seemed to indicate that worst must soon be over be still blowing very heavily while atmosphere be now quite clear of mist permitting view to extreme confines of horizon everything wild tumultuously heaving sea to windward land ahead to leeward preternaturally hard outline point du raz be now about three mile distant bore about point maybe trifle more on lee bow with surf breaking furiously upon reef projected beyond while leeward extremity of reef jutting out from easternmost extremity of isle de seins lay dead ahead smothered in boiling passage between two reef now looking alarmingly narrow be through passage must win safety be of course on lee side of deck so must only catch occasional disconnected word of what passed between trio to windward presently gathered that master seemed to be endeavouring to persuade skipper to wear ship while still have room enough to execute manoeuvre captain vavassour appeared to be objecting upon plea once on other side of point have nothing more to fear whereas must wear ship now must be heading for penmarks a soon a got round upon other tack must reach be faced with task of weathering during hour of darkness skipper be evident be for grappling with nearest danger for reason that must at least have light enough to see what be doing mr howard seemed to side with sir remonstrated master desperately have considered what must inevitably happen if flaw of wind must come round that point at critical moment break off a be likely enough to do well n o answered captain slowly have not thought of must confess for believe that thing be at likely to happen be very much obliged to for mentioning mr trimble for forewarned be forearmed ' in circumstance like present be bounden duty to take possible precaution for safety of ship be still of opinion that unless something unforeseen such for instance a occurrence have just suggested must happen will weather point go clear to provide against anything of sort mr howard turning to first luff be good enough to see everything ready for club hauling ship have best bower cable ranged double bitt stopper at say thirty fathom mr galway where be mr galway mr delamere be good enough to find mr galway say want tell that may be necessary to club haul ship request to muster carpenter mate below ready to cut away best bower at instant give word then come back to may want ay ay sir answered touching hat away went heading for second lieutenant cabin met just coming out somebody having already passed word that captain wanted delivered skipper message received assurance that must be ready then returned to quarter deck presently mr howard returned to inform captain vavassour that order have be carried out very well sir answered skipper let men go to station for tacking ship hand by best bower anchor oblige mr howard by seeing personally that anchor be ready for letting go also that be let go on instant must give order if at last moment must become necessary to club haul will personally take charge mr delamere find one of boatswain mate station below at main hatchway in position that can see on deck here with instruction to wind call to cut cable moment that receives signal will pas on to critical moment be now close at hand point be endeavouring to weather be le than mile ahead still far enough on lee bow to justify hope that might yet go clear scene generally be of so alarming character situation be so critical that even bravest man there might well have be excused if failed to regard altogether without apprehension for be now blowing harder than ever sea be breaking with absolutely appalling fury on reef speaking eloquently of fate awaited in event of failure over driven ship so heavily pressed down by canvas that lee side of quarter deck waist be afloat groaned complained in timber a literally fought way through opposing sea smothering forward so completely at mad plunge that who be standing by to let go anchor have be compelled to lash firmly at post to avoid being washed overboard add to fierce shriek howl of wind through rigging aloft groaning of mast in partner of main tack a ship rolled to windward thunderous shock of sea a smote bow shattered into blinding sheet of spray flew a high a foretop drenched lee clew of topsail sight of spar bending whipping to terrific strain that be called upon to bear remembering too that if anything must carry away just then must mean utter destruction of ship loss of hand reader may be able dimly to picture feeling animated ship company of europa on occasion even skipper looked shade paler than usual a slowly brought speaking trumpet from behind prepared to raise to lip be now so near reef that must hear hollow booming thunder crash of sea breaking upon outer extremity be within cable length of lee bow be evident that even if went well be going to be touch go with when suddenly ship came upright sail flapped with report like discharge of pounder that fatal flaw of wind round point master have foreseen have come upon up went trumpet to captain lip from issued bellowing call of hand 'bout ship ready oh ready down helm quartermaster stand by to let go at word mr howard ay ay sir came response faintly heard above howl of wind thunder of surf on rock to leeward heavy slosh of sea in over bow hair raising slatting of canvas overhead ship in obedience to lee helm have come up about point still forging ahead bringing outer extremity of reef broad on lee bow when suddenly canvas with terrific report filled again ship careened to bearing up helm quartermaster hard up with let go off again will do yet by jupiter ejaculated skipper in voice quivered with excitement while master who have be standing close by while sprang to wheel lent strength to put over steady wheel be next order a ship paid off again once more began to gather way thus nearer quartermaster keep full let go through water what be about sir a ship suddenly griped weather leach of fore topsail shook be undertow recoil of surf from reef be hawsing bow up into wind sir explained master a strained at wheel with sweat trickling down from underneath rim of hat there now fall off again steady a go a master let go wheel took off hat drew forth pocket handkerchief to wipe streaming visage end of reef drew fair abeam so close must almost have leaped from main rigging into boil of surf that seethed hissed swirled about black fang of rock showed here there above water danger be over for a ship went plunging surging past one must see how time lifted be a be dragged bodily to windward by strong undertow minute later reef be astern fast working out on weather quarter showing quite clearly how exceedingly narrow have be escape hold on there with anchor mr howard shouted skipper first lieutenant waved hand came aft wet to skin clothes streaming with water a though have be overboard a indeed have to intent purpose for while standing on forecastle waiting for order to let go anchor have be quite a much under water a above be a narrow squeak a have ever beheld sir exclaimed a joined skipper if have not be for board that involuntarily made must never have done agreed skipper believe that not even undertow must have saved however well that end well ' so will first take mainsail off mr howard then may splice main brace call watch let go along clean full quartermaster there be nothing to leeward now that need be afraid of how head ' west sir answered quartermaster clewing up stowing of mainsail without allowing to thresh to ribbon be task of little difficulty considering violence with gale be still blowing first luff be seaman enough to accomplish without mishap sooner be off ship than once more resumed former buoyancy of motion lifting easily over sea with only occasional sprinkling of spray upon forecastle instead of ploughing furiously through drowning whole of fore deck a have be doing during endeavour to work out to windward of point du raz so great indeed be improvement in condition generally that although be still blowing very heavily felt a though have suddenly passed into fine weather after recent buffeting three quarter of hour later passed le stevenets believe might have weathered have really made serious effort to do so there be need in case unlike of point du raz have option of going to leeward if chose skipper did choose have evidently have enough of close shave for one day moment recognised that must have if made attempt to weather group of rock ordered helm to be put up passed to leeward of giving good wide berth have stomach for again viewing surf washed rock at such close quarter a have be fated to do day by time that be well clear of le stevenets night have fallen for previous hour sky have be gradually clearing so that by end of second dog watch be fine clear star lit night wind too be distinctly moderating while sea although still very high be longer more regular not quite so steep a have be in word gale have broken by midnight be once more under course single reefed topsail by end of middle watch be able to shake out reef in topsail set topgallantsails after hove about headed south once more passing well to windward of isle de seins outlying reef about noon next day chapter six capture dutch frigate about fortnight later being at time off cape ortegal cruising under short canvas sighted at daybreak brig in offing to windward steering south under press of sail be at moment of discovery eight mile distant from general appearance especially from cut of canvas judged to be french man o ' war accordingly at once made sail hoisted private signal of notice be taken therefore concluded that suspicion relative to nationality be well founded crowded sail in chase sooner be act of ours perceived by stranger than weather being fine wind moderate breeze from west hauled wind bracing sharp up endeavoured to make escape to windward weather condition however be ideal for frigate overhauled brig so rapidly that by ten o'clock in forenoon be within gunshot of whereupon hoisted colour fired shot across forefoot a polite hint to to heave to reply to be to pour in broadside of seven pounder shot from flew over between mast doing damage upon perceiving noticing also that be about to return compliment by firing starboard broadside at hurriedly ran up french ensign a hurriedly hauled down again at same time backing mainyard in token of surrender thereupon closed with took possession prize proving to be fourteen gun brig gironde bound from brest to toulon transferred crew of seventy to frigate sent home in charge of mr galway second lieutenant prize crew before parting company learned from certain paper on board on th of previous month august treaty of alliance offensive defensive between france spain have be signed at madrid be thus at war with spain a well a with dutch french piece of news lad greeted with cheer of delight when be communicated to for gave enemy to fight to conquer be now at practically southern extremity of cruising ground with land plainly in view to leeward captain vavassour who seemed of late to have contracted marked dislike for anything resembling lee shore therefore decided to work well off land until frigate have gained track of homeward bound ship there to lie in wait for anything dame fortune might be disposed to send in pursuance of resolution made sail upon taut bowline a soon a gironde have parted company cracking on working out offing of about hundred mile by daylight next morning day dawned fresh clear with almost cloudless sky moderate breeze from about west by south very little sea overrunning long regular biscay swell be in short perfect atlantic weather about a complete contrast a must well be imagined to condition have prevailed during late experience in audierne bay weather being of so fine settled character have be carrying royal through night shortly after captain made appearance on deck at eight bell in morning watch breeze freshened up perceptibly whereupon good offing having be secured word be given to clew up furl three royal minute two later hand be aloft out on yard rolling up canvas be while be thus engaged ship being at time on starboard tack consequently heading to southward that hail came down simultaneously from fore main royal yard to effect that couple of sail be in sight broad on lee bow to inquiry on part of first lieutenant a to what looked like answer be returned that be impossible to say just then a stranger be so far away that even from lofty elevation of observer head of royal be only just clear of horizon mr howard cast inquiring eye about gaze fell upon mr delamere said have good glass just jump below get if please then shin up a far a main royal yard see what can make out concerning stranger did a directed hand who have be aloft meeting in maintop on way down what do strange craft look like simmons asked of smartest of party well sir replied a told howard few minute ago ca make much out of a yet be too far off for have got pretty good eye mr delamere think when brings that glass o ' yours to bear on that will find one on be got r'yals stowed while t'other have hers set likewise have sort of notion that if stay aloft for matter o ' ten minute so will find that there be three on instead o ' two at event just a be layin ' off yard thought catched glimpse of somethin ' showin now again that looked like canvas of craft just liftin ' over 'orizon thanks simmons said will keep lookout for number three if really exists ought to declare unmistakably within next few minute by bye suppose be heading way to best o ' knowledge belief be sir man answered be on yard long enough to make exactly sure seemed to that even durin ' minute two elapsed after first catched sight of lifted bit thanks said again will soon see sprang into topmast rigging proceeded on way aloft while simmons swung down over rim of top soon reached destination seated comfortably on royal yard with back resting against mast under lee from elevation stranger be distinctly visible to naked eye for atmosphere be a clear a crystal even before have established to liking unaided sight have assured that simmons supposition be correct that there be three sail instead of two to southward for object that topman have only believed saw elusively appearing vanishing on verge of distant horizon now stood out clear sharp a tiny patch of canvas showing milk white in morning sun well clear of other two soon brought telescope exceptionally powerful instrument to bear upon three patch of canvas gleamed like tiny shred of fleecy summer cloud upon sharply ruled edge of dark blue sea at once discovered that simmons have be so far right that one of craft have indeed royal stowed not only that topgallantsails also while other two appeared to be showing cloth must possibly spread including a soon made out topgallant studdingsails presently when have be working away with telescope for minute two hail came floating up to from deck below of royal yard there what have be able to make out respecting two strange sail to leeward looking down past left shoulder saw skipper first lieutenant gazing upward at be latter who have hailed there be three of instead of two sir answered while two of be carrying royal topgallant studding sail third have royal topgallantsails stowed from infer that two of be merchantman while third be man o ' war probably frigate short confab between captain mr howard ensued upon communication of bit of information then skipper hailed how do bear now mr delamere do seem to be drawing out athwart hawse at bear about two half point on lee bow at moment sir replied think that if hold on a be going now will weather leading ship one take to be frigate by about mile be rising fast sir head of leader topsail be just beginning to show if breeze continues a fresh a be now ought to be abreast of in about made rapid calculation hour half from brief interchange of remark between captain first luff followed communication then latter hailed again thank mr delamere will do for present have better come down get breakfast estimate a to time at must close with stranger be not far out for when having snatched hasty breakfast again went on deck head of leading stranger topsail be visible above horizon having made sail about quarter of hour earlier hauled to wind trifle a though to intercept a emerged from hatchway drummer began to beat to quarter mr percival third lieutenant having gone into fore topmast crosstrees to reconnoitre from lofty outlook having not only confirmed conjecture a to leading ship being undoubtedly frigate also expressed conviction that be foreigner by time that be ready to engage if need be strange frigate be hull up a have hauled wind still farther threatened to weather if did not mind what be about tacked ship when soon became apparent that europa be much faster vessel of two therefore stood on until be sure of ability to pas across other vessel bow upon next tack when went about again at same time hoisted colour to challenge stranger promptly replied by hoisting dutch colour thus declaring to be enemy declaration lad greeted with three mighty cheer ship be now close hauled on opposite tack dutchman heading to northward upon port tack while europa on starboard tack be heading up high enough to render certain that must be able to cross bow at about distance of cable length be captain vavassour intention to do if must pouring in raking broadside at proper moment dutchman soon let know that be not to be caught so easily for when arrived at about four point on lee bow suddenly went in stay giving starboard broadside a did so next moment storm of pound shot came hurtling about ear crashing through bulwark killing two men wounding five poor fellow besides cutting up rigging good deal immediately luffed returned compliment giving whole of port broadside main deck upper deck gun when smoke blew away have satisfaction of seeing that have shot away jib boom thus depriving of considerable amount of head sail at most critical moment moreover loss of jib caused to miss stay hang in wind so long that taking advantage of opportunity captain vavassour bore up passing close athwart stern raked most effectively with starboard broadside receiving only four shot from dutchman stern chaser in return meanwhile dutch crew went to work with most praiseworthy courage activity to clear away wreck so to reduce amount of after sail a to get ship once more under command before must succeed in doing have kept away far enough to give room to tack have gone about again once more crossed antagonist stern raking second time most destructively at close quarter with port broadside double shotted discharge must have played havoc with crew for when at length have paid off sufficiently to bring starboard broadside to bear be only able to fire little more than gun while be so indifferently aimed that only three four of shot struck now have very great advantage over antagonist from fact that spar be intact while be greatly hampered by loss of so much head sail advantage did not remain with very long for at next exchange of broadside down came fore topmast at same instant that dutchman mizenmast went over side put upon nearly equal term advantage being rather on side of antagonist if anything now went at hammer tongs making running fight of broadside to broadside a fast a men must load fire now too began to dawn upon that have caught tartar for dutchman mounted forty gun pound pound carronades against pounder pounder while close range at be fighting about pistol shot distance enabled heavier metal to punish severely lad cared very little about appeared one of remarking to in hearing that pounder must kill quite a effectively a at short range for part must a soon be killed by one a other appeared to be spirit animating hand for toiled away at gun loading firing with utmost rapidity cheering at broadside whether of own enemy work be too hot to last very long when have be engaged about hour noticed that antagonist fire be perceptibly slackening when at length contrived again to pas across stern deliver raking double shotted broadside hauled down colour hailed that surrendered word be at once passed to cease firing battle ended for at rate be not at sorry for there have be moment when appeared to a though be bent upon emulating famous kilkenny cat who fought until nothing tail remained now came task of taking possession of prize investigation revealed fact that out of boat only two be in fit state for immediate service namely second cutter captain gig others having be more le damaged by enemy shot skipper therefore ordered former to be lowered directing mr percival third lieutenant to go away in taking with a many men a must carry mr delamere continued captain vavassour have better accompany mr percival bringing back boat with couple of hand a soon a have obtained essential information be a quick a can if please because want to be off after other two craft ay ay sir answered a turned away to go below fetch dirk couple of minute later be clear of europa pulling away toward dutchman skipper injunction to to hurry being emphasised by fact that a passed through gangway caught sight of carpenter mate busily engaged upon task of routing out new topmast from among assortment of spare spar that carried meanwhile other two craft of skipper have spoken have appearance of being dutch indiaman under convoy of frigate have hauled wind a soon a action began be now four mile dead to windward heading about north west cracking on with evident intention of getting out of sight if possible before must repair damage sufficiently to proceed in pursuit five minute sufficed to span narrow stretch of water separated from late antagonist upon climbing side be received at gangway by officer of twenty five year of age whose head be swathed in blood stained bandage who handed sword to percival with dignified bow officer who spoke english quite well informed that ship have captured be dutch frigate gelderland of forty gun homeward bound from east indie with two ship in sight under convoy further informed that name be van halst at beginning of action have be third lieutenant whereas in consequence of heavy loss inflicted by raking broadside be now ship commanding officer indeed appeared that fire have be fearfully destructive for in addition to damage have be apparent from europa deck now beheld dismounted gun shattered blood splashed bulwark cut rigging hanging everywhere in bight shot scored deck cumbered with dead dying men veritable shamble mynheer van halst must not tell precise extent of ship loss in killed wounded for there have be time thus far to ascertain sound member of crew be still busily engaged in terrible task of separating wounded from slain conveying former below to be attended to by surgeon told that have begun action with complement of three hundred ten officer men that believed from what have seen quite half of must have be put hors de combat now that fight be over ship taken poor van halst began to show sign of stress strain of engagement gradually turned ghastly pale lip quivered from time to time to extent for few second during paroxysm lasted be scarcely able to articulate staggered a stood talking to at length percival who must ill afford to waste time in conversation gently led into handsome cabin under poop deposited on sofa found decanter of brandy gave good stiff dose to revive left there with kindly injunction that be not to attempt to move until percival returned having thus disposed for time being of principal prisoner without a hoped hurting feeling third lieutenant took rapid stock of condition of prize percival mentioning such item of information a wished to have reported to skipper while jotted down in pocket book together with such other note a believed might be found of interest thus examined boat found three of absolutely intact while fourth must be rendered serviceable in about hour by carpenter shot having taken effect for most part on main deck then quickly surveyed stock of spare spar came to conclusion that damage in direction might be made good except so far a mizenmast be concerned must consequently have to go home brig rigged at best a barque meanwhile from moment when people first set foot upon deck have fallen to upon work of clearing away wreckage saving be worth saving knotting splicing rigging leaving dutch crew to look after wounded comrade convey below to surgeon at length after have be aboard about hour be ready to return to own ship therefore ordered two hand down into boat alongside shoved off for europa noting with great satisfaction a did so that breeze be fast dropping that two indiaman be still hull up not having made very much progress to windward during time have be aboard prize upon regaining europa deck found scene of feverish yet perfectly ordered activity everybody be busily engaged in one way upon task of making good damage to spar rigging by enemy shot strong gang upon forecastle have already cleared away wreck of fore topmast having removed from practically uninjured everything have be attached to in shape of other spar rigging so on such for example a topgallant mast royal mast with sail yard rigging topsail yard topsail cap crosstrees topmast rigging carpenter mate have already got new spar fitted ready for pointing while practically cut gear have be either knotted spliced a for casualty be delighted to learn that be very light taking into consideration determination with adversary have fought loss in killed wounded amounting to eight of former twenty two of latter of only seven case be regarded by surgeon a really serious captain vavassour be up on poop talking to master when passed in through gangway therefore at once made way to having reported in due form a come on board sir proceeded forthwith to make report referring from time to time to pocket book in order to assure be omitting nothing thank mr delamere skipper said when have finished seem to have brought very full complete report complete enough at event to give pretty clear idea of state of affair aboard prize from what tell judge that mr percival will have hand full for hour to come be not that so answered that be precisely how matter appeared to very well said then a soon a carpenter have finished here must go aboard prize taking with a many men a mr howard can spare will go with remaining aboard gelderland until able bodied portion of crew can be transferred to ship when will undertake piece of work using if need be to facilitate operation such of prize boat a will float have better find mr howard acquaint with arrangement then tell carpenter what want to do appears to that mr lucas be now almost if not quite ready to turn over to prize if so have better take across away trotted presently found first lieutenant on forecastle supervising labour of boatswain carpenter latter of whom be just putting finishing touch to part of work delivered message picked out fifteen more men to go aboard prize that being mr howard must spare hustled with carpenter crew down side presently found again aboard prize here short a have be duration of absence found great improvement in appearance of thing mr percival gang have be working like demon have made great advance toward general clearance of wreckage so much so indeed that be quite ready for carpenter to start work at once while a for dutch crew have completed task of carrying below killed wounded be busily engaged in washing down main deck otherwise obliterating a far a might be evidence of recent battle allowed to finish job although knew skipper to be very anxious to be off in chase of two indiaman for have noticed while crossing over to prize on last occasion that wind have fined away to mere zephyr that indiaman be still hull up while there be appearance of weather falling stark calm within next hour two therefore told that taking everything into consideration there be really great need for hurry have not to wait very long for within hour dutchman have done be possible for to do by noon have completed somewhat disagreeable task of transferring prisoner to europa taking with on last trip dutch surgeon report upon loss incurred by gelderland during action a anticipated by van halst be exceedingly heavy killed numbering thirty two while wounded totalled le than one hundred thirty one of whom at least ten be so desperately hurt that there be little hope of outlasting night by time that be done mr howard have got new fore topmast on end rigged topsail yard aloft secured topsail fore topmast staysail jib set when at once filled on ship hauled wind in pursuit of indiaman mr percival having received order to follow a soon a must make sail then piped to dinner hand having spent most strenuously busy morning at four bell in afternoon watch wind have fined down to such extent that frigate be making no more than bare four knot through water although have by time got up fore topgallant royal mast again be once more under plain sail while a for two indiaman built a cargo carrier rather than for speed appeared to scarcely have steerage way seemed to maintain luff only with utmost difficulty indeed there be time when fell so broad off a to present full broadside to although capture might now be regarded a practically certain be evidently not disposed to yield without making sort of struggle for liberty for be on opposite tack one of having gone about idea of course being to separate widen distance a much a possible in hope that by so doing one of at least might escape even if other be captured captain vavassour however did not allow tactic to disconcert in least fixed upon one of a object of pursuit altogether disregarding movement of other meanwhile devoted effort to close with with result that by two bell in first dog watch be within gunshot of quarry when shot be pitched across forefoot a gentle hint to to heave to declined to take hint be not until sent shot whistling between mast that sturdy old mynheer must be convinced of impossibility of escape when hoisted colour to peak only to instantly haul down again back mainyard in token of surrender mr delamere said captain will be obliged to send to take possession of ship take cutter therefore with dozen men armed of course proceed on board at once may take mr millet midshipman with who with couple of hand can bring back boat message may find necessary to send will have to depend upon dutch crew principally to work ship for until can make further arrangement a soon a have shoved off will proceed in pursuit of other ship have better follow so long a there be wind enough for to do so must use own judgment a to most opportune moment for sending away mr millet boat quarter of hour later followed by jack millet crew of twelve clambered in over bulwark of motherly old craft that have brought to formally took possession of haarlem dutch east indiaman of ton homeward bound from batavia full to hatch with rich cargo of eastern produce cuddy full of passenger who seemed to take capture very philosophically especially when explained to that might rely upon being left in undisturbed possession of strictly personal effect with skipper however most dignified old fellow white haired bronzed by nearly century of sea life be different appeared that be part owner of ship having entire saving of lifetime in purchase of fifty share quantity of cargo in hold although did utmost to face misfortune a brave man must tear started to eye a explained to that capture of ship must leave frau absolutely penniless in old age endeavoured to soften blow to a much a possible by sympathetically murmuring idiotic platitude about fortune of war of course be good poor old fellow simply shook head ejaculated ay fortune of war be very well for young sir who depend upon war to provide with career to talk like think of thousand who be ruined whose heart be left desolate by war think of parent who have to mourn loss of son cut down by war in very flower of manhood because ruler can not agree tell sir that if men be what must be honourable honest upright faithful follower of christ there need be war to replied that doubtless be true that if must be compelled to wait for abolition of war until mankind became perfect have conviction that must live to see chapter seven ho when through captain of haarlem a interpreter explained to dutch crew that be intention to call upon to continue to work ship seemed disposed at outset to refuse soon brought to more reasonable frame of mind by giving choice of remaining in own forecastle enjoying liberty of haarlem deck on one hand being transferred to frigate confined below on other when took few minute to make up mind that first alternative be by far more desirable of two having arrived at understanding filled away with cutter in tow stood after europa be now in full pursuit of second indiaman schelde of ton also from batavia with even more valuable cargo than carried by haarlem a now learned from chief mate of latter oh be weary work to attempt to turn to windward in light breeze in deep bluff bowed squat sterned dutch built haarlem after experience of smart lively swift sailing british frigate be therefore with feeling of utmost satisfaction shortly before end of second dog watch heard europa once more booming out summons to surrender saw mainyard of schelde swing slowly aback in response for now business of taking possession of third prize once over must at least bear up crowd sail for home with free wind to help over ground for by time mr percival have so far made good damage sustained by gelderland that once more have vessel under command be working out toward on port tack from what must see of behaviour of ship appeared to that even in guise of brig must be quite able to hold own with slow moving indiaman schelde frigate having hove to be able to close with in course of about hour when sent away jack millet two men in cutter with report to captain vavassour giving name tonnage nature of cargo of haarlem together with such other particular a thought must like to know also acquainting with fact that dutch crew have consented to work ship meanwhile europa have taken in light sail clewed up course with evident intention of keeping close company with prize a soon a schelde have be taken possession of prize crew put on board captain vavassour sent away gig to in charge of young millet with written instruction be to remain in charge of haarlem retaining jack to help to crowd sail for plymouth taking care to keep in close touch with rest of squadron jack good boy upon receiving instruction to join have have sense forethought not only to bring along own dunnage mine also a soon a have hoisted in two chest sent back gig proceeded to make ourselves comfortable by taking possession of two stateroom in cuddy that by good fortune happened to be vacant be close upon four bell in first watch when at length arrangement being completed europa hoisted night signal for to make sail upon wind having meanwhile freshened up again trifle wore round crowding sail upon two indiaman shaped course for ushant remained on deck until have seen topgallant topmast lower studdingsails set aboard command then having have busy very tiring day turned over charge of deck to bateman steady old quartermaster who have be spared to by mr howard laying strict injunction upon to keep very sharp eye upon dutch crew then turned in five day later at daylight made land came safely to anchor in plymouth sound just a breakfast bell be being rung on board two indiaman appearance of europa in sound accompanied by three prize one of be more powerful vessel than created great excitement ashore be speedily surrounded by whole flotilla of boat occupant of clamorously besought permission to come on board dispose of by sale barter varied assortment of good commodity that have brought off strictest order have be given that stranger be on account to be allowed on board that boat other craft be to be permitted to come alongside even approach prize be therefore obliged to posse soul in patience see fresh meat soft tack many other dainty that must gladly have purchased taken back to shore again two day later however prize be taken into hamoase crew landed after prize crew returned to europa where joyous news be communicated to that be to proceed at once to portsmouth to refit weighed forthwith stood up channel with slashing westerly breeze arriving at portsmouth on following day when hand be turned over to guardship frigate be taken into dock obtained leave without slightest difficulty spent very happy month with father at expiration of be notified that europa be once more ready for sea be requested to join forthwith on occasion left home journeyed down to portsmouth alone father happening at time to be suffering from attack of gout while not sufficiently serious to be alarming be nevertheless painful enough to preclude travelling upon arriving at destination called at george hotel where captain vavassour usually put up with intention of reporting to learning that be on board frigate at once proceeded to harbour engaging wherry transported belonging to spithead where europa lay at anchor be just in time to catch captain report before left ship for night then descended to midshipman berth where be joyously welcomed by former shipmate upon inquiring for latest news appeared that certain change have occurred in personnel of ship since have last met together for instance mr howard have most deservedly obtained promotion be given command while mr galway now reigned in stead aboard europa a second third lieutenant have two new men namely mr william gadsby mr edward sutcliffe of whom seemed to have made fairly favourable impression on whole although a be perhaps only natural occupant of midshipman berth seemed just little inclined to regard askance a newcomer of whom little be thus far known when hour so later again went up on deck through mr galway made acquaintance of new men speedily came to conclusion that though new second luff might possibly turn out to be rather taut hand perhaps little inclined to be intolerant of practical joking to midshipman be so prone yet on whole must not have much cause to regret arrival of mr sutcliffe among for of impressed a being exceedingly well bred men whether not must turn out to be capable seaman however be matter only time more intimate association must prove a have already intimated frigate have be reported a ready for sea when received order to join so be save in one most important particular namely that be short handed for although upon arrival home hand have be turned over to guardship placed upon book while own ship be in hand of dockyard people admiral have drawn upon pretty freely in order to enable other ship to complete complement go to sea so that when time came for europa to receive back crew be found that be nearly fifty men short of full number be more unfortunate in have very little time left in to make up deficiency for be to sail in three day time for plymouth there to form part of escort of large fleet of merchantman transport bound to west indie under convoy now be that new second third lieutenant showed mettle for on very night of arrival on board organised two formidable pressgangs led ashore one party landing at portsmouth other at gosport between managed to make clean sweep of pretty nearly crimp house within radius of four mile of harbour returning to ship shortly before daylight next morning considerably battered worse for wear for have be engaged in series of desperate hand to hand fight bringing with sixty three fine able bodied merchant seaman who have be in close hiding while awaiting berth few of men have already served on board man o war did not need very much persuasion to induce to enter again when ball having once be set rolling a be rest followed suit in little batch of two three until by midday whole of have volunteered have completed complement at daylight on third morning after arrival on board blue peter be hoisted fore topsail be loosed gun be fired a signal that be about to proceed to sea from moment until anchor be lifted be bustle confusion hoisting in securing boat stowing away stock of description clearing ship of woman wife sweetheart of crew trader who be anxious to obtain settlement of account captain gig have be sent ashore immediately after breakfast about ten o'clock returned bringing off captain vavassour boatswain piped hand up anchor hour later be bowling away down solent before fine easterly breeze arrived in plymouth sound next morning found assembled there about one hundred twenty sail of merchantman bound to various port on other side of atlantic in safe convoy of to destination be to take part also found old ship colossus frigate astarte of thirty six gun two gun brig hebe naiad at anchor outside merchant fleet being remaining ship of squadron detailed for convoy duty on day following arrival at plymouth wind shifted blew hard from south west with almost continuous rain a weather condition prevailed for eight consecutive day remained at anchor awaiting change of wind since be useless to take to sea fleet of merchantman greater number of be so deeply laden such poor sailers that must have be impossible for to make progress against wind be blowing dead in teeth during period of inaction thirty additional sail arrived at rendezvous anxious to avail of protection of convoy when therefore on ninth day weather cleared wind hauled round from south east merchant fleet of be to take care during passage across atlantic numbered in exactly one hundred fifty four sail change of weather occurred shortly after midnight with steadily rising barometer at daylight therefore commodore fired gun hoisted signal to weigh by eight o'clock leading ship in fleet be under way beating out to sea led by colossus departure being hastened by much firing of gun continuous display of signal flag two gun brig went out with first of fleet duty being to marshal merchantman into something like order when got outside astarte remained at anchor to quicken up movement of laggard expedite matter generally hard time have of for so short handed be of vessel that be obliged to send working party on board to assist in making sail breaking anchor out of ground by noon last of be fairly under way a soon a have passed outside of too weighed stood out after flitting hither thither hailing first ship then that with imperative order for to crowd sail oh what weary heart breaking work be business of whipping in for so sluggish be of craft that seemed a though must never be able to make way out to main fleet be by time hove to in offing however by eight bell in afternoon watch have contrived to hustle last one out to windward of eddystone when commodore made signal to fill away off went with wind couple of point free weather brace checked slower coach among merchantman with larboard studdingsails set then came signal from commodore to regulate rate of sailing by of slowest craft in fleet to keep a close together a prudence must permit finally signal to men of war to take station assigned to to keep sharp lookout for marauder last signal be made purely a matter of form duty not because be actually necessary for although none of have sighted suspicious looking craft on way round to plymouth felt pretty certain that news of assembling of convoy of probable sailing date must find way across channel sooner later must discover that few enterprising privateer be hovering upon skirt watching for favourable opportunity to cut in secure prize two south easterly wind held long enough to enable charge to get well clear of channel to southward of ushant before changed then gradually veered round until came out strong from north west when away went for madeira slowest ship carrying rag of canvas that must stagger under while faster craft be unwillingly compelled to shorten down in order that might keep together while a for ourselves astarte utmost that must show without running ahead of station be double reefed topsail sighted passed madeira on eighth day out from plymouth two day later to great joy picked up trade blowing fresh thus far have not sighted single suspicious sail most of be of opinion that having be permitted to come thus far without interference be now safe that with strong trade wind wafting along even slowest coach among at pace of from six to seven knot hour trouble be over more knowing one shook head smiled compassionately at ignorance said wait bit be right for at daylight on certain lovely morning when be by reckoning three hundred twenty mile from island of barbadoes upon going up to main topmast crosstrees to take look round generally count number of sail in sight discovered that at last wolf have entered fold be already playing havoc with for to start with one of finest fastest merchantman have hauled out from main body under heavy press of canvas be already hull down in south eastern board being evidently in possession of prize crew while in thickest of ruck be very large brigantine under exceedingly short canvas yet keeping pace with slow sailing merchantman first sheering alongside one hugging affectionately for few minute then turning attention to doing likewise be not for on northern flank of convoy there be small full rigged ship felt certain be stranger apparently pursuing same tactic a brigantine while far away to north be man o ' war brig cracking on in chase of five craft whether portion of convoy not must not at moment say seemed to be manoeuvring with deliberate purpose of drawing brig away from convoy so affording brigantine ship opportunity to put in good morning work unmolested on deck there hailed there be two strange sail astern seem to be running alongside taking possession of number of craft one large ship be heading south east already hull down from crosstrees here two brig hebe naiad be about fifteen mile off in northern board chasing five other craft thank mr delamere answered first lieutenant can count number of merchantman in sight will try to do so sir replied be afraid will be little difficult for be bunching together astern a though for mutual protection in manner be very confusing still will be glad if will do best to get information hailed first luff to replied a in duty bound ay ay sir will have try therewith set to work upon somewhat awkward task in middle of of merchantman began firing signal gun to attract attention example seemed contagious for in about five minute popping of pounder be almost continuous smoke became a thick a though small battle be raging while ship after ship hoisted signal for enemy in sight at length after being compelled to begin work over again two three time managed to complete count making of one hundred forty eight number reported to first lieutenant down on deck doe that include six craft appear to have parted company mr delamere hailed mr galway sir replied be number be still sailing in convoy first lieutenant conferred for few minute with captain who have meanwhile be sent for have come on deck then hailed again directing to come down meanwhile good deal of signalling have be proceeding between colossus astarte just a reached deck order be given to make sail two frigate having be instructed to chase stranger for in addition to pursue recapture large ship have by time vanished altogether in south eastern board at once hauled wind acknowledging signal from commodore crowded sail standing to southward upon port tack set everything to royal although moment that ship be brought upon wind yard braced sharp up became conscious of fact that trade be blowing quite strong enough to justify under ordinary circumstance in keeping topgallantsails stowed be time for prudence valuable property be being stolen under very nose ay murder being committed too for aught that must tell to contrary marauder must be caught punished therefore cracked on pressing beautiful frigate to utmost limit of endurance oh what joyous exhilarating sensation be to feel ship alive once more a be heeling steeply over to shrill piping of strong salt breeze bounding from wave to wave plunging sharp stem deep into heart of oncoming surge cleaving indigo crest asunder in perfect storm of sparkling foam above played miniature rainbow after being compelled for week to moderate pace to of sluggish merchantman shift of helm brought portion of convoy in midst of big brigantine be pursuing nefarious trade square upon weather beam a be now going off practically at right angle to course steered by convoy a be sailing at good rate relative position very quickly altered a brigantine have not yet seen fit to haul out from among merchantman be beginning to hope that be too busily employed to notice movement that before did so took alarm must gain weather gage of be not going to be quite so easily caught a that happened however that at precise moment when hauled out from main body have run alongside large transport carrying troop out to west indie officer on board having got timely notice of what be happening have prepared for visit by turning up soldier five hundred in number serving out ball cartridge to causing to crouch low behind bulwark then just a brigantine ranged up alongside to board soldier at blast from bugle have poured in fire of musketry have literally swept crowded deck filled with killed wounded causing to haul off in tremendous hurry soldier continuing to gall until contrived to escape by hauling wind interposing of other ship between herself transport even a be when at length hauled out clear of convoy proceeded to make sail be good three mile to windward of though about three point abaft beam of course heard faintly rattling crash of musketry volley be thus able to make pretty shrewd guess a to what be happening be not until brigantine have cleared convoy began to make sail that must form idea of extent to have be punished by soldier for picarooning craft usually go a heavily manned in proportion to tonnage a man of war be generally able to make sail quite a smartly now sail be made a slowly aboard a though have be short handed merchantman seven hand only for counted through glass going aloft to shake out reef from topsail to loose topgallantsail royal while two more appeared to be a many a must be spared to lay out loose standing flying jib when at length be under plain sail like saw that must have work cut out to catch for developed most extraordinary turn of speed although strong breeze heavy sea be in favour by time that have got reef out of immense mainsail have set enormous gaff topsail above have drawn so far ahead of a to bring couple of point upon weather quarter whereupon tacked advantage gained being solely due imagined to slowness of crew in making sail when be round full upon other tack be still quite three mile distant bore about point on lee bow of course very soon drew out athwart hawse now everything seemed to depend upon be more weatherly craft of two seen from fore topmast crosstrees to ascended for purpose of getting good look at appeared to be one of immensely beamy willow craft copied from slaver vessel knew although generally sailed like witch be often anything weatherly yet have heard of vessel thus modelled for sake of securing speed fitted with very deep keel to ensure weatherliness where light draught of water be not consideration remained to be seen whether brigantine be craft of class now that canvas be at length set heavy loss of men that have sustained be very serious disadvantage to for with one good man to steer must sail a well with dozen hand a with hundred on deck there must be doubt that be going very fast through water point now be whether a converged toward other a be now doing two craft being on opposite tack must persuade by mean of bow gun to give in so save time must be consumed in long stern chase mr purvis gunner believed that must having obtained permission from captain to try hand soon proved right by shooting away chase fore topgallant mast when loss of topgallantsail royal flying jib so far reduced speed that quickly became evident must either strike run gauntlet of entire broadside wisely chose former alternative twenty minute later be hove to with topsail aback on europa lee quarter chapter eight audacieuse privateer mr delamere said captain vavassour take dozen men mr gascoigne secure possession of brigantine if please stay moment a touching hat be about to dive below for chest have better have with simmons henderson a two out of dozen to take charge of watch take also two extra hand to bring back boat will remain hove to until have secured prisoner below have not time to tranship now when have done that will be pleased to bear up join convoy now be a quick a can young gentleman for be anxious to be off after merchantman yonder ay ay sir answered touching hat turning away to secure crew first found simmons carpenter mate henderson quartermaster informing of captain arrangement desired to pick out best ten men must lay hand upon arm get into cutter with bag hammock then make own preparation by time gascoigne must be ready then bundled below found gascoigne set to work to get own chest bedding ready ten minute later boat be lowered at lee gangway in ten minute be aboard prize be received at brigantine gangway by most ruffianly looking individual with left arm in sling otherwise bare head bound up in bandage through blood be even then oozing a proffered sheathed sword introduced a monsieur jules despard chief mate of french privateer brigantine audacieuse of dunquerque mounting sixteen long pounder long pounder on forecastle originally carrying crew of one hundred fifty six men of whom twenty five be away in indiaman have vanished in southern board while twelve more be aboard one of vessel of gun brig be in chase of remainder monsieur said there be fourteen beside who be fit for duty others including captain le mesurier have be killed outright severely wounded in murder trap dastardly transport of yours set for be base cowardly act of theirs to permit to approach within biscuit toss then shoot down like do think be more cowardly than for so heavily armed manned vessel a to range up alongside of attack perfectly defenceless craft like indiaman surprised in darkness monsieur demanded continued have time to argue point just now henderson to quartermaster just jump below see if can find spot where prisoner may be safely confined ay ay sir answered henderson touching hat a turned away to inspect forecastle friend monsieur jules despard appeared to understand english quite well for a soon a henderson have vanished said presume monsieur have full authority from captain to accept parole of such of a be willing to give for monsieur answered have received such authority on contrary order be to confine below for present at event until opportunity will occur to transfer to frigate monsieur order surely doe not apply to officer of ship a well a men remonstrated frenchman be usual to make distinction pardon monsieur interrupted appear to understand be ship man o ' war be merely privateer do do not hold commission ship of course be privateer letter of marque a have already have honour to inform answered despard therefore precisely cut in doubtless recognise difference whether do not matter nothing order be definite precise be duty to carry out must desire to make representation to captain vavassour when frigate rejoins will be happy to transmit to meanwhile shrugged shoulder expressively very well monsieur enseigne de bateau returned glowering at savagely if be determined to inflict upon indignity of confinement instead of accepting proffered parole can not help possibly may meet again under reversed condition must do so will find that memory for injury be good one turned walked forward wearing most ferocious scowl hissing execration between set teeth minute two later henderson returned to deck with intelligence that have found fine store room abaft fore peak must be cleared out in few minute must afford ample room for such of prisoner a must be necessary to put under restraint upon hearing went down below with leaving simmons in charge of deck personally inspected place appeared to be excellent in way for proposed purpose therefore gave order to take five men clear place out forthwith after be to get prisoner below secure while be doing went aft to cabin in search of writing material wherewith to pen brief report to captain vavassour brigantine be built with monkey poop extending from taffrail to within about eight foot of enormous mainmast main cabin with captain first second mate stateroom a also steward pantry lay beneath be most excellent arrangement for otherwise vessel being extraordinarily beamy very willow there must have be scarcely head room enough abaft in ship run for cabin whereas addition of four foot height of poop afforded delightfully lofty airy cabin for size of vessel found upon going below that chief second mate stateroom be situated respectively on starboard port side of ship forward of foot of companion ladder with steward pantry between window in cabin pierced through front of poop affording occupant excellent view of might be happening out on deck about three foot abaft foot of companion ladder transverse bulkhead extended for entire width of ship in centre of bulkhead be door gave access to cabin opening door passing on found in main cabin be exceedingly roomy pleasant little apartment of full width of ship well lighted by large skylight in deck above a well a by dozen large circular port in side furniture consisted of handsomely carved sideboard on one side of door balanced by well stocked book case on other there be cushioned locker running fore aft along side of ship beautifully polished mahogany table draped with handsome tablecloth occupied centre of cabin in one part of book case found massive inkstand well supplied with pen also abundant supply of stationery accordingly sat down penned report to captain vavassour have just completed document when henderson came down to acquaint with fact that prisoner who be in least likely to give trouble be securely lodged below therefore sealed report taking on deck handed over to one of two men who be to take boat back to frigate dispatched few minute later europa having meanwhile shifted berth hove to again close to leeward of boat passed under frigate stern disappeared from view seeing boat coming mr galway have manned tackle fall in readiness minute later be run up to davit boatswain pipe shrilled out mainyard be swung away went beautiful craft like hound released from leash in pursuit of vanished indiaman leaving to own device now have time to look about note effect of brigantine disastrous encounter with transport truly be terrible enough in conscience for although a soon a uninjured portion of crew have made sail upon vessel in unavailing effort to escape have employed in separating wounded from dead carrying former below to cockpit where ship surgeon be then busily engaged in attending to hurt there have not be time enough for to complete task slain wounded still cumbered deck to extent when upon departure of frigate gave order to bear up stand after convoy lad must scarcely get at sheet brace without trampling of under foot be everywhere between gun about hatchway especially on forecastle in wake of port fore rigging where have grouped thickly preparatory to boarding where lay literally in heap while bulwark be splashed with blood from end to end of ship lee scupper be still running with have ranged up on starboard side of transport consequently dead wounded lay thickest on port side of brigantine few of crew have apparently run round to shelter under lee of longboat be stowed on main hatch after receiving first second volley closeness deadly character of volley be borne witness to by fact that boat be literally riddled with bullet hole missile having evidently passed through through probably laid low one of that found on starboard side if further evidence be needed be to be found in fact that starboard bulwark almost a high solid a of man o ' war be pitted with bullet long way closer together than raisin in sailor plum duff a henderson caustically remarked first duty be of course to aid wounded who have not already be attended to therefore while simmons three hand busied aloft in clearing away wreck of fore topgallant mast remainder of prize crew set about gruesome task even gascoigne lending hand while took wheel dead be out of proportion to wounded a soon discovered for when individual exhibiting slightest sign of life have be found carried below proved that numbered altogether only thirty three out of total of one hundred nineteen be ship complement when attempted to capture transport deducting fourteen prisoner whom have confined below remainder representing killed amounted to le than seventy two hard necessity of case demanded that must launch overboard without delay did getting rid of whole of before closing with convoy done wounded conveyed below have time to think of ourselves make arrangement for own comfort during coming night there be difficulty about gascoigne arranging to sling hammock in late captain stateroom left chief second mate stateroom available for simmons henderson a for men simply screened off portion of mess deck near main hatchway slung hammock there wounded being accommodated in portion of mess deck forward of screen ship have hold in usual acceptation of term be to say there be space for stowage of cargo having be built a fighting ship pure simple space below mess deck being only comfortably sufficient to accommodate ballast water tank provision store generally thus although so heavily manned there be ample room aboard for whole of crew captain stateroom wherein gascoigne took up quarter be exceedingly comfortable apartment perfect palace indeed compared with midshipman berth aboard europa be situated abaft main cabin be like latter full width of ship measured about twelve foot fore aft be lighted by window reaching right athwart stern a well a by small skylight in deck above combination of two affording admirable facility for ventilation be very neatly comfortably though not extravagantly furnished standing bedplace with commodious chest of drawer beneath on starboard side being balanced by book case with drawer for chart on port side together with sort of cabinet in ship chronometer captain sextant be kept set of cushioned locker ran athwart after end of cabin between bedplace book case there be wash stand toilet table at foot of bunk table occupied centre of apartment immediately beneath handsome shaded lamp hung suspended by brass chain from skylight deck be comfortably carpeted chest of drawer be well stocked with clothing few garment together with oilskin coat legging sou'wester hung from brass hook screwed to fore bulkhead when went on deck again after brief sojourn below be met at head of companion ladder by simmons who touching hat said what about breakfast mr delamere have be too busy to think about up to present believe can find time to snatch mouthful of food drink now men be beginnin ' to ask what be latest news from galley ay to be sure answered be just wondering what be matter with now that come to mention mean that like men want breakfast be galley fire lighted yes sir answered simmons copper full of cocoa know where to find eatable henderson have be thinkin ' that must be bad plan to have ship cook steward up from below make 'em work for livin ' certainly agreed have up at once simmons by mean tell will probably not understand send aft to will tell want done few minute later two frenchman be brought up on deck to explained to that wanted to exercise usual function at seemed highly pleased small wonder for be certainly more pleasant to work be free than to be cooped up below in idleness hour later piped to somewhat belated breakfast very excellent one be too far better than what have be accustomed to aboard frigate came to unanimous conclusion that in other respect french might be ignorant at least understood art of living well breakfast over simmons went to work routed out spare fore topgallant mast prepared for sending aloft while rest of watch be busy clearing away wreck forward by time that new spar be ready for swaying aloft have overtaken rest of convoy when commodore sent away boat with first lieutenant of colossus in to receive report wrote out handed to retaining copy to be handed to captain vavassour after little chat together visitor instructed to retain command of prize until return of europa meanwhile to take place of ship to assist in protection of convoy also informed that during absence astarte have captured ship privateer have be so busy on outskirt of convoy few hour before while boat of colossus astarte have recaptured no le than five merchantman have be taken possession of by marauder a for hebe naiad have vanished in northern board a yet there be sign of return two day later arrived at carlisle bay barbadoes europa overtaking in offing in company with recaptured merchantman of have gone in pursuit while on evening of same day two gun brig also arrived bringing in with five vessel have started to recapture thus little squadron of privateer have waylaid have made bold bid for booty not only gained nothing lost own ship a well together with good many life heaviest loss of be that sustained by unfortunate audacieuse in blundering attack upon transport for in addition to seventy two killed found on board when took possession nine more have died of wound before anchored in carlisle bay remaining twenty four wounded together with who have be hurt on board other prize be taken ashore lodged in hospital at bridgetown while whole of prisoner be transferred to colossus gascoigne fully expected that must now be ordered to rejoin europa instead of to great delight be ordered to remain on board crew being increased to twenty six being a many a captain vavassour must possibly spare remained in carlisle bay just twenty four hour period utilised by refilling water tank laying in bountiful stock of fruit vegetable poultry together with a much fresh meat a believed must possibly consume before went bad then leaving in bay such ship a be bound for barbadoes sailed again for various island to charge be bound leaving at halting place until in fulness of time arrived at port royal thirty sail so that remained under protection be safely moored in kingston harbour remained at anchor in port royal full week during first lieutenant be more than generous to in matter of leave whereby be enabled to twice dine spend night at admiral pen meeting there making acquaintance of several military officer from up park camp a well a number of exceedingly jovial hearty hospitable civilian planter merchant so on from kingston surrounding neighbourhood be first experience of west indie after glorious scenery of island marvellous luxuriance beauty strangeness of tropical vegetation everywhere clothed think that what impressed most be amazing hospitality of inhabitant who positively seemed to vie with other in effort to show kindness did of want loan of horse vehicle to make excursion into country have to hint at requirement might take choice of dozen be instantly placed at service while invitation to dine spend night longer to join picnic shooting party be literally showered upon in such abundance that must have needed at least six month leave to have enabled to avail myself of thus in addition to two night spent under admiral hospitable roof passed one night might have passed many more at up park camp three whole day night visiting sugar plantation at saint thomas in vale in centre of island then came order to sail be obliged to bid regretful farewell to many kind friend not however until have extorted from more promise than must ever hope to fulfil must visit make long stay when next found in island order be to cruise in caribbean generally among lesser antilles for protection of own commerce destruction of of enemy during succeeding six month performed duty varied by occasional brief visit to port royal barbadoes making few unimportant capture meeting with adventure worth recording be through one of capture that first got news of surrender of island of trinidad on th of february to combined naval military force under rear admiral john harvey lieutenant general sir ralph abercromby be six week after occurrence of above event that while cruising off cape gallina on costa firme with head to westward found so nearly becalmed that became necessary for to set flying kite in order to retain steerage way night fell intensely dark for moon well advanced toward third quarter rose late while sky have gradually become overcast great mass of heavy cloud having worked up against wind threatening one of violent thunderstorm be so frequent in particular part of world storm gathered slowly when put in appearance on deck to stand watch at eight bell of second dog watch have not yet broken although occasional faint flicker of sheet lightning away to eastward warned that might expect to do so within next hour so at moment of appearance on deck however there be very immediate prospect of outbreak for wind although light be steady frigate close hauled on port tack be creeping along at rate of about three knot per hour while gleam of sheet lightning be exceedingly faint infrequent occurring at about ten minute interval very gradually brilliancy of flash a well a frequency duration increased until by two bell glimmer of of endured for perhaps a long a three second during entire sky with enormous fantastic cloud shape from horizon to zenith be lit up with faint sulphurous blue glare strongly suggestive of idea that be afloat in heart of enormous cavern momentarily illuminated by burning of port fire be during flickering of one of somewhat prolonged gleam that lookout on forecastle head reported small sail three point on weather bow headin ' to east'ard close under land mr galway at once sprang up on poop followed of intently staring in direction indicated by lookout transient gleam have by time flickered out might a well have be staring at vast curtain of black velvet for must see however by patiently waiting persistently staring in proper direction until next flash came at length contrived to get momentary glimpse of dozen voice at least exclaiming at same instant there be did see mr delamere demanded first luff a darkness again enwrapped yes sir answered caught momentary glimpse of what did make out to be asked now be surprising how much detail trained eye of sailor will grasp even in brief space of time occupied by gleam of sheet lightning be due in part think though certainly not wholly to what scientist describe a persistency of vision phenomenon cause image to remain imprinted upon retina of eye for quite appreciable period after object have vanished be certain that there be more in than though precisely what may be can not tell suffice to say be able to answer unhesitatingly brigantine sir of about two hundred ton under plain sail very low in water decidedly suspicious looking customer just so answered galway exactly what made out to be have goodness to step down report matter to captain vavassour if please there be need however for captain who have be reading in cabin have heard voice have come up on deck to see what be matter then ensued brief intensely exasperating period of waiting until flash came once more betrayed stranger whereabouts came at length revealed still standing to eastward so close under land for momentary illumination of sail by lightning must undoubtedly have slipped past unseen ah yes there be see exclaimed skipper wait until be abreast of then tack mr galway continued doubt can see great deal more distinctly than can see if tack now will doubtless do same with result that will be to windward ahead of if wait until get fairly past will be point in favour because if stand on can gradually edge down upon seems to be moving through water very fast light a be wind remarked first lieutenant ten minute ago be broad on weather bow while now be almost abeam expect will find that be quite a fast a ourselves chapter nine pirate brigantine watched stranger a be revealed at uncertain decreasing

swell with small overrunning ripple caused by faint breathing of breeze distant land brigantine sliding furtively along within shadow when at length have drawn to bearing two point abaft beam captain gave word to tack when three minute later be fairly round yard braced up sheet hauled aft frigate gathering way on starboard tack stranger lay straight ahead of of course have taken precaution to wait until immediately after lightning flash before putting helm down a happened next gleam did not occur until several minute after have tacked probability therefore be that stranger must know nothing about manoeuvre until scene be again illuminated question now interested be how must people act when made discovery that have shifted helm be standing in direction there be three alternative open to first might follow example tack endeavour to escape to windward if believed vessel speedy enough to succeed secondly might haul wind enter gulf of venezuela along shore of there be two three willow inlet in one other of might take refuge anchor in hope of being able to defend ship successfully against boat attack thirdly if be perfectly honest of have doubt might proceed steadily on way taking notice of movement when next got sight of third alternative seemed to be intention for so far a must discover have started neither tack sheet therefore proceeded to edge down very cautiously very gradually toward keeping about point on lee bow now discovered that task be not going to be nearly so easy a have at first thought for in very light breath of wind be then blowing be wholly insufficient to keep lower canvas asleep stranger undoubtedly have heel of slipping along so fast indeed that within quarter of hour of tacking be running off with wind abeam weather brace checked instead of being upon taut bowline a have be at beginning of chase meanwhile expected storm though have be brewing long showed unmistakable sign that be not going to keep waiting very much longer for sheet lightning be flickering almost incessantly while low deep muttering of distant thunder occasionally made heard storm seemed to be working up astern of for presently dazzlingly vivid flash of chain lightning rent darkness over weather quarter quickly followed by deep hollow reverberating peal of thunder rumbled like echo of seventy four broadside quickly followed nearer than have preceded presently far away astern of saw advancing toward sort of wall of vapour lower edge of gleamed white phosphorescent a wind in lashed surface of water into foam hand shorten sail be now word watch

swooped down upon with weird shrieking howl dash of wet be rain half spray next moment with tremendous creaking groaning of timber gear with three topsail yard on cap with chain bobstay half buried in foam heaped up about bow away went frigate like startled sea bird speeding down wind upon wing of squall enveloped in sheet of rain be more than half salt water with lightning flickering darting round thunder crashing overhead in continuous booming roar squall lasted very nearly three quarter of hour long before time have elapsed weather ahead have cleared sufficiently to enable again to catch sight of brigantine now about two point on starboard bow running dead before like under nothing close reefed topsail reefed foresail be still maintaining distance from in most wonderful manner be now possibly in consequence of having be compelled by squall to bear up steering a though to enter gulf of venezuela contrived to gain little upon by carefully watching opportunity making sail by degree a squall blew out in respect people be fully a wide awake a be made sail with boldness rapidity most conclusively proved that be very strongly manned therefore not in least likely to be harmless innocent trader that must doubtless have liked to persuade be be hugging land so closely that of be of opinion that skipper intended to run ashore take to boat if must prove impossible to avoid capture in other way captain did not believe master also seemed to be of opinion object said trimble be undoubtedly to get round point espada fairly into gulf if can succeed in there be plenty of little cove especially along western shore in might anchor sheltered from gun bid defiance to boat attack ah observed skipper with much meaning well will see be perfectly evident that be anxious to keep out of clutch desire argues guilty conscience on part only make more determined to overhaul confound here come rain again mr gascoigne have goodness to slip into cabin desire steward to bring oilskin on deck stay fellow will have turned in by time will get rain came swooping down upon with tail end of squall for quarter of hour be so thick that must see nothing couple of ship length outside bulwark then cleared away cloud dispersed star came out wind dropped to moderate breeze presently moon with nearly half disc in shadow crept up above horizon flooding heaving water with ruddy gold quickly changed to silver a satellite climbed high enough to clear herself of vapour distorted shape imparted to colour of burnished copper where be brigantine ahead abeam on quarter looked nowhere must discern faintest trace of have lost sight of bare quarter of hour in brief space of time have contrived to vanish a completely a though have gone to bottom in deep water leaving not so much a fragment of floating wreckage to furnish clue to fate skipper be a much puzzled a be annoyed in perplexity turned to master what do think have become of mr trimble demanded can not have gone ashore broken up so completely in quarter of hour that sign of must remain must see something at least in nature of wreckage to give hint of what have happened yet see nothing although if have be stranded either purposely by accident wreck ought to be away in there somewhere about abreast of there be off shore danger be there nearest that know of be monk away out here twenty five mile to nor'ard east'ard of answered master coast inshore of be of course bit rocky there be nothing so far a know in nature of hidden danger to cause wreck of brigantine sir be belief that there be snug little secret cove known to skipper of brigantine that took advantage of rain squall to slip into in hope of dodging ah said skipper yes be after only feasible explanation of disappearance be ahead astern to seaward of therefore must be hidden somewhere inshore mr galway to first lieutenant will shorten sail if please with ship head off land remaining in sight of coast until daylight when will perhaps be able to discover hiding place of brigantine be done during remainder of night europa under three topsail jib spanker stood off on never going farther from shore than distance of six mile very gradually working way back to a nearly a must guess spot where have lost sight of brigantine a night wore on trace of recent storm passed away sky cleared moon star beamed down upon in tropical splendour affording ample sufficiency of light to enable to maintain effective watch upon coast ensure that stranger did not creep out from place of concealment give slip terral land wind overpowered by recent squall once more resumed sway piped up strongly bringing off to warm fragrant odour of land vegetation at day dawned sun soared into view above eastern horizon with coming of light half dozen of best telescope in ship be brought to bear upon line of coast that lay about five mile distant on port beam happened to be lucky possessor of exceptionally good instrument present from father have not be long at work with when discovered what be unmistakably small indentation in coast line sheltered concealed by two headland approached other so closely that viewed from distance appeared almost to overlap immediately directed first lieutenant attention to spot at same time handing glass presently picked up agreed with that be undoubtedly cove tiny bay of sort be rather of opinion that be too small to afford shelter to vessel of dimension of missing brigantine nevertheless since be only opening that must discover be moreover about spot where stranger have disappeared be determined to give place overhaul helm be accordingly eased down yard braced in began to work in toward then fighting boat crew be told off to overhaul boat prepare for service yard stay tackle be got aloft for purpose of hoisting out launch boat gun be slung ready for lowering over side a soon a boat must be brought alongside ammunition box be brought on deck in short preparation be made for boat expedition after hand be piped to breakfast by time that meal be finished frigate have worked in to within about mile from shore at point ran into calm land breeze having died away boat be then got into water brought to gangway gun be lowered down secured to platform in bow of launch two cutter shot be passed down stowed on bottom board on side of keel ammunition box be stowed in stern sheet then else being ready who be to take part in expedition be mustered for inspection prior to being dispatched on what be likely enough to prove dangerous errand little recked of of possible danger on contrary if onlooker have judged only by satisfied smirk countenance wore might have be supposed that be bound ashore for day holiday in wood expedition be to be under command of mr gadsby second lieutenant who must go in launch first cutter be to be commanded by mr o'donnel boatswain command of second cutter be entrusted to mustered fifty altogether including marine when at length after having be carefully inspected by first lieutenant be given word to shove off men who be left behind sprang into rigging sped on way with hearty cheer took very easily a pulled shoreward in line abreast for be by time scorching hot be important that men strength must be husbanded to utmost extent in view of possible fight might be awaiting at end of journey kept sharp lookout ahead for although country in sight showed sign of habitation there be knowing how soon masked battery on one perhaps of headland might declare by dropping few shot among nothing however happened to hinder progress over glass smooth surface of water in course of about twenty minute reached opening between two headland found ourselves in mouth of small practically land locked cove of twenty acre in area with friend brigantine in very centre of with four anchor down two ahead two astern with boarding netting triced up port open gun run out eight long pounder in battery starboard broadside bearing full upon entrance there be exclaimed dozen eager voice in chorus while word be still upon lip eight jet of flame burst from side followed by eight wreath of whirling white smoke instantly commingled forming curtain completely hid long low black hull from a shower of grape came hurtling about ear saw big black flag go slowly soaring up to main truck self confessed pirate by piper exclaimed fred gascoigne who have calmly crawled out from under bow sheet of boat when be half way between frigate shore now give way men shouted gadsby springing to foot in stern sheet of launch waving sword above head give way get alongside before can fire again gunner fire slap at bulwark will board in smoke marine fire in through open port hurrah lad put back into at moment a smoke of brigantine broadside thinned away permitted again to catch glimpse of hull noticed peculiarity about craft seemed to offer very important advantage captain have in fact committed same oversight a frenchman in bay instantly hailed launch ahoy do notice mr gadsby that have netting triced up on port side apparently be making certain that intend to go alongside on starboard side by jove yes be right delamere answered gadsby will board on port side first cutter on port quarter second cutter on port bow keep up fire marine now gunner a soon a be ready blaze away three boat gun spoke at almost same instant so close be now to quarry that grape shot literally tore starboard bulwark to piece terrific outburst of shriek yell instantly followed upon discharge bore eloquent evidence to terrible havoc that have wrought among crew moment that have fired boat separated first cutter making wide sweep to port in order to pas under brigantine counter while sheered away to starboard to get under bow launch passing outside of in order to get fair run for brigantine waist minute be alongside hooked on then began most terrific struggle for brigantine seemed crowded with men have evidently taken little by surprise by boarding on inshore side instead of side be presented to upon entering cove be clear that like prize crew of indiaman in bay have never expected to think of pulling round under bow stern instead of dashing straight alongside of course be very easy matter for pirate to cross deck from one side to other a soon a discovered intention did lining bulwark from head rail to taffrail popping at with musket pistol thrusting at with pike cutlass hacking at hand head a endeavoured to climb side force way over bulwark in on deck lad be not to be daunted by resistance however desperate a surged up alongside dropped oar allowing to slide overboard tow by lanyard drawing pistol cutlas leapt to foot with wild cheer sprang on to boat gunwale thence to foothold that must find snapping pistol in face of who dared to show head above rail while marine thrust bayonet through open port into leg of individual who happened to be within reach thus disconcerting aim of many otherwise deadly stroke for few breathless second be fire smoke fury pistol cracking steel rasping upon steel cheer execration groan dull crunching sound of cutlass sheering through muscle bone heavy fall of stricken on deck scuffling of foot shout of defiance exchanged between contending party then few of contrived to get in on deck forcing back pirate making room for who followed until who be not too severely hurt to climb ship side be inboard there ensued deadly hand to hand fight in quarter be asked for given pirate seemed to number about three time a many a ourselves be truly desperate set of ruffian fighting a well knew with halter round neck doubtless preferring to die in heat of battle rather than perish ignominiously upon scaffold for few minute have work cut out to retain slight advantage that have gained gradually lad drove antagonist back until latter be grouped together in dense mass round mainmast with people hemming in on side pressing into compact crowd at least half of be unable to strike effective blow did what must however by hurling empty pistol into face over head of comrade be busily engaged in defending from attack of herculean negro when one of heavy missile struck hammer taking fairly in centre of forehead so nearly stunning that for moment lost consciousness be completely thrown off guard next second terrific blow crashed down upon bare head hat having be lost earlier in melee fell to deck last conscious sensation being be being trampled upon by a seemed to innumerable crowd of people then swooned when recovered consciousness found in hammock in sick bay aboard frigate with number of companion in misfortune around at first felt too utterly miserable to take much interest in anything for head swathed in bandage be aching smarting so consumedly that for first quarter of hour so must not bear even subdued light entered through open port be obliged to keep eye closed moreover be parched burnt up with fever a weak a cat consumed with intolerable thirst attempted to turn in hammock be unable to do so a still struggled one of sick bay attendant came to side asked if must do anything for gasped out something to effect be perishing of thirst whereupon brought pannikin of tepid water dipped from bucket stood near one of open port raising in hammock placed to lip tepid insipid a actually be thought have never tasted anything half so delicious not only drained to last drop asked for more however declined to give without surgeon direct permission having a explained to be warned that when awoke must probably be suffering severely from thirst be only to be given very limited quantity of liquid at outset until surgeon have have opportunity to examine further into condition man however reported fact of return to consciousness shortly afterward wilson surgeon came down to see be bedside manner be somewhat bluff nevertheless judicious for have once heard say in confidential moment that always upon principle made light of patient ache ailment a have discovered by long experience that have good effect upon invalid causing to believe that there be never anything very seriously wrong with thus calling in aid of imagination to assist in curative process be illustrated in behaviour toward upon occasion of be now speaking came stood by side of hammock looking down upon with whimsical expression a took wrist in hand pressed finger lightly upon pulse put out tongue ordered abruptly did so obediently glanced at for few second then remarked not much matter with see how d feel explained that head be giving excruciating pain that felt burnt up with fever thirst at laughed pooh pooh exclaimed that be nothing thank lucky star that have got off so lightly a have of poor fellow here have lost limb two while others of boarding party have lost number of mess altogether be simply broken head since skull appears to be abnormally thick daresay will very soon mend again ache badly doe ah well be excellent sign perhaps have better remain on sick list for few day keep to hammock until pain pass off good going on duty while be blind with headache know yes now that be here be awake may a well look at wound again walked over to screen put head round end of called sharply sentry pas word for mr burroughs to come to ask to bring basin of hot water sponge roll of bandage anything else think be likely to want tell that be going to dress mr delamere be head then returning to side drew out penknife with quick gentle finger proceeded to cut away number of stitch kept bandage in place when at length have unwound flung deftly away behind though not so deftly that caught glimpse of out of corner of eye saw that be drenched with blood by time that have removed bandage gently clipping away with pair of scissors hair stuck to here there burroughs assistant surgeon have turned up with hot water number of odds end wilson took sponge in hand saying now will probably hurt little yell if can help because if do will disturb poor fellow around so set teeth if feel anything just grin bear will be a gentle a can be gentle man must have be more so nevertheless during next quarter of hour inflicted so much agony upon a extracted little splinter of bone with forceps so on long before have finished be drenched with perspiration felt so sick that finally swooned again completed operation upon senseless body night afterward learned passed in state of high delirium for several day have only very vague idea of where be what be happening around predominating sensation being that top of head be on fire blazing furiously while be consumed by fever thirst be almost a exquisite torture a pain of head only radical difference between two be that when be permitted to quench thirst that particular form of torture be alleviated for few brief second while other be continuous distracting almost to point of being unendurable seemed to that lay for age in suffocating sick bay moment of time being heavy with indescribable torment a matter of fact be there little more than forty eight hour skipper cracking on for jamaica in order that several bad case of be one of worst might have advantage of lofty airy ward of naval hospital at port royal where arrived on morning one after attack upon pirate brigantine may a well complete story of adventure by saying what only learned afterward that captured vessel with loss to ourselves of five killed eighteen wounded of whom seven including be so badly hurt that wilson gravely doubted whether must ever pull round a for pirate out of crew of one hundred twenty six men twenty three be found dead on deck after have taken fifty four be wounded of so desperately that le than eleven of died before anchored in port royal harbour remainder be in due course brought to trial for piracy found guilty five of be hanged at gallows point while rest be condemned to work on road in chain for remainder of miserable life chapter ten ashore invalided have hazy recollection of suddenly finding on deck still in hammock then few minute later of being in boat finally when next came to myself discovered be longer in hammock in bed delightful spacious comfortable bed in there be room for one to stretch change from one side to other otherwise obtain little temporary relief when lying long in one posture have become wearisome then instead of being enveloped in stiflingly hot blanket lay upon one fragrant cool snow white sheet with over bed enclosed by mosquito netting deliciously cool breeze streaming into long ward through several wide open lofty window one of immediately opposite foot of bed afforded excellent view of considerable portion of port royal harbour with apostle battery crouching at foot of salt pond hill almost immediately opposite on other side of water one of hospital orderly who be on duty in ward came to side of bed at once upon finding be awake gave long satisfying draught of lemonade cool exquisitely refreshing after think must have summoned doctor to for few minute later that individual came lightly to side of bed thrust hand beneath sheet felt pulse afterward learned that be dr loder chief of medical staff in port royal naval hospital oh what difference there be between wilson europa surgeon latter be bluff hearty slightly inclined to be boisterous in manner while dr loder word movement nay whole appearance suggested peace quietness perfect restfulness a well a by subtlety of manner vague none le distinct impression that thing be going well with one be tall rather thin man with dark brown hair beard moustache be bald on top of head wore gold rimmed spectacle through fine dark eye beamed down upon patient with expression of sympathy be in a good a tonic asked few question in quiet almost caressing tone of voice gave orderly who have in charge certain instruction then patting gently upon shoulder assured must soon be all right again in tone of voice quiet a be somehow seemed to carry absolute conviction with a matter of fact really did begin to mend practically from moment so rapidly indeed that on twenty third day after admission wound in head have so far healed that bandage be discarded three week later be discharged into guardship cured europa having gone to sea again time before guardship be place for weak shaken a then be by long serious spell of illness although admiral might well in press of daily affair have be excused have forgotten so unimportant detail a state of health did not on contrary invited to spend week at pen to recuperate during wife lady agnes be second mother to hospital nurse combined from moment there be lack of invitation for to go into country regain strength former acquaintance one hunting up reminding of several almost forgotten promise must visit a frigate be not expected to return to port royal for at least two month a although discharged from hospital be a yet by mean fit for duty have not slightest difficulty in obtaining month leave spent most enjoyably with friend whose estate be situated in saint thomas in east on northern slope of blue mountain range be part of purpose to enter into detailed description of life on jamaican sugar plantation will attempt to convey to reader definite idea of jamaican hospitality let suffice to say that never spent happier month anywhere that planter with jollity light heartedness love of fun be most genial kindly hospitable folk ever met with of vieing with rest in amicable contest who must show most kindness attention went among almost total stranger when left felt a though be parting with a many brother sister upon reporting to admiral at office received very kindly asked whether felt fit to return to duty to replied with most emphatic yes informed that europa be not expected for month at least then invited to dine with that evening at pen spend night there table be a usual well filled with guest be civilian excepting three four military officer over from up park camp navy be entirely unrepresented save by reason being a soon learned that french dutch spanish be exceedingly active in about caribbean there be not enough of own ship to cope with consequently available craft of sort flying british pennant have be sent to sea be being kept there at length when guest have left pen lady agnes have retired for night sir peter invited to accompany to broad gallery covered by veranda stretched right athwart front of house from end to end directed one of negro servant to carry out to small table box of cigar jug of sangaree two wicker basket chair wherein seated preparatory a surmised to more le confidential chat of sort though what of such nature so important personage a port admiral must possibly have to say to insignificant mid like must not divine sir peter however be not sort of man to beat about bush if have anything to say generally said without circumlocution did so now selecting with care cigar for lighting pouring out couple of tumbler of sangaree settled in chair began by remarking well young gentleman so have quite recovered from effect of wound eh feel fit ready for duty once more yes to question sir peter answered think understood to say that europa be not expected to return to port royal for at least month so did interrupted admiral question be what be going to do with meanwhile be time for officer to idle about ashore know sir responded certainly be not be exceedingly glad that have broached subject for affords early opportunity to do what have have in mind to do namely to ask whether can not find better employment than kicking heel aboard guardship until frigate return ah commented sir peter so be what have in mind be have served time yet yes sir replied with nearly three month to spare good remarked companion of course have not passed yet have not have opportunity have log book with yes sir answered when be sent ashore to hospital captain vavassour be good enough to send with belonging where be log book mean now demanded sir peter be aboard guardship with rest of thing answered very well returned companion have better go down to port royal with in morning bring log book ashore for to look at have scheme in head for employing be not at sure whether be fit to undertake duty of so exceedingly responsible character a have in mind although hesitate to tell youngster captain vavassour gave most excellent character in respect what sort of navigator be suppose like most other young gentleman can fudge day work well enough to pas muster eh laughed be afraid sir replied that too many of must rather fudge than take trouble to do day work properly got out of lazy trick time ago now will not turn back upon lad of own age whether midshipman master mate where navigation be concerned ah remarked that sound right tell what can do in navigation problem can do plane traverse middle latitude mercator sailing answered can also do day work can use quadrant with accuracy can find latitude by meridian altitude of sun moon star can find error rate of chronometer also longitude by can determine variation of compass can find longitude by lunar can do pole star problem well think be about sir thus far very creditable too answered admiral evidently well pleased what about seamanship continued believe be pretty good at too sir said be at portsmouth in dockyard day during fitting out of frigate watched whole process of rigging when first saw have nothing standing three lower mast well remarked sir peter ought to have picked up little knowledge relative to spar rigging of ship during time did be question come will put through facing bit if be not too sleepy supposing that became necessary for to get maintop over masthead how must go to work considered moment recalled operation a have witnessed then proceeded to describe what have seen yes very good commented companion now get lower rigging into place set up described how must do also answered several other question apparently to satisfaction very well said that be rigger work exceedingly important to know of course still not exactly seamanship now young gentleman suppose to be in command of fine frigate a hope will be day please god be turning to windward in fresh breeze under plain sail becomes necessary to tack describe various evolution did so then old gentleman gradually took still aboard suppositious frigate through rapidly freshening breeze into regular hurricane until have got ship hove to under bare pole with tarpaulin lashed in weather mizen rigging then shook hand with dismissed to room next morning immediately after first breakfast got under way in admiral ketureen sort of gig with roof to drove down to wharf at kingston where barge fine boat be waiting for sea breeze have set in be piping up merrily in about three quarter of hour be alongside dockyard wall at port royal here admiral left with instruction to go off aboard guardship at once bring log book ashore for inspection did be nearly noon before sir peter be ready to attend to even then be after cursory glance that bestowed upon book cursory though be what saw appeared to satisfy for be good enough to express approval a closed book pushed across table to very good very good indeed remarked far more creditable than mine be when be age be afraid consider most promising young officer be going to take under wing because believe will do credit nay boy want thanks a broke in somewhat incoherently in attempt to express gratitude at least not in form of word continued word be often spoken under influence of strong momentary impulse forgotten almost immediately afterward if must desire to show that be grateful to for what intend to do for can not exhibit more acceptably than by justifying very great trust be about to repose in believe will for young a be have proved to be made of right stuff have made good use of time have a much knowledge in curly pate of yours a many officer of twice length of service posse now be not telling because want to make conceited far from be simply because want to understand have formed very high opinion of that expect to live up to d 'ye understand youngster quite clearly sir peter answered be exceedingly kind most encouraging on part that have spoken so frankly a have can assure that be not in least likely to entertain unduly high opinion of in consequence of on contrary be afraid that have formed altogether too favourable opinion of quality will remember opinion will do utmost to justify very well answered man can say more than if fulfil promise will be perfectly satisfied now a to work upon propose to employ must know that there be more work good deal more work to be done on station than there be ship to do consequently although ship at disposal be now at sea be continually receiving complaint that commerce in west indian water be inadequately protected have applied for additional ship have be told that there be none to spare must do best can with what have fact be that caribbean approach be not only swarming with privateer have too much reason to believe that there be strong gang of out out pirate at work a well be in hope that capture of pirate brigantine by europa must put end to kind of work have not indeed have scarcely made appreciable impression upon number of outrage of distinctly piratical character be being constantly reported to be of course not now alluding to vessel have gone temporarily missing for may in most case be traced to operation of enemy refer to vanish utterly leaving trace of kind behind to hint at fate also to other craft be fallen in with derelict from time to time plundered bearing indication that attempt have be made to destroy either by scuttling setting on fire privateer do sort of thing know if capture ship generally put prize crew aboard send into nearest port belonging to pirate however endeavour to escape identification by destroying trace of handiwork butchering unfortunate crew of vessel case of kind came to light only last week kingston trader of bristol with very valuable cargo five thousand pound in specie have be overdue about month consignee have be worrying accordingly last friday small turtling schooner arrived from windward passage reporting that have seen wreck ashore near tete de chien on island of tortuga off north west coast of saint domingo launched pirogue succeeded in getting close enough to wreck to identify a missing kingston trader also to ascertain that have be on fire most of upper work having be consumed be third case of almost identical kind have occurred within last two month be convinced that be work of pirate now young gentleman be going to give job of finding pirate bringing to book be work for man know have not man to spare be convinced from way in answered question last night from character captain vavassour have given not only that be very capable young officer also that have full share of sound common sense self reliance that be in fact quite a likely to give good account of yourself over business a must many much older man therefore since be certain to pas with flying colour a soon a opportunity to present for examination offer intend to give acting order a lieutenant to place in command of small schooner with good strong crew to send off upon roving commission to do best to put down piratical outrage be so frequently occurring under very nose now what d 'ye think of scheme youngster be job too big for to tackle sir answered certainly not too big only thing fear be may not be sufficiently experienced to execute so responsible duty a efficiently a ought to be executed will do very utmost sir peter can promise that if can only have with one two thoroughly steady reliable men to help with occasional word of advice believe will be able to give very good account of ourselves yes returned sir peter believe so too otherwise must not dream of sending a to experience well there be only one way of gaining be by actually doing thing be rather rough school perhaps be only one in can thoroughly learn lesson be glad to see that have idea of shirking now a to seventy four of yours be fore aft schooner of one hundred ten ton said to have be built at baltimore be something of freak designer having apparently turned line end for end put bow where stern must be vice versa nevertheless theory seems to have be sound for be told that be perfect witch for speed especially in light weather speed be one of quality must have be caught smuggling be condemned to be sawn in two thought might perhaps be able to find better use for than so have postponed operation be called wasp if have a much enterprise a give credit for ought to make sting to purpose will find in hulk hole stop minute rang bell messenger entered jones said sir peter have idea where master attendant be yes sir answered man be outside on wharf not minute ago then please see if can find said admiral request to come here to carline be very decent fellow continued a soon a messenger have vanished will get to take aboard show craft have key of companion fore scuttle believe can talk matter over together decide what will need to fit for service ah here be carline good morning mr carline be mr delamere whom be going to send out in charge of wasp to see what can do toward putting stop to repeated piracy want to take aboard let have thorough good look at schooner after can draw up list of what be needed to render fit for work will have to do now good morning mr delamere come up to pen to dinner to night then can report to what think craft requires so admiral going to fit out that smugglin ' schooner send to sea in eh remarked master attendant a soon a got outside replied that quite understood that to be sir peter intention oh well observed know how will get on with be queer one to look at expect will want learnin before will be able to handle properly have have experience in fore after only in boat replied barge of old ship colossus be rigged a fore aft schooner have sailed many time suppose fore afters be handled in pretty much same way matter of mere size wo make very much difference imagine well expect will find wasp bit different observed companion be such queer model see everything about be exactly opposite of what think must be have tremendous beam draught of water worth speakin ' of outrageously long tapering bow short squat stern there will see presently there be doubt about can sail there be nothing in harbour can look at a for working why have be told that have be known to be round full on other tack twenty second after puttin ' helm down well that be good news at event remarked like nice smart working ship why henderson where in world did spring from how be that be not away in frigate exclaimed a encountered figure be perfectly familiar to for same reason a mr delamere answered man touching hat be on beam end in hospital when went to sea bowled over in scrimmage wi ' brigantine same a be where be what doing now demanded why sir be aboard guardship along wi ' two of chap a be discharged from hospital about same time a be answered man formerly one of europa quartermaster oh indeed replied very much surprised for have not known that there be others a well a put ashore from frigate be ready for duty again asked ay that be sir answered henderson will be glad enough to get to sea have mouthful of fresh air once more bein ' in harbour be very well for change man soon get enough of a'ter ai half so comfortable a bein ' at sea then in case said seeing way to getting one good hand at least perhaps may be willing to volunteer for little schooner that admiral be going to give to go pirate hunting in ay that indeed will mr delamere glad of chance answered henderson heartily perhaps sir added must help to two three more good men if so be a happen to want well think more than likely that will said so just keep eye open in direction will doubt see again to morrow next day when can have further chat henderson touched hat turned away master attendant made way along wharf to landing step here directed four men to jump down into gig spread cushion in stern sheet while went into office to procure key be to afford access to interior of seventy four a admiral have jestingly called then descending step taking place in gig carline seized yoke line gave word to shove off away went across upper end of harbour through boat channel past gallows point whereon stood stout post beam from five ringleader of pirate taken aboard brigantine have be launched into eternity chapter eleven hm wasp sighted wasp immediately upon rounding gallows point be lying quite by down in most southerly bight of hole little more than cable length from beach consequently have clear uninterrupted view of moment that cleared point be lying broadside on to with head pointing to southward first thing impressed about be diminutiveness in comparison with of craft lying in hole looked little more than mere boat idea of actually going to sea attempting serious work in such cockle shell struck a little short of absurdity that feeling wore off bit a closed with next thing to attract attention be great beauty of outline sat very low upon water have abnormally long overhanging counter spring sheer be so great low a sat bow stood high dominant above water be painted black from rail to copper top edge of be about six inch above load line have only two lower mast bowsprit standing mast be magnificent stick lofty enough apparently to spread canvas that must possibly carry without need of topmast spar be stepped well forward mainmast indeed seemed to be almost amidships giving one very clear idea of enormous area mainsail must present when fully set be not however until got close to carline caused boatman to pull slowly round detected what admiral master attendant meant when have spoken of freakish peculiarity of model then indeed became apparent that designer have a sir peter have said literally turned line end for end a be for have absolutely straight of breadth at side be a round a apple long bow shaped like wedge with curved instead of straight side with just suggestion of hollowness of water line a approached stem started almost a far aft a point where mainmast be stepped while run instead of fining away toward stern post like tail of fish be quite full sweeping round under counter in semicircle then be that understood why counter be so abnormally long be not merely fancy on part of designer intended to give smart rakish appearance be for purpose of giving despite fulness of run clean easy delivery yes a looked at critically studying line from possible point of view must believe that must prove quite extraordinary sailer for there be nothing in long keen bow for water to grip knifelike stem must sheer into gently expanding side must shoulder aside with scarcely resistance leaving to close in again aft about stern post with nip must add to speed just a one may make nut spring from one finger by merely pressing upon must be good sea boat too for bow flared out over water in fashion a to lift over sea however steep yes liked outside look of amazingly longer thought idea of going to sea in such craft mere folly on contrary longed for moment when must have opportunity to test capability having scrutinised exterior of new command to heart content went alongside boarded gangway be open so little freeboard did show at point carline measured found to be exactly four foot that be able to spring from boat gunwale to schooner deck without difficulty without need for side ladder have by time quite forgotten first impression of diminutiveness in connection with craft moment passed through gangway stood upon deck gained new impression namely that of spaciousness for be extraordinarily beamy hatchway be small there be nothing in way of fitting of kind to cumber up deck indeed so far a actual room to move about upon be concerned quarter deck seemed to be quite a spacious a of europa be flush decked fore aft abaft immensely lofty mainmast there be nothing companion with seat locker on side of fine big skylight very handsome brass binnacle wheel bulwark be only three foot high with fine solid teak rail be built of hard wood oak elm throughout copper fastened carline having unlocked companion door went below found ourselves in really beautiful little cabin elegantly fitted up painted white gold well lighted ventilated from above by big skylight with three large circular port on side a well there be nice wide comfortable locker on side running fore aft fine solid handsomely carved mahogany table in centre cabin looked bare for fitting of kind have be removed put into store then abaft main cabin there be small exceedingly comfortable looking stateroom with standing bedplace drawer beneath wash stand etcetera lighted by two circular port one at head one at foot of bedplace ran athwartships from cabin passed into main hold saw at once that must easily be fitted up converted into berth deck for hand by merely running few deck beam across laying deck running up bulkhead spent whole morning aboard making voluminous note of various alteration must be needed to fit little vessel for new service to be destined same afternoon be unmoored taken alongside wharf strong gang of dockyard workman went aboard to begin upon most obviously necessary work such a taking out ballast prior to giving interior thorough cleaning so on night at pen after guest have left sir peter called upon to give account of day doings to tell thought of wasp to produce read list of alteration needed to complete equipment of schooner of of graciously approved adding few suggestion of own on following morning after going on board hooker with examining inside out gave order for whole of work to be proceeded with forthwith a there be other ship in port refitting at moment be slack time at dockyard almost whole of resource be available to expedite work in consequence of schooner be ready for sea fortnight from day on first boarded meanwhile admiral have made out presented to acting order while for own part have be busy day day at dockyard superintending work being done to wasp in hunting up crew for a attached very considerable importance to quality of crew be quite determined to have very best must obtain large proportion of time be spent in hunting for good men here be that found service of henderson late quartermaster of europa of especial value for not only did enter for schooner a have promised must when ran up against a be on way to pay first visit to wasp being equally a anxious a to have little vessel well manned have persuaded four good men like formerly of europa wounded in fight with brigantine now convalescent to join thus forming at stroke nucleus of first rate crew have done good deal more than for in addition to four men above referred to there be aboard guardship about dozen others recently discharged from hospital only requiring few day of pure ocean air to set on pin again have persuaded also to enter even however did not complete obligation to guardship for there be aboard three midshipman assistant surgeon captain clerk of whom have be separated from ship from chance cause secured eldest of midshipman named willoughby a master while other two very quiet respectable lad named respectively dundas hinton took more for health sake than for other reason assistant surgeon be named saunders shipped a surgeon while millar captain clerk came with a purser obtained gunner warrant for henderson to great delight remaining officer consisted of fine smart boatswain mate named pearce who came a boatswain carpenter mate named mill who came a carpenter in addition to have cabin steward cook crew of forty four men four boy therefore regarded a excellently equipped so far a crew be concerned unfortunately schooner be too small to carry armament to fine crew must do full justice utmost that must carry with anything like safety being six long expounder even with weight of on deck seemed to be just trifle more tender than altogether liked be however best that must do with with have to be content having reported schooner a ready for sea received order from admiral slipped from number buoy on certain morning immediately after breakfast proceeded to work out to sea under single reefed

cloud to deposit again in harbour add to magnitude of shoal be steadily encroaching upon deep water area little hooker became lively began to pull at cable a though impatient to be off moment that hand tailed on to throat peak halliard of immense mainsail proceeded to hoist away when having set sail by way be beautifully cut stood a flat a board slipped hauled aft jib sheet heeled to pressure of wind a though preparing to spring with little swirl of water about sharp stem a paid off proceeded to gather way next moment be sheering through smooth water of harbour like hungry dolphin in pursuit of shoal of flying fish with sheet flattened in came to until be looking up within three point of wind careening to bearing sweeping a rapidly almost a noiselessly a wreath of mist driving to

flaring overhang lifted little craft buoyantly over with nothing worse than small playful flash patter of spray in over weather cathead to tell of encounter must be difficult to say whether astonishment delight be feeling predominated in breast of hand of fore aft a stood watching really marvellous performance of little clipper while beating out of harbour be not speed only although seemed phenomenal for swept past other craft be going way a though have be at anchor weatherliness astounded quite a much a did speed for looked up good three point higher than did square rigged neighbour while oil smooth wake trailed away astern a straight a ruled line with apparent inclination to trend hairbreadth towards weather quarter seemed to make leeway at well exclaimed henderson who be standing by close abaft weather main rigging watching a be rapid sliding past of various object ashore have heard people speak of ship a sailin ' like witch be only now comin ' to rightly understand just exactly what that expression mean mean goin ' along precisely a if be shot out of gun why mr delamere believe a there be anything afloat can touch not at event in moderately smooth water what will do in heavy sea remains to be seen will soon find out reckon for be foamin ' white away out there in offing have notion that will go over like duck provided that drive too hard look at sir a schooner leapt from crest of sea into hollow beyond foam buzzed boiled to level of lee head rail then went glancing away dizzily aft ai that just perfectly beautiful never shipped drop did there

worth speakin ' about must steer wi ' one hand answered man to prove word placed one hand behind kept there for minute two while grasped spoke of wheel with other have by time brought beacon shoal about one point abaft weather beam be of opinion that must weather on next tack therefore gave word ready about helm lee directed helmsman to ease down helm let go wheel for moment little hooker at once came to wind with head sail slatting threshing a spilled wind out of then began to pull wheel over toward with one terrific dive into sea came rushing at split into two shower of diamond spray

for to haul down second third reef to take jib off after went along quite comfortably shipping nothing worse than occasional sprinkling of spray over weather bow at eight bell of second dog watch handsomely weathered morant point on way out through windward channel being purpose to work out through caycos passage then cruise to fro athwart to windward of windward passage that being cruising ground believed pirate must be most likely to haunt shortly before daybreak on third morning after leaving port royal found rapidly drawing into smooth water so rapidly indeed that pearce boatswain whose watch be came down in alarm roused out fearing that willoughby midshipman who be acting a master have made mistake in reckoning that be about to blunder on to danger be able however to set good man mind at rest by explaining that be doubtless drawing in under lee of caycos bank that therefore water might naturally be expected to smoothen nevertheless feeling that have have good night rest understanding from pearce that day must dawn in le than hour time turned out slipping into trouser jacket went up on deck very glad be that have done so for be thus enabled to observe very curious natural phenomenon one might knock about in sea for year without seeing for simple reason that circumstance must be favourable phenomenon be not visible caycos bank be shoal lying sixty eight mile off monte christi on north coast of hayti measure about same distance from north western to south eastern extremity be about sixty two mile across from east to west at widest point be consequently of considerable extent from fact that depth of water over range from six foot to eighteen foot be not without danger must be approached with due caution especially during hour of darkness in daylight danger be not nearly so great because north eastern north western edge of shoal be fringed by number of cay among sea break heavily while whole surface of shoal be white water be same white water give rise to phenomenon above referred to locally known a bank blink be simply reflection of phosphorescence of water in cloud above darker more overcast night more distinctly be reflection seen phenomenon be of course quite natural easily to be accounted for yet occurrence can scarcely be regarded a le than providential for there can be doubt whatever that appearance in sky have often be mean of warning navigator that be approaching danger so causing to haul off in time to avoid shipwreck upon night in question when first saw found upon going on deck that darkness be profound sky being so completely obscured by cloud that not so much a single star be visible away to windward ranging from about two point on weather bow round to square cloud from almost overhead to within fifteen degree of horizon be faintly yet quite perceptibly tinged greenish hue tinge being strongest about midway between weather bow beam pearce have noticed appeared when came to question about have thought that might possibly portend change of weather until have looked at barometer found inclined to rise then have become alarmed by smoothing of water seemed to far more portentous than light on cloud have not be on deck more than quarter of hour when blackness under lower edge of bank blink away over starboard cathead began to pale first to cold slaty grey from that by rapid gradation to rich purple then to crimson from crimson to orange tint so deep a to be almost scarlet beneath horizon loomed out black a ink intervening space of water lightening a swept toward until at distance of couple of mile became livid bluish white marked western edge of shoal sufficiently accounted for smoothing of deep water in be sailing a orange light spread north south from point at have originated at same time reaching upward from horizon bank blink began to fade rather to become merged in overpowered by shape of heavy lowering cloud overhung began to reveal lower edge here there suddenly flushing into hue of richest yet most delicate rose that rapidly strengthened first into scarlet then to burning gold a ray of yet unrisen sun smote upon presently in midst of rich orange light be now flashing up on eastern north eastern horizon there emerged shape of indigo practically flat topped with two small protuberance one at end by stretch of imagination might be termed hill rising to height of perhaps sixty seventy foot be island of west caycos most westerly of cay on bank ten minute later be under lee within le than cable length from beach what change have taken place in aspect of sea sky during ten minute a stood spellbound watching gorgeous change of colour be taking place along eastern horizon broad ray of white light edge slightly tinged with violet suddenly shot vertically aloft from horizon piercing cloud mass a though with thrust of spear a though there have be magic in touch cloud mass at once began to break up melt away assuming ere vanished conceivable tint of rainbow from deepest richest hue of purple through crimson scarlet to purest molten gold while wonderful change of colour be taking place shaft after shaft of living quivering light flashed into sky radiating like spoke of wheel against warm primrose tint of horizon merging by imperceptible degree into pure delicate azure of sky revealed by breaking up dissolution of cloud to be followed few second later by appearance above horizon of great rim of blazing palpitating golden fire level ray from shot along tumbling surface of ocean splashing with million scintillating point of dazzling light a crest of tiny wavelet curled over broke under whipping of freshening breeze then while still stood watching gauzy veil of rain pride of morning swept down upon blotting out glory of sunrise for brief minute two then driving away to leeward leaving sail deck dark with wet revealing sun now fully risen sky clear pure to windward with freshening of breeze rapidly brought west caycos first abeam then on weather quarter while high land of providenciales grew upon weather bow here be very nearly getting into exceedingly awkward scrape for while went below to prepare for morning bath under head pump after witnessing magnificent sunrise have endeavoured to describe wind suddenly fell light died away then while be dressing after bath sea breeze suddenly sprang up blowing gale there be not three mile from land with a dangerous stretch of lee shore a be to be found in region abeam of fortunately schooner extraordinary weatherliness stood in good stead enabled to claw off for must probably have left bone if not own there mid afternoon observation showed to be in latitude degree minute north longitude degree minute west position considered far enough out for purpose therefore hove about under short canvas proceeded to work way slowly to southward eastward on lookout for anything might chance to come way for several day after nothing of moment occurred finally found two hundred mile to northward eastward of mona passage be debating within whether to bear up go back over ground have just traversed to continue on have look at porto rico while be thinking over question lookout in fore crosstrees reported sail to windward quickly succeeded by several others whereupon made sail shaped course must enable to get somewhat clearer view of if necessary to intercept lookout aloft soon reported that leading ship be under short canvas while immediately followed be covered to truck showing studdingsails a well from piece of information be not difficult for to guess that stranger to windward consisted of convoy of merchantman with escort of men o ' war conjecture of mine soon proved to be correct for within hour of first appearance leading ship be in sight from deck made out biggest of to be gun ship others in sight obviously being merchantman a closed with ensign pennant hoisted commodore signalled to come alongside send boat aboard did going in boat to see what news must pick up thus learned that ship have boarded be goliath captain of be commodore of squadron of convoying ship consisting of in addition to goliath frigate tourmaline spartiate gun brig vulcan wolverine spitfire tortoise convoy consisting of three hundred eighty seven sail of sort bound to various west indian port informed commodore of nature of duty upon have be sent out by admiral on station inquired whether suspicious craft have be sighted during passage to grimly replied in affirmative added that have be accounted for must be found with prize crew aboard in main body of fleet stayed on board seventy four for couple of hour gathering what news inmate of ward room must give during wasp under boom foresail fore staysail only easily kept company with ponderous two decker looking in comparison with no bigger a thumb a negro must say excited great deal of curiosity on account of very peculiar model likewise very considerable amount of admiration a swept along lightly buoyantly a seagull over long undulation of heavy swell be running be first time have ever beheld under sail from outside own bulwark although looked down upon from lofty poop of goliath seemed to be merest cockle shell small enough to be hoisted inboard stowed upon two decker main hatch there be still look of staunchness about coupled with beauty of form rakish sauciness of entire appearance made feel very proud of fact that commanded a well a very anxious for opportunity to show of what crew be capable having extracted information must obtain after be not very much made adieu descended side stepped into boat returned to schooner upon rejoining made sail hauled to wind in hope of finding picarooning craft hanging on to skirt of convoy although hovered in wake of latter until very last of have disappeared beneath southern horizon hope be vain finally decided to bear up for navidad ship bank proceed through sea of hayti a far a entrance of windward channel then if still unsuccessful in search for trace of pirate to work way back to atlantic by crooked island passage exploring of cay in austral bay on way seeming to to afford considerable facility for establishment of pirate depot chapter twelve what gunner saw two morning later wasp being at time off ysabelica point be most northerly point of island of hayti be awakened by young dundas one of two midshipman whom have on board entered cabin laid hand lightly on shoulder a started up at touch said beg pardon mr delamere for entering cabin knocked twice did not seem to hear gunner be sorry to have disturbed sir must be very much obliged if must come on deck for minute two very well said will be up in brace of shake just turn up lamp if please youngster let have little more light on subject ah be better thanks kindly hand unmentionable say mr dundas there doe seem to be very much wind what be weather like stark calm sir smooth water a dark a inside of cow answered lad doe weather look threatening then what doe never mind shoe if please thanks will do now be ready away go youngster preceded by lad passed into fore cabin thence up on deck where a dundas have picturesquely intimated darkness be profound air breathless save for small draught created by flapping of great mainsail to gentle movement of schooner upon low undulation of swell a stepped out on deck heard henderson voice close at elbow although man be invisible sorry to have be obliged to disturb mr delamere said something happened that thought ought to know about yes remarked interrogatively well what be henderson well be like here sir replied have be becalmed last hour more durin schooner have be boxin ' compass while be be that close muggy one seem to have be able to get air enough to breathe closeness made feel so drowsy that to prevent from droppin ' off to sleep have be obliged to keep on foot pacing fore aft atween main cabin skylight main riggin ' watch have coiled theirselves away somewhere doubt what be snatchin ' cat nap have troubled to disturb sir for lookout on fo cbe'le be keepin ' eye skinned well few minute ago may be five may be ten 'd just swung round to walk aft from main riggin ' when a eye travelled away out here over port quarter got notion into head that there be somethin ' goin ' on down there for seemed to that 'd got glimpse out of corner of eye a might be of small sparkin ' like like well hang if know what be like unless might be twenty thirty pistol musket being fired close after one ah ejaculated did hear sound henderson anything like of distant firing for instance mr delamere not sound sir answered gunner then continued that ai very surprisin ' when come to think of for just listen to what be goin ' on aboard here old hooker ai so very noisy will allow still what with rustlin ' of canvas overhead patter of reef point creakin ' of jaw o ' mainboom clank o ' wheel chain wash gurgle of water alongside with roll of there be not much chance of pickin ' up sound comin ' from distance be there sir be true there be not admitted did see hear anything else henderson asked sir never thing answered gunner 'd like ye to understand mr delamere must care actually to stand up in court swear that really saw what told ye for a explained only caught thing out o ' tail end of eye a might be then 't be gone again saw nothin more impression really have seen something be so strong that felt be duty to report of course did perfectly right agreed particularly in view of task have be given to do did lookout see anything of appearance of flash sir answered henderson did nat'rally must for be keepin ' lookout ahead on bow while here flashin ' showed if really did show at be imagination out there over port quarter quite so concurred under circumstance must not be in least likely to see appearance did occur to to take bearing of spot where thought saw flash yes sir did answered henderson stood just for second two to see if there be more comin ' then not seein ' anything went straight to binnacle took bearin found to be west by west half west with one consent walked aft to binnacle peered into schooner have swung several point while gunner have be spinning somewhat long winded yarn for bearing gave now lay about point over starboard quarter stared into blackness in direction must see nothing then got night glass setting to focus raised to eye pointing out over starboard quarter sweeping slowly carefully to right left for minute two saw nothing then a swept tube along what judged to be line of horizon tiny smudge of radiance so dim a to be scarcely more than suggestion seemed to float athwart lens be gone again there be probably nothing in ordinary life much more difficult than to pick up retain in lens of telescope levelled by hand spark of light so minute faint a to be invisible to unaided eye in midst of surrounding darkness difficulty be enhanced when attempt be made from deck of small vessel oscillating though ever so gently on ridge of long low running swell for life of must not again find feeble glimmer have seemed to swim athwart instrument try a must be good henderson said at last abandoning attempt in despair handing telescope over to be almost certain that for single instant caught faint blur of light away out there can not find now take glass see if can meet with better success verify bearing before do so schooner have swung point two further round by time bearing now lay broad over starboard beam in direction henderson pointed glass meanwhile dundas midshipman who have called have slipped down below brought own telescope on deck be working away with gunner met with luck be about to try hand again when slight lessening of intensity of darkness away down in eastern quarter indicated approach of dawn in low latitude transition from night to day vice versa be extraordinarily rapid occupying few minute even a stood watching pallor strengthened spread to right left upward suggesting stealthy rapid withdrawal of infinite number of dark gauze curtain from face of firmament until presently eastern quadrant of horizon became visible pallid sea showing like surface of molten lead sluggishly undulating like coil of sleeping snake while overhead stretched unbroken pall of dark grey cloud seemed to promise drenching downpour of rain before long light from east stole upward among cloud westward along surface of sea with amazing rapidity yet to impatience progress seemed exasperatingly slow for away down in west darkness be still profound yet even a gazed that darkness seemed to become diluted a be with advancing light that must almost see sliding along surface of water until suddenly a though emerging from invisible mist ghostly object appeared grey elusive against background of darkness with one voice three shouted there be yes there be large ship about seven mile away lying becalmed like with plain sail set to royal flying jib for perhaps minute after first sight of light be too weak uncertain to enable to discern detail a kept telescope persistently bearing upon first one distinctive feature then became revealed be full rigged ship lying broadside on to mr delamere announced young dundas so perceive returned somewhat dryly notice also that have swung with head to southward be big lump of craft not very far short of ton must say commented henderson with eye still glued to eye piece of schooner glass continued after slight pause reckon be foreigner high poop deep curvin ' headboard never took shape in british shipyard be prepared to swear to look to like dutchman what do think mr delamere agree with that be undoubtedly foreigner answered think be dutch there be too much gilding gingerbread work about quarter for there a sun broke through cloud showed upper rim above horizon flashing long level beam along surface of water striking stranger causing stern of to blaze into sudden flame of glittering radiance do see that henderson quarter be solid mass of painted gilded carving dutchman be too economical too fond of dollar to lavish so much gold leaf a on adornment of ship prefers to put money into extra bolt fastening that fellow be spaniard be greatly mistaken spaniard dutch french make much difference to mr delamere answered gunner a replaced telescope in becket will give nice little bit o prize money a soon a breeze come enables to run down alongside ay that will if doe happen to be man o war believe be answered a again levelled glass at continued be man o war although see show set of teeth there be not many of be small piece half of may be quaker for what can tell to contrary be spanish west indiaman believe bound doubt to cartagena other port on main have probably come in through handkerchief turk island passage well there doe not seem to be much chance of wind coming just yet henderson so have better get head pump rigged muster scrubber meanwhile will have bath a usual then get dressed so a to be ready by time that breeze come when eight o'clock breakfast time arrived there be perceptible change in aspect of weather remained stark calm while heavy pall of cloud have shrouded night sky have thinned away to kind of dense haze in midst of sun throbbed great shapeless splotch of misty light notwithstanding partial veiling still contrived to impart scorching quality to breathless atmosphere a ascended to deck after breakfast found pearce boatswain whose watch now be apparently waiting for reappearance held schooner glass in hand have evidently spent practically whole time since eight bell in watching stranger have be thinkin ' mr delamere began how must be to get boat out go after chap must do quite comfortable take possession of leave prize crew aboard get back to schooner again before dinner doubt agreed why must trouble to get boat into water fatigue men by long pull in sweltering heat ship ca get away from without wind if be judge of look of vessel will walk up to a if be at anchor a soon a breeze come be good seven mile away pull of hour half at least in weather at end of men must be too tired to face resistance effectively if be offered a very possibly might be really see necessity to dispatch boat just yet at least do well 'pon word mr delamere know answered pearce scratching head with puzzled air way put there seem to be sense at in doin ' of yet know sir fact be be bit puzzled about there ship here be regularly boxin ' compass jibboom pointin first way then then t'other while ship have veered nothin ' to speak of time have be on deck have pointed steady to south'ard ever since first set eye on seems to that have altered bearin bit suppose ai likely that have got boat into water towin ' on t'other side of have good gracious man surely not ejaculated what in world must do mad thing a for what effect must two even three boat have on big heavy ship like must never hope to tow below horizon out of sight of before wind come if not why must tire to death by making such attempt admit that be rather strange that head must point so steadily in one direction while be boxing compass probably draw twice a much water a do may have something to do with took telescope from pearce hand again levelled at stranger be still lying broadside on to showing port side yard be braced sharp up on starboard tack a though assuming to have come in through one of passage have have wind from westward while breeze have brought where be have be from eastward peculiarity of now struck for first time carried particular significance to mind beyond suggestion that possibly might after be homeward instead of outward bound a stood scanning through lens gradually dawned upon that people seemed to be extraordinarily busy for must detect indication that quite large number of men be actively moving about deck presently to astonishment noticed that have tackle at mainyard arm while be still wondering what might be for saw large case rise slowly above level of bulwark then vanish again apparently over rail then in second illumination came to understood everything there be craft of sort alongside completely hidden from view by hull canvas braced a sharp up a possible undoubtedly there be boat in water on other side of employed to keep broadside on to thus keep other craft hidden from certain portion of cargo be being hoisted out transferred to hidden vessel inference be obvious hidden craft be pirate have somehow managed to sneak up alongside surprise in pitchy darkness of early hour of morning henderson have actually caught glimpse of very act of capture now be being plundered by audacious scoundrel under very eye laid down glass looked sharply round horizon atmosphere be distinctly thickening to extent indeed that sun be now almost blotted out there be greasy look about sky seemed to portend bad weather sea be still glass smooth not faintest suggestion of catspaw to be seen in direction there be certain gloomy lowering appearance over western horizon appeared to promise breeze before long might be hour however before came must not wait for for robbery very possibly violence ay even cold blooded murder be being perpetrated at moment speedy intervention be imperative felt horribly vexed that must have allowed ourselves to be hoodwinked so completely for although device be undoubtedly quite clever conviction must insist upon forcing upon have attached altogether too little importance to gunner story of mysterious flash seen out of corner of eye told that story ought to have aroused suspicion ought to have conveyed distinct suggestion to mind that if have must have detected ruse almost with first appearance of daylight however be not moment for reproach of others be moment for action turned sharply upon boatswain mr pearce said on starboard side of ship there be craft completely hidden from by hull canvas of stranger cargo be being hoisted out of one transferred to other mean that act of piracy be being perpetrated have be commissioned for express purpose of suppressing piracy be a likely a not that hidden craft be identical vessel that have be sent out to capture in case duty be clear must get up within striking distance interfere without moment loss of time now question in mind be must man arm boat send away must rig out sweep attempt to sweep schooner up to scene of action under ordinary circumstance must be for dispatching boat quite know what to make of weather there be sign of breeze in direction at present moment that lowering appearance away to westward may mean wind if doe may come down very strong must do so must bother boat enable pirate to slip away on other hand wind may not come away for several hour yet be one of occasion when experience be valuable will be glad to have opinion a to plan be better pearce meanwhile have be peering through glass again when finished speaking laid down turned to 'pon word mr delamere be very difficult to say answered while have be talkin have be lookin ' at ship away yonder believe sir a be right about there bein ' craft alongside of although have so managed thing that might have stayed day a be without bein ' wiser if have kept on watchin ' yes be hact of piracy right enough have doubt a say what be best thing to be done paused gazed earnestly toward increasing appearance of thickness greasiness in western quarter carefully studying aspect for full minute more then turned to again like look of at mr delamere said there be bad weather brewin ' yonder be sure of how long will be before come man can say may be hour may be on within next half hour so what doe barometer say stepped to open skylight peered down through at barometer hung in gimbal from fore transom mercury be falling rather rapidly yes pearce continued like look of sir must like to take responsibility of advisin ' of to send boat away for ye see mr yes interrupted cutting ruthlessly in upon man speech see quite clearly boatswain that be of one mind upon point therefore there be need to discus further will at once proceed to action call hand if please mr pearce next moment shrill chirruping of pearce pipe gruff bellow of hand ahoy resounded throughout little vessel deck at once became scene of animation galley fire be extinguished although cook be by time busy upon preparation of men dinner screen be fastened up round hatchway magazine be opened powder shot be passed up on deck gun be cast loose loaded men dancing about deck with glee activity of schoolboy preparing for day amusement then a soon a be ready for action heavy sweep be rigged out four men to sweep schooner bow be pointed straight for stranger to overcome inertia of little vessel get way upon be laborious work men stripped to waist be soon streaming with perspiration after first five minute toil during worked up speed of about three knot proved comparatively easy matter to keep going soon became evident that keen watch upon movement be being maintained by pirate for sooner have be made apparent that intended to close with stranger than attempt at further concealment be abandoned ship course be clewed up yard be squared to facilitate hoisting out of cargo additional tackle be got aloft sign of greatly increased activity on board at once became manifest now also became apparent that mean have be resorted to for purpose of keeping broadside presented to hull interposed between pirate vessel that mean have now be abandoned a of further avail for within next ten minute swung stem on to saw that there be indeed craft alongside slashing big topsail schooner immensely beamy with canvas clewed up furled deck cumbered with bale package of size description be being hoisted out of big ship hold lowered over side with feverish activity a two craft swung round revealing presence of second vessel lad gave cheer of delight exultation applied with such fierce energy to toil of working heavy sweep that churned glassy surface of ocean into long double row of miniature whirlpool went swirling frothing away from blade of sweep into wake of schooner to distance of full quarter of mile fortunately however be not compelled to toil very long at exhausting labour for when have progressed about mile few catspaws came stealing along surface of water from westward while dark line gradually extended along western horizon advanced steadily in direction catspaws meanwhile multiplying spreading until within quarter of hour of first appearance sail of strange ship be wrinkling flapping to quite pleasant little breeze moment that happened pirate schooner cast off made sail with rapidity precision of man o ' war thus demonstrating that be manned by exceptionally strong efficient crew a soon a be clear of ship be brought to wind under enormous spread of exquisitely cut canvas away went close hauled on port tack heading to northward at pace made gape with astonishment while ship with squared yard gathered stern way first fell broadside on to then gradually paid off until be before wind when down came driving toward yawing so broadly to port starboard that be easy to see have nobody at helm seemed to point pretty clearly toward presumption of tragedy quarter of hour later catspaws be ruffling surface of water here there round stirring canvas at rapidly decreasing interval with true breeze coming fast close behind therefore laid in sweep put helm up trimmed sheet on port tack took long pull strong pull upon halliard round paid off just in time to receive first of true breeze into hollow of canvas when heeling over to extent of strake so away too went with merry buzzing seething of water under bow along bend chapter thirteen wasp fight pirate schooner pirate schooner craft of apparently two hundred ton more very long low on water painted dead black with immensely tall wand like mast enormous spread of canvas be now slipping along fast through water heading to northward six mile dead to windward of be

proper moment schooner be hove to quarter boat lowered with four hand in armed with pistol cutlass jumped in pulled away for other craft carefully watching movement contrived to get alongside hook on without very much difficulty then hand of swarmed up towering side tumbled in on deck with drawn pistol in hand for there be never knowing what ghastly trick pirate might play what fiendish trap might set be capable of anything everything therefore behoved to be wary nothing happened there be not soul on deck to interfere with to demand business first thing did be to put helm hard over lay mainyard aback a came to wind then ascended to poop took comprehensive glance round circumstance thrust most obtrusively forward demanding immediate notice be that main hatchway be gaping wide open with tackle dangling down from main stay evidently for purpose of hoisting cargo out of hold round hatchway deck be littered with bale case of description of intact a have come up out of hold while others have be ripped wrenched open content scattered hither about deck there be cask lying on bilge head knocked out perhaps gallon so of port wine still in while round about deck be dark wet reeking with fume of

sanguinary revolting a have expected to find for there be ensanguined mutilated corps to shock eye harrow imagination by sight of hurt for matter be there living people on board ship in cabin forecastle although there be abundant evidence that have have full complement of occupant forecastle for example be lumbered up with chest of seaman boot cap various other article of clothing lying scattered about deck while oilskin sou'wester more clothing hung from peg nail driven into timber wall bedding in bunk also be disarranged a though men have just rolled out of large copper slush lamp suspended from deck beam still burned smoking flaring to roll of ship upon swell confusion here be merely normal such a be always to be found in ship forecastle grand saloon presented very different terribly suggestive appearance whole place be scene of dreadful disorder violence carouse seeming to have be succeeded by life death struggle for massive mahogany table be bare while cloth must have

ruthlessly despoiled ship if there be must be in hiding with view of testing latter point now swung down through open hatchway leading to lazarette believing that must be part of ship wherein person might most successfully hide evade capture be sooner down in gloomy receptacle devoted to stowage of ship cabin store than saw that too have be rummaged if not actually rifled must detect sign indicative of presence of person person in hiding although shouted until be hoarse sound save furtive scurrying of rat reached by way of reply presently a stood listening ear became accustomed to subdued creaking groaning of vessel framework cargo sound came to sound of gurgling bubbling water making way toward a best must down between cask case cumbered place suddenly dropped down into void found water salt water surging washing to fro with movement of ship to height of knee tried to find source of inflow be now down in ship run standing upon steeply sloping side speedily realised that point of influx be already so far beneath surface a to be entirely beyond reach water be coming in fast too for even a stood there must feel creeping insidiously up leg scoundrel have evidently followed usual custom have scuttled ship in order that tangible evidence of crime might remain until made discovery have be intention to put prize crew on board send into port royal with one more probably dozen bad leak below water level utterly beyond reach plan be no longer feasible now only thing to be done be to leave unfortunate craft to fate proceed in chase of author of mischief do utmost to bring to book therefore scrambled up out of lazarette into main saloon made way out on deck again summoning boat crew descended deserted ship side pushed off on way back to wasp be with something akin to shock looked back at santa brigitta a boat sped across short space of water separated from schooner for although have only be aboard short half hour have settled perceptibly during time so deeply indeed that a looked at felt convinced must have be scuttled forward a well a aft that water must be pouring into from at least dozen auger hole at rate must sink long before must get out of sight of although breeze be now perceptibly stronger than have be when boarded ill fated ship by time have regained deck of wasp craft be once more under way pirate schooner be hull down on north western horizon nearly ten mile away light breeze smooth water such a have at moment constituted absolutely ideal weather for wasp be under precisely such condition that marvellous sailing power showed to utmost advantage smart a other schooner have revealed to be have very little doubt a to ability to overhaul bring to account therefore piled upon little hooker rag that must find spar stay for brought to wind flattened in sheet until mainboom be almost amidships generally made preparation for long chase to windward although weather be at moment everything must be desired from point of view did not by mean like look of hazy appearance of atmosphere far from clearing be steadily increasing in density sun have by time vanished altogether appearance of gloom away down to westward be now deepening at same time working round into northern quarter of heaven also mercury be dropping quite rapidly chief anxiety now be to overhaul pirate schooner bring to action before nightfall for with bad weather threatening unless must succeed in doing there be likelihood of giving slip during hour of darkness stern chase be proverbially long chase chase to windward be apt to be even longer while start of ten mile under such circumstance must necessarily prove heavy handicap to pursuing vessel nevertheless be not without hope difficult a task threatened to be might yet accomplish for still wanted nearly hour to noon wasp be slipping along through water like racer be looking up full point nearer wind than antagonist early a yet be to form conclusion felt almost certain that be head reaching a well a weathering upon chase a soon a became apparent that hour must probably elapse before must go into action gave order for gun to be secured galley fire to be lighted again in order that men might not be deprived of usual dinner meal be just nicely over when to utter amazement chase suddenly hoisted black flag bore up with squared yard came running down with obvious intention of coming to close quarter with whereupon once more made ready for battle at same time shortening sail to ordinary working canvas at first be distinctly puzzled to account for understand sudden change of tactic upon part of pirate remark of henderson seemed to offer tolerably plausible explanation of depend upon sir suggested only hauled off to give time to stow away plunder cumbered deck when shoved off from spaniard must want to go into action with lot of bale case hamperin movement now that have got everything snugly stowed under hatch be comin ' down to try conclusion with if really mean business have very tidy little job afore ay assented schooner will prove very tough nut to crack henderson carry more than twice weight of metal even if be mistaken in supposing that saw long gun on forecastle appears to be very strongly manned only chance will be to engage at close quarter lay aboard carry by boarding d 'ye think will be such fool a to let do sir caustically demanded gunner chewing hard upon quid in evident perplexity n o returned dubiously suppose will if can help be only chance same must bend energy to accomplish there be particular reason why must not so far a can see unless of course be unfortunate enough to have spar two knocked away good shooting be what be going to decide fight henderson must hope that ours will be better than theirs ay agreed gunner there be harm in hopin ' shook head spat vigorously over side by way of expressing doubt be worrying a turned out doubt apprehension be by mean without foundation for when antagonist arrived within range of long be not mistaken a to matter hauled wind opened fire upon with making very excellent practice too although be not until have fired six shot at that of actually came near enough to do damage then shot only passed through foresail making neat hole in canvas doing further mischief previous attempt however have come close enough to to prove that have at least one excellent gunner on board for one of shot fell within two three fathom of at utmost when man shoot so well at long range be bound to score few hit sooner later be precisely what henderson most feared for so long a pirate chose to play game of long bowl might blaze away at at leisure in perfect safety pound shot flying over over at distance far beyond range of pounder what now have to do be to shorten distance between ourselves antagonist a quickly a possible bring within reach of gun before sustained very serious damage from long gun if fortune must so far favour thought that possibly might here be able to make one of wasp peculiarity very useful peculiarity consisted in fact have by time have many opportunity of observing that in smooth water such a then prevailed little vessel must if properly handled shoot quite extraordinary distance to windward while in stay have in mind to utilise peculiarity now by making series of very short board getting good way upon then easing helm very gently down allowing to shoot maximum possible distance to windward time that hove about mentioned idea to henderson have not very much faith in idea being that of most old salt that best way to work to windward be to break tack a seldom a possible agreed however that might perhaps be worth while to make experiment see what result must be accordingly put plan into practice with such good effect that hour later have actually succeeded in working up near enough to pirate to bring within range of own gun meanwhile have be most assiduously pegging away at in first instance with long gun only latterly with pounder of mounted seven in battery a well have by mean come off scathless having be hulled three time losing two men killed five wounded before single shot of ours have reached though spar have thus far escaped rigging have not suffered to very serious extent with arrival within range of own gun however matter began to be little more lively be fortunate enough to have dozen very excellent shot among men now began to make play man being evidently anxious to win for proud distinction of being champion shot of ship with result daylight began to show here there through pirate schooner canvas severed rope streamed out from spar splinter began to fly on board then particularly lucky shot struck main masthead fair just above nip of lower rigging next moment down came main topmast with huge gaff topsail while peak of mainsail drooped until gaff hung almost up down hurrah lad cried exultantly now have see how pay off be bound to come to leeward now can not help down helm mr willoughby let go round stand by to give starboard broadside a cross bow slap right into eye of phew be nasty one a shot from pounder came along smashing right through quarter boat cutting keel clean in half tearing great gap in bottom planking of filling air in immediate neighbourhood with splinter whizzing so close past head that wind of whipped hat off overboard two craft be now not more than short half mile distant fast approaching other pirate loss of after sail causing to fall broad off come foaming down toward despite obvious effort to keep to wind while on side be making most desperate effort to get to windward thus secure advantage of weather gage in sea fight often mean so much conned by willoughby who be acting master lively little wasp swept round into wind fore reaching magnificently in stay then paying smartly off on starboard tack a did so three starboard pop gun barked out one after other saw splinter fly white a shot struck close together about half way between starboard hawse pipe cathead just at precise moment when be dead end on to shot must have raked from end to end quite small uproar of yell shriek came floating down from to on wing of freshening breeze told that have wrought very fair amount of execution on board be evident that captain knew business for next moment several hand sprang into fore rigging topsail topgallantsail royal be clewed up furled with exemplary celerity jib be hauled down stowed be again brought to wind while dozen hand swarmed aloft to mainmast head to clear away wreck of topmast to pas strop round shattered stump to hook peak halliard block to enable to sway away peak of mainsail again while that be doing maintained fire upon with most ferocious energy ala with very deplorable result to little wasp crew for be by time so close to other that be practically impossible for side to miss now be that superior weight of metal began to tell casualty be by time becoming serious for have already lost nine men killed outright while moment more wounded be being taken down into cabin where saunders surgeon be working like nigger affording temporary relief must do more just then to injured be still devoting energy to task of getting to windward of antagonist firing at a fast a leaping gun must be loaded in endeavour to disable when succeeded in bringing again to wind a rounded to gave whole broadside of seven pounder with shot from long pounder by way of make weight result be absolutely disastrous for a iron shower hurtled about ear there be crashing tearing sound aloft away went mast over side foremast shot away close to deck while mainmast went about way up length bad a be be for poor willoughby who be standing by side have top of skull literally shot away fell dead into arm next moment carpenter came to with report that have be hit between wind water by pound shot that schooner be making water fast pirate cheered with ferocious glee a saw plight to have reduced captain tall handsome scoundrel with very spanish looking cast of countenance have impudence to leap up on rail of vessel hail demanding to know whether have struck no shouted back fiercely never will to such hang dog murderous set of scoundrel a man that schooner do worst villain have advantage of time when next meet will be turn crow loudly young cockerel retorted pirate captain scornfully if men be wise will leave gun go below for swear to that if fire shot will sink sink then be hanged to yelled back in reply then in exasperation whipped pistol out of belt levelling at pulled trigger did not mean to be shot if must help preferring suppose to take risk of being hanged later on moment that saw what must be at sprang off perch so hurriedly that fell headlong to deck while lad sent up howl of savage derision put charge of grape in on top of round shot lad ordered blaze away a fast a can load wasp have lost wing sting remains will make scoundrel feel yet before have done with men responded to with loud fierce hurrah turned to gun again a cheerfully a though be still certain of victory although there be probably not man there who did not by time realise that chance be against gallant little schooner ever reaching port again battle now raged with absolutely maniacal fury two schooner being by time within biscuit toss of other pirate schooner lying on weather beam gun so hot that threatened to leap over low rail into sea be loaded fired a fast a men must serve fighting at such close quarter carnage on side be frightful bulwark of vessel being practically shot away gun who served left absolutely defenceless deck be like shamble there seemed to be more dead than living upon scupper be spouting blood while pirate be in scarcely better case although be now apparent that have originally outnumbered by something like three to one how long matter must have continued in fashion be impossible to say after have thus be fighting almost hand to hand for about quarter of hour during pirate schooner gradually drew ahead of lucky shot from one of gun brought down mainmast when fell broad off passed across bow raking severely a went then drove rapidly away to leeward people having apparently at length come to conclusion that have have that wanted in way of fighting moment became certain that fight be over sank down upon breech of nearest gun mopped blood perspiration from face tried to understand scene of ruin carnage surrounded for with cessation of turmoil excitement of battle everything seemed suddenly to assume inconsequence unreality of dream must not quite realise that shot torn blood bespattered wreck over gaze wandered wonderingly be erstwhile smart dainty little schooner of have be so proud that maimed disfigured form lying broadcast about deck be really dead men also head ached most consumedly there be loud buzzing in ear silence rather comparative silence succeeded to continuous sharp explosion of gun excited shout of men cry of wounded seemed weird uncanny unnatural for now there be sound save wash of water alongside intermittent groaning cut into now then by sharp cry of man under hand of surgeon coming up through smashed skylight low murmur of men speaking to other from time to time where have flung down exhausted between gun fact be be suffering from reaction be inevitable after so fierce protracted fight battle having lasted for over hour felt that must bestir must become light headed hysterical something equally foolish therefore rose to foot called to steward to bring glass of water water cask usually stood on deck having be smashed to stave early in fight then gave order for men to secure gun also sent young hinton down below to ascertain bring particular of casualty thus far have be much too strenuously engaged attention too fully occupied to take note of weather now a glanced round at lowering heaven observed threatening aspect bethought that fatigued though be there still remained abundance of work to be done in preparation for storm be evidently brewing for sky be now completely overcast with pall of dense livid purplish slate coloured cloud that clearly portended gale wind be coming in hot fierce intermittent puff scourged sea into miniature foam flecked wave for few second at time then dropped almost to calm again upon looking at barometer saw that mercury have fallen almost inch since have last looked at shortly before commencement of fight spaniard have vanished pirate schooner be still running away to leeward presently young hinton midshipman whom have sent below to ascertain extent of casualty came up to with list in hand have prepared saunders surgeon being at moment far too busy to spare time for making up of return from list learned appalling news that of entire complement of fifty eight told have lost no le than seventeen killed thirty two more le severely wounded leaving only poor paltry nine of untouched of whom be one fortunately of thirty two wounded only about half of be hurt severely enough to be rendered totally unfit for duty be bad enough in conscience with ship dismantled leaking something very like gale threatening have just finished perusal of young hinton list when henderson carpenter came up on deck former bringing with key of magazine have secured in accordance with order have sent down below to while mill be fresh from examination of ship interior report be anything reassuring for news brought be to effect that have be hulled no le than seventeen time four of shot have hulled being pounder one of two of pirate pounder have struck between wind water added that have plugged hole a well a must that there be nearly three foot of water in hold that little ship be very severely strained that be making water at rate of nearly eight inch hour chapter fourteen end of wasp be clear that in face of such report a threatening sky frowned down upon be not moment in to indulge in thought of rest however loudly poor aching body might clamour for there be much to be done to secure own safety that of injured helpless comrade very little time in to do therefore directed pearce boatswain to pipe hand to splice main brace when have be done little band who be still capable of doing duty be divided into three party one of under henderson be stationed at pump with order to work at until sucked while second much smaller party under leadership guidance of carpenter be given task of temporarily securing various opening in deck against possible influx of water skylight companion having be completely wrecked by shot third party under pearce boatswain devoting to task of clearing away wreck of spar securing a much a possible of wreckage in order that might have wherewithal to give schooner jury rig must enable to take into port pirate schooner meanwhile have continued to run away to leeward upon course must carry to northern coast of hayti in few hour work went slowly forward must not be otherwise with men so utterly exhausted a be little moiety of wasp crew who survived that desperate fight many of smarting with wound that have received meanwhile weather grew ever more threatening stimulating to exertion of be confident must have be utterly incapable under more placable circumstance not that there be very much to find fault with at moment for be not exactly blowing hard gust for last hour more have be sweeping over now from quarter anon from be steadily growing more frequent stronger while sky have become black a night before night actually fell have made shift to pump schooner dry hatch be battened down skylight companion opening have be protected after fashion have cleared away wreck of mainmast saving spar attached having done men declared that must have meal rest before must again turn to felt claim be just for indeed have done wonder taking thing into consideration have not heart to spur to further effort just then for have worked with therefore knew from personal experience how utterly exhausted must feel how impossible must be to get further useful work out of until have rested for hour two indeed there did not appear to be good sufficient reason why must call upon for more hard work just then be true that much that intended to do still remained undone most important task of being getting up of something in nature of jury rig short handed a now be must prove very formidable task much too formidable too protracted to justify hope that must be accomplished before expected gale came a considered question talked over with henderson boatswain seemed that if must not be completed beforehand must really be better on whole to defer until after gale have blown over therefore gave order to knock off work get supper rest two minute later deck be deserted save by be bracing up to keep lookout a best might felt bound to acknowledge to myself that situation be very much reverse of satisfactory for there be totally dismasted strained leaking badly crew exhausted only nine of unwounded land barely twenty five mile to leeward of to crown heavy gale springing up fortunately have be able to make provision be possible to meet impending struggle for wreck of mainmast be now inboard while lanyard of fore rigging have be cut away on side wreckage of foremast be now under schooner bow attached to hull by stay only so that served a floating anchor to little vessel be already riding head to wind allowed men two hour in to rest refresh then once more summoned on deck for upon sounding well found that although schooner have be pumped dry before have cried spell ho there be now eighteen inch of water in be determined that leak must be kept down by frequent spell of pumping must never do to have little hooker waterlogged while battling for life in gale a there be little doubt that must be in course of next few hour in fact while men be still toiling at pump got first real taste of for up to moment wind have be coming in steadily increasing succession of scuffling gust more fierce than predecessor first from quarter of compass then from that with quite moderate breeze in between mostly from northerly direction that sometimes moderated almost to calm now after somewhat longer spell than usual of moderate breeze wind quite suddenly increased in force to of full gale swooping down upon in mad scuffle twirled little craft about like teetotum for minute two a howled raved around lashing whole surface of sea into one unbroken sheet of foam spray then settled down began to blow great gun from northward whipping up nasty short choppy sea into within ten minute little schooner be plunging to height of hawse hole however a turned out be only beginning of for when once gale have fairly broken loose steadily grew more furious with result that in about hour be plunging bow under while to add to difficulty violent motion strained little vessel opened seam to extent so far from getting pump to suck needed utmost exertion of hand working in quick relay to keep leak from gaining upon clearly must never do to permit state of thing a to continue for only partially rested men must soon become exhausted by laborious toil of pump then what must become of therefore summoned council of war consisting of gunner carpenter boatswain to whom explained view of situation asked advice be opinion founded upon experience during recent fight that if pirate schooner be to be tackled successfully must have to be by bigger craft than wasp at event if wasp be to be again employed against pirate must certainly have to be equipped with very much heavier armament insignificant little array of six pounder must never be expected to cope successfully with other craft fourteen pounder long therefore argued since present armament must never be of further use to so far a pirate be concerned while at present moment be doing much to make schooner strain to piece be indeed actually imperilling safety that of on board why not throw overboard so relieve little vessel of weight give best possible chance to weather gale henderson boatswain be rather opposed to plan gunner suggesting a alternative that must cut adrift from wreckage be holding head to wind endeavour to get before wind scud to view still adhered even after have pointed out to that island of hayti constituted lee shore only twenty five mile distant upon must inevitably be dashed before morning if adopted plan carpenter however took view that must lose gun in case if schooner went ashore probably ship life a well while by making timely sacrifice of gun there be at least possibility of saving ship be thus two to two a be absolutely convinced that plan advocated by gunner boatswain involved destruction of ship drowning of at least a many of poor fellow below a be too seriously injured to be capable of taking care of unhesitatingly decided in favour of own alternative at once gave order to throw gun overboard without further ado watching opportunity therefore taking advantage of roll of ship launched pounder overboard one after other until six of have vanished in ocean depth increased liveliness of little vessel at once demonstrated relief at loss of so much weight from deck carpenter have just sounded well have announced joyous news at last pump be gaining upon leak announcement be greeted with feeble cheer from now utterly exhausted men who have for so long be toiling at almost hopeless task of clearing ship of inflowing water when sudden dreadful change occurred in weather wind have be blowing whole gale moment before fell dead in instant appalling darkness overspread firmament atmosphere suddenly became so rarefied that seemed impossible for one to draw full breath sea moment earlier have be breaking furiously ceased to do so instead began to leap high into air falling back with splash in sudden stillness seemed positively terrifying schooner swinging broadside on rolled so furiously that momentarily threatened to turn bottom up while of who be on deck have to seize hurriedly first fixed portion of vessel framework that must lay hand on to save from being pitched overboard like shot out of catapult to continue pumping under such circumstance be impossible for needed hand one strength to merely hold on now what be goin ' to happen wonder growled gunner who be clinging with to belaying pin in part of rail still remained intact in wake of main rigging can understand gale o ' wind mr delamere here sudden calm seem natural to be not natural said mere look of sky be sufficient to assure of there be something behind may be certain though what be be sure can not say possibly may be fresh outfly from other point of compass may end up with violent thunderstorm though think will sky interrupted henderson there be thunder there sir ye may take word for listen delamere d 'ye hear thought for instant that be directing attention to pitiful cry moan be being extorted from unhappy wounded down below a be flung hither thither by furious lurch of schooner be about to make sort of reply when low moaning smote upon ear increasing with appalling rapidity to fierce medley of sound in savage roar of maddened beast shriek wailing of mortally terrified human being seemed to be about equally mingled long line of phosphorescent white appeared upon northern horizon showing up with ghastly distinctness against background of black scowling sky fierce scuffle of hot wet wind swept over be gone again leaving taste of salt upon lip with deafening howl a of concentrated fury tempest leapt upon filling air with drenching spindrift scudwater while taking schooner fair abeam heeled over until water be up nearly level with coaming of hatchway for nearly minute lay thus despite fact that be dismasted believed that be about to turn turtle with when gradually a drag of wreckage ahead brought round head to wind again righted to even keel once more rode almost a still a though be in harbour while spindrift scudwater raked deck fore aft like continuous tempest of small shot stung face hand so severely that be literally impossible to face turning back to dropping upon hand knee be driven to creep for shelter wherever must find sea have gone down a though by magic for such be power of wind that slightest irregularity of surface slightest lift of wave be at once torn off swept away to leeward in form of spray so dense that be impossible to see farther than few yard in direction perhaps worst most terrifying feature of whole experience be that there be nothing to be done nothing that must possibly do to abate peril of situation be a absolutely helpless a though have be bound hand foot must merely crouch impotently waiting for end whatever might be be not possible for matter to continue very long a be hurricane endured only for about twenty minute then moderated to strength of heavy gale whereupon sea began to rise again with frightful rapidity hour after first stroke of hurricane schooner be pitching bow under shipping increasing quantity of water at plunge now a once more bestirred ourselves be confronted with fresh calamity for makeshift protection of damaged companion skylight a well a fore scuttle have be swept away probably at first stroke of hurricane although not one of have observed already vast quantity of water be pouring into little vessel interior principally through fore scuttle have scarcely made alarming discovery when saunders surgeon who have remained below through hubbub busily engaged in attending to wounded came up on deck confirmed worst fear by informing that schooner be rapidly filling water having already risen to level of cabin floor be now obvious that little ship be doomed hurricane coming so close upon heel of fight smiting before have have time to repair damage be proving too much for be strained battered to piece nothing that must do out there short handed buffeted by pitiless wind sea must avail to save be doomed now utmost lay in power to do be to make sort of provision for own safety that of wounded shipmate yet when one came to consider question what must do boat badly damaged by shot of pirate in first place have be utterly destroyed swept away by first furious stroke of hurricane while by same agency deck have be swept clear clean of everything not actually bolted down except wreckage of mainmast have lashed firmly to ring bolt in deck before gale arose there be that wreckage be true also wreckage of foremast under bow if must possibly be got alongside raft of sort might perhaps be constructed out of there resource must end there be time for pondering consideration be done must have to be done at once therefore called gunner carpenter boatswain to hastily explained to idea a to construction of raft bade muster available hand get to work forthwith while millar purser cabin steward be instructed to get together a large quantity of provision water a possible wherewith to stock structure when finished now that wind have moderated from hurricane force to of heavy gale sea rose with really startling rapidity be already running so high that when came to set about task of cutting adrift wreckage of foremast with idea of hauling alongside utilising in construction of raft at once became evident that time for undertaking piece of work be already past for even alongside schooner partially under lee wreckage must be swept so violently by breaking sea that must be impossible for men to go over side work upon without being washed off drowned be therefore compelled to abandon that part of plan turn attention to construction of raft on deck must float clear when battered hull sank from under foot ala even be not to be for have scarcely got wreckage of mainmast cut adrift from lashing be busily engaged in arranging with topmast mainboom in form of triangle a base upon to construct platform when happened that schooner having just surmounted sea got pinned down by head in consequence of water in rushing forward a settled down stem on into succeeding trough at critical moment yell of dismay from carpenter caused to look up from work beheld with eye almost starting from socket glaring pointing ahead single glance in direction sufficed to account for terror for there sweeping down upon with deadly implacability towered perfect mountain of sea front almost a steep a side of house foaming hissing crest reared threateningly aloft a high a lower masthead have be standing be at once apparent to pinned down a schooner be at moment by bulk of water in interior having concentrated in fore part of must not possibly lift in time to rise over summit of on sweeping sea must inevitably break on board sweep from stem to stern send to bottom for second stood petrified with consternation then with yell of hold on everybody for life dashed to companion opening shouted to below on deck hand of up come men instant have not second to lose dreadful wailing cry of despair floated upward from below in response to warning be echoed by people on deck a awful liquid mountain hovered above seeming to pause for instant a though in sentient enjoyment of helplessness terror next moment crest curled over whole mass of water seemed to hurl headlong upon hapless schooner foaming in over bow burying fathom deep in heart felt poor shattered hull quiver tremble beneath like frightened thing a giant wave smote then be seized by on rushing water swept off foot overwhelmed whirled helplessly hither thither in midst of medley of whirling wreckage flying rope end struggling men opening eye beheld hull of schooner short distance away standing almost perpendicular slowly gliding downwards bow first even a looked vanished into dark profundity beneath then directed glance above seemed that be fathom deep for phosphorescent foam boiled overhead looked almost a far aloft a frigate lower yard by same ghastly phosphorescent light must distinguish vaguely number of swirling object of appeared to be merely inanimate wreckage while others looked like struggling human being then suddenly conscious of fact be within influence of downward draught of sinking schooner be being dragged down after instinctively struck upward desperately with hand foot fighting to return to surface must have be dragged down to very considerable depth for presently lost sight of phosphorescent light on surface caused by breaking of sea found involved in pitchy darkness struggling madly with lung almost bursting how long awful struggle lasted have mean of determining probably be much le than minute time seemed to drag out first to minute then to hour finally lost idea of time sense of terrible situation recollection of dreadful catastrophe have just happened found a in vivid dream re enacting many long forgotten episode of earlier day then in moment scene vanished be suddenly knew not how on surface gasping for breath half smothered with sea be breaking over head convulsively clutching rope have somehow found way into grasp gradually dawned upon that rope must be fast to something for alternately tautened slackened with sweep swirl of sea thereupon proceeded to haul cautiously upon with result presently found alongside floating wreckage of mainmast with difficulty at length managed to drag up get astride substantial spar then finding that did not roll over throw off a more than half feared must gradually worked way along until found close up against crosstrees then thought perceived reason why spar maintained stability so well mainsail have be set when mast be shot away gaff with sail attached still retained position on mast main halliard having somehow jammed in block evidently be that prevented spar from capsizing rope by have hauled alongside spar proved to be end of peak halliard thought that if made fast so prevented peak from sagging must secure still further stability of wreckage accordingly did so knotting bight round one arm of crosstrees then firmly lashing to same arm with loose end of halliard be now much better off than when first found overboard for have stout spar to support might remain afloat until fell off from exhaustion moreover even when end of spar be submerged a of course very frequently be be never buried deeper than armpit while there be moment when be hove up clear out of water altogether besides water be quite warm be therefore by mean uncomfortable notwithstanding situation having made secure next began to look about with view of ascertaining how many of companion in misfortune have survived catastrophe for have not doubt that few at least must be a lucky a to horror found that be sole occupant of particular mass of wreckage although shouted at full power of lung until be hoarse in hope that if there be more survivor must hear thus be guided to same refuge have gained sole response be howling of gale hissing wash of breaking sea true there be moment when fancied that heard faint shout in reply to cry concluded that be only imaginary for did not hear fancy heard again then a opportunity offered looked about in quest of other wreckage thinking that possibly there might be few fragment to of one more of shipmate might be clinging darkness be so intense must not see farther than two three fathom in direction indeed be only faint phosphorescent light given off by breaking sea enabled to see anything at even at short distance thought occurred to that a floating wreckage there might be must drive in same direction possibly might be more fortunate in morning with reflection composed a well a must to rest for be by time literally half dead with fatigue so utterly exhausted be that despite desperate plight believe actually did lose consciousness in sleep at brief interval during terrible night for dawn came very much more speedily than have dared to hope with appearance gale broke wind perceptibly moderating with rising of sun a soon a be light enough to permit object to be distinguished aroused from lethargy seemed to have gripped proceeded to search heaving surface of ocean a well a aching eye must allow a matter of fact there actually be few small scattered fragment of wreckage floating at great distance from there be sign of human being far near then scanned very carefully horizon in direction particularly to northward in hope of discovering sail of sort heading toward horizon be bare save to southward where high land of hayti loomed up with startling quite deceptive distinctness although have hoped that might perchance be so fortunate a to sight sail hope be very feeble one disappointment by mean acute for be perfectly well aware that be many mile too far to eastward to render appearance of sail of sort in least degree probable with pang of hunger beginning to assail not smallest fragment of kind of food wherewith to relieve began for first time to realise fully exceeding awkwardness of situation to realise too that if deliverance be to come to must bestir do what might be possible to meet for to remain passively lashed to inert piece of drifting wreckage might very well mean slow agonising death by starvation yet after what must do land be nearest refuge that considered must be at least twenty mile distant altogether too far to dream of swimming to although rather prided upon prowess a long distance swimmer twenty mile idea be ridiculous especially in heavy sea in exhausted condition without food with mean of getting looked rather longingly at smaller fragment of wreckage floating in neighbourhood if must secure one of of sufficient size to support partially yet not large enough materially to hamper progress through water might perhaps with aid be able to accomplish distance great though be before strength entirely gave out run of sea greater buoyancy be already widening distance between comparatively massive piece to have lashed regretted that have not occurred to earlier to abandon mainmast in favour of one of moment that light of dawn revealed to struggled into standing position on spar supported steadying upon somewhat precarious perch by grasping arm of crosstrees carefully examined such fragment a came within ken with heave of sea detached piece seemed to consist mostly of piece of planking with what looked very like hatch be floating together pretty much in bunch with only few fathom of water separating two piece thought that if must get in among surely ought to be able to find piece must serve purpose point worried be whether in exhausted state in so heavy sea dared make attempt to swim unaided comparatively short distance separated from coveted fragment reflected that if have not strength to achieve so simple feat a must certainly never be able to accomplish longer swim even with advantage of support choice seemed therefore to lie between risk of drowning on one hand that of starvation upon other took moment to decide in favour of former yes told better in way to drown than to starve sooner matter be decided better to give best possible chance flung off jacket kicked off shoe retaining only shirt trouser then casting off lashing by have secured to shattered mainmast stood up carefully took bearing of flotsam relative to sun to guide when swimming done poised upon spar preparatory to diving off mast have raised hand above head when not dozen fathom away immediately between spot for be bound saw dorsal fin of two enormous shark sculling quietly to fro a though to blockade cut off from only hope of escape chapter fifteen voyage on hatch pulled up just in nick of time for in second must have made plunge must have meant death horrible death for splash must have made upon entering water must have inevitably attracted attention of monster brought upon with rush almost appeared a though malicious influence be at work to prevent escape a though fate be against yet after be not fate be to blame own dullness in not perceiving chance availing of moment that presented if instead of vacillating a have done have promptly taken plunge must have accomplished short swim before shark have made appearance cut off retreat when first sighted detached fragment of wreckage distance separated from be trifling now be at least double a far be increasing rapidly soon must pas out of sight altogether last hope must be gone stood watching two shark a swam lazily to fro between fast receding wreckage really looked a though be aware of presence have divined purpose be determined to frustrate for what seemed at least hour be probably not more than ten minute voracious fish tacked way that approaching little nearer tack until at length be so close that must have leapt upon back of nearer one so close that must distinctly see entire bulk sight turned blood cold for be veritable monster one of being fully twenty foot long from snout to tip of unevenly fluked tail while other be perhaps three foot shorter there be now no room to doubt that be fully aware of existence for time that passed great goggle eye glared at hungrily with expression seemed to say all right boy may hold on there a long a like will wait for get at last began to cast about in mind for mean by might drive creature away have knife with long strong sharp blade attached to neck by lanyard looked about to see if there be anything available must convert into spear by lashing knife to there be nothing be still puzzling brain when suddenly two fish paused in patrol swung quickly round next instant made sail dead to windward a though have just caught scent of especially tempting morsel now if ever be time told brute have undoubtedly left there be other shark in sight second be precious therefore without allowing instant for pause hesitation quietly slid off mainmast into water struck out smoothly steadily for certain knoll ashore in line with have last seen floating fragment desired to reach be still blowing quite fresh there be very heavy sea running no longer broke badly be in favour sea overtook flinging forward at least couple of fathom so that made excellent progress a ascertained when turned for moment to glance back at mass of wreckage have just abandoned saw also that happened must keep on there must be thought of turning back for while run of sea be helping grandly in progress to leeward be powerful enough to render return to late refuge impossibility therefore set teeth with eye fixed upon distant knoll be to serve a guide struck out with long quiet steady stroke knew from experience must maintain for hour on end if need be of course kept very sharp lookout for wreckage be aiming for saw nothing of for long time more than once qualm of something very nearly approaching terror seized a idea suggested that possibly have missed goal be moment leaving farther behind be fast approaching state of panic might very easily have resulted in fatal consequence when suddenly occurred to that of course must be quite impossible for to see insignificant fragment of flotsam unless happened to be hove up on crest of wave at precisely same moment reflection so far steadied nerve be able successfully to combat almost irresistible impulse to put forth whole strength in frantic struggle to increase speed through water quickly settle question one way other reward came to ten minute later when a went soaring up on breast of unusually high wave caught momentary glimpse of what be undoubtedly small piece of plank of sort floating in midst of lacework of foam on crest of wave immediately in line with knoll by be directing course like everything else at greater distance than fifty sixty fathom must only see when on summit of wave fragment of plank still seemed to be terribly long way off strength be beginning to flag despair be again gripping at heart when a rose upon next sea be cheered by quite unexpected sight of considerable quantity of wreckage not more than hundred fathom distant sight renewed courage composure returned be once more calm enough to be able to husband remaining strength employ to best advantage found steadily gaining upon object of pursuit finally after long dreadfully exhausting struggle arrived in midst of wreckage first thing came to happened to be seaman chest have undoubtedly floated up through hatchway when schooner foundered floated deep for in addition to being full of water evidently contained several article of usual kind sailor take to sea with have sufficient reserve of buoyancy to afford appreciable measure of support clung to while recovering breath resting wearied limb after long swim also enabled to look round at leisure make up mind a to of object in sight must best serve purpose there be one of half of wheel grating floating at great distance from be small thin affair made of oak possessing very great amount of buoyancy although must undoubtedly be better than nothing at quickly came to conclusion that there be other piece must serve purpose better there be for instance hatch probably one of main hatch after consideration decided must not do better than secure possession of wanted something else a well must not resign to idea of merely supporting upon passively allowing wind sea to take whithersoever must there be land in sight be purpose to reach if possible therefore required something in nature of paddle wherewith to propel hatch guide in right direction presently saw piece of splintered plank about four foot long six inch wide looked more suited to purpose than anything else in sight have by time quite recovered breath be also somewhat rested therefore abandoned chest without more ado swimming first to piece of plank secured possession of then pushing before headed for hatch soon reached to climb up on hatch be very much more difficult feat than have imagined must be for first effort merely resulted in causing to turn over at length having considered matter little managed partly to guide under partly to climb up on until have fairly under when to great delight found that be just buoyant enough to support weight that by carefully seating cross legged tailor fashion in exact centre of must keep right side up next experimented with makeshift paddle although hatch proved so terribly crank be several time in imminent danger of capsizing by mere sway of body from side to side presently acquired trick of keeping balance found to great delight must actually progress although only slowly at cost of great exertion strangely enough have not thus far suffered very greatly from thirst although something like eighteen hour have elapsed since last draught have passed lip sense of hunger be by time painfully acute have mean however of satisfying gnawing craving for food therefore addressed to task of paddling tiny raft shoreward fully convinced that only hope of saving life lay in reaching land before scanty remains of strength became exhausted estimated from height of sun above horizon that be about nine o'clock in morning when fairly started upon shoreward voyage exasperating slowness with drew away from rest of wreckage caused to put speed through water at not more than mile hour at utmost while grey misty appearance of land for be making convinced that must be at least twenty mile distant have therefore something like twenty four hour of continuous laborious paddling before before might once more hope to feel solid earth beneath foot find something be no more than little wild fruit wherewith to stay hunger be not skin of hand have become so exceedingly soft tender through long immersion in water that sharp edge of board be using a paddle quickly caused to blister although paused long enough in labour to enable to trim sharp edge away with knife to work board into somewhat more convenient shape blistering process continued until within about hour palm be quite raw smarting most atrociously from salt in water moreover have lost hat sun struck down so fiercely upon unprotected head be soon nearly delirious with headache throbbing of old wound received in attack upon pirate brigantine on costa firme still headache headache blister blister there be land yet long distance off have to be reached before strength gave out life must pay forfeit so set teeth paddled doggedly on hour after hour hunger ever growing keener while now began to experience in addition torment of thirst whole body became racked with ache pain a though have be unmercifully bruised beaten head throbbed until seemed a if must burst open a for hand at length felt a though rough paddle be white hot iron have certainly never in life before experienced such complication of agonising pain despite land seemed to draw never inch nearer think must at length have become light headed for gradually feeling stole over that everything surroundings situation suffering be unreal be victim of peculiarly ghastly horrible nightmare must by by be wakened fortunately to find be in own bunk that event of past twenty four hour have be nothing more than exceptionally vivid realistic dream from state be partially aroused by seeing number of glittering object start out of sea round while at same instant be conscious of receiving sharp blow on chest when on looking down into lap saw fine flying fish wriggling flapping there making gallant ineffectual effort to hoist out of hollow formed by crossed leg return to water for second two stared stupidly down at struggling creature then seemed to dawn upon dazed faculty here at last be food something must at least mitigate for time fierce pang of gnawing hunger in very frenzy of eagerness clutched unfortunate fish bit savagely into writhing body yes know that idea be inexpressibly repugnant even revolting yet solemnly declare that never in life before have tasted anything so exquisitely delicious a raw fish never have so keenly enjoyed meal be glad to believe that there will be very few who can sympathise with appreciate enjoyment for reader must have experienced first agony of starvation be worst before can do so revolting not be profoundly convinced that owe life to meal for sens returned to at once upon completion although with there also returned full appreciation of acuteness of physical discomfort felt distinctly revived reinvigorated moreover with full return of sens became aware that after painful effort have not be nearly so ineffectual a have imagined to be land being now appreciably nearer than have be at daylight that morning few of bolder detail being now visible now once more be sufficiently rational to take cognisance of flight of time be not at certain of bearing felt that sun must certainly have crossed meridian that eternity of suffering through have passed must never have be compressed into short half hour so if be correct in surmise hour must be somewhere about three o'clock in afternoon three o'clock in afternoon land still so far away that many further hour of toil agony must be endured ere might hope to reach brain reeled again at mere prospect of in perfect frenzy of despair resumed paddle cry aloud mad incoherent prayer to god that must either send help in extremity mercifully put immediate end to suffering then thought came to torment in something like three hour sun must set darkness must encompass about if sky must become obscured with cloud star be hidden how must continue to find way at idea looked about mind have be too confused too busily occupied with other matter to take intelligent note of weather during last few hour be somewhat relieved to observe that sky be now clear save for few scattered solemnly drifting cloud that weather have tolerably settled appearance that wind have moderated to quite gentle breeze that sea have gone down very considerably be no longer breaking certainly be point in favour since be not longer in momentary peril of being capsized washed off frail ark advantage be to certain extent counterbalanced by fact that run of sea be not materially helping wearily yet desperately continued to ply clumsy paddle first on side then on other with alarming rapidity suffering seemed to grow in acuteness until found moaning uttering short sharp cry of distress with movement of body ay with breath drew for now to add to discomfort suddenly became aware that lung be in way affected that mere act of breathing seemed to tear asunder yet though situation appeared to be so utterly hopeless doggedly persevered in effort telling over over again out loud that if must hold out long enough must in natural order of thing eventually reach shore succour think be about time finally lost control of for thenceforward be conscious that be continually talking to myself in hoarse guttural croak that even now shudder to call to mind now arguing now encouraging now reproaching until at length idea wandered away to sort of incongruous subject by turn detected laughing singing praying apostrophising sun cloud distant land even spirit of drowned companion whom imagined to be crowding round trying to drag off floating hatch be aware in vague impersonal fashion of gradual decline of sun toward west of disappearance beneath horizon of fact just a outline of land ahead be fading into gathering darkness small spark of light sprang into view somewhere in direction be steering for then suddenly grew black about there be singing in ear oblivion when consciousness returned opened eye found stretched upon bed in large lofty room very barely furnished there being nothing in apartment save bed upon lay large old fashioned wardrobe dressing table small round table by bedside two massive carved chair upholstered in stamped leather showed sign of having seen many year of service be night apparently for only illumination came from large handsome lamp have appearance of being wrought out of silver one of two chair in room stood by side of bed be occupied by very respectable looking negress of forty year of age thereabout sound asleep two jug one of porcelain one of cut glass stood on table in company with large tumbler cup with spoon in glass jug be three part full of lemonade if eye did not deceive sight of suddenly caused to become acutely conscious of fact be athirst have negress be awake must have asked to give drink seeing that be sleeping sleep of just decided to help with intent essayed to raise in bed might a well have attempted to lift house for when came to move discerned to consternation be so weak must scarcely stir hand foot much le raise entire body in alarm distress unwittingly gave vent to feeble groan faint a be proved sufficient to arouse attendant who stirred in chair adjusted turban then rising to foot leaned over bed peered down into face for second stood thus when eye having adjusted to rather dim light of lamp perceived be awake ah murmured in half whisper in spanish senor be at length again thanks be to blessed saint how be feeling senor very thirsty replied in same language spoke fairly well to amazement though have intended to speak out loud voice be more than scarcely audible whisper negress have to bend head to catch bueno ejaculated with evidence of keen satisfaction senor be thirsty have spanish will drink then laid hand upon forehead now discovered to further astonishment that head be swathed in bandage yes then medicine more sleep so saying filled big tumbler with lemonade how delicious looked with thin shred of lemon leaf of mint floating on surface passed arm very gently beneath shoulder raised to semi sitting posture applied tumbler to lip oh how good how delicious how refreshing be that long cool draught how grateful to parched palate exquisite acidity of flavour talk of nectar belief at moment be that nectar be merely lemonade under name smacked lip audibly a gasped for breath after emptying tumbler sable friend smiled with satisfaction then still holding poured about wine glassful of very dark brown almost black liquid from porcelain jug into cup presented to too drank for be still thirsty medicine be by mean so palatable a lemonade being of exceedingly pungent bitter taste be afraid made rather wry face a negress removed cup from lip ah murmured smilingly senor doe not like so well a lemonade be nevertheless better drink of two for will kill fever in blood give back strength while lemonade merely refreshes then a gently laid back on pillow adjusted sheet only covering about throat continued now senor must sleep when awakes mama elisa will have nice nourishing ready for very good ah very good indeed to make strong again whether be comfort refreshment followed slaking of thirst effect of medicine kind hearted nurse have administered cooling night breeze swept in through open window played freely over can not say possibly might have be combination of three whatever cause true be that head be scarcely back on pillow before sank into profound most refreshing sleep refreshing to mind body for during hour of unconsciousness followed brain remained absolutely quiescent be no longer disturbed harassed by vague yet terrifying phantasy dim memory of have haunted during few minute of wakefulness when next opened eye room in lay be flooded with brilliant sunshine streamed in through large open window in wall faced also freely admitted indescribably refreshing breeze richly laden with mingled perfume of tropical garden spray of rose bush laden with magnificent crimson bloom swished to fro before window swayed by breeze wafted dash of scent laden breath toward beyond there stretched vista of flowering shrub orange banana tree straight smooth stem of palm part of gigantic trunk of silk cotton tree springing from smooth sward of guinea grass beyond again thicket of bamboo delicate feathery foliage of closed view splendid butterfly flitted hither thither few humming bird poised upon swiftly fanning wing hung over flowering plant like living gem sipping nectar of bloom occasionally brilliant green lizard must dart along broad window sill in chase of fly for several minute lay quite motionless lost in admiration of beauty of picture upon eye rested inhaling long breath of perfumed air that played about then swiftly awaking consciousness be distinctly hungry caused to turn head toward chair mama elisa have occupied when fell asleep chair be still occupied not by mama elisa however by quadroon girl of about seventeen year of age clad in usual garb of coloured woman namely sort of loose chemise of white cotton petticoat printed in kind of paisley pattern reached to little below knee long black hair hung in two thick plait down far below waist wore massive gold earring in small shapely ear necklace of big amber bead encircled finely modelled neck otherwise bare foot be shod in low cut crimson morocco slipper when first glimpsed be leaning back in chair idly waving palm leaf fan while fine dark eye gazed abstractedly with somewhat sad expression methought upon brilliant picture presented by open window a stared started to foot bent over gazing intently into eye then laid soft shapely hand for moment upon brow withdrew again murmured in pure rich castilian senor be better have slept long well skin be cool fever have gone be hungry be not so nodded good exclaimed with smile of satisfaction disclosed two row of small perfectly shaped teeth will go tell mama elisa before must say word ask question have vanished through door in wall against stood head of bed minute later in came mama elisa smiling over honest still good looking face bearing in hand large massive tray looked a though might be solid silver tray be draped with cloth of snow white damask upon be symmetrically arranged small silver bowl steaming content of emitted most savoury appetising odour spoon small cruet plate upon lay slice of white bread of dry toast wine glass containing liquid of rich ruby colour might possibly be port wine aha cheerily exclaimed a placed tray content upon table by side of bed be easy to see that senor be better eye be brighter long sleep have done good now need only plenty of nourishing food careful nursing to set again upon foot teresita tell that be hungry senor be good sign do think must take little broth senor replied that have very little doubt upon point whereupon good soul proceeded to crumble small quantity of bread into steaming bowl after slipping arm under shoulder very tenderly raising supported body against ample bosom a fed from bowl spoonful at time coaxing between while to nibble at toast broth be delicious whatever might have be made of be in mood to ask question to own surprise mama intense gratification consumed in quantity about pint to last drop also ate about slice of toast then came wine glass of ruby coloured liquid proved to be a have anticipated port wine rich generous seeming to fill with new life when have finished meal have drained bumper of lemonade teresita be summoned to assist in process of washing face hand inducting into clean linen after followed long sleep progress toward recovery be now rapid although soon learned that escape from death have be little short of miraculous naturally a soon a reason returned to be strong enough to engage in conversation began to inquire where be how came to be there for first three four day after event above described nurse mama elisa teresita refused to tell anything save be with friend at length when have so far recovered a to be able to sit up in bed without assistance mama elisa took compassion upon proceeded to satisfy curiosity informed first that gale in wasp foundered have occurred more than three week previously then proceeded to say that on second day after gale have moderated sea having by time gone down sufficiently to permit fisherman once more to proceed to sea in canoe one tomasso negro formerly slave now freeman in service of senor don luis fernando maria calderon y albuquerque owner of bella vista estate have sallied forth from certain small cove on estate for purpose of procuring supply of fish a usual after having be thus engaged for hour with very scant success tomasso have decided to try luck farther out while padding to seaward attention have be attracted by appearance of something floating about mile away paddling in direction in hope that what saw might be worth picking up have at length come alongside hatchway with upon in state of collapse negro on island have risen in insurrection against white only six year previously while slavery have be abolished only about four year relation between black white on island be consequently still greatly strained many negro finding one in helpless state must have callously left to die tomasso however luckily for be not one of sort have always be well treated by master therefore felt animus against white consequently a soon a found that spark of life still remained in body transferred to canoe abandoning for moment further thought of fishing paddled back to shore then hauling canoe up on beach have hastened to house acquainted master don luis with find latter generous humane high spirited fellow a noble specimen of spanish hidalgo a one need wish to meet at once hastened down to cove upon perceiving condition gave immediate order be to be carried up to house put to bed everything possible done to save life nearest reliable doctor being at santiago over forty mile distant on other side of mountain have quickly decided to put in hand of mama elisa born upon estate of amply proved fidelity marvellously skilled in use of herb treatment of disease with result that having battled for fortnight with raging fever that almost immediately developed have at length triumphantly brought to point of convalescence chapter sixteen night alarm having heard mama elisa story next thing wanted be naturally to see don luis thank for extraordinary kindness to stranger more than enemy accordingly upon being informed of desire learning from mama elisa be now well enough to receive visitor host presented at bedside that same evening expressed very great pleasure felt at finding making such good progress toward recovery accepted expression of gratitude with much graciousness professed happy to have be mean of saving life of fellow creature begged to regard house everything belonged to a entirely at service for a long a might be pleased to make use of then said must be glad to learn how came to be in plight in tomasso have found if felt equal to task of telling story thought that for moment looked trifle disconcerted when mentioned fact be british naval officer if so expression be quickly suppressed listened with deep attention much sympathy to story of falling in with boarding santa brigitta subsequent fight with pirate schooner foundering of wasp during gale somewhat to surprise be quite young man scarcely more than thirty year of age have somehow got into head that being owner of so fine estate a bella vista must of necessity be at least middle aged if not elderly man understood when explained that estate have originally be purchased afterwards developed by father who now learned have perished in insurrection of at length after have be chatting together for fully hour mama elisa intervened protesting that have be sufficiently excited for one day quite unceremoniously ordered master out of room upon don luis laughing heartily at favourite servant brusqueness shook cordially by hand hoped must soon be well enough to quit sick chamber informed that must now do pleasure to visit for few minute daily if only for purpose of assuring that mama elisa have not poisoned with of vile concoction after parting shot at mama effected masterly retreat from time onward mended rapidly on sixth day after don luis first visit be well enough to rise from bed leave room for hour two now must have be in ludicrous difficulty in matter of clothes for scanty garment in have come ashore be not only ruined by long immersion in sea water be also in rag have not be for fortunate circumstance that don luis be a nearly a possible of same height enabled generously to place wardrobe at disposal while don luis be fine square shouldered well built fellow have shrunk to little more than skeleton so that although clothes fitted well enough a to lateral dimension in other respect made look pretty much of scarecrow must not avoid seeing ghost of smile flickering in don luis eye when upon first appearance in public so to speak presented in due form to wife dona inez there be smile on sweet lady lip in eye a fell upon noted evidence of suffering in hollow cheek wasted form on contrary be at once commiseration sympathy a expressed gratification that have fallen to lot of one of people to find in hour of need to bring to shelter of roof instead of leaving to perish a might very well have happened have fisherman who found be other than tomasso be quite young woman not more than twenty five thought typical spaniard with dark melting eye shaded by very long curving lash immense quantity of black glossy hair clear colourless skin petite handsome exceedingly graceful in movement even better than that be kind gentle in manner tender hearted sympathetic appeared to be absolutely idolised by man woman child upon estate received in drawing room fine lofty spacious apartment occupying approximately width of front part of house other half being occupied by dining room between drawing room there be fine hall roomy enough to be used a lounge very cool pleasant since house stood on slope of hill facing north overlooking sea while wide front door stood always open freely admitting sea breeze drawing room be really handsome room floor being of very beautiful native wood polished to brilliancy of mirror covered here there with mat rug skin wall of polished satin wood arranged in panel be hung with few very fine picture few small table loaded with miniature native curiosity be arranged apparently haphazard about room there be large low couch about dozen lounging chair piece of fancy work very handsome guitar lay upon couch large french casement be wide open giving access to wide gallery reaching right athwart house from side to side shaded from direct ray of sun by overhanging veranda into gallery be taken inducted into low spacious basket chair well equipped with cushion made thoroughly comfortable senora seating on one side of don luis establishing on other of obviously doing utmost to make feel thoroughly at home oh be good to sit out there feeling soft warm breeze playing about to drink in perfume laden air to gaze abroad upon sun bathed gently sloping lawn interspersed here there with neat symmetrically shaped flower bed gay with luxuriant rainbow tinted bloom to watch tall palm swaying a wind swept through clashing frond to note magnificent butterfly brilliant plumaged bird flitting hither thither with blue foam flecked sea mottled with rich purple cloud shadow stretching away to far horizon be allowed to sit there for two hour drawing in renewed health with breath then mama elisa teresita lieutenant swooped down upon declaring must not be further fatigued marched back to room put to bed gave dainty little meal of broth breast of roasted chicken administered stiff dose of new concoction characterised chiefly by superlative nastiness then left to go to sleep did with amazing promptitude sort of thing continued for fortnight sitting up time being gradually extended until on fourteenth day mama elisa medico in chief pronounced well enough to turn out for second breakfast to stay up for remainder of day then a gradually recovered strength came little walk in company of don luis dona inez perhaps together at first for few yard only a far a certain flower bed back then to point near at hand from specially charming vista be to be obtained finally up into mountain for distance of mile so by time that stage of convalescence be reached have arrived at conclusion that be high time must think of relieving kind benefactor of company return to duty on certain day took advantage of circumstance of being alone with host to mention matter to ask if must put in way of obtaining passage back to jamaica explaining although a be aware have not single coin in possession must pay passage money immediately upon arrival at port royal dear fellow said don luis laying hand almost affectionately upon shoulder knew of course that must come sooner later must not reasonably expect to keep with always naturally desire to return to profession duty a early a possible do not think that be just little hasty little over eager in mentioning matter to so soon after know be by mean well a yet strength be doubt equal to leisurely walk of two three mile about neighbourhood do really think that be strong enough to return at once to hardship exposure of sailor life yes said certainly think so indeed believe be great deal stronger than seem to imagine besides be quite possible may not be sent to sea again immediately upon return there may be ship for just at moment when next turn up at port royal in case may have short spell of shore duty before again going afloat in case be anxious to return report to admiral unfortunate result of encounter with pirate undergo trial by court martial for loss of wasp trial by court martial gasped surely mean to say that countryman will be so cruel a to treat a criminal simply because be inadequately equipped to cope with overwhelmingly superior force because after beating off force storm happened to arise ere have time to make suitable preparation for idea be monstrous absolutely monstrous be about to explain to don luis that be custom of british navy to try officer who be unfortunate enough to lose ship matter what circumstance may be must not let speak be so full of indignation at what evidently considered rank injustice of thing so eager to avail of lever seemed to afford for pressing home upon certain proposition now sprang upon that must not suffer to utter single word by way of explanation wait dear fellow wait exclaimed what have just told affords opportunity to mention what dona inez have discussed together more than once without real hope however of being able to bring to pas now however find that if go back must surrender prisoner be tried a criminal for what be certainly no fault of yours will speak what be in mind why go back at why not give up sea remain here be trusted friend right hand man in management of estate very badly need one like one in whom can place most absolute trust for estate be altogether too big for to manage single handed overseer while be good enough men in way doubt understand business be scarcely kind of men whom must put upon equality with admit to house to intimacy with dona inez however be different be gentleman although englishman thanks don luis thousand thanks for extraordinarily friendly generous proposal interrupted what suggest be impossible must return to port royal at cost honour demand a to exceedingly kind offer can say be that not even to accept must give up profession to be so greatly attached of be so inexpressibly proud be afraid will never be able to make senora understand how deeply moved be how profoundly grateful for really remarkable proof of kindly feeling toward quite so interrupted companion again laying hand upon shoulder need say more think understand since feel that really must go will not make further effort to tempt on contrary will do everything possibly can to assist wish will ask however dear young friend not to make reference to conversation in presence of dona inez for be convinced that if be to become aware that have actually made proposal to that have felt bound to reject must be profoundly disappointed then changed subject don luis promising to send one of negro into little town of puerto twenty mile distant to make inquiry a to possibility of being able to obtain passage on board one of small vessel occasionally traded between port kingston at same time generous fellow gave to understand that purse be entirely at disposal for purpose of defraying necessary expense that loan must be repaid at own convenience negro messenger be duly dispatched on following morning then a be not expected back until evening of third day have to posse soul in patience meanwhile don luis who seemed to have taken most extraordinary liking for allowed matter on estate practically to look after while dona inez gave up almost entirely to taking short walk into adjacent country showing a much a possible of beauty be on second night after occurrence of above recorded conversation rather in early hour of following morning be awakened out of deep sleep by sound of galloping hoof evidently approaching house before have found time to rub sleep out of eye sit up in bed wondering meanwhile what such unusual sound might portend animal sweep past end of house pull up with much snorting scattering of gravel before front door next moment footstep apparently of several people be heard ascending front step crossing wide gallery running along front of house entering hall by way of front door stood open day night except in bad weather then strong voice pealed out in spanish methought there be note of panic in hola there don luis don luis where be man arise pray at once have momentous news for who be what be heard don luis exclaim then came creak of bedstead in adjoining room a good man leapt from heard busy with flint steel endeavouring to obtain light be de mendouca answered strange voice family negro from mountain be out again being warned that be making for montpelier abandoned place took horse came on here to warn ave maria don luis exclaimed a seemed to be scrambling into clothes negro out again heard that be showing sign of unrest will be with in moment nay be alarmed carissima danger be certainly not immediate will have ample time to rise dress at leisure oho thought danger eh be time for to be making muster therefore rolled out of bed without waiting to strike light felt for clothes scrambled into made way to entrance hall just a don luis having joined unexpected visitor have succeeded in lighting great hall lamp stranger be five in number be hurriedly presented to of in turn first there be don esteban de mendouca tall thin cadaverous looking man with intensely dark eye thin crop of hair exceedingly long moustache with thin drooping end pointed vandyke beard dark beginning to be sprinkled with grey then there be dona christina wife small woman a dark a husband with perfectly preserved complexion fat fifty if day next there be don pedro de mendouca don esteban elder son very proud haughty looking man of about twenty seven year of age don silvio brother three year younger exceedingly like elder brother with much more agreeable expression of countenance lastly by mean least in attractiveness senorita eugenia don esteban daughter most lovely young woman of about seventeen year of age exquisitely fair with pair of melting blue eye acknowledged introduction with stately courtesy seems natural to spaniard then a don esteban began brief story have time to take good look at be easy enough to see that have risen from bed fled in utmost haste for toilette of have be very inadequately performed despite predominating impression produced upon be distinctly favourable indeed only thing of in least disapproved be demeanour of don pedro de mendouca struck a being good deal more haughty arrogant than there be excuse for circumstance think surprised most be that people must have fled in such apparent unreasoning panic abandoning fine property absolutely that possessed excepting horse have ridden clothes stood up in to parcel of lawless negro be soon to learn however that be not lack of courage have inspired flight have doubt don luis began don esteban that like have heard rumour of late that negro up in mountain be again beginning to show sign of unrest so far at least a be concerned rumour have be so exceedingly vague contradictory paid little attention to for a be of course aware scarcely month pass over head story of impending outbreak reach yet have never come think have at last grown to regard rumour a mere idle talk without foundation justification consequently be not only very greatly surprised also distinctly incredulous when one of house boy aroused shortly after midnight to night with intelligence that negro be actually out that practically own people have abandoned hut gone forth to join be latter circumstance alarmed when little later have verified statement came to conclusion that time for action have arrived accordingly saddled up came away without further ado a came along son discussed situation ultimately decided that proper thing also best thing must be to make for bella vista in first instance inform of fact learn view a to situation be able to learn in strength black have turned out demanded don luis answered don esteban be not know from experience that when begin raid usually divide into number of small band attacking in several direction simultaneously depending upon being reinforced by negro on estate purpose to attack thus for example whatever may have be original strength of band set out to attack montpelier have already be augmented by two hundred of people probably now muster about two hundred fifty altogether not more must say ah look yonder do see that blaze be montpelier have already plundered house set on fire so see did not get away from too early looking out through open door at back of house must be seen from hall beheld small flickering spark of fire well up on lower slope of mountain even a gazed waxed in size brilliancy snatching up powerful telescope always hung ready to hand in hall bringing to bear upon spark be able to make out that be indeed large house from window thatched roof of flame be bursting in momentarily increasing volume while round about crowd of negro be apparently dancing dance of savage delight at destruction be effecting yes said a laid down glass be undoubtedly house don esteban distinctly remember dona inez pointing out to while be out for walk about week ago at moment dona inez fully attired emerged from room there be instantly cordial interchange of salutation between visitor then turned to asked what be heard say just now don ricardo surely not that montpelier be in flame deeply regret to say that heard aright senora look yonder may see blaze for black be dancing round like so many demon answered dona inez clasped hand together wrung in distress oh don esteban dona christina be so sorry for exclaimed be horrible will be here next what do intend to do luis must really run away leave beautiful place to be destroyed ruined be there nothing can be done to save will not go so far a to say that answered don luis on contrary be strongly indisposed to abandon without struggle what say don ricardo turning to be fighting man do think house be capable of being defended successfully against armed undisciplined rabble of three hundred black that depends entirely upon how strong garrison can muster dear friend answered so far a house be concerned believe that given say couple of hour for preparation might be put into very excellent state of defence must be no good at unless must raise garrison of let say thirty fighting men at least a many non combatant to act a loader ambulance party so on thirty fighter thirty non combatant returned don luis surely that might be managed why boy number more than three hundred nine tenth of whom be born bred upon estate few of might possibly desert perhaps twenty five per cent of to put figure at very highest feel certain that bulk of must stand by through thick thin have everything to lose nothing to gain by going over to outlaw oh yes be convinced that there must be difficulty in matter of raising sufficient number of fighter so far then so good said next question be that of weapon firearm especially be afraid dear don luis will scarcely be able to raise thirty gun with adequate ammunition for same ah true answered don luis have not thought of still now let think moment may a well tell here cut in don esteban that although must not see way to defend montpelier successfully son have brought gun with of course will be available must decide to make stand defend house dear don esteban will need for own protection on way to to wherever propose to make for unless of course choose to throw in lot with must perhaps be scarcely more dangerous than attempt to reach one of town for news of rising will spread among negro like wildfire precisely cut in don esteban again be exactly own thought therefore if presence here will not embarrass will gladly remain take chance with dear don esteban exclaimed don luis let hasten to assure that nothing must possibly give greater satisfaction than to have assistance of two gallant son at critical juncture in fortune then be settled exclaimed breaking in rather ruthlessly be afraid upon don luis compliment for considered there be scant time just then that make three gun to start with now how many more can muster four of overseer have two gun while remaining two have one answered don luis of posse brace of good serviceable pistol in addition then a for must know dear don ricardo that firearm be rather weakness of mine whenever see especially good gun buy if can consequently have very fair selection in gun room probably about twenty in a well a few brace of pistol duelling otherwise oh be excellent exclaimed far better than dared expect a to ammunition think will find that have a much of a be at likely to need for always make point of keeping ample supply in stock answered don luis good answered next point to determine be identity of garrison first there be don esteban two son make three then there be five will six overseer fight think don luis oh yes without doubt answered don luis be most excellent fellow devoted to then so far muster eleven said want nineteen more fighter at least thirty good steady non fighter men who can be depended upon to retain coolness do exactly a be told during confusion excitement of fiercely contested fight now don luis can lay hand upon forty nine men of kind have indicated men who be trustworthy enough to be admitted inside wall at moment when treachery on part of one of must probably be fatal to don luis flushed looked almost angrily at a suggested possibility of treachery on part of of people really don ricardo exclaimed put a put almost make tremble at vastness of responsibility be about to undertake will see will at once go down to hut choose men bring up here for approval with shot at walked out at back door disappeared into darkness while don silvio at father request went out to lead horse round to stable bring in gun chapter seventeen attack on bella vista twenty five minute later don luis returned so colourless be lip so wild eye so dreadfully agitated entire appearance saw in moment something have gone very radically wrong somewhere dona inez saw too approaching laid hand soothingly upon arm a anxiously asked what be luis what be matter mi querido tell can bear must never have believed ejaculated don luis clasping hand in front of wringing in distress disappointment have always believed one of negro to be absolutely faithful to yet now upon news that outlaw be out more than half of have left quite possibly will hour two hence be joining in attack upon house ungrateful wretch precisely cut in be that more what about who remain be of trustworthy enough to be permitted to assist must do best can without oh answered don luis emphatically thank god can trust one of who remain a for forty nine whom have chosen to come into house to help well be going to demonstrate extent of faith in by placing life at mercy oh yes have shadow of doubt so far a be concerned very well then said in case have better be admitted at once for defence have still to be made what be going to do with who be not wanted have given instruction to go away conceal in wood until have beaten off attack answered don luis then will return help to put right damage may have be done during fight will thought very much doubt kept doubt to myself turned instead to matter next thing that have to consider be safety of lady said what be to be done with during fight don luis looked at rather blankly lady ejaculated surely dear don ricardo will be more safe in house than anywhere else will not depends answered if think must be safe for to start on horseback for nearest town alone escorted by few of most trusty of negro oh exclaimed dona inez dona christina in same breath must not propose anything of kind don ricardo will not be separated from husband if be to face danger will face danger with then don luis broke in altogether like suggestion that lady must attempt to make way to nearest town said for see have mean of knowing what be state of intervening country hour ago might have deemed suggestion excellent one now after shameless desertion of half own boy know not what to think suppose there be snug secret place of concealment such a cave something of sort existence of be known only to yourselves suggested very thing exclaimed don luis enthusiastically there be place existence locality be known to absolutely one dona inez be useless to speak of interrupted dona inez in tone of finality will not go there anywhere else remain here with luis if dona christina dona eugenia must like to go let do so by mean dona christina dona eugenia be quite a emphatic a hostess in determination not to be separated from men folk so that question be very soon settled after there be nothing to be done to call up black auxiliary put house in a efficient state of defence a mean at disposal permitted at once proceeded to do don luis seemed naturally to look to to take lead in warlike preparation a naturally did finding that have only very hazy notion of how to set to work in first place house be excellently adapted for defence outside wall being built of stone about two foot thick to keep out heat while roof be tiled there be consequently very little danger of place being set on fire from outside burnt out of chief weakness consisted in exceptionally large size of door window opening thought must see way to minimise evil while out walking with don luis wife have noticed spot remarked at time might be very easily converted into excellent sand gravel pit while only few day prior to eventful morning when don esteban de mendouca party have burst in upon with news of negro outbreak don luis have received large consignment of new sack destined to receive crop of coffee cocoa other product be at moment coming forward upon estate now moment that question of defending house be raised sack sand pit came into mind first thing did therefore be to get hold of six overseer instruct to organise into gang black who still remained on estate equip one party of with pick shovel set second party to bring sack from store a required third party to fill sack with gravel sand a excavated remainder to carry filled sack up to house on hand barrow arrange in door window opening under direction while be being done don luis produced stock of firearm ammunition then don esteban don pedro set to work to clean oil lock generally put weapon in reliable working order while don silvio aided by sister dona inez lighted fire in dining room went to work upon task of casting bullet for pistol proving upon examination that only very small stock of remained on hand lastly while mama elisa teresita busied in detached kitchen cooking ample supply of food for little garrison dona christina so far laid aside dignity a to prepare dining room table set for breakfast for day be by time breaking have decided that must be sound policy to snatch meal if possible before fight began scheme of defence consisted in blocking up door window opening throughout building with good substantial wall of sand bag leaving here there small loophole just wide enough to admit of musket being pointed through musketrymen must be stationed at loophole man having assistant who must stand by to pas fresh cartridge bullet a soon a weapon be discharged of course musketrymen assistant must be moved from room to room a required according to point against attack be most strongly directed considered that ought to stand very good chance of making effective defence because must be exceedingly difficult for assailant to force way into building so long a sand bag wall stood firmly believed must require more courage than negro possessed to charge home to overthrow in face of such fire a must direct upon from advantageous position must occupy moreover must posse important advantage of being almost completely protected from fire consequently must be able to take aim coolly collectedly while must be fully exposed there being better cover for than few scattered bush here there determined to remove must there be time after more important defence be complete at length after two hour of most strenuous work negro have ever performed in life have done everything that be possible to do so first stationing dozen of best men at various commanding point to act a picket give timely warning of approach of enemy went to breakfast most of with excellent appetite although be bound to admit that lady did not eat much when meal be over without news from picket went out through opening that have purposely left in front door barricade took good look round passing from picket to picket questioned man closely a to whether have seen sign of enemy replied in negative indeed although carefully scanned open space must see even examining with telescope not faintest indication of lurking danger must anywhere discover although montpelier be by time mere smouldering ruin to appearance utterly deserted be about to return to house to inquire whether after might not have taken too much for granted in assuming a certainty bella vista must be attacked when one of picket uttered shout raising hand pointed looked in direction indicated there sure enough beheld party of negro marching confidently toward house how many there be must not tell for be just then winding way through thick detached mass of scrub beyond boundary of estate confident manner of approach led to suppose that believed be quite strong enough to achieve easy conquest of place raising whistle to lip blew shrill call not only a warning to in house to be on qui vive also a signal for picket to fall back then when have made sure that latter be on run toward house brought telescope to bear upon approaching party with view of learning little more concerning equipment if possible number first thing impressed with regard to be that be remarkably fine stalwart looking set of men hard wiry full of endurance a indeed might be expected from history of have gathered by snatch from don luis during preparation that morning appeared that be practically runaway slave descendant of such who have made good escape from various plantation on island before slavery be abolished few year prior to date of story men have established in mountain fastness so difficult of approach so easy to defend that although attempt have often be made have be found impossible to dislodge in mountain fastness have increased multiplied prodigiously raising own cattle growing own corn supporting generally in state of comfort if not of actual luxury that to who have not seen seemed incredible to fled criminal for desperate character in island found welcome safe sanctuary among of course be outlaw hand against man man hand against of late be to say within year so of time of be now writing have adopted policy of sallying forth from mountain retreat at irregular interval attacking isolated plantation looting destroying building murdering carrying off captive white avowed intention being to terrorise drive white person off island make own although most of have be brought up in catholic religion be said that have reverted to heathenism be addicted to practice of voodooism snake worship other hideous barbaric rite although physique of men be good enough did not think very much of equipment appeared that about fourth man of carried firearm of kind with powder flask suspended by cord round neck bullet pouch attached to belt while remainder carried cutlass pike in case ax cane knife even scythe blade lashed to end of long pole having learned a much of approaching enemy a be possible for to ascertain without exposing to risk of capture by having retreat cut off retired in good order to house pausing at detached kitchen on way ordering mama elisa teresita to hasten at once to house with such provision a have be able to prepare waited until be fairly on way then set fire to place for be within about sixty yard of house must have afforded excellent cover for dozen sharpshooter who from shelter might have galled rather severely be flimsy structure wall built of wattle plastered with mud while roof be of thatch by time therefore reached house be blazing furiously quarter of hour later be mere heap of smouldering ash sight of blazing kitchen caused approaching outlaw to raise shout of triumph possibly be under impression that building have be fired by of negro belonging to estate who be about to join force with have already begun work of destruction when saw retiring toward house shout quickly changed note from triumph to anger several of who carried gun halted dropped on one knee proceeded to take pot shot at few of bullet came quite near indeed much too near to be pleasant bulk of flew wide made good retreat to house untouched be at once admitted by friend who immediately proceeded to block up with sand bag aperture by have entered moment that motley army of assailant came close enough to house to enable to see that have be put into state of defence halted dozen of clustered about immensely tall powerful looking negro who be attired in stained somewhat tattered uniform of spanish infantry colonel wore sword buckled about waist with pair of big horse pistol thrust into belt apparently be conferring together a to what be to be done under unexpected circumstance for now appeared that so completely have succeeded in terrorising white serious resistance to raid have practically become thing of past appearance among attacking force of big negro above mentioned seemed to fill don luis don esteban with consternation for recognised at once a chief of outlaw man with reputation for ruthless savagery have caused name to become word of terror among white on island only to be mentioned with bated breath be petion gasped don esteban in accent of dismay if must be so unfortunate a to fall into hand after resisting fate will be too dreadful for description must not be better suggested with quivering ashen lip that must surrender at discretion without attempting resistance if do so will probably be shot out of hand even must be preferable to being carried off into mountain there dying lingering death by torture a know that many other white have done who have dared to resist petion certainly not answered don luis with decision will never agree to young friend don ricardo here seems to be of opinion that house be capable of being defended effectively ought to know since fighting be trade suppose that mere fact of petion appearance among assailant be going to make alter opinion be don ricardo by mean said rather other way about for if can only contrive to bowl over mister petion don esteban uttered ejaculation of horror kill petion exclaimed good sir most fervently hope that one in house will be so ill advised a to attempt petion life for if anything be to happen to follower must be so incensed so utterly maddened with fury that must simply pull place down about ear drag out from among ruin to die death of unimaginable horror dear don esteban retorted do really believe that fellow will fight more courageously if leader happens to be slain because on contrary be firmly convinced that if head be destroyed body will also lose vitality very speedily collapse therefore for one will make point of honour to do best to kill petion if will only afford chance very strongly recommend that rest must do same if petion fall follower will very soon be discouraged yes yes quite agree with don ricardo exclaimed don luis nothing be so likely to discourage fellow a to see leader fall therefore let kill petion if can although be popularly believed to bear charmed life will need very much more potent charm than that be at likely to posse to stop bullet if can only get fair shot at exclaimed come gentleman let get back to post must watch move now may take unawares play very ugly trick dialogue have lasted le than five minute brief a be have outlasted consultation between petion lieutenant who be annoyed to find upon returning to point of observation have retired be now out of sight period of suspense lasting nearly ten minute now ensued at end of whistle sounded shrilly from somewhere at sound of whole band of outlaw numbering somewhere about four hundred suddenly broke cover with yell came charging down upon side of house firing a ran aim be not bad considering that none of paused to bring piece up to shoulder just pointed weapon in direction of house pulled trigger while still on run although heard several of bullet strike wall roof not one came through loophole penetrated to interior of house none of be hit next second irregular straggling sort of volley rattled out from house by way of reply must not see that anybody be penny worse for at least on side of house where be stationed so far a be concerned have not attempted to fire having made up mind must not pull trigger during fight until must be certain of making hit negro who have be told off to help in defence of window at be stationed have simply thrust musket through loophole blazed away apparently without taking trouble even to sight along barrel friend said digging savagely in rib of fellow be that aimed at of senor echoed in astonishment did not aim at one in particular simply fired piece believing that bullet must be certain to hit one just so retorted well be not at way to win fight for see bullet have hit one next time shoot aim straight at particular individual make sure that gun be pointing straight before pull trigger for example see that big man running straight toward man with scythe on end of pole well keep eye on for moment see what happens man in question be coming straight for window with intention probably of attempting to dislodge of sand bag force way into house be only about ten yard away when having carefully covered chest with two sight gently pressed trigger when smoke blew away fellow be lying motionless upon face twenty others who have be following have come to abrupt halt be gazing with indecision first at house next at cartridge quick whispered thrusting hand out behind small soft hand met mine thrusting cartridge between finger glancing hastily over shoulder in surprise saw that be teresita who have established a assistant next moment have bitten off end of cartridge poured powder down barrel thrust empty paper after by way of wad be ramming bullet home on top of then peeping through loophole a cocked lock saw that party of four of comrade have picked up stricken man be just about to carry away while others be in full retreat for clump of bush not very far away probably for purpose of securing cover while reloaded weapon four bearer however be still within easy range taking careful aim for moment caught one of fair between shoulder down went on top of man who be being carried away other three at once took to heel ran did not finally get away scot free for snatched now reloaded musket from assistant hand be lucky enough to bring one of down with shot in leg though be up limping away next instant there said to negro who be supposed to be helping see how be done very well see to friend that make more miss did not at least not very often meanwhile firing from other room have be proceeding pretty briskly though with what result so far a other three side of house be concerned must not tell have be fairly effective on side of building for in addition to three men for whom have accounted there be five motionless figure lying on grass within view of loophole while have seen others go staggering away palpably hit imagined that outlaw be somewhat disconcerted at finding so many gun in house have not very much stomach for fight wherein be possible that good many of might get very seriously hurt hitherto appeared utmost resistance have met with have amounted to nothing more formidable than few hasty ill aimed shot followed by immediate retreat of defending party adventure upon be now engaged be quite different matter here be good solidly built house constructed of material be scarcely possible to set fire to from outside well barricaded evidently full of resolute men quite determined to sell life dearly oh yes be quite different looked a though did not half like for having failed in first rush have now withdrawn out of range be apparently discussing new scheme of operation during pause visited other room in succession to see how occupant have be faring what measure of success have met with result of inspection be discovery that twenty seven of attacking party have lost that number of mess while nearly double a many have be more le seriously hurt in first rush be quite a good a must reasonably have be expected seemed fully to account for shyness enemy be now exhibiting stated what have happened at own window urged man individually to keep quite cool to take careful aim before pulling trigger then returned to post just in time to see sixty negro emerge from bush bearing trunk of palm tree have cut down be apparently about to employ a battering ram with to batter in of defence men in adjoining room saw at same moment instantly in spite of warning have so recently given two shot rang out from window at be stationed range however be too long nobody be hurt hurrying from own room into one from shot have come found that be occupied by one of overseer negro be engaged in giving a severe lecture a knowledge of spanish permitted when there be sudden call for hand from front of house rushing round saw that party of about hundred of enemy be charging across lawn in open order leaping from side to side a came in manner admirably adapted to render aim utterly ineffective man be crouching at loophole in room with barrel of piece projecting through even a entered one of piece spoke ineffectively man who fired be don pedro turned from loophole with savage execration at failure be not of slightest use to attempt to pick off at long range while be jumping about in fashion exclaimed wait until be so close that can make sure of then shoot to drop at twenty yard even ten five be just a effective a though bowled over at hundred a man fire let step aside make room for while be thus exhorting companion stepped to loophole have just be vacated by don pedro thrust muzzle of weapon through sighting along barrel there be individual coming toward jumping from side to side like rest first to right then to left watched for moment two noticed that spring of to left brought exactly in line with tall slender tree stem distance in rear therefore aimed straight for stem then waited until made next spring to left when pulled trigger down toppled almost at same instant three four other shot rang out proved sufficiently well aimed to reach mark few second later half dozen shot followed down went four more of charging negro effect be instantaneous at least half of halted in manifest indecision wheeled abruptly round fled only about dozen of boldest maintained rush quick discharge brought even to halt with loss of four of number while stood hesitating whether to advance retreat peppered again to manifest astonishment consternation possibly thought that with gun empty be reasonably safe for minute so whereupon turned fled leaving six of comrade prostrate on ground at moment cry from teresita sent with rush helter skelter to room have originally undertaken to defend here found critical state of affair indeed for while have be engaged in checking rush upon front of house party with palm tree battering ram have under cover of various patch of vegetation stolen up to within hundred yard of side be now manifestly preparing to make rush across open bearing battering ram with thanks however to teresita warning cry be just in good time to pour in brisk fire upon almost before have fairly started upon rush three four men went down throwing others into momentary confusion afforded opportunity to treat to second volley a second volley crashed out having reloaded weapon stepped forward to take place at loophole just vacated by one else a did so observed that whole party have be thrown into great confusion by second volley tree trunk having fallen to ground be dropped that however be not negro dressed in spanish infantry uniform have come to front be standing stock still with back toward house haranguing battering ram contingent apparently urging to pick up tree again make attempt opportunity be too good to be lost for be within long range be quite worth while to throw away shot on chance of hitting therefore levelled piece aiming steadily at imaginary point about two inch immediately above head feeling certain that with amount of elevation must get somewhere pulled trigger smoke of discharge obscured view for second two wild shout of triumph from in next room told that shot have be successful then a smoke drifted away saw fellow lying prone on ground with men standing staring at a though fascinated yet seemingly afraid to approach attempt to raise a stood still peering through loophole at scene empty piece be gently withdrawn from hand by one behind loaded one substituted for whereupon chose mark fired bringing that man down also second casualty at such long range seemed to galvanise party into sudden life for raising weapon poured in straggling irregular ineffective volley a though in obedience to order then turned raced for nearest cover followed by few dropping shot at least served to freshen way if did nothing else entire attacking party now took cover opened fire upon house at long range apparently possessed little skill in use of firearm for although few shot struck house not one of came anywhere near loophole one of garrison remained unscathed foe be amply strong enough to have carried building by assault have possessed courage resolution to charge across open right up to house tear down single one of barricade have already learned by experience that meant certain death to of while if report did not belie be ready enough to take life of others with accompaniment of most atrocious cruelty there be apparently none among willing to contribute to success of party by sacrificing own innocuous fusillade of house continued for nearly two hour during made pretence of reply except when individual in temporary access of courage attempted to slip across from one piece of cover to situated few yard nearer house when be immediately subjected to volley that laid low sent scuttling back like scared rabbit to former place of refuge chapter eighteen captured by negro outlaw at length about ten o'clock in forenoon fire of outlaw ceased for aught that must tell to contrary might have abandoned attack altogether retired situation be one of far too much peril to permit to take anything for granted while therefore main body of party so to speak seized opportunity thus afforded to snatch hasty much needed meal watcher with loaded weapon be stationed at door window of house with instruction to maintain sharp lookout immediately to report movement that might detect on part of enemy minute passed meal be concluded still everything remained tranquil so perfectly tranquil indeed that at length must come to one of two conclusion outlaw have withdrawn altogether be elaborating scheme for renewed attack of particularly deep cunning character of nature of behoved to secure hint of information by hook by crook suggested must go forth alone keeping well in open in order might be effectively covered by gun of others in event of anything in nature of treachery being attempted take look round in immediate neighbourhood of house endeavour to ascertain what outlaw be doing if have gone what have become of at first one must listen to suggestion be denounced a too utterly hazardous to be entertained for moment when pointed out that must only be hazardous if enemy still remained upon ground don silvio proposed by way of amendment that men must sally forth in body for mutual protection to must not agree arguing very reasonably think that if outlaw have departed must be a safe for to go forth a for whole of while if treachery happened to be safety of female portion of party absolutely depended upon men remaining in house ready to defend in event of renewed attack argument of mine coupled with necessity everybody at length recognised for to make move of sort finally prevailed about noon left house armed with musket brace of pistol loaded fortified by item of advice from of companion first act be to examine carefully body lay round about house taking lay nearest at hand then passing on to others result of examination be discovery that fallen numbered in sixty seven fourteen of whom be still alive so seriously injured that have be unable to withdraw to safety of cover inquired of of men what have become of companion be unable to answer must groan agua agua por amor de dios informed that must be supplied with water otherwise looked after a soon a have satisfied that friend have retired that further danger from be to be apprehended at same time reminded that must scarcely expect much consideration from people whom have so wantonly attacked when at length came to body of petion found that life be extinct fellow having be shot clean through heart be somewhat surprised that follower have made attempt to carry off body that have not done so took to be sign of pretty thorough demoralisation on part conducted examination of ground with utmost circumspection for knew not at what moment volley might rattle out at from one of large clump of ornamental shrub be scattered about here there upon lawn still larger mass of bamboo palmetto other wild vegetation at one particular spot be still allowed to flourish almost within musket shot of house nothing happened sign of enemy be to be discovered therefore at length came to conclusion that finding house be not to be captured except at sacrifice of very considerable number of life outlaw have withdrawn be now on way to attack estate owner of be incapable of making so resolute effective defence a ourselves began to wonder in direction assailant have gone remembering that much of effectiveness of defence of bella vista have be due to early warning given by don esteban de mendouca have afforded time to make necessary preparation occurred to that if route taken by outlaw must be determined might be possible to pas on warning so enable somebody else to prepare warm reception for therefore proceeded to examine ground carefully quartering now in direction now in other in search of mark sign must furnish with clue be search by mean barren of result for after time came to spot where guinea grass have be well trampled indicating to mind that be point where various division of attacking party including wounded have rallied from have begun retreat in belief be fully confirmed little later by finding that footmark led away in direction gradually trended round toward back of house past coffee plantation so back toward mountain now if have decided to retreat to mountain fastness there be need to trouble further about at least for moment in walk in same direction with don luis have noticed several path have be informed led to certain plantation in neighbourhood be of course quite possible that brigand might be making for one of therefore determined to follow up trail while be fresh endeavour to obtain definite clue to actual destination first idea be to return to house acquaint occupant with result of investigation thus far inform a to further plan then retrace step to spot where at moment stood reflected that to do meant loss of twenty minute more might make difference between success failure to plan so determined to push on at once immediately proceeded to do so have not proceeded very far before have conclusive evidence be on right track by coming upon wounded negro who lay fair in middle of path groaning piteously a clasped head swathed in blood stained bandage between hand asked if be badly hurt si senor answered hurt to death fear unless can obtain speedy help must walk farther companion have abandoned take to house pray senor let hurt be attended to will be horrible to die here alone in open moreover ant will find before long consider what fate will then be dreadful enough doubt if man be a bad a considered to be did not believe be for though voice seemed feeble enough when began to speak distinctly gained in strength a went on very speedily came to conclusion that weakness be more than half imaginary also be not very greatly disposed to be tender hearted over suffering of such fiend a negro outlaw have proved to be instead therefore of responding to appeal asked curtly way have companion gone straight up toward mountain answered pointing upward along path in be standing very well said be necessary must verify statement be therefore going on little farther will soon be back will then help to house have wound attended to although will avail little for warn that rest of wounded will be handed over to authority forthwith mean for death upon gallows fellow grunted even will be le disagreeable than being devoured alive by ant answered without bandying further word with continued way up path took rather sharp turn few yard farther on a rounded bend be somewhat surprised to see two more men lying in road one of whom seemed to be either dead in swoon while other appeared to be almost in state of collapse inhuman villain thought to abandon wounded in heartless fashion surely might have somehow made shift to carry off injured comrade with for must be fully aware that if unfortunate wretch fall into hand of authority will meet with short shrift well seem to have punished rather more severely than have thought must not be very greatly surprised if find few more poor beggar in same plight before have finished walk with thought uppermost in mind approached prostrate figure one of whom be moaning most piteously while other lay still with half closed eye staring upward at sky well picaro said to man who be moaning what be matter with oh senor gasped for love of god help to get into shadow of yonder bush be perishing of thirst scorching sun be adding to torment if will raise to knee perhaps can manage to crawl to ah good have quick jose help be strong a horse so be right now kneel upon while lash wrist together miguel a man have left in road minute before came running up take gun pistol will be safer in hand than in surprise be perfectly managed completely taken off guard by admirably assumed helplessness of three scoundrel be easily captured for a incautiously laid down gun for moment to place hand under arm of moaning hypocrite who have begged to assist rascal flung arm leg round pinning in grip for moment held helpless dragged to ground rolling over on top of while other springing with equal suddenness into vigorous life activity also flung upon held face downward in sandy soil while comrade swiftly bound hand behind back with long silken sash have rapidly unwound from waist while be doing up came third man who have be so dreadfully afraid of being devoured alive by ant took possession of weapon now when be too late truth dawned upon villain far from being seriously hurt be a sound a be have simply be left behind in feigned helplessness upon off chance that one of white might incautiously venture out a have done with object of ascertaining where retreating brigand be actually going thus be captured oh how execrated folly now that be too late be being hurried along rough path by jubilant trio who have captured who be in great hurry to rejoin main body of outlaw how fervently hoped prayed that none of rest of white at bella vista might be a foolish a have be thought went back to wounded men lying scattered here there round house within musket shot of for moment soul sickened with dread a thought of what might happen if too be merely shamming fear be only momentary remembered that hurt of one of be visibly indisputably real serious enough to disable render harmless hoped that failure to return must put whole household upon guard by demonstrating to imprudence open eye to fact that danger be not necessarily over because brigand have withdrawn companion be in high feather at having achieved capture extolled shrewdness of certain mateo who gathered from remark be new chief in place of deceased petion in having devised so ingenious trap a one into have unsuspectingly fallen moreover endeavoured to beguile way by drawing vivid word picture presumably in hope of frightening enjoying terror of unspeakable torment must be inflicted upon by way of appeasing mane of of comrade who have fallen in attack upon house truly might very well have be excused have blenched at prospect according to lay before for if be to be believed be not hour two several day of excruciating suffering might expect however did not by mean believe that said might be clever enough actor so far a shamming being wounded be concerned in finer art of inflicting suffering in anticipation be mere clumsy bungler for lacked that finer sense of dissimulation endows man with power of lying with conviction allowed motive to become apparent seeing disappointed by laughing in face besides whether what said be truth falsehood be not going to afford trio of sable outlaw satisfaction of boasting that have succeeded in frightening englishman enlivening way with such conversation a have hinted at trudged along upward path for distance of about mile half when suddenly came upon wide open space where main body of outlaw have halted to rest refresh also a soon became aware by trend of general conversation to determine whether must return to head quarter proceed to attack other estate in immediate neighbourhood appearance in character of prisoner be signal for great yell of ferocious delight on part of outlaw immediately followed by brisk fusillade of scurrilous ribald jest concerning sport that must have with upon return to mountain stronghold so bloodcurdling be suggestion thrown out by of fiend confess qualm of fear surged over for second two for saw at once that unlike captor ruffian be not endeavouring merely to frighten be in deadly earnest not that feared death man who ever knew must dub coward in heat of battle under most ordinary circumstance can face death ay have faced hundred time without tremor to be triced up helpless to have one strength sapped one life slowly drained away by long drawn out succession of unspeakable torment be prospect venture to say few can bring to face without manifestation of discomposure although cheek lip may have blanched for moment permitted further greater sign of fear to escape returned glance of fiendish ferocity with unquailing eye listened to diabolical jest in apparently unruffled silence a be conducted through rank by captor toward

perverse influence altogether beyond control seemed to urge to speak a did whether must strangest circumstance of word instead of evoking from questioner white hot explosion of wrath fully expected seemed to gratify man rather than otherwise for grinned appreciation a gazed into flashing eye then thought seemed to suddenly strike be picked up floating upon piece of wreckage say remarked now wonder whether by chance that piece of wreckage happened to belong to british man o ' war schooner engaged pirate schooner few mile in offing about month two ago did answered belonged to britannic majesty schooner wasp foundered in gale sprang up immediately after engagement commander be so far a know only person saved commander reiterated incredulously why be only boy nevertheless what have told be truth answered fellow sat considering statement for so long time began to wonder whether perchance be destined to affect fate in way at length however appeared to have arrived at decision for drawing greasy notebook from one pocket stub of pencil from proceeded with much labour to indite communication of kind upon when completed folded in peculiar way handed to carlos at same time giving in tongue with have acquaintance what took to be certain instruction nature of communication may have be appeared to meet with carlos ' emphatic disapproval for began to argue strenuously with other argument lasting ten minute rapidly growing more heated until finally something be said that apparently convinced of futility of further dispute on part then suddenly desisted seizing by arm dragged away to spot where be somewhat isolated from rest of camp where left in charge of companion jose miguel while went off elsewhere absence however be of brief duration for presently returned followed by two other negro who bore in large calabash ample supply of boiled rice roasted yam substantial portion of roast goat mutton deposited on ground within easy reach of before departed left to ourselves a soon a have gone fairly out of ear shot carlos turned to pointing to provision said a released from bond help eat freely senor englishman for have long march before be likely to again see decent meal indeed exclaimed be camp head quarter call so far off then a must seem to imply be not going to head quarter replied rather tartly may thank good god that be so for whatever may be mode of death may accept assurance that will not be anything like so protracted unpleasant a awaited among mountain yonder well said that at least be good hearing if be not going to head quarter pray where be going order from mateo new chief whose beauty doubtless impressed replied with grin be to conduct down to coast deliver over to very good friend manuel garcia pirate whose schooner tiburon crew punished so severely when according to own admission mind engaged little time ago mateo be under impression that garcia must be peculiarly gratified to find in power officer who commanded schooner mauled tiburon so severely so a have confessed that be man have decided to make present of to friend to take risk of rumpus will certainly arise when band learns that be not to have pleasure of amusing with how far be friend garcia lair from here demanded not very far be answer will take until close upon sunset to do distance because mateo prefers that must not start until rest of band be on move fear that if be seen going toward sea instead of up into mountain of lamb might begin to ask awkward question insist upon accompanying therefore if feel at tired have better avail yourself of present opportunity to snatch little sleep a matter of fact did not feel in least tired wanted opportunity to think quietly over change in prospect therefore gladly accepted suggestion made by carlos stretching out beneath shade of adjacent clump of bush closed eye before knew be fast asleep be awakened by sound of many voice stir of many foot sat up to see that whole band of marauder be in motion ten minute later there be nothing to betray presence save cloud of dun coloured dust rising into air over top of bush appeared to however that instead of wending way toward mountain be bearing away in westerly direction toward spot where at distance of eight ten mile knew group of extensive prosperous plantation existed a soon a last of straggler have vanished carlos rose to foot said now senor englishman if be sufficiently rested will be moving because if must be noticed that be not among of people might return to look for must be very bad indeed for if must do find be quite ready answered a sprang to foot in minute little party also consisting of carlos jose miguel have disappeared from scene way lay in precisely opposite direction to taken by raider be to say while marched toward west followed narrow winding footpath that if must be said to have definite direction at trended toward east for three hour trudged steadily onward carlos with one of pistol in belt in addition to own weapon walking on one side of with jose similarly equipped on other while miguel with gun upon shoulder brought up rear for several mile traversed lower slope of range winding hither thither steadily working way eastward now passing over sterile rocky ground sparsely dotted here there with clump of thorny scrub anon opening out glorious prospect of gently undulating fertile country dotted with plantation smoke blackened roofless wall of of mansion built on clearly suggesting recent visit from late petion fellow outlaw beyond grand old ocean blue save where darkened by drifting cloud shadow flecked here there with white from scourging of trade wind at length however when sun have declined to within span length of western horizon bore away sharply toward north presently came in sight of indentation in coast at first glimpse have appearance of being land locked a approached more closely saw be really nearly circular bay about mile in diameter entrance of be most effectively masked by small islet stretching completely across leaving only two narrow passage one to east other to west of small felucca lay at cable length from shore when at length reached lip of basin like depression bottom of formed bay cove rather perceived to amazement that sort of village of quite respectable extent have be built along southern margin of building being so large that at once set down a storehouse number of people be moving about building quite dozen boat be hauled up on beach above high water mark now noticed very remarkable peculiarity in connection with cove side of basin wherein lay consisted everywhere of perfectly vertical cliff two hundred foot high so look where must must at first discover way down into looking little closer however presently became aware of exceedingly narrow dangerous zigzag path traversing cliff face about quarter of mile farther on toward at once made way quarter of hour later having first encountered sentry at upper end of path to whom carlos whispered password must not catch found safely at base of cliff at extreme end of village arrived here directed step toward most important looking house in place at door of carlos knocked ancient frosty headed negro responded to knock in reply to carlos question stated that don manuel garcia be at moment away in schooner that senor fernandez be a usual in charge of settlement possibly might do a well to suggestion carlos assented whereupon be ushered into large bare room furnished in such manner a to suggest idea that be chiefly used a council chamber door be shut upon chapter nineteen in pirate stronghold here waited nearly hour at conclusion of door at upper end of chamber opened tall rather good looking man dressed entirely in white entered at appearance carlos sprang to foot saluting handed over note mateo have scrawled stranger who be none other than don victor fernandez captain manuel garcia second in command took note read glanced at curiously then nodded curtly to carlos companion good ejaculated captain will highly appreciate thoughtfulness of new chief mateo in sending englishman in name desire to tender warmest thanks to mateo request to convey with expression of highest consideration do leave to night will remain until morning if latter mille gracias senor answered carlos must greatly like to stay here for night rest for day have be exceptionally trying fatiguing one for be instruction that must rejoin at earliest possible moment be imperative must not be neglected if may be permitted to stay long enough to share people supper will gladly do so so be answered fernandez find pacheco tell that will sup in great hall with rest of hand then request to come to whereupon carlos two fellow cut throat saluted retired for minute two after departure of trio fernandez sat meditatively regarding in silence twisting turning mateo note in finger meanwhile at length with just ghost of smile flickering over feature said tapping note in hand worthy mateo tell that be officer in command of little schooner gave tiburon severe dressing down little while ago be that really fact yes answered be proud to say that be well returned can scarcely credit why be only boy so people be constantly reminding retorted in british navy boy soon learn to do men work so must appear assented interlocutor apparently in nowise offended at brusque method of answering be englishman of course what be name told well senor delamere said be perhaps lucky thing for captain garcia went to sea four day ago in refitted tiburon that may possibly not return for nearly month have be here at moment for instant believe that must have given chance be going to offer for have vowed that if ever can lay hand upon will make such example of a will strike terror to heart of enemy of course sympathise with to great extent for have never in life have trouncing a gave with ridiculous little schooner of yours apart from other consideration self love have be very severely wounded therefore being man who never forgets forgives injury will not be satisfied until have salved wounded pride by making pay in full in manner will cause sailor in west indian water to shudder with horror be not vindictive a be be always willing to subordinate revenge to good of community by of course mean community little republic at present be bounded by cliff enclose cove in process of time be destined to include whole of magnificent island of hayti who know possibly entire group of island now known a west indie young a be have proved to be formidable enemy have courage resolution apparently other quality go to making of successful leader therefore think thousand pity that must be wasted uselessly expended in mere gratification of petty revenge will benefit nobody anything on contrary be convinced that must gain immensely by making one of nay interrupt please hear to end before attempt to reply in absence of garcia be supreme here can secure election a member of band once member be absolutely safe from garcia for be one of rule of brotherhood that one be for be for one ' private jealousy animosity be absolutely forbidden punishment for transgressing law be death let offender be who will now be one argument in favour of joining there be others be weak a yet be true be because a community be still very young be however gaining strength almost daily capture make add to number because give prisoner choice between joining death nine of ten choose former also be rapidly accumulating wealth be power with power unlimited wealth will give added to power of constantly increasing number thing be possible to even to conquest of world now lad of intelligence ought to be able to see without much persuasion how tremendous advantage will be to belong to formidable band a will soon become therefore put to in nutshell will join upon discovering direction in companion argument be trending first impulse have be to interrupt indignantly by declaring that saw through purpose must have naught to do with must not permit to do insisted upon saying say to end while be doing have time for reflection perceived that man be enthusiastic visionary possessed of such boundless ambition that be able to see nothing except impossible goal fellow leader have set before saw that fellow fernandez at event have dwelt upon mad scheme of conquest first of hayti then of west indian island ultimately a have declared of whole world until have become obsession with in difficulty be swept away gorgeous dream have seemed to be thing already almost within reach occurred to that by pretending to listen to dreamer to appear to treat dream a though be possible for to eventually materialise to seem to weigh proposal seriously have made to might gain time enough to mature plan of escape to put into effect before return of tiburon arch enemy garcia while a general rule most emphatically disapprove of everything that savour of deception felt that taking circumstance of case into consideration must be perfectly justified in practising such dissimulation a might be necessary to extricate from exceedingly awkward situation in now found therefore when with eye ablaze with enthusiasm fernandez flashed question at will join hesitated just for second two then replied suppose hardly expect to answer offhand so momentous question a do be very well of course for who have given matter much careful thought to feel so confident a do plan be capable of realisation with be very different entire idea be absolutely new to if may be permitted to say so look little short of chimerical be not chimerical fernandez impatiently insisted on contrary be perfectly feasible a have planned absolutely certain of realisation there be need for to repeat at length argument that man adduced in support of contention let suffice to say listened to with deep attention for wanted to learn a many particular a possibly must concerning plan of extraordinary band with view to future contingency when at length left presence believe also left under impression that have more than half convinced of advisability of acceding to proposal meanwhile man pacheco in obedience to command conveyed through carlos have be patiently waiting in antechamber for summons to appear receive command of fernandez concerning now interview being at end former be called into room pacheco said fernandez young gentleman be senor delamere officer who commanded small british man o ' war schooner lately attacked tiburon vessel foundered in gale sprang up immediately after action contrived somehow to make way to shore where be nursed back to health strength in hacienda of bella vista belonging to senor don luis calderon y albuquerque that hacienda be attacked by petion band in early hour of morning a carlos have doubtless already told petion be killed during attack while senor delamere subsequently fell into hand of mateo petion second in command who very thoughtfully sent on to now senor delamere being although still very young naval officer of considerable experience undoubted courage will be acquisition of utmost value to if can succeed in inducing to join have hope very great hope of doing so therefore want to take in charge for present showing utmost consideration allowing free range of settlement since will be impossible for to escape because desire to become thoroughly acquainted with resource to see for perfection of arrangement for securing success of great enterprise must scarcely believe ear when heard fernandez give extraordinary a deemed most imprudent order seemed too good to be true why if foolish man have known there be nothing must possibly have more ardently wished for than liberty to range freely settlement become fully acquainted with resource if have ever dreamed of such possibility a must not have needed must be brought prisoner to place must have be too eager to make way to voluntarily of course be much better a be for now have to do be to keep eye ear wide open learn everything possibly must generally make very best use of time before return of garcia while humouring fernandez to top of bent in delusion that must ultimately convince of advantage of joining band moreover believed must not have much difficulty in accomplishing last for although be at first somewhat at loss to understand great eagerness to secure a recruit became perfectly intelligible when learned little later on that only weak point in entire scheme consisted in extreme scarcity of trained sailor capable of undertaking more important executive duty seaman of kind to be found in ship forecastle possessed not exactly in abundance sufficient for ordinary necessity appeared that apart from garcia first lieutenant one other have not single navigator among be easy to understand that if anything untoward must happen to of men activity of brotherhood must be seriously crippled while fatality swept whole of away might well mean utter ruin of hope did not learn quite at once for seemed to be one item of information upon fernandez desired to remain ignorant mingling freely with everybody a be permitted to do be impossible for to prevent secret from ultimately leaking out have not be in settlement more than three day before became acquainted with with good many other thing a well for instance learned that of three navigator community boasted two namely garcia be on board tiburon while third be in command of most respectable looking brig provided with complete set of false paper be engaged in conveying to various port such portion of cargo of plundered ship a be not needed by pirate disposing of same for cash procuring with cash such commodity a be required from time to time felucca lay at anchor in bay have also be similarly employed be now idle man who have commanded being with garcia in tiburon in place of officer who have be killed in action with wasp at time of arrival extraordinary pirate settlement community consisted of forty seaman of various nationality except englishman who have thrown in lot with garcia fernandez rest about hundred others who although not seaman be most useful for performance of such strictly shore duty a erection of house loading discharging of trading brig storage of various commodity needed by community working up of rough spar into spare mast yard boom etcetera for brig schooner making of spare sail for same in short execution of multitudinous kind of work be essential to comfort of man in civilised condition exceedingly comfortable rascal made for house be well built in many case beautifully furnished also enjoyed many luxury procured from cargo of plundered ship purchased out of proceeds of sale of such plunder a did not require for own use be not long before discovered that there be mystery of sort attaching to felucca lay at anchor in bay have made more than one attempt to go on board with object of giving overhaul attempt have be quietly met frustrated in such way soon grew to understand must not persist further without exciting grave suspicion be one thing of others that most desired to avoid for be felucca regarded a only possible mean of escape from pirate that being case be of utmost importance must hing to betray thought lurked at back of mind be fine sturdy looking little craft measuring somewhere about sixty ton felt that if must once get aboard get enough sail hoisted to take out to sea most difficult part of adventure must be over for jamaica lay to leeward must not very well lose way even if be compelled to go to sea without chart be true that rig of felucca namely single latteen sail head stretched along enormously long tapering yard hoisted to top of stout stumpy mast raking well forward be not precisely rig must willingly choose to go to sea alone with beggar must not be chooser seemed to to be hobson choice that nothing must therefore make up mind to face difficulty of rig do best must with remain until garcia return so miss only chance of course there be just bare possibility might find man even two three willing to share adventure with for must scarcely believe that member of community have quite willingly joined without compulsion of kind have intention of jeopardising chance of success by making inquiry of however cautious character if such men be to be found must have to be almost by pure accident meanwhile be for to make plan in manner that if necessary must be carried out single handed be imperative must visit felucca by hook by crook since have already discovered that must not be managed during day there be nothing for to make attempt at night now be in pacheco charge be responsible for although be nominally free to come go a must be not long before discovered that be practically impossible for to get out of sight for more than five ten minute at time except at night time when be granted privilege of small room to myself in house even then for first week of sojourn must scarcely stir in bed at creaking of must be at door inquiring why be moving whether required anything questioning being fancied simply for purpose of assuring be still in room a day rather night went on vigilance gradually relaxed for so shaped speech a to convey impression at least in own mind have practically decided to join band be perhaps so far threw off guard a to betray on certain night into indulgence of favourite vice be too marked devotion to rum bottle for several night in succession ever since have be placed in charge in fact have be perforce compelled to remain perfectly sober in order that might keep strict watch upon at length when while be sitting at table together taking supper allowed to believe have finally decided to go to fernandez next morning take oath ventured to celebrate conversion by drinking health in stiff nor'wester of rum water rather more rum than water that act of weakness be undoing for at first taste of spirit after forced abstention completely lost control of must no more refrain from taking second tumbler than must have flown second naturally led to third third to fourth whereupon recognising that chance be at hand yawned twice thrice most portentously complained of fatigue retired to room following a far a door locking in a be custom before going to own room that troubled not whit for house be of one story only to slip out of by way of open window be almost a easy a walking out through door once gaoler became so deeply wrapped in sleep that stealthy movement must not awake moved quite carelessly about room for minute two then flung heavily upon bed fully dressed a did so heard pacheco go tiptoeing clumsily back to table stumbling against chair on way muttering imprecation at own clumsiness a went further gurgling of liquor being poured into glass followed then deep sigh of satisfaction a glass be emptied bang of a be noisily replaced on table finally man staggering footstep along floor a made way to own room then came kicking off of shoe followed by other sound indicative of fact that be undressing heavy creaking of bedstead a flung upon minute two later deep snoring be still much too early for to think of making move for sound reached from outside told that number of people be still up about therefore waited with such patience a must muster until have ceased then allowed something like half hour to elapse in order to make sure for be case where be better to be hour late than minute too early by undue haste spoil everything at length however complete absence of sound suggestive of human movement outside steady regular resonant snore of pacheco in next room encouraged to make preliminary move did by rising slowly with infinite caution to sitting position on bed done next got off bed altogether not however without causing thing to give forth sundry most alarming creak of brought heart into mouth snoring in next room went on steadily without pause break two minute later found standing barefooted outside window ready to scramble back into room upon first suggestion of danger nothing happened however with shoe in hand next proceeded to creep very cautiously round to front of house night be clear with moon sky be brilliant with star affording even more light than really wanted at length having peered cautiously round noted that building be dark showing that inhabitant have retired to rest stole slowly crouching across open so down to beach among boat drawn up on sand there be small norwegian boat much used a dinghy consequently not drawn a far up on beach a others be craft be on lookout for by by found half afloat secured by painter to small anchor dug well into sand lifting anchor with utmost care noiselessly deposited in bow then making sure that oar be in lifted bow slid off sand until be fairly afloat when gently turned round gave vigorous push scrambled in over stern taking care to do everything without noise then throwing out oar over stern headed boat in direction of scarcely visible felucca proceeded to scull off to thus far everything have gone smoothly without ghost of hitch really difficult part of enterprise be still to come estimated that good four hundred mile lay between cove port royal harbour distance at average speed of six knot must take best part of three day night to cover under most favourable condition to do must need food water have not most remote idea whether be to be found on board felucca although hoped might be for have seen dozen men go off to regularly day for purpose must not divine unless perchance be to pump out food water be absolutely necessary to ensure success unless must find at least sufficiency to last three day must return take measure to provide supply for to start without must be simply courting disaster that however be point must only be settled upon arrival on board taking matter very easily husbanding strength for exceedingly difficult task of getting felucca under way single handed in event of thing conspiring to render decided step justifiable sculling so gently that scarcely raised ripple on highly phosphorescent water at length glided quietly up alongside felucca taking end of boat painter with climbed in over vessel low bulwark passed dinghy astern made fast forthwith proceeded to overhaul craft have thus surreptitiously visited first visit be to tiny cabin companion door of found unlocked when got below be so intensely dark must see nothing felt that at cost must have light must be morning flight must be discovered long before must learn wanted to ascertain therefore went on deck again loosed immense sail spread fold of over small skylight in order to mask light in cabin must be fortunate enough to obtain one then went forward to forecastle to hunt for lantern of sort found fore scuttle not only closed also secured by stout iron bar slotted end of be passed over staple secured by padlock fortunately however individual who have last visited little vessel have be too careless too lazy to remove key from lock therefore have to do be to turn key remove padlock from staple throw back bar lift off cover way down into forecastle be clear have sooner lifted off hatch cover be preparing to descend than to utter consternation became aware of fact that forecastle be inhabited for a flung leg in over coaming distinctly heard sound of stirring followed to amazement by drowsy muttering of voice in english grumbling what blaze do want now who come off here at time o ' night time to turn out yet will swear for seem to have be asleep more 'n five minute english then speaker must certainly be friend without more ado dropped down into little forecastle exclaiming hillo there who be friend what dickens be doing locked up here in forecastle who be retorted voice why be englishman name tom brown name of mate here be joe cutler of late of britannic majesty schooner wasp what foundered in gale o wind somewhere off here coast while since be picked up off bit of wreckage by crew of here hooker what turned out to be something in piratical line brought into harbour since have be here have be made to work like nigger because must jine brotherhood a call theirselves latterly have be kept aboard here feluccer because appears that there be chap ashore there a want to see ay if come to perhaps be chap seems to a have heard voice before who be at gov'nor name be delamere replied commanded of course of course interrupted brown mr delamere be knowed that knowed that voice of yours sir here joe rouse bitt man here be skipper come to life again minute sir will have light joe lighted glim last what did ye do wi tinder box two men be broad awake out of bunk bustling about almost before one must draw breath next moment have lighted lantern in dim glimmer of stood up side by side saluting a stared into face scarcely able to credit stupendous piece of good fortune a unexpected discovery of two men not only englishman actually member of own late crew lad exclaimed a stood before at attention be more glad than can express not only to find that like have managed to escape with life also that be here aboard felucca for fully intended to make somewhat desperate attempt to escape in single handed presence of two men put very different complexion upon affair what might have be wholly unable to accomplish alone three can together manage with ease there be only one possible difficulty in way can tell whether there happens to be food water aboard craft yes sir answered brown there be for be fed day out of ship store there be scuttle butt on deck nearly full o water there be grub down in lazarette how much know then let go at once ascertain said for escape may be discovered at moment naturally must be where must first look for mask that lantern with jacket one of bring along aft second be now of importance to took few minute to penetrate to little vessel lazarette where found ample supply of provision of kind for much larger crew than ourselves much longer voyage than contemplated very well remarked a ran eye over array of biscuit flour barrel cask of be branded prime mess beef while others contained potato sundry other commodity will do will certainly not starve during next few day else may happen to now clap on hatch again will go on deck slip cable make sail without further ado chapter twenty beginning of end a turned to quit cabin suddenly became aware that bell be furiously jangling somewhere dashing up companion ladder to deck discovered that sound proceeded from shore where light be beginning to flash one after other in rapid succession until whole settlement appeared to be awake stirring on deck of at once shouted sending voice down through open companion never mind about hatch leave everything a be for moment clap on to main halliard there be alarm of sort ashore if happens to be that have discovered to be missing will come off to felucca first thing yes by jove if be not mistaken there be boat shoving off already look lad a two men came tumbling up on deck be that not sparkle of oar in water there right in heart of deep shadow ay sir do look uncommon like mistake yes be sea fire shinin ' to stroke of oar right enough exclaimed cutler be comin ' along a though meant business too mr delamere 'd be good plan sir if be to jump for'ard cast that cable off bitt while tom here see about mastheadin ' here yard there wo be so very much room to spare atween by time that here hooker paid off gathered way be right joe there will not answered dashing forward to windlass bitt proceeded to throw off turn after turn of stiff hempen cable held felucca to anchor until last turn be gone flake went writhing twisting out through hawse hole then a end disappeared with splash dashed aft rammed tiller hard over to port noticing a did so that large boat pulling eight oar be le than hundred fathom distant from coming up to hand over hand then catching turn of main sheet round cleat jumped forward again to where two seaman be dragging desperately at halliard hoisted heavy sail put back into men cried a tailed on to fall of tackle there be large boat close aboard of will be touch go ' with even if be able to scrape clear at fiercely dragged at fall of fourfold tackle formed working end of halliard at pull great heavy swaying yard slid few inch up short thick mast a though reluctantly while away on weather quarter heard fierce shout of men in approaching boat a encouraged other punctuated by quick jerk of oar in rowlock swish of water a oar blade clipped into with passage of second menacing sound drew appreciably nearer dominating even thunderous rustle slatting of sail slowly climbed into air over head while felucca now fast gathering stern way at same time paying off be driving steadily down toward boat at rate seemed to render capture inevitable at length with final jerk made little craft tremble to keel big single sail filled felucca careened to bearing a canvas caught full pressure of wind at same instant heard oar blade clatter a be hastily laid in exultant cheer arise from immediately under counter catch turn with halliard quick then lay aft gasped villain be alongside will be in over quarter before can do anything to prevent if be not smart a spoke passed rope under then over belaying pin before surrendering to cutler to complete operation of belaying then bounded aft followed by tom brown who have snatched handspike from rack a passed first act be to drag tiller over to windward pas turn of tiller rope round head of to help felucca to pay off for be now gathering headway then sprang to taffrail looked over pursuing boat have actually overtaken man who pulled bow having laid in oar have grabbed gunwale of small boat in have come off from shore have dropped astern upon boarding felucca be now hauling own boat up alongside while half dozen of companion have risen to foot be scrambling into smaller boat apparently with idea of climbing aboard by shinning up painter felucca have by time gathered way be moving so fast through water that be a much a man must do to hold on quite beyond power to haul one boat closer to other for couple of breathless second longer hung on desperately then with yell of savage disappointment be obliged to let go while somebody in stern fancy must have be fernandez seeing how thing be going shouted to crew to throw out oar again give way before must be done big boat be dozen fathom astern be leaving so rapidly that for to overtake be manifest impossibility meanwhile small boat with six men in be towing astern of felucca with nose raised high in air water bubbling boiling up to level of top of transom even slopping in over occasionally so that be impossible for of occupant to move lest by so doing must cause to fill swamp said occupant therefore did what must in way of relieving feeling by vigorously anathematising in good sonorous spanish explaining in short pithy sentence sort of treatment that might confidently look for when next got into power then one of happened to remember that time brace of loaded pistol be sticking in belt whereupon whipped out blazed away at companion promptly following suit luckily without doing slightest injury by time felucca be rapidly nearing weathermost extremity of island guarded masked entrance of bay presently weathered handsomely bore up to pas out to sea gliding between two head minute later be now fairly outside with first plunge of little vessel sharp stem into surge met a swept into open sea yell of dismay arose from occupant of boat astern who cried out that be being swamped implored for love of saint to cast off before be washed out drowned must not resist temptation to retort that even if happened must still be getting le than desert then adding that hoped must soon have pleasure of seeing hanged at gallows point cast off painter set adrift leaving to get back into cove a best must with only one pair of small oar among stood on close hauled until have gained offing of about three mile when put helm down tacked lay to being intention to remain off entrance of pirate cove until daylight in order might obtain bearing landmark must enable to identify locality of spot upon return to destroy settlement a be determined to do be well that took precaution for when daylight came found that so admirably have nature masked cove be impossible for to discover until again stood close in even then must by mean make sure of spot until be within cable length of then however by mean of carefully taken set of compass bearing obtained mean must enable to run in from distance hit off place with unerring precision duly arrived in port royal harbour early on fourth morning after escape from pirate cove a by common consent called passage being of perfectly uneventful character a may be supposed kept sharp lookout for arrival of admiral from kingston moment that barge hove in sight hailed shore boat felucca not possessing boat of kind landed for purpose of making report be surprised at same time very pleased to see shaking warmly by hand a office messenger closed door behind after showing into presence well youngster exclaimed be very glad to see back again alive kicking for to tell truth have be absent so long that have given wasp up for lost well what luck have have strange that did not notice little schooner at anchor a came down for have be on lookout for now long while ah replied be grieved to say sir peter that will never again set eye on wasp for lie at bottom of sea of hayti with crew be afraid save two others tut tut tut exclaimed admiral be bad news indeed tell how happened a briefly a possible related entire history of cruise including adventure upon island of hayti escape from pirate winding up by pointing out felucca lay in full view of office window old gentleman remained silent sunk in deep thought for several minute after have concluded story shaking head occasionally a thought matter over at length however looked up said be sad business very sad losing poor fellow blame boy in least did what must did very well too to fight beat off so immensely superior force a of pirate be very creditable feat consider might have be well have not be for gale springing up at so inopportune moment well well can not be helped thing happen sometimes in spite of that can do there be generally lesson to be learned from mishap if will look for lesson conveyed in case be that made mistake in arming of wasp instead of fitting with six long pounder ought to have mounted long long upon deck then must have be able to play game of long bowl with pirate fight upon practically equal term a be be badly peppered before must reach at with own gun well can not now be helped little hooker be gone there be end of now thing to consider be what be next to be done what be own idea have be among rascal know strength suppose have sort of notion of how can best be circumvented eh yes sir said seems to that there be two way of dealing with pirate one way be to waylay schooner at sea capture then go into cove destroy settlement to do effectively must have vessel a fast a heavily armed a strongly manned a own craft happen to posse just now worse luck cut in admiral what be other plan explained alternative scheme regarded a more effective of two in pretty full detail a unfolded saw old gentleman eye begin to sparkle when at length came to end dashed fist down upon table exclaimed with enthusiasm be plan boy ought to do trick have vessel to spare so will have to take felucca do best can with strictly speaking know ought to put under arrest not employ again until after have be tried for loss of wasp circumstance be such that can not afford to waste time in mere formality just now will take responsibility of sending to sea again at once will be bit crowded aboard little hooker be afraid ca be helped if go well ought not to be for long now go find carline talk over matter with then come up to pen to dinner to night seven o'clock sharp report to what have arranged took hint went very well pleased on whole with result of interview for must confess that have gone to interview not altogether without trepidation be quite possible have told that admiral might find fault with manner in have engaged pirate schooner might have picked hole in tactic something of sort might even have considered that wasp might have be saved after fight have acted otherwise than did to great relief there be not word of blame from on contrary have murmured word two of approval here there while have be telling tale be now about to prove undiminished confidence in by entrusting with command of expedition against same formidable foe must not possibly have hoped for more favourable reception soon found master attendant inexorably button holed while explained what wanted done although poor man be frightfully busy just then several ship being in harbour refitting after having be in action with enemy let protest a might must not release until have agreed to do everything required result being that when dockyard men knocked off work to go to dinner day felucca be already alongside wharf more than half ballast out of while when dockyard bell rang at six o'clock night signalling cessation of work for day hold have be swept clean quantity of dunnage laid in four pounder stowed on top thereof well packed up round to prevent from shifting when craft be at sea although remained on spot until last moment supervising matter in order that everything might be done to satisfaction still managed to reach pen by seven o'clock smart sailing boat up to kingston ketureen from thence out to pen being mean of conveyance sir peter be a much surprised a pleased when reported to amount of progress have made during day be wonderful exclaimed how in world did manage simply by sticking to master attendant so preventing from doing anything else until have attended to requirement replied admiral laughed in enjoyment of picture mind conjured up of master attendant vainly trying to shake off poor carline remarked how must have suffered before must bring to point of setting aside other work to attend to be good man most excellent fellow in way have one fault allows to be too much trammelled by routine with everything irrespective of importance must be attended to in proper order now that have jolted out of groove will be day before will be able to get comfortably back into have doubt sir peter be right did not wait to see know be that by noon next day have brought unhappy man into frame of mind caused to yield prompt attention to requirement rather than waste valuable time in fruitless endeavour to evade with result that three day later felucca be ready for next expedition be to lead against pirate moment that preparation be complete reported to admiral received formal instruction to proceed to sea at once that same evening weighed stood out of harbour with first of land breeze now have to make passage to windward although hugged southern coast of jamaica a closely a dared thus availing to fullest possible extent of land breeze a far a morant point be not until daybreak of ninth day after sailing from port royal that arrived off entrance to pirate cove here be baffled for couple of hour waiting for springing up of sea breeze caught first breathing of took in with arriving at anchorage about one bell in forenoon watch plan of campaign be perfectly simple intended to enter cove if pirate schooner must happen to be in harbour run straight alongside board before crew must have time to clear away gun bring to bear upon felucca have strong enough crew to do have doubt a to ability to carry schooner in face of most determined resistance that pirate must offer then schooner captured crew safely confined below establishment ashore must have alternative to surrender at discretion be annihilated by schooner gun there be only one weak point must see in scheme be that considerable number of men constituting shore portion of establishment might escape into interior of island unless mean be devised to prevent be however not very difficult to accomplish for will be remembered that there be one way of entrance to egress from cove on land side namely narrow very dangerous zigzag path down face of perpendicular cliff gap in wide enough to prevent effectual possibility of passage way might easily be made by explosion of bag of powder preparation for little expedition be to accomplish piece of work be made during time that be lying becalmed off mouth of cove when at length entered boat containing four seaman in charge of midshipman who have be most carefully instructed concerning precise nature of duty be to perform be cast adrift just inside head outside islet masked entrance while pulled away for shore in felucca stood on into cove man of with sword cutlas girded to waist brace of loaded pistol thrust into belt standing ready to leap aboard schooner must happen to be in roadstead have sooner cleared islet however fairly entered cove than discovered that schooner be not in harbour consequently must be obliged to adopt modification of plan have devised in view of such very possible contingency although tiburon be not in cove anchorage be not tenantless brig of two hundred seventy ton being moored therein while apparently boat belonging to settlement a well a own be passing to fro between shore bound shoreward being loaded to gunwale while coming from be light at first glimpse of somewhat unexpected sight jumped to conclusion that vessel be prize almost instantly remembered that in addition to tiburon pirate owned brig by mean of disposed of such captured booty a did not require for own use purchasing with proceeds other good of stood in need have very little doubt that craft before be brig in question be that a might first task be obviously to secure possession of vessel felucca be accordingly at once headed for so busily employed be pirate aboard brig in task of hoisting out cargo striking into boat alongside that be quite half way across bay before discovered presence although people ashore who be unloading boat did utmost to warn comrade by hailing pointing sooner be felucca seen recognised than whole place be thrown into state of consternation alarm bell ashore be rung people made dash for weapon then tumbling good haphazard out of boat on to sand sprang in pulled might main for brig while on board swarmed up out of hold down over side into half loaded empty boat gave way for shore in very panic of confusion although brig be moored well in that boat passing to fro might have short distance to travel in felucca be alongside have secured undisputed possession of vessel before boat with armed crew have traversed distance between shore seeing occupant paused drew together a if to confer to await further development of brief pause promptly availed ourselves by getting brig under way working felucca out toward entrance when much to astonishment boat with one accord turned round pulled back to beach unexpected action on part be great relief to for have fully expected that must make concerted effort to recapture brig felucca by boarding in case must have have hand full must almost certainly have lost few men probably believed felucca to be armed with cannon fully expected to be received with liberal dos of grape canister must fully account for sudden unexpected display of prudence be that a may be allowed to work craft out to sea without molestation when having hurriedly overhauled prize found that be amply provisioned for much longer voyage than to port royal put in command of second midshipman with prize crew of ten men giving instruction to report to admiral without delay dispatched forthwith then transferring remainder of following back to felucca re entered cove came to anchor outside of close to islet masked entrance in such position that little craft must be warped right in alongside bit of cliff dropped sheer down into water have scarcely done when deep hollow boom echoing re echoing along face of cliff enclosed cove told that party have be dispatched to breach road up face of cliff so cut off retreat of pirate toward interior of island have accomplished task time be now important to for of course must not tell at what moment garcia arch pirate crew in tiburon might put in appearance upon scene have few very important preparation to make before must consider ready to deal with therefore have sooner let go felucca anchor than lowered only other boat that have brought with ran warp away to shore of islet securing to such rock a be most convenient for purpose done warped little craft right in alongside cliff made secure after next task be to carry ashore two stout hawser have brought with for purpose convey to top of cliff under felucca lay moored then rigged pair of sheers over vessel hatchway proceeded to hoist pounder out of hold one at time of course then having got first gun on deck already prepared in port royal dockyard by being encased in stout cylindrical packing of plank passed bight of two hawser round one at end with hand tailing on except one whom set to watch a sentinel proceeded to parbuckle up face of cliff be stiff job preparation having be made beforehand everything went without hitch when knocked off work for night four gun be landed together with carriage while so far a must discover pirate ashore remained in absolute ignorance not only of doings also of whereabouts same night waiting until darkness be sufficient to hide movement from pirate ashore gunner boatswain carpenter ascended to highest point of little islet in search of suitable spot upon to construct projected battery be fortunate enough to find on very summit be indeed perfectly ideal for purpose for commanded not only whole of interior of cove with settlement ashore also entrance open sea for space of about mile possessed further advantage that needed very little labour to completely adapt for purpose so eager be to complete preparation must fain have set men to work upon night have already done extraordinarily well in getting four gun landed mounted upon carriage therefore decided though somewhat reluctantly to let have long unbroken night rest when next day arrived be glad that have be wise enough to do so for came to work fresh laboured with will a for spent night doing sentry go for fully expected to receive visit from shore time during hour of darkness nothing happened when at length day dawned be relieved be inclined to believe that effort to conceal presence on island from pirate have be successful with dawning of new day however critical period be past cared very little whether inhabitant of settlement did did not discover whereabouts therefore got hand to work moment that be light enough to see by time that pirate ashore began to show two of four pounder be in place on spot have chosen for battery be ready to open fire at moment notice cove be too small islet too close to settlement for to conceal whereabouts movement when once began to work upon summit where be in full view of eye within range of couple of mile pirate ashore have not be on move more than hour before became apparent that presence have be discovered indication that be case be clear unmistakable alarm bell clanged out summons instantly work ceased man be seen to be hurrying toward building in have be interviewed by fernandez upon arrival in settlement must mean one thing namely speedy attack upon islet in anticipation of hastened completion of preparation so that might be quite ready to meet attack when came first business be to get remaining two gun into position bring up to battery entire stock of ammunition did not cost more than hour strenuous labour at completion of hand went to work to tumble sufficient quantity of ballast into felucca to enable to stand up under sail moment that be done sent out to sea with midshipman four hand on board in order that might not fall into hand of pirate with instruction to return only when british ensign must be displayed from battery scarcely be felucca under way when sentinel who have be left in battery to keep watch upon movement of pirate ashore summoned to post upon arrival there at once saw that preparation have not be completed moment too soon for a topped hill obstructed view of cove from seaward side of islet saw whole male population of settlement numbering about one hundred forty marching down to beach with evident intention of embarking in boat pulling off to attack with aid of telescope must distinctly distinguish figure of fernandez who be assuming direction of operation must not admire strictness of discipline appeared to exercise over follower for fellow seemed amenable to briefest order possessed exactly twenty boat in ranging in size from craft capable of accommodating forty men down to little norwegian dinghy in have made escape be evident that man of party have be previously told off to particular boat for upon arrival at beach hitherto compact body at once dissolved into twenty separate detachment of made way in perfectly orderly manner to particular boat whole flotilla being launched manned at fernandez ' word of command done boat be turned round with bow pointing straight for islet again at word of command oar a one dropped into water expedition advanced to attack in long straight line boat have not so much a single gun among crew being armed simply with cutlas pistol musket therefore felt apprehension at concerning result of coming conflict rather somewhat unaccountable pity for unfortunate wretch who seemed to be quite unaware that be advancing to doom singular feeling of pity be quickly swamped by reflection of fate must certainly be ours must by chance be foolish enough to let pirate get better of since be important that must make utmost of opportunity gave order for four gun to be loaded with grape carefully aimed at four largest boat be done four piece spoke deadly message almost simultaneously smoke momentarily obscuring vision while thunder of discharge echoed re echoed round cliff in long series of slowly decreasing reverberation long before have died away breeze have swept aside pall of smoke hid boat from saw that so carefully have gun be aimed shot have taken effect four boat at have be discharged being now mere shapeless mass of wreckage among few men struggled here there to keep afloat casualty among pirate must have be appalling for estimated that four boat being largest in entire flotilla must have contained at least total number of men comprising expedition so far a must ascertain with aid of telescope survivor of four crew scarcely numbered dozen in of course nearest boat at once closed in upon wreckage with object of rescuing few survivor in so doing dozen of became bunched close together for about minute such opportunity be too good to be missed gun having meanwhile be smartly loaded again two of be brought to bear upon bunch simultaneously discharged result of two shot be scarcely a effective a of previous discharge possibly because gun captain have become little flurried excited nevertheless two of boat aimed at be blown to piece while two three of others showed sign of more le serious damage occupant be thrown into such dire confusion that abandoning further effort to save comrade took to oar seemed intent only upon getting apart a quickly a possible example be immediately followed by remaining boat crew of opened out until there be at least couple of fathom of clear water separating boat from boat for few second be under impression that havoc thus quickly wrought by gun have so far discouraged pirate that intended to abandon attack upon islet for there be several very evident sign of hesitation among presently apparently in response to exhortation of fernandez who pulled along line in fast gig oar dipped once more remnant of flotilla most gallantly resumed advance amid cheer yell of encouragement defiance that clearly reached on islet chapter one extermination of pirate nothing must possibly have be better from point of view than foolhardy gallantry of pirate in thus persistently pressing attack upon islet for advantage be on side must remain so until enemy have landed come to hand grip with be imperative that in order to ensure own success a many a possible of foe must be put hors de combat before fight became hand to hand melee certainly seemed at first blush to be rather cowardly to pelt poor beggar with grape while be unable to strike blow in return feeling be after one of very weak false sentimentality man of be outlaw even if not yet actual murderer at least potential one consorter with cruel cowardly brute in human shape who must destroy without mercy if be not destroyed who be in fact worse than wild beast for whereas latter take life merely to satisfy craving of nature average pirate slew for sheer love of slaying in order that might gratify unnatural lust caused to revel in sight of human suffering therefore after first qualm of reluctance felt compunction in ordering gunner to ply weapon upon advancing enemy with skill at command right willingly did men obey order sponging loading priming pointing firing with fell determination of men who knew that must slay be slain aiming so carefully that shot be made to tell with disastrous effect so that advancing boat gradually fell into confusion a shot after shot whistled through sinking boat here shattering there killing maiming so many of crew that must neither advance farther retire lay upon water mere drifting blood bespattered wreck have distance between beach islet be half a far again a actually be there can be doubt that entire expedition must have be swept out of existence a be nine out of twenty boat left settlement survived to reach islet be grounded upon beach just below battery a keel grated in upon shingle crew sprang out dragged boat well up so that must not go adrift then sinking upon one knee emptied musket at to cover landing of comrade on part holding fire in readiness to meet rush upon battery be now imminent here fernandez still unwounded exhibited only bit of sound generalship have distinguished attack for instead of allowing men to charge up slope promiscuously a landed to be cut down bowled over by pistol in detail ordered to form up in single file open order until last boat have arrived probably guessing that be without musket knowing that men be for moment beyond pistol shot then after allowing time to recharge musket minute two additional in to recover breath prepare for desperate up hill rush at battery gave word to advance leading way while with naked cutlas in one hand pistol in other crouched behind low breastwork watching toiling figure scrambling struggling up steep almost precipitous slope have advanced about way fernandez still leading be just about within pistol range when rose to foot sprang up on low earth parapet have constructed raised sword above head in a loud authoritative voice a must command shouted in spanish halt then a advancing pirate wavered hesitated in astonishment at unexpected action continued fernandez others call upon to throw down arm surrender in order to prevent further sacrifice of life can do good by persevering further in futile attack for be master of situation can shoot down man of before will be possible for to reach spot where stand to push on will simply mean crack one of pirate crouching behind have coolly levelled musket taken pot shot at bullet passing through hat searing skull like white hot wire so toppled over with shock fell back into arm of one of men yell of savage joy raised by pirate at sight of fall be echoed by own men a sprang to foot intending to leap over low parapet charge down upon advancing foe to avenge be not really hurt shaking off grip of man who held cried out in time to stay adjuring by that held dear to stand fast where be finish fight in battery splendidly obeyed although might well have be excused have ignored command for firing of musket shot served a signal for general fusillade on side in course of four of men fell be commanding position by time that pirate have emptied musket pistol at have brought to standstill with more than number down after there be possibility of further restraining lad indeed be there need therefore poured out over low earthwork down few yard of slope still intervened between enemy next moment be engaged in hand to hand life death conflict side expecting giving quarter for few second that lasted be warm work pirate fighting desperately since knew that if taken alive halter awaited then in space of minute be over last of foe be down a well a few more men on own side who remained unhurt stood gasping for breath mopping perspiring brow a glared hungrily about for more foe to conquer there be none presently pulling together gathered up own wounded carried to such shade a must be found where surgeon mate who formed one of company at once got to work upon attending to hurt meanwhile ensign be hoisted a signal to felucca to return to harbour then such of a must be spared went out to disarm wounded pirate afterwards afford such relief a lay in power while others again gleaned weapon ammunition of fallen recognising that might possibly be useful in fight with crew of tiburon later on then having made arrangement for conduct of work on islet during next few hour took two largest boat have survived passage across water of cove with dozen men armed to teeth under leadership of myself boatswain pulled away to settlement to see how matter stood in direction a have anticipated there be not man left in place not even boy above fourteen year of age male above age have be detailed to take part in attempt to capture islet fernandez have fully recognised to be key of entire position now of hundred fifty who have taken part in disastrous attempt one be slain lay wounded in hand while be taking stock generally of situation so to speak making further plan boatswain assisted by seaman whom have brought ashore with made careful systematic search of building in place removing weapon everything must be used a such ammunition transferring to two boat prior to return to islet there be not many weapon not very great quantity of ammunition there be more than must conveniently stow in boat therefore took portion of out to about middle of bay there threw overboard returning for remainder conveying to islet most important result of visit to shore however consisted in information freely given by one of woman so far a have be able to gather from conversation of men tiburon crew might be expected to arrive in cove at moment by time party got back to islet day be well advanced felucca have returned to cove be now anchored inside islet close to southern shore surgeon although still busy among wounded pirate have doctored up whole of own wounded made comfortable a might have be expected from peculiar character of engagement enormous advantage of position enjoyed casualty be singularly light consisting only of five killed nine wounded in case of pirate there be very different story to tell have ascertained while ashore that left settlement one hundred fifty strong now remained of amounted to just thirty seven wounded of whom at least one quarter must probably succumb to hurt thirty seven caused to be put into boat a soon a have be attended to conveyed to settlement where turned over to care of woman folk who thought must probably be able to give more attention better nursing than must hope to afford next day at urgent request of several of woman also caused own wounded to be taken ashore where under supervision of surgeon be taken in hand most tenderly cared for dead own a many a must find belonging to pirate be hastily sewn up in canvas weighted launched overboard from felucca be taken well out to sea for purpose be about three bell in forenoon watch on fifth day after attack upon islet two sail be sighted by lookout standing in toward cove hour later be able to identify one of a infamous tiburon while other be large craft apparently british judging by build cut of canvas doubtless capture have long ago made possible preparation to give pirate schooner warm reception upon arrival going even to length of surrounding battery with parapet masking latter by covering with sod of growing grass have now therefore nothing to do patiently to await arrival of enemy confident that must sail right into cove unsuspectingly never get so much a hint of presence until must open fire upon a have planned so matter turned out two vessel entered cove together simultaneously came to anchor big craft upon stern of descried word berwick castle bristol anchoring about cable length east of schooner very fortunately for chiefly concerned well out of line of fire waited until saw anchor of vessel splash into placid water of cove heard rumble of cable a smoked out through hawse pipe then while gunner brought four pounder loaded with round shot grape to bear upon crowded deck of pirate schooner party raised rough flagstaff to british ensign have be nailed dropped heel into socket already prepared for even then be nearly minute before presence be discovered by pirate who be at moment busily clewing up hauling down canvas preparatory to stowing boatswain gunner have telescope focussed upon schooner keenly watching movement on board be not long before recognised upon quarter deck issuing order generally carrying with air of authority handsome rascal who during fight between tiburon wasp have hailed asking whether have struck almost on instant of recognising saw man run up to excitedly say something to point toward islet handsome rascal who be without doubt pirate captain manuel garcia stood stared amazed for few second at islet then made dash for companion from withdrew telescope levelled in direction for perhaps quarter of minute kept tube steadily pointed toward then with gesture of mad ferocity dashed instrument to deck seizing speaking trumpet placed to lip effect be instant stoppage of operation of clewing up hauling down aboard tiburon while eye in be a by one impulse directed toward islet pause endured only for space of few second just long enough to enable gazers to identify flag flying on islet a british ensign thereupon everybody seemed to be galvanised into instant breathless activity again now however former process be reversed men who be already half way aloft intent upon furling canvas started to return to deck others sprang to sheet halliard began to sheet home hoist away a if for life in short be evident that pirate contemplated getting under way again attempting to escape out to sea be at moment that boatswain who still have glass focussed on schooner cried out be goin ' to cut cable mr delamere look sir will see chap hurrying for'ard with axe in hand be that so exclaimed then bring number gun to bear on schooner forecastle sweep clear quick before can cut adrift will never do to have drifting over cove be interrupted by crashing report of number with others have already be most carefully trained upon schooner a smoke blew away saw vessel port bulwark about cathead thickly dotted with white mark where shot have struck while forecastle have be crowded with men moment before be now clear not so much a single head showed above rail give other three gun a quick a please keep up fire with grape only until receive further order cried almost a word left lip other three gun bellowed terrible message in response to men on tiburon deck seemed to shrink disappear although good many of went down enough be still left to enable to man port broadside of seven pounder a well a long with astounding rapidity brought whole of gun to bear upon spot from jet of flame smoke issued marking position of gun while defiantly ran up black flag to main truck now action raged fast furious side loading firing a rapidly a must although continually exhorted own gunner to give plenty of time to take careful aim enemy quickly got range to nicety shot came screaming about ear plumping into earthen rampart in almost continuous shower blinding with dust dirt that threw up occasionally sending splinter flying in direction when shot happened to strike stone yet marvellous to relate although several of be suffering from severe contusion caused by flying splinter of rock not one of be thus far actually disabled while within ten minute from beginning of firing of schooner slackened perceptibly showing plainly how severe be punishment be inflicting upon be further exemplified by fact presently man be seen to be hailing berwick castle in response to two boat be lowered crowded with men pulled over to schooner thus reinforced tiburon fire breezed up again for few minute then gradually slackened again finally when action have be in progress twenty minute died away altogether black flag being slowly reluctantly hauled down minute later in token of surrender cease firing lad cried schooner have struck now while gun crew remain here ready to open fire again if need be rest of will go aboard take possession with wild cheer thirty of leaped ruin of parapet dashed headlong down steep slope to little strip of beach where dozen boat be drawn partly up out of water to pounce upon boat rush afloat then tumble helter skelter in over gunwale be work of second only then throwing out oar away went for pirate schooner keeping well apart in case of treacherous resumption of firing on part of pirate nothing occurred everything remained silent almost ominously so on board schooner one head only showing above torn splintered bulwark that of man who apparently wounded clung to main topmast backstay seeming to watch approach a drew nearer that head gradually assumed recognisable appearance in eye until at length felt convinced that be that of garcia suddenly a watched fellow disappeared not a though have sunk to deck exhausted rather a though have gone elsewhere at run with disappearance strong suspicion of diabolical treachery on part gripped wrestled with for few second until in fact be within dozen fathom of schooner side then influenced by irresistible impulse sprang to foot shouted hold water will go alongside ship first see what be state of thing there schooner be safe can not escape while be aboard who can tell what may be happening aboard ship round with boat men pull alongside englishman with one accord boat swept round headed for berwick castle couple of minute later be alongside swarming up lofty side be in act of swinging in over rail in wake of main rigging when terrific concussion shook vessel from stem to stern loud boom like explosion of pent volcano rent air looking in direction of sound saw vast sheet of flame smoke suddenly burst from schooner mast gun vast quantity of debris among recognised thirty forty human body went hurtling high into air side opened out showing rib here there black against white flame then torn dismembered hull sank in midst of seething water of cove followed by plunging debris a came down again after flight into air instinct have warned aright man have seen be beyond doubt garcia have fired vessel magazine in hope of blowing into air with a boarded by living jingo sir be lucky thought of yours to order to board ship first gasped boatswain with white quivering lip a clung to rail where must have be if 'd gone on boarded schooner a at first intended to a soon a somewhat shaken nerve must permit proceeded to search berwick castle in hope of finding at least of crew there be trace of beyond seaman chest in forecastle clothing of master officer in respective cabin of showed sign of having be made free with by captor crew have vanished to last man having doubtless be offered in accordance with pirate usual policy alternative of service under black flag death apparently to eternal honour have chosen latter story be done for there be need to weary reader with prosaic detail regarding arrangement made for removal of woman from pirate settlement prior to destruction how latter be accomplished let suffice to say that destruction be so thorough complete that encouragement be left for other pirate to adopt place a rendezvous so far a be aware other pirate ever attempted to do so sailed for port royal same afternoon about two hour before sunset just a great luminary be about to sink gorgeously beneath western horizon wind failed afforded opportunity to do something very greatly desired to do namely to call upon friend don luis dona inez two warm hearted friend who have played good samaritan treated with such generous hospitality when have be brought to house more dead than alive after loss of wasp thus far have have opportunity to pay visit now by lucky chance wind happened to fail when be within couple of mile of shore almost exactly abreast of bella vista be distinctly visible from deck of berwick castle in strong light of setting sun took glass carefully examined shore found beach upon have be landed saw that water be smooth enough to permit of landing recognised that here be opportunity to visit friend express gratitude for that have done for might never occur again next turned glass upon bella vista saw that door window be opened latter draped with curtain fancied must even make out one more person seated under shadow of veranda be pretty certain therefore friend be at home at once made up mind to visit a felt might with safety for calm must last about two hour then land breeze must spring up berwick castle must then work close inshore heave to until must rejoin preparation be soon made within ten minute of arriving at decision to go ashore having left boatswain in charge given necessary instruction be in boat heading for beach of course be quite dark time before boat keel grated upon sand that fact did not greatly trouble for knew way quite well have very little difficulty in finding path led up to house building be by time lighted up a approached heard voice among that of don luis be easily distinguishable then a ascended step led up to gallery running round house heard dona inez speak next moment stepped out through drawing room window caught sight of for moment stopped dead with startled look in eye then with little scream of delight darted forward seized hand impulsively kissed on cheek in spanish fashion much to embarrassment luis luis cried still holding hand come hither quickly caro mio see most welcome sight that have seen for many day why yes of course will responded don luis next moment too stepped out on to gallery straight up to like wife kissed welcome thousand welcome dear don ricardo exclaimed snatching hand from wife clasp where on earth have sprung from from yonder answered pointing to seaward where lantern at berwick castle gaff end shone like star through darkness well be just in time for dinner exclaimed so come in there be others here who will rejoice to once more see whom thought dead long ago a two dear warm hearted impulsive friend dragged in through open window became aware that entire mendouca family be in drawing room by too be very cordially welcomed though naturally with little more restraint than displayed by don luis wife oh what dinner be how genuinely delighted be to see not excepting mama elisa teresita of whom insisted upon seeing when learned be in house of course have to relate to in detail everything have happened to from moment when went forth to reconnoitre on memorable day of attack on bella vista by black many loud be ejaculation of amazement a reached most telling point of story appeared that have waited anxiously for return have only finally given up hope at nightfall by time have arrived at conclusion that black have got carried away into mountain to torture to death told that have mourned for a for brother delight at finding still lived convinced of truth of assertion later learned that mendouca family be still enjoying don luis hospitality pending rebuilding of montpelier be not until after ten o'clock night succeeded in dragging away from bella vista only then upon promise most willingly gave to keep in touch with by letter repeat visit a often a possible so far a latter part of promise be concerned fate be against for never again be privileged to meet of be six bell of first watch when reached berwick castle by time land breeze be piping up strong a soon a boat be hoisted to davit filled away for port royal where arrived in due course landed prisoner to number of twenty three three week later underwent trial for piracy on high sea evidence against being overwhelming be hanged at gallows point fortnight after conviction a for crew obtained full even generous recognition for merchant of various west indian island combining together to present with exceedingly handsome service of plate to subscribe to purse content of be to be divided pro rata among other officer men of expedition admiral be good enough to express unbounded satisfaction at what be pleased to term unusual skill discretion with task of exterminating most formidable nest of pirate have be carried out took considerable pain to afford early opportunity not only to undergo formality of court martial for loss of wasp also to pas examination immediately after latter event presented with commission to crack frigate in subsequently saw much exciting service lasting up to short lived peace of amiens toward end of year by time have attained to rank of post captain although many of subsequent experience a officer of british royal navy be sufficiently strange exciting be never again lot to cross sword with pirate for pirating became occupation to be shunned so far a west indian water be concerned for several year after memorable example made by british government in inexorable hunting down destruction of notorious garcia pirate of hayti formidable band
