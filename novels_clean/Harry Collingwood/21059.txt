marvellously apt pupil since have be with managed practice single handed before came to have doubt can do again if need be so be off with at once lad for mother seems to be in sore need of five minute later dick maitland have boarded tramcar on way to london bridge railway station from whence took train for crystal palace nearest station to mother home reached within two hour of departure from number paradise street now a dick maitland happens to be hero of story be necessary must be properly introduced to reader seems a appropriate moment a to begin with then when caught first glimpse of assisting dr humphreys to dress bind up token of affection mr william taylor have bestowed upon wife dick maitland be within three month of eighteenth birthday fine tall fairly good looking athletic specimen of young public school twentieth century englishman be only son mother be widow husband having died when dick be sturdy little toddler trifle over three year of age mr maitland have be left quite comfortably off husband having accumulated sufficient sum to bring in income of close upon seven hundred pound per annum provision of mr maitland will stipulated that income arising from carefully chosen investment be to be enjoyed by widow during lifetime subject to proper maintenance education of only son dick upon demise of mr maitland capital be to go to dick to be employed by latter a might deem fit clause in will stipulated at close of school career dick be to be put to such business profession a lad might choose mr maitland pithily remarking that did not believe in drone since mr maitland although most excellent woman in respect have head for business husband appointed honest old john cuthbertson own father solicitor sole executor of will so died happily in full conviction that have done everything be humanly possible to assure future welfare of widow infant son faithfully have john cuthbertson discharged trust until in fullness of year have laid down burden of life son jonas have come to reign in office in father stead event have occurred three year previously about time when dick having completed school life have elected to take up study of medicine surgery important step have involved many interview between mr maitland mr jonas a clerk in father office have learned to call for said mr jonas have succeeded to executorship of many will mr maitland among a well a other portion of father business so great have be zeal interest that have displayed during necessary negotiation mr maitland have be most favourably impressed indeed jonas cuthbertson have honestly earned very high opinion that mr maitland have formed of displaying not only interest zeal also considerable amount of acumen in matter of dick placing for when mr maitland perhaps very naturally expressed wish that dick must begin study under guidance of eminent harley street specialist solicitor strenuously opposed idea not only upon score of expense also because a argued dick must certainly acquire wider knowledge of disease cure acquire much more quickly under hard working practitioner among east end poor of london that a very truly pointed out be great desideratum in such case a dick far outweighing extra hard work sordid surroundings to mr maitland have at first so strenuously objected moreover dick agreed with solicitor in end maternal objection be overcome careful enquiry be instituted finally dick found installed a pupil in somewhat bohemian establishment of doctor julian humphreys md mrcp mrcs several other letter of alphabet queer though arrangement be in many respect proved eminently satisfactory to dick for dr humphreys be not only extraordinarily able physician surgeon also marvellously clever learned outside bound of profession gentle tender hearted a woman thoroughly good fellow round in best highest sense of term a for dick displayed from outset quite exceptional aptitude for noble profession have chosen study instead of being irksome be pleasure almost passion with nerve be steel never for moment lost head even when assisting at most sickening operation touch be light sure knowledge seemed to come to intuitively wonder that doctor humphreys persistently predicted brilliant successful career for pupil upon arrival home dick found mother in such acute state of distress for first few moment of interview seemed to be quite incapable of making intelligible statement must hing weep copiously upon stalwart son shoulder gasp that be ruined utterly irretrievably ruined at length however lad managed to extract from mr maitland statement that have seen in previous morning paper account of suicide of mr jonas cuthbertson solicitor judging from name other particular given in published account that must be mr cuthbertson have hurried up to town called at cuthbertson chamber where worst apprehension have received complete terrible confirmation from particular supplied by mr herbert cuthbertson chief clerk appeared that mr jonas after walking worthily in father footstep for two year have become infected with gambling craze first losing own money have finally laid hand upon a much of client property a must obtain access to until ill luck still pursuing have lost that also then have sought to evade consequence of misdeed by blowing out brain with two shot from revolver final act of folly have be perpetrated two day before account of in paper have fallen under mr maitland notice in interim there have of course be time only to make very cursory examination into affair of suicide examination have sufficed to reveal appalling fact that available security of own of client have disappeared while sufficient evidence have be discovered to show pretty clearly what have led to disappearance be sum substance of mr maitland somewhat incoherently told story when dick have heard through to end have reason to doubt truth manifestly be not at sort of story to be taken upon trust must be fully completely investigated if only for purpose of ascertaining whether not anything however small be to be saved from wreck accordingly after partaking of hasty lunch young maitland wended way to city there have most discouraging interview with mr herbert who be by time busily engaged upon preparation of detailed statement of position of affair for information of late employer client creditor mr herbert explained be proving task of much le difficulty than have anticipated since cuthbertson have apparently kept accurate account of gambling transaction of have latterly be upon gigantic scale with evidently desperate resolution of recovering former loss ruining in attempt while have not destroyed of paper a so many suicide do before perpetrating final act of folly position of affair a outlined by mr herbert be gloomy enough made clear to dick for moment be speaking with reserve a be impossible for to say anything of absolutely definite character until investigation be being conducted with aid of firm of chartered accountant of high standing must be complete having now ascertained in connection with deplorable business be for moment possible dick returned to mother did best to comfort encourage a might have be expected effort met with very great measure of success seeing that there be practically nothing of comforting encouraging character in story told by jonas cuthbertson chief clerk next morning dick maitland returned to number paradise street where found friend humphreys a busily engaged a ever in work of healing sick comforting sorrowing poor received welcome from cheery genial medico seemed to ease shoulder of at least load of anxiety be not until well on towards evening that claim upon doctor time attention slackened sufficiently to afford opportunity for dick to tell story after be only amplified edition of story originally told in mr maitland letter when at tale be fully told humphreys have by dint of much cross questioning fully mastered miserable detail sat for hour more smoking diligently silently a considered in what way must best help young friend at length however idea seemed to occur to for looked up said well dick friend sound about a bad a anything have heard of for many long day why in world did that fool of lawyer want to meddle with gambling why must not have be content to devote energy to conduct of business first class one according to chief clerk account father left must have provided with very comfortable living day probably snug competency to retire upon when found getting too old for work tell what be boy mad craving to get rich quickly be one of great curse of latter day when once get firm grip upon victim quickly convert honest upright man into conscienceless rogue who soon becomes centre of widespread circle of ruin untold misery look at fellow cuthbertson have honest honourable father a understand be to start with perfectly honest honourable yet look at now what be why simply dishonoured corpse hastily huddled away into suicide grave man who having utterly spoiled life have presumptuously prematurely hurried into presence of maker burdened not only with heavy load of own sin also with responsibility for ruin misery have left behind moralising however will not help boy for if know anything at about be that be not sort of character to make such horrible mess of life a poor wretch have done now question be what can do to help respected mother out of slough into man weakness sin have plunged not very much be afraid for can not restore to property of be robbed that appears to be gone beyond recall can do for may possibly help little can give letter of introduction to man who be under very heavy obligation to who being thoroughly good fellow will be more than glad to discharge obligation if will only afford opportunity to do so will go to give full complete particular of terrible misfortune have befallen if there be anything at to be saved out of wreckage will save for without fee without reward for sake too be solicitor honest one a many still be thank god be solicitor whose aid will be most useful to in unravelling of tangled skein say doctor be awfully good of exclaimed dick struggling to conceal emotion of gratitude after manner of englishman not altogether succeeding if matter concerned alone continued must not let do thing for must think of poor mother for sake must humble pride suppress assertion of independence so far a to accept help so kindly generously offered here let say that there be man on earth whose help must so willingly accept a yours blundered on dimly conscious that there have be something of ungraciousness in speech so stopped dead overcome with shame confusion be all right dear boy returned humphreys smilingly laying hand on dick shoulder know exactly how feel very heartily respect sense of sturdy independence be very estimable in way so long a be not carried too far a matter of fact dick none of be absolutely independent in world for almost moment of life be dependent upon somebody for assistance in one shape be not until assistance be withheld that be brought to realise extent to be individually dependent upon fellow creature be moralising again habit seems to be growing upon since came among poor folk down here have be brought face to face with vast amount of misery can be directly traced to ignorance crime just pas over stationery cabinet will thanks now will write to friend graham at once have better call upon at chamber in lincoln inn to morrow morning at ten o'clock sharp be about only hour of day when can be reasonably certain of finding when dick called upon humphreys friend graham upon following morning sent in letter of introduction soon have abundant evidence that rising young solicitor be quite a busy man a doctor have represented to be yet be not too busy to respond promptly to friend claim upon actually leaving important looking client waiting in outer office while interviewed dick listened with utmost patience to story latter have to tell questioning occasionally making note of answer upon writing pad at length after interview of over hour duration graham closed pad sharply rising extended hand to dick saying thank mr maitland believe have now essential fact may assure friend humphreys will take up case with utmost pleasure without loss of time also will do best for mother from what tell be inclined to imagine that wreck of cuthbertson affair will prove to be pretty complete therefore very strongly advise not to reckon upon being able to save anything for out of wreckage if there must by chance be anything will have now good morning be very pleased to have made acquaintance a soon a have anything definite to communicate will write to remember very kindly to humphreys good morning interview be certainly not very encouraging on other hand be by mean disappointing for dick have already quite made up mind that penny of mother money be lost be therefore very pleasant surprise to when about fortnight later letter came from graham announcing that have succeeded in rescuing close upon five hundred pound for mr maitland from ruin of cuthbertson estate that good lady must have money by presenting at writer office going through certain formality chapter two dick make up mind be late in evening of day upon mr maitland having fulfilled formality required of by graham have received from cheque for sum of four hundred eighty seven pound seventeen shilling eightpence apart from house in lived represented remained to of very comfortable fortune left to by late husband dick have escorted mother up to town upon conclusion of transaction have taken back to cedar after have made best of way to paradise street for moment have now arrived when must come to understanding with friend dr julian humphreys consult with respecting future ten o'clock have struck few minute ago belated patient have be attended to dismissed surgery have be closed by simple process of drawing down blind locking outer door now two friend be sitting opposite other in same drug scented apartment conversing earnestly together a humphreys pulled contemplatively yet somewhat vexedly at brier pipe have seen so much service that be now charred down to about original size fact be remarked dick in continuance of conversation that there be other course open to for be resolved will not touch farthing of money that friend graham have so cleverly rescued from ruin of cuthbertson estate stiver of will be required for maintenance of poor mater while be away must go away because a have admitted there be employment occupation of kind here at home to in present condition of unpreparedness must turn hand with hope of earning sufficient income to maintain though ever so modestly even if post be to be have for asking in country at event be not know to be plain unvarnished truth do not yes humphreys answered unhesitatingly be true unfortunately very well then dick resumed that being case next question be where be to go what be to do in order to earn enough money to maintain mother in meantime eventually to restore to position of security of be robbed by rascal cuthbertson de mortuis nil nisi bonum reproved humphreys gravely poor chap have gone to answer for sin whatever may have be there be end of so far a be concerned to rail at now speak of disparagingly will not hurt do good dick friend so unnecessarily bespatter memory by way now to return to mutton problem that propound be indeed hard one to solve to many must probably appear impossibility although be by mean old man have be long enough in world to have recognised that what many people deem impossibility be nothing of sort if only one have grit to face tackle be grit boy make impossibility possible believe posse quality in sufficient measure to enable to accomplish great thing question be what be particular great thing will meet case what be work be best fitted to do be already very well up in profession have chosen there be many man in successful practice to day who know le about than do unfortunately be not yet qualified ' therefore can not set up for even if must afford time to create practice can not a to becoming unqualified assistant that of course be out of question pay be altogether too poor to justify entertainment of idea there be country where restriction be not nearly so great a be in england there be others beyond pale of civilisation where restriction at exist where clever man with plenty of grit to back up might perhaps do remarkably well still to penetrate to such country man must take life in hand even then courage may prove insufficient to save from unspeakable horrible death now what can do besides doctoring nothing will help in present strait answered maitland can sail boat swim ride drive horse can shoot straight consequently if possessed sufficient influence might be able to get job a groom stableman even under gamekeeper none of thing be good enough for be capable of better thing than grooming horse cleaning harness looking after pheasant want employment will bring in good money mean to have too be right dick be way to talk returned humphreys approvingly modesty be all right very desirable admirable quality in young man character one be seen far too seldom nowadays modesty however be one thing self depreciation quite be mistake for anyone to underrate own value a very truly say be capable of doing much better work than needed in of occupation that have named therefore be justified in insisting upon having man have perfect right to very best most profitable work be capable of doing must get for be use for to sit down supinely demand that providence will put into hand man who be worth salt will get up hustle ' a american tersely express not rest until have secured what want now boy be very heavily handicapped have money influence to help to what want therefore will have to depend upon hustle grit alone also have time to waste in looking about in country for kind of thing want even with hustle grit imaginable may take month even year to find a said at beginning of conversation must go somewhere abroad to get what want in foreign land may find even such despised accomplishment a riding swimming straight shooting of utmost value to in opinion mainstay must be medical surgical knowledge have acquired now whereabout on face of old globe of ours be likely to be able to employ knowledge to best most profitable account must be where wealth be abundant where medical surgical skill be pretty frequently in demand also where there be plenty of scope for young fellow who like be imbued with spirit of adventure now let consider for moment where be country most nearly answer to condition what do say to south africa be land of gold diamond be not believe overrun with medical men a to adventure humphreys shrugged shoulder spread hand abroad expressively dick eye sparkled face lit up with enthusiasm south africa be place for without doubt exclaimed with animation be a say rich be also land of unbounded possibility how be to get there passage money amount to something considerable have money to spare for sort of thing also a have said will not take penny from mater what about borrowing suggested humphreys a know dick be not rich man have doubt must manage to interrupted dick emphatically thousand time be like doctor to offer to help out of own exceedingly limited mean be more grateful to than have word to express simply will not avail myself of kindness that of anybody else indeed for must be starting with millstone of debt hanging round neck have thought of better way than will work passage out work passage out ejaculated doctor staggered in spite of whole hearted belief in virtue of self help at bold suggestion on dick part in what capacity pray oh a anything returned dick buoyantly a ordinary seaman cook mate stoker what doe matter will find way never fear will take trot round dock to morrow will be strange indeed if can not somewhere find market for labour why even elementary knowledge of nautical matter have acquired in sailing little single handed cutter during holiday time will be of service to can steer can box compass know name of sail on full rigged ship will guarantee that before have be forty eight hour out will know function of bit of running rigging where to lay hand upon in dark ay will bet that will dick answered humphreys with enthusiasm a great a dick own have not much doubt a to being able to get berth a ordinary seaman for be big strong fellow for mere pulling hauling purpose skipper ought to be glad to get hold of yes think may consider part of problem solved what about after arrival in south africa how do propose to proceed at end of voyage when have safely landed for must remember that in probability will have wage to draw people who work passage be usually shipped at princely rate of pay of one shilling per month yes know said dick still will have reached scene of great endeavour without cost be important thing after will of course be obliged to trust to own push hustle ' a call for be impossible to make definite plan at distance from scene of operation quite so agreed humphreys must also remember that there be always element of luck chance please to call in background to be watched for opportunity often present literally at moment notice in most unexpected fashion one who profit by be who be alert enough to seize a pass there be one thing must do dick must take with well stocked chest of drug a well a case of surgical instrument since will not let lend money to help on way must allow to make present of medicine chest just a token of appreciation of way in have conducted a pupil nay boy must not refuse for if do will be deeply hurt a well a seriously offended very well then acquiesced dick since put in way so very strongly will accept generous gift with thousand most hearty thanks not only for gift also for kindly feeling that prompt dear dick protested humphreys there be really reason at why must feel so extraordinarily grateful for in doing what propose to do will only be very inadequately repaying for much valuable assistance rendered much very pleasant companionship during time of pupilage with think that because have not expressed much voluble regret at abrupt severance of connection feel for do very keenly assure see quite clearly that thing be inevitable therefore to complain about must be useless foolish now there be one other way in can help when have explained to how tremendous be power propose to place in hand will understand more clearly than must show in other way absolute trust repose in for tell dick in sincerity there be not person in whole circle of acquaintance be pretty wide whom feel must safely trust with power so potent be for evil a well a good be convinced that can trust be why have determined to endow with ability to perform deed to many people will seem positively miraculous have often expressed amazement at uniform success attends treatment of even most difficult case medical surgical especially surgical know from remark have made that attribute success purely to extent of knowledge well of course knowledge have something to do with true secret of success lie in free use make of hypnotism yes doubt be surprised for have never seen employ of well known method of ordinary hypnotist very true method be not ordinary method at be one claim a own exclusive discovery be a far in advance of ordinary hypnotism a be in advance of method of stage hypnotist almost at outset of professional career directed attention to investigation of hypnotism determined to ascertain whether not there be anything in claim set up by exponent soon discovered that there be something in despite disrepute cast upon by grotesque performance of certain so called entertainer there be need for to detail to successive step by at length attained present knowledge of marvellous power of science let suffice to say that by diligent study of eventually acquired such mastery of that have enabled to well to put mildly succeed where for must have failed large measure of success be due to fact have discovered infallible method of instantly hypnotising patient without patient knowledge be hypnotised know have remotest suspicion of then convey to powerful suggestion that treatment of be going to be absolutely successful there have whole secret humphreys paused for moment a if considering whether not must say more then gazed abstractedly at carefully kept finger nail right hand wandered to waistcoat pocket then looking up extended hand toward dick saying just lend penknife moment will dick produced knife held out to humphreys who looked at then shrank back good heaven man exclaimed asked for penknife not for adder where did get that brute from with inarticulate cry expression of unutterable disgust loathing maitland dropped penknife to floor then stamped on savagely grinding heel of boot on a though grinding head of snake into ground why dick exclaimed humphreys looking assistant square in eye what be doing what have good knife be doing to that must treat in barbarous manner maitland stared back blankly into doctor smiling eye for moment then looked long at penknife on floor finally stooped cautiously took between forefinger thumb eyeing doubtfully while then suddenly sat down pulled out pocket handkerchief mopped off perspiration freely bedewed face well will be shot ejaculated what extraordinary experience will believe doctor when tell that a drew penknife out of waistcoat pocket actually seemed to change into adder in hand there be flat wicked looking head malevolent eye characteristic marking of body above there be feeling of writhing strongly in grasp a though be trying to get enough of length clear to turn strike talk about aaron rod of old egyptian necromancer turning into serpent why must have sworn that knife of mine did precisely same thing now there be problem for doctor what sort of mental aberration be that caused to imagine extraordinary thing a eh simply dear boy hypnotised unbeknownst ' so to speak in illustration of what have be telling answered doctor laying hand upon dick shoulder hope did scare very severely eh n o answered dick slowly did not actually scare doctor managed to give thrill of horror disgust a have not experienced for many long day say do really mean to tell in sober earnest that abominable experience be due to hypnotic suggestion on part yes do answered humphreys wanted to bring home to in very convincing manner power hypnotist exercise over subject must have done even more convincingly perhaps by commanding to take perfectly cold poker in hand then suggesting to that be red hot when despite fact of poker being cold hand must have be most painfully blistered probably adder experiment be convincing enough eh be indeed assented dick with little reminiscent shudder look here doctor say that hypnotised when did do did see do anything peculiar boy of course did because adopted own especial method be instantaneous undetectable will teach if care to learn for seem to foresee that there may be occasion by by when get out to south africa when may find power extremely useful to particularly if must get medical surgical work to do in case just hypnotise patient in way will teach then powerfully suggest to that treatment be going to cure will do so a to when got under influence be done while asked to lend penknife by jove exclaimed dick be marvellous perfectly marvellous if did not know to be absolutely truthful man think must bring to believe now can understand what meant when spoke of potency of hypnotism for good for evil why a understand have never yet dared to pas on secret of power to anyone else swear to doctor that if will entrust to will never under circumstance use except for good purpose will ever pas on secret to anyone else except with express permission now that have given idea of capability simply long to know secret for seems to that chap with power must come very near to working miracle yes assented humphreys quietly be so indeed even with imperfect knowledge for have not yet nearly mastered possibility of science have done thing that without aid must have be impossible now if like will initiate into secret of power be very simple after once known will enable to do everything can do first of however propose to throw into cataleptic sleep in order that while be in condition may imbue with absolute faith in without everything can teach must be practically useless at least until have acquired faith in by somewhat slow laborious process have to pursue have to acquire faith in myself power by repeated experiment extending over period of several month have not time for so must imbue with by process of suggestion while be in state of trance now be ready yes quite answered dick with quick indrawing of breath for now that came to point suddenly found that to submit unreservedly to hand of even friend humphreys for purpose of experiment smacked rather strongly of uncanny be something of nerve trying experience humphreys evidently noted momentary hesitation for said need not have least fear will be profoundly unconscious during period of sleep will awake without slightest trace of unpleasant feeling now stretch out comfortably on sofa do exactly a tell when dick descended to surgery few minute late next morning found friend humphreys with coat off shirt sleeve rolled up clothes protected by white apron extending from throat to top of boot busily engaged in dusting bottle shelf whereon stood a dick entered doctor mounted upon step ladder looked down at with smile nod of welcome said well boy how did sleep how do feel after ordeal of last night dick laughed joyously ordeal ' exclaimed hope may never have to undergo more trying ordeal than slept like top thank feel a fit a fiddle morning indeed know that ever felt so fit in life before be not have not remotest idea what mysterious thing did to last night know that have imparted to something have never hitherto possessed feel morning buoyancy of spirit that seems to amount of disappointment must damp lessen for moment have belief in so complete so boundless feel can not help be successful in new venture of mine upon be about to embark yes said humphreys nodding head in manner very clearly expressed satisfaction be result of ordeal ' will be quite permanent mind say that will always feel quite so buoyant confident a do at moment for be beyond power of man to make absolutely immune to circumstance in spite of circumstance however adverse will always retain at least of present buoyancy confidence think will ever sink into condition of utter abject despair overwhelms people drive to suicide to change subject be still minded to go to dock morning in quest of shipmaster benevolently enough inclined to allow to work passage out to south africa rather answered dick be to say if think can spare for few hour of course can spare answered humphreys must advise to go immediately after breakfast for a know be early bird catch worm how do propose to set about quest not quite haphazard suppose answered dick thought of getting shipping gazette perhaps telegraphy consulting advertisement page with view of learning what ship be on berth for south african port where be lying date of sailing excellent idea declared doctor a

surcharged with technicality for be enthusiast in everything relating to combating cure of disease far into small hour descanted learnedly upon beloved science confiding to instructing dick in many valuable secret by dint of laborious research much consumption of midnight oil have wrung from dame nature on many occasion in not far distant future dick maitland have ample cause to look back with

out through dock gate jack have done hand turn of work on board dick listened with good tempered grin to chorus of grumbling be proceeding around interjected merry jest two caused growler to stop in mid career in amazement at audacity then having slipped nimbly into clothes sprang up through hatchway presented first on deck of forecastle hand to be greeted by mate with cheery well done youngster first to answer call come of joining ship with unmuddled brain think be going to get on well together sincerely hope so sir answered dick if will not be fault although be rather ignoramus at present

a regularly polished not with usual rottenstone oil with special metal polish provided out of skipper private purse there be more certain way of putting old man back up than for man to allow to be seen knocking ash of pipe out against portion of ship painted work be even asserted of captain robert so anxious be to maintain smart appearance of ship must whenever ran into calm have quarterboat lowered manned in order that might pull round vessel assure that mast be accurately stayed to precisely same angle of rake woe betide unhappy boatswain if there seemed to be slightest occasion for fault finding concordia be beamy ship in proportion to length carried full poop extending forward to within about twenty foot of mainmast underneath be handsome saloon cuddy fitted with berth

choose well found well built sailing clipper when desire to make sea voyage such be vessel in young dick maitland be to make first a hoped only essay a seaman before mast after slight sketch have be given of skipper will be readily seen that must scarcely have hit upon craft where must be likely to have more hard work better opportunity for acquirement of large measure of seafaring knowledge in very short time mr sutcliffe chief mate have be favourably impressed by dick from moment when two have encountered other at shipping office mr sutcliffe method of showing favour be to provide favourite with ample sufficiency of work to do ship have therefore not be out of dock hour when dick be sent aloft with able seaman named barrett to get fore main royal yard across so eager be lad to learn a much a must that barrett very willingly permitted to do work merely directing what to do how to do at same time instructing a to nomenclature purpose of various part of gear be manipulated during operation naturally dick being novice took about twice a long a companion must have taken over job so eager be to learn such aptitude did exhibit that won unqualified approval of barrett a well a of mr sutcliffe who have be keeping sharp eye upon what be going on aloft a for dick although be first time that have ever be aloft in anything deserving name of ship although hull upon looked down seemed ridiculously inadequate to support lofty spar upon be working suggesting idea unless exercised utmost caution in disposition of weight must inevitably capsize entire complicated structure felt giddy nervous went about work with coolness confidence of thoroughly seasoned hand arrived off gravesend anchor be let go ship swung to now fast ebbing tide quarterboat be lowered skipper be rowed ashore while mr sutcliffe went round of deck satisfied that everything have be done to make concordia perfectly ready to get under way at moment notice yard be accurately squared by lift brace running

ship be once more under way two event happened late in afternoon meanwhile occupant of forecastle be sent below to snatch few hour rest in preparation for coming night during dick maitland have opportunity to become better acquainted with messmate for wonder proved to be without exception british consisting of two irishman five scotchman one welshman while rest be english there be nothing very remarkable about of be just ordinary average sailormen did not take dick very long to make up mind that with possible exception of carpenter barrett ab who have be companion instructor aloft during morning five scotchman be pick of bunch hand seemed to be very decent fellow in own rough way now that have have time to recover from previous day debauch manifested distinct disposition to be friendly toward young greenhorn whom found in midst especially a have already have opportunity to see that greenhorn greenness be not of such character a to entail upon very much extra work afternoon be well advanced when at passenger seventeen in number came off to ship moment that baggage be embarked anchor be hove up tug once more came alongside took towrope concordia proceeded upon voyage hope being freely expressed fore aft that there must be no more anchoring until ship must have arrived under shadow so to speak of natal bluff a soon a ship be fairly under way anchor at cathead chief

during watch below fair wind concordia fell in with at mouth of thames lasted long enough to carry ship not only clear of channel also well to westward of ushant captain robert having availed to utmost of opportunity to make a much westing a possible a experience have taught at season of year prevailing wind might expect to meet with to northward of madeira must most probably be strong from south westward event proved correctness of mariner surmise for on seventh day out from gravesend fell in with expected shift of wind four hour later concordia be fighting way to southward under double reefed topsail against heavy fast rising sea seven day have made vast amount of difference to dick maitland so far a usefulness a seaman be concerned in comparatively brief period have contrived not only to learn name function of bit of running rigging in ship also to lay hand unerringly upon required halyard brace sheet downhaul clewline other item of gear in darkest night be a active almost a handy aloft a smartest ab in ship proved to be born helmsman standing trick at wheel from very first leaving straighter wake behind than of other men even when ship be scudding before heavy following sea mr sutcliffe chief mate be delighted with young protege declared in unnecessarily picturesque language that must qualify boy to perform duty of able seaman before natal bluff must heave in sight dick be to prove mettle in quite fashion before long for strong south westerly breeze concordia encountered on seventh day out rapidly developed into so furious gale after battling with for fourteen hour captain robert decided to heave to under close reefed fore main topsail at eight bell noon order be accordingly given to clew up furl already reefed course to haul down stow fore topmast staysail under weather condition of moment be task requiring service of hand by order of chief mate who be conducting operation dick be stationed at weather fore clew garnet with three other hand men having gone to station be waiting for word of command when suddenly chain main tack carried away part attached to sail acting like whip struck one of men who be standing by to ease away smashed poor fellow right arm above elbow shattered jaw laid open right cheek from turn of jaw to right ear be torn away from man head force of blow also be such a to dash unfortunate fellow against bulwark so violently that instantly fell to deck senseless accident naturally at once occasioned utmost confusion in midst of mainsail promptly threshed to rag mate sprang down poop ladder rushed to spot yelling whole string of order to nobody paid slightest attention dick with two three others abandoned post ran to injured man assistance back to station skowbanks roared mate what d 'ye mean by rushing about like flock of frightened sheep d want to see ship dismasted here dick joe pick up carry below to bunk until skipper can attend to beg pardon sir spoke dick be afraid may do poor fellow further injury if attempt to carry below understand that there be spare bunk in deckhouse where boatswain carpenter be quartered may not take in there if will give leave will attend to hurt have studied medicine surgery feel sure can do better for than anyone else excepting of course qualified surgeon dickens say so ejaculated mate staring at dick in amazement very well then in case have better take charge of yes of course take into deckhouse now lad clew up fore course be lively with haul taut clew garnet ease up tack sheet man buntlines leach line be sort up with away aloft of make good snug furl of quickly yet with utmost care injured seaman be lifted up carried into deckhouse where in accordance with dick instruction be laid upon table mattress having first be hurriedly dragged from one of bunk placed to receive then leaving patient for moment in charge of other man dick hurried to forecastle brought up medicine chest have be humphrey parting gift to case of surgical instrument opened placed upon carpenter chest to undisguised admiration horror of assistant who gazed a though fascinated at array of highly polished saw knife scissors other instrument of queer horribly suggestive shape then dexterously removing man jacket shirt while still remained unconscious dick rapidly proceeded to give patient systematic overhaul with object of ascertaining precise nature extent of injury have just completed examination when injured man showed sign of returning consciousness at same moment that skipper having heard from mate particular of accident came bustling into deckhouse with bottle of brandy in one hand tumbler in other intent upon doing something though scarcely knew what for relief of sufferer brandy arrived in nick of time seizing bottle tumbler unceremoniously maitland poured out small quantity held tumbler to patient lip with difficulty man contrived to swallow about teaspoonful considerably revived then with groan of anguish strove to mumble few word in spite of broken jaw now if ever be moment when humphreys ' doctrine of efficacy of hypnotism might be effectively tested fixing man upturned gaze with own in peculiar manner humphreys have described illustrated dick said to patient in quiet yet firm confident tone of voice now tom attempt to say anything ask question listen to have met with accident be not at serious be going to put right make quite comfortable will be obliged to pull about bit understand will suffer pain whatever when have finished with will fall into quiet refreshing sleep from will awake without fever complication of sort now turn over on left side let begin by attending to injury of face to utter amazement of skipper joe man who have assisted dick to carry injured man into deckhouse patient turned quietly over on left side a directed without groan other sign of suffering resigned quite contentedly to dick ministration latter to outward appearance perfectly calm possessed inwardly full of astonishment at complete success of first experiment at once proceeded with quick deft hand to arrange in position shattered fragment of jaw strapping firmly in place with bandage sticking plaster then deftly drew together edge of gashed cheek stitched up wound applied antiseptic dressing bound up injured face in such manner that patient might be enabled to take liquid nourishment without disturbance of dressing lastly placed broken bone of arm in position firmly secured there with splint bandage a dick inserted last pin in bandage arranged arm in comfortable position patient closed eye minute later quiet regular breathing showed that be fast asleep chapter four phil grosvenor proposition well dash wig exclaimed skipper face picture of blank astonishment beat record why man fast asleep in spite of handling of how in name of be wonderful did manage to work miracle youngster oh easily enough laughed dick everything be easy know sir when understand how to do learned how to do great many other very useful thing under one of cleverest men in london man who must be famous for fact that prefers to work in obscurity of east end let poor enjoy benefit of wonderful skill instead of becoming fashionable harley street practitioner with permission sir will look after friend tom here guarantee to have up about again a well a ever before reach latitude of cape do ejaculated skipper then by george sir will have opportunity look here why did tell that be doctor when came asked to allow to work passage out to south africa well see answered dick be rather down on luck just then rather mother have learned only few day before have be robbed of money be imperative must at once go out into world earn more for hence anxiety to go to south africa be so badly off must even afford to pay fare out there therefore determined to work passage a considered that fact of being doctor must be recommendation to decided not to mention ah remarked skipper be just where made big mistake service a medical man must have be far more valuable to than a ordinary seaman besides can do better work than mere pulling hauling dipping hand into tar bucket be gentleman in manner speech will look like one when get into suit of clothes now tell what be be not going to waste by allowing to remain in forecastle longer so just turn to get tar stain off hand shift into white shirt shore going suit of clothes come aft into cuddy a ship surgeon there be very fortunately vacant cabin that can have may earn rest of passage by looking after health of passenger crew there be three four lady who be pretty nearly dead with seasickness if can relieve will bless for discovering oh yes answered dick cheerfully have doubt can relieve right there be one thing with regard to arrangement that perhaps have not thought of captain perhaps passenger will not approve of bringing aft out of forecastle to associate with upon term of equality trouble head about son returned skipper be affair be quite sure that wo object when tell 'em fact of case besides have already noticed while have be at wheel have remarked what well spoken gentlemanly young fellow be will be all right never fear now if have finished with poor chap for while have better cut away make fit for cuddy then shift aft bag baggage very well sir will many thanks to for promotion answered dick can not leave tom here on table comfortable a be therefore with permission sir will call in couple of hand who with joe will be able to put into spare bunk where will be out of everybody way where can attend to quite conveniently to proposal worthy skipper at once consented hour later dick having discarded working clothes for suit of blue serge otherwise made presentable moved aft established in spare cabin captain robert placed at disposal skipper having meanwhile ensured cordial reception for from passenger by telling such particular of dick history a be acquainted with also describing with much picturesque detail masterly manner in lad have patched up injured seaman dick have reason to complain of manner in passenger received among on contrary reception be cordial in extreme especially by woman to whose sense of romance lad story a told by skipper appealed very strongly introduction took place just a passenger at least of who be not too ill be about to sit down to tiffin dick be assigned place at long table halfway between head foot where captain robert mr sutcliffe respectively presided young man declined to sit down until have visited relieved new patient consisting of five lady three men method of dealing with unfortunate be simplicity relying wholly upon wonderful power of hypnotism with friend humphreys have endowed prepared for patient draught consisting of sugar water only slightly flavoured with aromatic bitter a presented got patient under influence in instantaneous manner humphreys have taught at same time saying in quietly confident tone of voice now want to drink please be absolutely unfailing instantaneous remedy for distressing complaint from be suffering moment that have swallowed trace of discomfort will disappear to return more will feel so thoroughly well that very probably will wish to rise dress advise on contrary recommend to remain where be until have have few hour refreshing sleep after can get up to dinner be right a patient swallowed draught now feel quite all right yes will feel very sleepy presently just let go when awake will find a well a ever be in life incredible though may appear be precisely what happened what be perhaps at least equally remarkable be that although good people have suffered more le from seasickness day since leaving gravesend from moment be entirely free from for remainder of voyage among passenger who be thus suddenly completely cured be mr philip grosvenor who having be crossed in love moreover possessing far more money than knew what to do with while have disposition to dissipate on racecourse at gambling table be going out to south africa to shoot big game young man be only month two over twenty six year of age at once struck up warm friendship with dick originating possibly in feeling of gratitude for prompt relief from suffering have hitherto made life burden to from moment when south foreland light have sunk beneath horizon astern of concordia made first advance after dinner on evening of day have witnessed cure a dick have foretold fell asleep immediately after swallowing draught young medico have administered have awakened feeling absolutely well just in time to rise dress for dinner have partaken of very hearty meal thereafter have made way up on poop to gaze upon stirring spectacle of ship battling with gallantly holding own against raging wind sea possibly also to revel in new found immunity from horror of mal de mer here have found dick born sailor walking heaving plunging deck chatting animatedly with mr sutcliffe who honest man felt somewhat at loss to determine precisely manner of behaviour toward youngster whom have so recently patronised ordered about who be now translated aft to quarterdeck upon equal footing with dick have just about succeeded in putting to flight worthy chief mate feeling of awkwardness embarrassment when grosvenor appeared joined pair whereupon sutcliffe who be rather shy with passenger sheered off upon pretence of attending to duty left two together by jove doctor be grand sight be exclaimed dick recent patient never saw like of before must be in form to see now for 'pon word know be wonder perfect wonder give arm let walk about bit will be right d'you know think ever felt more fit in life than do at moment to reflect that only morning be ugh tell what be doctor must patent that prescription of yours have made up sell at five shilling bottle must soon make fortune will write testimonial for took one dose never needed ' eh hang must do either rather too ambiguous eh sort of double meaning in kind of statement what joking apart old man 'd very strongly advise to patent thing advertise extensively be certain that there be money in possibly agreed dick who have intention of taking young man into confidence to extent of explaining actual character of draught unfortunately however to do a suggest need preliminary expenditure of good deal of money be singularly scarce commodity with be afraid that plan of yours will scarcely do be true that be particularly anxious to make fortune too without moment loss of time be afraid will have to hit upon other way of doing ah well what be plan if be fair question excuse old chap be not asking out of mere vulgar impertinent curiosity at dinner table to night somebody mentioned that be working passage out to south africa what do propose to do when arrive there heaven only know certainly answered dick with lugubrious smile when step ashore on wharf at port natal will not know in what direction to turn step where to look for meal night lodging also whole of available capital will consist in wage will take up when captain robert give discharge amounting probably to couple of shilling what ejaculated grosvenor incredulously oh say dear chap be not in earnest surely indeed be then in deadly earnest answered dick be not worrying be strong more than willing to work mean to take very first job come to hand let be what will believe that if chap be willing to work can always get something to do though may not be precisely kind of work that must like when once have secured mean of providing with board lodging will be able to look round for something better yes yes of course will responded grosvenor little dubiously say old chap continued admiringly be gritty beggar mistake wonder if must mind telling story not at answered dick there be nothing in need be ashamed of forthwith proceeded to give new found friend brief yet clear account of circumstance have resulted in being reduced to present plight by jove maitland admire exclaimed grosvenor when dick have come to end of story there be not one man in hundred who under similar circumstance must have tackled situation with indomitable pluck whole hearted belief in that have shown feel sure that such courage will meet with just reward be kind of fellow always come out on top simply because will not allow to be kept down now look here be going to make proposition to understand be on purely selfish ground be going to make be going out to south africa because want to forget well very bitter disappointment have recently sustained particular of will perhaps tell day if fall in with proposition a hope will way in propose to conquer disappointment of mine be to go in for life of adventure exploration of interior big game shooting that sort of thing understand have heard most thrilling story of wonderful thing people be to be found in interior of africa while many of be doubtless lie there be evidence enough of perfectly reliable character to prove that there be at least certain amount of truth in others be purpose to ascertain at firsthand exact measure of truth take for example contention of certain antiquarian that ruin of ophir must exist somewhere upon east coast have read pretty nearly everything have be written upon subject be convinced of soundness of contention a be also of contention that zimbabwe be not ancient ophir then again there be statement of existence of mysterious white race in far interior persistently crop up at interval must be interesting in extreme to be able to settle matter beyond doubt must very well then idea be to attempt to find ancient ophir also mysterious white race if possible of course know that what propose be scarcely in nature of picnic doubt mean good deal of hardship privation danger in fact friend without exception pronounced fool for thinking of engaging in such undertaking while at least half of confidently prophesy that if make attempt will never return well be a may be plenty of better fellow than have gone under in such excursion on other hand a big duffer a be have done great thing turned up again all right so there be particular reason can see why must not do same so far a money be concerned have more than enough to enable to equip expedition in such manner a to ensure minimum of discomfort with maximum of everything necessary to success only item have have doubt a to ability to obtain be suitable companion for of course in maddest moment have never be as enough to contemplate going into so big thing single handed precise kind of man that want be not to be found either among friend elsewhere at home so came away without trusting must be lucky enough to pick up somewhere on way by jove maitland event have justified trust for have found in exactly kind of man have have in mind along rather somebody better for in addition to other qualification have very considerable skill a physician surgeon be what never hoped to secure even in most sanguine moment do wish to infer then that be proposing to take a hired assistant what demanded dick well yes answered grosvenor with somewhat embarrassed laugh a hired assistant certainly because service of fellow like must be of incalculable value to especially when inevitable sickness come along want particularly to secure because well to be perfectly plain blunt because have taken great fancy to because recognise in exactly quality must make of not only invaluable assistant also perfectly ideal partner friend companion therefore in capacity a medical attendant to expedition propose to offer regular fixed salary of let say two guinea day taking one month with sixty five pound month first six month to be paid in advance in capacity of partner ivory skin other matter may accumulate during progress of expedition except what may desire to appropriate a trophy wherewith to adorn ancestral hall dick laughed thank very much said must possibly accede to term be altogether too glaringly unfair salaried part at object to because of course if desire to include medical man in retinue must pay fair salary two guinea day be not too much in opinion when come to talk about share of spoil in capacity of partner becomes different matter altogether since can not contribute farthing to expense of expedition therefore can not by process of reasoning be entitled to share of possible profit if care to engage a doctor at salary that have named will accept post with pleasure most hearty thanks because pay will suffice to keep dear old mater going when return to civilisation if ever do will be able to set about task in earnest of making fortune ' look here dear fellow remonstrated grosvenor be just nonsense in if will excuse saying so to refuse second part of proposal for reason be not undertaking expedition a speculation with idea of making pay have already much larger income than know what to do with for other reason money doe not come into question at like other fellow who go hunting will naturally desire to have few trophy to exhibit a token of prowess beyond will have use at for ivory skin horn such other matter a may acquire therefore may a well have a anyone else especially a be avowedly out fortune hunting besides two guinea day be altogether inadequate rate of remuneration for young fellow of exceptional ability why before have be practising month must be earning four five time amount will be sacrificing possibility for indefinite period if elect to join force with therefore contend that if profit of kind accrue to expedition be justly entitled to will not be content unless consent to take indeed if refuse will be obliged to withdraw offer altogether much a will regret having to do so under circumstance there be of course nothing more to be said finally dick agreed to grosvenor proposal in entirety more readily that after when came to reflect upon there be much truth in what grosvenor have said with regard to possible loss dick might sustain by attaching to expedition burying in wild for more le indefinite period a time went on there must be no doubt a to fact that grosvenor be genuinely pleased with arrangement by have secured dick a companion in projected expedition did make secret of fact that regarded term of agreement a eminently satisfactory from own point of view while dick for part felt that have done not at badly in securing post at salary of sixty five pound month to be enjoyed moment that set foot on shore moreover that salary be sure thing for at least six month since grosvenor insisted upon paying in advance for period dick must be in position to remit quite nice little sum home to mother immediately upon arrival on south african soil party to agreement be thus equally satisfied thenceforward devoted much of time to elaborating plan in order that time must be lost upon arrival grosvenor with confidence of inexperienced be quite prepared unhesitatingly to plunge into very heart of darkest africa with other companion than dick few kafir hottentot boy a servant dick although younger of two have discretion enough to understand that must be very unwise thing to do that must be altogether more prudent in way to secure service of white man well acquainted with country way language of native to act a sort of general overseer factotum view grosvenor at length somewhat unwillingly accepted meanwhile tom injured man made most extraordinarily rapid progress toward recovery under dick skilled treatment much to enhancement of young gentleman reputation appreciable time before period that dick have named be out again on duty very little worse for accident save that right cheek bore scar must carry with to grave at length day arrived when captain robert having worked out observation for determination of ship latitude longitude made welcome announcement that if wind held went well passenger by time thoroughly weary of to most of changeless monotony of sea sky might hope to feast eye upon glowing picture of south african landscape within ensuing twenty four hour at once everybody became cheerfully busy upon task of packing up in preparation for joyous moment when might exchange eternal movement of rocking deck for terra firma rejoice once more in sight of tree grass flower of busy street of much talked of beauty of suburban berea dick maitland possession be so few that needed very little packing to prepare for transit from ship to shore when have finished adjourned to grosvenor cabin to assist that gentleman who since dispensing with service of valet seemed quite incapable of replacing possession in receptacle from have taken upon beginning of voyage remainder of day be passed in animated discussion of future plan arrangement while one effect of imminent termination of long ocean voyage be sudden development of amazing access of cordiality between people who have hitherto manifested little interest in other accompanied by pressing invitation to come stay few day at place whenever happen to be in neighbourhood also few of more enthusiastic occupant of cuddy remained on deck until midnight in hope of catching glimpse of bluff light before turning in only to retire to cabin discontented grumbling because at eight bell gleam still obstinately refused to appear on horizon over port bow where mr sutcliffe chief mate have be anxiously watching for full compensation came to disappointed one when awakened on following morning about six o'clock by voice of mate issuing certain sharp order from poop followed by flinging down of rope upon deck cheery yo ho of sailor a threw weight upon various portion of

green beautiful in clear atmosphere light of early morning to vision of whose eye after seventy day of gazing upon sky sea be yearning to behold once more beauty of solid earth for full hour ship remained hove to with head to seaward during early breakfast be served to occupant of cuddy then upon appearance of tug coming out over bar concordia wore round headed inshore light sail be rapidly clewed up hauled down towline be got ready for passing in moment everything be bustle apparent confusion upon ship deck barefooted seaman rushing hither thither flinging down coil of rope on deck casting off halyard sheet dragging vociferously upon clew garnet clewlines downhauls other complicated paraphernalia of ship furniture with captain shouting order from poop mate in charge of gang of men on forecastle getting anchor cockbill ready for letting go preparing for arrival of tug alongside then up came little steamer rolling pitching heavily upon long ground swell sweeping round in long curve brought alongside wallowing ship brief interchange of hail between bridge concordia poop sudden snaking out of whirling heaving line from forecastle of latter followed by thin tremendously strong steel towing hawser a few remaining sheet of ship canvas shrivelled in to mast yard tug passed ahead towrope rose dripping out of water tautened to semblance of metal rod away went two craft heading for middle of space of water divided two breakwater hour later concordia came to anchor in spacious willow inner harbour opposite railway station long voyage be at end eager passenger be not yet at liberty to go on shore although concordia carried clean bill of health certain formality have yet to be gone through medical officer have still to satisfy that there be sickness of infectious kind on board before pratique be granted a medical officer happened to be thoroughly conscientious man determination of fact consumed full hour at length tedious examination came to end ship be pronounced perfectly healthy boat have be hovering round be permitted to come alongside then ensued few minute of strenuous bargaining between passenger boatman at end of time dick grosvenor having said goodbye to captain officer dick also included crew in farewell found being pulled across few yard of water intervened between ship shore presently stood upon sun blistered wharf fighting way through odoriferous crowd of shouting laughing gesticulating more than half naked kafir rickshaw men who clamoured for honour of dragging mile so that separated point from durban custom house officer have first to be placated grosvenor disgustedly found obliged to disburse goodly sum a duty upon firearm ammunition before be permitted to retain possession of at length however custom barrier be successfully negotiated then dick in one rickshaw grosvenor in baggage in third two friend proceeded in triumph along bush bordered road over level crossing of railway so up smith street to royal hotel where purposed to put up for day two where upon arrival joined fellow passenger at hilarious second breakfast in accordance with arrangement made at cabin table few hour earlier chapter five

fourteen mile farther up coast on other side of umhloti river invitation dick must fain have declined for be impatient to begin real business lay before grosvenor be so charmed with country everything that saw in especially with spontaneous kindness friendliness hospitality of people that seemed in hurry to rush away from bury in wilderness a happened of young men have reason to regret time thus spent for host old time transport rider named mitchell have penetrated far beyond zambezi in younger day be experienced hunter knew interior inhabitant peculiarity a well a if not better than other man living be brimful of information hint absolutely invaluable to new arrival freely imparted when told of nature scope of young men projected adventure however shook head dubiously strongly urged to abandon idea of attempting more than just few month big game shooting mind said strongly sympathise with in very ambitious aim ridiculous a many men must pronounce for be animated by precisely same desire when be youngster of about age turning to grosvenor by jove say so ejaculated grosvenor surprised delighted to meet man of such wide experience a mitchell who did not pronounce plan chimerical for must be stated that thus far enunciation of plan have be almost invariably received with covert open ridicule then continued do understand that believe in possibility of finding site of ancient ophir well yes may understand to mean that in general way be mitchell somewhat guarded admission continued if ask whether think probable that will discover ophir mysterious white race rumour have asserted to exist somewhere in far interior answer certainly not dickens exclaimed grosvenor why dear sir why well if will not be offended by exceeding candour chiefly because think much too young too inexperienced to have chance of succeeding in so very formidable undertaking be somewhat discouraging reply yes of course admitted grosvenor be true that be quite inexperienced youth be surely in favour rather than against for be strong healthy doubt will soon become inured to fatigue hardship even privation have splendid constitution moreover friend maitland here be doctor surgeon of quite remarkable ability fact regard a of utmost importance then a to matter of experience imagine that be bound to acquire that a go on be not going to be transported into heart of wild in few hour by express train know answered mitchell with somewhat grim smile be quite true a be also contention that will acquire experience a go on then of course fact that mr maitland be doctor surgeon of be unaware be great point in favour when be said still think that will find undertaking too much for why by way did ever hear of certain charles menzies explorer mean yes have heard of in fact believe be account of travel that first put idea into head answered grosvenor ah remarked mitchell cryptically wonder just how much have heard respecting travel well not very much must confess acknowledged grosvenor so far a can remember amounted simply to statement that after one of long absence from civilisation returned with story that have actually discovered site of ancient ophir that have gathered reliable information concerning existence of mysterious white race be to be one of object of quest just so commented mitchell relapsing into pregnant silence be evident that be intently considering difficult question presently looked up said knew menzies very well in younger day a matter of fact saved life for have not happened to have fallen in with picked up must have inevitably perished in case public must never have heard of extraordinary rumour respecting discovery that afterwards leaked out be away up country elephant hunting at time found seventy mile side of zambezi in last stage of exhaustion from starvation be then returning from journey made famous have lost everything possessed even to rifle be therefore nothing short of marvellous that have contrived to make way a far back a did when found be too ill to talk much when first picked up afterwards when grew stronger told whole astounding story of journey adventure talked of publishing narrative very strongly dissuaded from doing so for a pointed out to there be portion of narrative be of so absolutely incredible character nobody must believe story must lose value from fact that must be regarded a merely fantastic fabrication must gain reputation of unblushing romancer to tell truth be firmly persuaded at time that what have gone through have affected brain that be victim of series of most weird horrible illusion have reason to modify opinion in respect few year afterward although be still unable to make up mind definitely a to just how much of story be true how much be due to imagination have become warped distorted by peril suffering by jove exclaimed grosvenor with sort of thrill in voice say know be intensely interesting eh what wonder if must mind repeating to few of statement found so difficult to believe at time with regard to be afterwards inclined to modify opinion well answered mitchell be afraid must ask to excuse from doing that see menzies be friend one of finest fellow that ever lived be dead now poor chap must not willingly say single word might cause anyone else to think lightly of picture in mind a other than very soul of truth honour yet if be to repeat to of statement have in mind know that two hard headed matter of fact englishman must at once set down a veriest fairy tale author second munchausen credulous old fool for attaching slightest weight to yet let tell africa be very queer country a will discover if persist in attempting to carry out plan queer thing happen in thing strain man credulity to breaking point until have have personal experience of that remark of shakespeare that there be more thing in heaven earth than be reckoned in philosophy ' be nowhere more forcefully confirmed than in continent of africa especially in part of be practically unknown to white man why even here close at hand among neighbour zulu there have be happening well authenticated mind be absolutely unexplainable by knowledge that white posse think have prosed enough for one sitting be growing late one o'clock a be living sinner must be growing tired do wonder why have told thing well be because must like to dissuade from mad scheme of yours experience tell can only end in disaster induce to content yourselves with two month hunting trip in company of good man who know country can be trusted to see that come to harm now good night of think over what have said sleep well dream of fantastic horror such a talk may have suggested if mr joseph mitchell sugar planter thoroughly honest well meaning man flattered that foregoing conversation must have other effect than to stimulate curiosity of guest confirm in determination to carry out plan in entirety very greatly over estimated persuasive power completely misread character of to whom have be talking for grosvenor maitland be of highly adventurous disposition what mitchell have told have simply whetted curiosity to keen edge have strongly suggested to that adventure promised to be of even more alluring thrilling character than have ever ventured to hope even in most sanguine moment so much indeed made clear to host when met next morning at breakfast table when must have made further attempt at dissuasion laughingly assured that mind be finally made up that kindest thing must now do for must be to give a much information a many hint wrinkle a must think of to help to satisfactory conclusion of adventure mitchell proceeded to do when at conviction have be borne in upon that effort at dissuasion be worse than useless when two day later took leave of genial planter dick carried away with notebook crowded from cover to cover with information be destined to prove of incalculable value to companion a well a sketch map showing best route to follow certain locality be to be most carefully avoided if desired to return sane sound to civilisation arrived in durban once more after most delightful jaunt at once set about making preparation in earnest one of first thing grosvenor insisted upon doing being payment to dick of six month salary in advance from date of landing upon south african soil practically whole of dick be able to remit home to mother since grosvenor must not hear of contributing so much a single penny toward expense of expedition therefore junior member of partnership have need to spend anything except for few curio thought mother might like to display to friend laid in few additional drug also added spare instrument two to surgical case to cover possibility of loss accident three day later started for johannesburg by way of delagoa bay pretoria grosvenor being very anxious to get glimpse of life on rand to gain knowledge of diamond diamond mining before finally bade farewell to civilisation since johannesburg lay on direct line of route knowledge sought might possibly prove useful in future dick raised objection to proposal especially a went armed with letter of introduction from mitchell to of most influential of rand magnate others whose advice assistance must be exceedingly helpful busy three week spent in city at witwatersrand enriched with much very valuable information particular general also enabled to acquire four excellent horse indian coolie groom named ramoo samee who not only bore most admirable character also raised objection when informed of nature scope of adventure upon employer be bound here too also at pretoria partner endeavoured to secure service of hunter a guide general superintendent be unable to meet with one who conformed in respect to requirement therefore ultimately decided to defer further quest until arrival in bulawayo be to be point from must finally bid farewell to civilisation upon arrival at bulawayo although met with difficulty in providing with brand new wagon team of twenty salted ox together with hottentot driver named jantje kafir boy named a voorlouper suitable candidate for post of guide offered must be found finally after devoting full week to fruitless search enquiry dick grosvenor agreed to start without one trust to luck own good sense everybody with one solitary exception declared that be most risky thing to do solitary exception in shape of old boer farmer named van zyl applauded pluck declared that be far more likely to succeed by learning lesson of wild for depending upon own courage adaptiveness than if set out under guidance of remained more le in leading string throughout journey what must advise said be that must look out for good nigger will be far more helpful to than white man will be content to be good servant to if be careful to keep in proper place instead of trying to be master sounded like good sensible advice coming a did from man who have be born brought up have spent long life on borderline separating civilisation from savagedom finally confirmed in determination to have already practically come to do without white guide according to mitchell route from bulawayo lay generally in north easterly direction accordingly after transacting business making possible preparation for long journey before writing final letter home announcing fact that be about to plunge into wilderness that therefore further news must be expected of for indefinite period set out about ten o'clock on certain glorious morning boldly striking straight out across veldt directing course by compass wagon be already fully loaded load consisting of several air tight case of ammunition six barrel of flour cask of sugar bag of coffee chest of tea small keg of brandy to be used only in case of utmost emergency case containing pickle condiment preserve salt other article of similar character to be regarded a luxury used accordingly own personal belonging including clothes firearm small tent made of waterproof material for sleeping in two net hammock with portable support full set of cooking utensil four sack of mealie meal finally two large box of bead of various kind quantity of brass wire case of cheap mechanical other toy small mirror etcetera grosvenor have have foresight to bring out from england with last three item being destined to be employed in bartering with native constituted quite a heavy load a be at desirable to put upon wagon although full team of twenty ox made light of especially a be now dry season ground be firm hard for travelling a for dick grosvenor travelled on horseback changing steed at outspan in order to accustom animal to gradually to get into good hard condition by working to certain extent day rode armed with good serviceable sporting rifle capable of dealing with practically game except elephant formidable hunting knife revolver in addition of carried pair of finest most powerful binocular glass grosvenor have be able to procure in london have have foresight to provide two pair in case of accident be fortunate for now rider be independent of other acting upon advice of friend van zyl confined strictly to short trek averaging about five mile three trek per day for first four day in order to keep ox in good condition a long a possible first four day of march be quite uneventful going be good grass still rich abundant water plentiful there be just enough game to keep party well supplied with meat while animal worked well improved in condition rather than otherwise especially horse proved to be even more promising than owner have hoped for when purchased be on morning of fifth day that party encountered what might be spoken of a first exciting incident occurred rather began a be nearing end of first trek about nine o'clock in morning dick grosvenor mounted a usual with half dozen dog constituted pack quartering ground ahead of be nearly mile ahead of wagon looking out for suitable spot for first outspan when sudden clamour on part of dog who have just disappeared over low rise in ground caused two rider to put spur to horse in order to see what be cause of outcry short gallop sufficed to carry to crest of ridge when beheld dog baying snarling round fine well set up native boy who armed with assagai knobkerrie constituted one of party of thirty in number who appeared to be guarding herd of about three hundred grazing cattle while about mile farther on be native village of fifty kafir hut of usual beehived shape built in midst of number of mealie field occupying area of roughly about square mile situated near bank of small stream dick maitland who have early developed rather remarkable aptitude for picking up language of native at once cantered forward calling off dog demanded to know name of village where must be best place at to outspan native whom addressed who seemed to be labouring under considerable excitement replied with rapid flow of word that speech be utterly unintelligible save that communication have something to do with lion boy pointing first to big clump of bush about mile distant then to village dick made several attempt to arrive at better understanding of nature of communication without very marked success at length suggested that grosvenor must ride back to wagon hurry forward in order jantje hottentot driver might act a interpreter be done about twenty minute later wagon arrived situation be explained to jantje who forthwith poured out flood of eloquence upon little band of native who by time have gathered round dick be earnestly endeavouring to make understand something that evidently regarded a of very great importance brief animated conversation at once ensued at end of jantje turned to employer explained dhese people say sars dat dhere be four five lion in de bush yander dhey won ' go 'way dhey wan ' to know if white gentbeen be so kind a to kill dhem lion because if dhey not be killed dhey kill de poor kafir cattle two day ago dhem lion kill two ox mo ' horrible maul de boy dat be herding dhem phew lion eh exclaimed grosvenor say maitland be good news eh what be longing for chance to have pot at lion right jantje tell that will kill lion for with greatest of pleasure will outspan at once set about business forthwith will be right thing to do suppose dick wo yes certainly answered dick by mean before think of tackling lion must see that poor beggar who be mauled two day ago by jove dread to think of what state of wound must be in hot weather be if be still alive just ask jantje whether boy who be mauled be still living whether lion killed question be put jantje duly interpreted reply yes sar de boy still alive most drefful sick dhese people say good exclaimed dick dismounting from horse then say to that be great doctor intend to save poor fellow life if can want one of to carry medicine chest for to take to injured man hut then have better take wagon down outspan near river where grass be good where ox be not likely to get among mealie then come to for will probably need to interpret for first part of speech being interpreted to little crowd of native one of at once stepped forward expressing a willing to carry medicine chest act a guide while volunteered to point out suitable convenient spot upon to outspan others forthwith breaking into song of thanksgiving in announced to sundry that be lucky day inasmuch a that white belungus be not only going to make well again brother who be nigh unto death be also going to utterly root out destroy cunning beast who refused to come out into open face assagai grosvenor announced intention of accompanying dick five minute later pair with sable guide leading way carrying medicine chest be en route for village dick carrying case of surgical instrument under arm rifle left with wagon deeming unnecessary to cumber with superfluous weapon in face of fact that villager be obviously quite friendly disposed to white men indeed be still too close to civilisation to anticipate anything else a neared village boy who preceded began to shout great news that white men be coming to make whole injured man occupant of hut to number of about two hundred men woman child swarmed out to gaze upon stranger guide who be inclined to put on air upon strength of being bearer of white men muti must fain have made most of occasion by pausing in centre of village haranguing fellow dick nipped intention ruthlessly in bud by repeating several time in imperative tone of voice word hamba go presently procession for occupant of village formed up followed trio came to halt in front of one of hut a bearer of medicine chest pushed burden in through low narrow entrance of hut dropped on hand knee in order to follow dick turned perceiving disposition on part of crowd to gather close about entrance so exclude what little light air might otherwise make way in took assagai from hand of astonished native holding by blade waved press back with butt end of weapon then still waving butt end described on ground arc of circle of twelve foot radius from hut entrance returning weapon to owner pointed to mark on ground addressing curiosity ridden mob said impressively in english now good people please have goodness to keep carefully outside line oblige yours truly there be not one of odoriferous dark skinned kafir who comprehended word of english dick action tone of voice be so expressive that meaning be almost a distinctly understood a though have spoken in language of tribe saw at once that be so that wish must be obeyed signing to grosvenor to precede forthwith passed into hut entering windowless structure straight from dazzling sunshine flooded outside world two englishman found plunged for moment in darkness so profound that must see nothing be fain to stand just where rose to foot after creeping through low doorway lest moving must stumble over something possibly patient in addition to hot close odour of interior of hut there be taint assailed nostril taint of festering wound with dick be already familiar shook head doubtfully a turned to figure of grosvenor just beginning to reveal in midst of enveloping obscurity said like at ca see patient a yet there be certain something in atmosphere of hut tell that if poor beggar life be to be saved have time to waste where be wonder oh think see there on ground at far side from doorway yes there be minute will be able to see clearly meanwhile perhaps pulse will tell something crossing to far side of hut knelt down by side of indistinctly seen man felt for hand having found laid finger upon wrist chapter six encounter with lion um murmured dick a feeble throbbing of man pulse met finger tip quite a expected very low weak evidently sinking from exhaustion must have out of into better light although be almost afraid to run risk of moving still must be done can see nothing here went to door of hut looked out crowd still grouped on outside of curve have described on ground respectfully making way before there be small densely foliaged tree growing at great distance from hut casting strong shadow upon ground that dick decided must be a good place a for purpose a be about to re enter hut there arose slight commotion upon outskirt of crowd presently jantje hottentot driver appeared endeavouring to force way through to master sight be welcome one for dick felt very much at loss with one to interpret for in tone of unmistakable relief lifted up voice shouted come along jantje be just man wanted then a hottentot joined continued see here jantje want wounded man very carefully removed from hut carried over yonder into shadow of tree just explain to fellow will ask to help sooner said than done with passing of last word through jantje lip dozen stalwart kafir dived into hut in moment reappeared bearing between unhappy patient stretched upon eland skin be exceedingly awkward job to get poor fellow out through low narrow doorway of hut managed somehow in minute have satisfactorily disposed beneath shadow of tree then dick approached proceeded to examine hurt have be severe enough to start with now after nearly forty eight hour of neglect condition be so indescribably loathsome that even dick seasoned hand though be nearly vomited at sight of while a for grosvenor be compelled to beat precipitate retreat returned gamely five minute later to see if must be of assistance dick however although have never in life before beheld anything approaching dreadful sight quickly pulled together professional instinct promptly asserting ordered hot water to be brought to while be being prepared opened medicine chest case of surgical instrument rest of inhabitant of village gathering round in wide silent awestruck circle have often before seen similar sight be therefore in measure accustomed to knew what patient condition meant there be not one among who did not regard injured man a already a good a dead nevertheless curiosity be powerfully aroused for have heard many wonderful story of white men who have lately come into country toward south be eager to see whether not be true that must perform miracle a have be asserted a for dick found confronted at outset by very serious difficulty patient condition be such that must not possibly do what be necessary without inflicting upon unfortunate man amount of suffering that in low exhausted condition threatened to result in collapse death man be too far gone indeed to justify use of anaesthetic yet without dick feared to proceed what be to do suddenly bethought of hypnotism yet how hypnotise man whose language must not speak then remembered very remarkable statement humphreys have made when discussing same subject of hypnotism be not actual word address to patient humphreys have asserted command will imposes on produce desired effect can be obtained without employment of word at if will be strong enough remember also that abnormal strength of will be needed if patient be passive unresisting surely thought dick ought to meet present case at event be well worth trying so here go therewith bent over patient fixing man gaze in peculiar manner humphreys have taught silently willed to sink into so deep sleep that must feel nothing of what be about to be done to almost immediately man eyelid fluttered closed sank into profound sleep breathing slowly deeply a must be seen by regular rise fall of bare brawny chest wao bekulu betagati wizard great wizard murmured astonished crowd of onlooker behind hand gazing wonderingly in other eye again dick laid finger on patient pulse already be stronger more steady very gently raised one of man eyelid lightly laid finger upon eyeball patient might have be dead for effect that touch have upon then warm water opportunely arriving young doctor got to work without further delay strongly impregnating water with antiseptic proceeded rapidly to cleanse wound taking pair of scissors knife from time to time removing already putrefying flesh then proceeded to dress wound one after other with healing ointment drawing edge together where necessary with few stitch when at length after more than hour diligent careful work labour came to end ordered wagon cartel to be brought to village door of man hut to be enlarged window opening to be made finally when thing have be done to satisfaction caused comfortable bed to be arranged upon cartel with skin borrowed from other hut man to be laid thereon taken back to hut time patient have be sleeping a calmly a infant time have now however arrived when must be aroused in order that anti febrifuge might be administered dick therefore once more bent over man strongly willing to awake instantly did when through jantje a interpreter question be put to how felt immediately replied in wonderfully strong voice considering condition that felt much better that wound be no longer so painful a have be whereupon dick administered draught telling still through jantje immediately after taking must again fall asleep so remain until evening when must awake much refreshed stronger while word be being spoken dick strongly willed that must be fulfilled man obediently gulped down draught dick gently lowered patient head to pillow again deep sleep fell upon poor fellow now ordered dick want two woman to come watch by man must constantly fan with leaf to keep cool prevent fly from troubling when wake someone must immediately fetch will be in tent by wagon yonder then turning to grosvenor who have remained at elbow time said more trekking for to day phil for next week expect must stay pull poor chap through if can now have taken in hand oh yes rather of course go without saying cheerfully assented grosvenor say dick old chap continued have astonished to day fairly taken breath away have slightest notion that be swell at profession a have just proved to be never saw anything like in life before y'know must have believed if have seen why must have given three have'pence for kafir life when first set eye upon now dash believe be going to set on foot again if do fame will spread far wide through country do lot of good say be jolly lucky thing for that poor chap dropped off into sound sleep just when did eh because enabled to do several thing that seems to must possibly have done have remained awake what puzzle be that continued to sleep through noticed that did seem to worry in least about whether awoke not suppose be sleep be not oh yes answered dick airily be sleep right enough nothing in nature of swoon about if be what mean now what about lion patient will sleep for several hour to come can quite well leave be now consulting watch only few minute past eleven o'clock ought to be able to organise hunt bag beast comfortably before tiffin be game bet be rather responded grosvenor be just what be itching to suggest thought must seem callous to propose that must leave patient must not have be sporting to have proposed to go off alone leaving behind oh be right returned dick confidently patient will not need for hour yet so let see about at once where be jantje jantje be close at elbow already putting on side among villager upon strength of being in service of bekulu betagati stepped forward at question answered with air of proud humility here sar what please to want mr grosvenor be going to have try for lion jantje if be still lurking in neighbourhood observed dick believe said that people report beast to be somewhere in yonder clump of bush very well now want party to enter bush on windward side carefully beat down wind in order to drive brute into open mr grosvenor will place ourselves on down wind side of bush if lion can be induced to break cover will do best to bowl over will also require two steady reliable men to come with to carry spare rifle understand must be men of courage who will not be scared out of seven sens bolt carrying rifle off with if lion must show in open yes sar answered jantje understan puffekly leave everyt'ing to sar arrange jus a wish ' will come wid sar to carry gun be brabe man sar pusson in dhis worl more brabe a will see sar very well answered dick suppressing smile at hottentot vainglorious boast being so exceedingly brave reliable will go with mr grosvenor must pick out good man to come with just see about will bring whole party to wagon where be now going to get rifle puffed up with honour of having so important matter confided to hottentot saluted turned to address crowd still hung about white men awaiting possible further development explaining to what be required few word sufficed moment that white man intention wish be understood crowd dissolved a if by magic men hurrying away to hut to procure weapon while dick grosvenor sauntered away toward wagon noting a went that team of ox have be driven to spot where grass be especially good close to bank of river that be being zealously watched guarded by dozen well grown lad armed with hunting assagai knobkerry arrived at wagon two friend proceeded to bring forth don bandolier having first satisfied that belt be filled with kind of cartridge required for particular pattern of weapon be about to employ then having taken down loaded four rifle intended to use awaited arrival of beating party conscious now for first time of peculiar not altogether pleasant feeling compounded of excitement be funk certainly not for neither of must have backed out of adventure on account yet if sensation be not funk bore sort of family resemblance to something perhaps in nature of stage fright fact be that realised at nearly same moment that be about to embark upon perfectly new experience adventure in be a yet untried in courage most perfect sangfroid be of utmost importance be by mean certain how must emerge from ordeal to put plainly be just little afraid that at critical moment might fail to exhibit superlative coolness aplomb slightest lack of must cause to feel for ever humiliated disgraced in eye of other besides there be native keen of eye quick to observe smallest sign of anything approaching to perturbation must be awful beyond word to fail before by curious coincidence mind of have be following precisely same line of thought a saw jantje approaching followed by forty beater mongrel cur belonging to village same resolution came to simply must not disgrace colour by displaying slightest sign of nervousness trepidation in eye of savage so drawing deep breath pulled together resolutely dismissing apprehension prepared to do die proudly leading party of beater hottentot approached giving sort of semi military salute announced that villager awaited order of white chief to proceed then leading forward tall savage of thirty five year of age of magnificent physique introduced man a mafuta half brother of injured man informed dick that mafuta have specially requested honour of being allowed to act a gunbearer to brother benefactor on occasion dick ran eye over man noted splendid development of thews sinew marked several ugly scar on body limb bearing mute testimony to fact that have already proved warrior met unflinching glance proud resolute yet respectful instantly decided that here be man who might be absolutely trusted without hesitation placed spare rifle in mafuta hand explaining to through jantje exactly what wished to do with then issued final instruction to beater who at once moved off to work round to windward side of clump of bush in lion be said to be hiding while grosvenor followed respectively by jantje mafuta took leisurely way toward point where intended to station for considerable part of distance walked together when at length separated dick who somehow seemed to have assumed direction of affair a matter of course with grosvenor tacit consent approval said now phil anything may break cover to right of baobab a stand facing belongs to while anything emerges to left belongs to of to interfere with other chance unless brute seem likely to get away make good escape just one caution old chap fire until quarry have passed out clear of line of bush may quite unintentionally shoot one of beater ah there be dog giving tongue beater be putting into bush to station old man good luck to thanks same to old chap cheerily responded grosvenor a wheeled strode away to spot fixed upon a station clump of bush in lion be said to have secreted be isolated one with nothing in particular to distinguish from thousand of other clump dotted visible country except one extremity of abutted upon edge of small willow ravine through trickled tiny rivulet discharging into larger stream flow through long valley intersected landscape close to spot where clump of bush touched edge of ravine rivulet flowed into through willow basin of rock formed ideal drinking place for animal be possibly circumstance have caused lion to take up temporary abode in particular clump there be possibility that lion when breaking cover might attempt to escape by bolting into up ravine accordingly when fact have be pointed out explained to dick have very unselfishly placed friend grosvenor on side in order that latter might have benefit of most likely chance barking yelping of dog grew steadily louder more insistent to be presently added shout shrill whistling of kafir a forced way through thick undergrowth few bird flew out with startled cry for about quarter of hour there be further result then suddenly dog burst into chorus of sharp savage bark entirely different in character from former utterance quite sufficient in to inform even veriest novice game of sort be afoot kafir cry of encouragement be redoubled occasional rustling crackling of branch became audible to intent watcher presently there arose terrific outburst of furious snarlings growl yappings intermingled with violent swishing crackling of dry leaf twig evidence conclusive that fight be proceeding in heart of bush then sudden sharp agonised pow wow of dog in pain rang out accompanied by horrible sound of worrying still further increase of hubbub followed then heavy crashing of bush out sprang magnificent tawny maned lion into open broke into view immediately opposite to dick not more than twenty yard distant stopping dead a sighted lad standing rifle in hand with mafuta like bronze statue behind a splendid beast stood at gaze with blazing eye tail switching in short angry jerk from side to side feeling of anxiety nervousness have be oppressing dick seemed to drop from like garment in instant became absolutely cool steady possessed lifting rifle to shoulder with lightning like movement while sight of weapon seemed to line of own volition upon centre of beast broad forehead right between eye pressed trigger there be flash sharp whip like report faint puff of smoke lion dropped stone dead where stood meanwhile hubbub in bush be raging even more fiercely than ever showing that beast have just fallen to dick rifle have not be cause of that sport be by mean over dick weapon be magazine rifle with quick movement jerked cartridge into position just a uproar grew so loud near at hand that became evident break be imminent next instant occurred splendid lioness carrying small cub in mouth crashed into open with dozen more yapping snarling cur at heel broke cover well on grosvenor side of baobab like lion came to abrupt halt a soon a saw grosvenor straight toward whom be charging in instant white man rifle leapt to shoulder next instant fired even a pressed trigger dog more valiant more foolhardy than rest dashed in upon with rapidity of lightning turned to meet rush dropping cub nearly tearing miserable cur head from shoulder with single stroke of powerful fore paw at same instant grosvenor bullet aimed at head crashed into flank passing right through utterly paralysing hind quarter with whining snarling roar poor beast rolled over on side instantly recovered so far a to raise on fore leg between cub trifle bigger than well grown cat took refuge jaw champing foaming eye blazing lightning at dog recognising helplessness closed in round save cub shouted dick let dog worry want to keep little beast alive leaving position hurried forward regardless of danger to beat off dog grosvenor jantje also rushed forward at shout be quickly joined by mafuta who seemed to divine what dick required dashing fearlessly in among snarling snapping dog kafir hottentot at length succeeded in beating off upon grosvenor stepped close up to lioness gave coup de grace by sending bullet through brain a rolled over dead mafuta sprang in grabbed cub by skin of neck despite fact that snarled spat like angry cat struck out viciously with claw be already strong enough to inflict quite painful scratch carried off to wagon tying to wheel by stout reim having ensured safety of cub dick carrying own spare rifle have snatched from mafuta hurried back to point have so hurriedly deserted for commotion in heart of bush clearly evidenced fact that remaining member of troop of lion still clung to cover that beater dog be doing utmost to dislodge laying spare rifle at foot dick stood facing great clump with rifle in hand at ready prepared for emergency noise confusion however seemed to indicate that next event must occur in area under grosvenor jurisdiction sure enough about minute later lion lioness broke cover together followed by remainder of dog noble beast of be apparently young animal barely full grown evidently intended to make for fresh cover in ravine finding grosvenor blocking way came to sudden halt upon dog instantly gathered round yapping snarling furiously while individual member made sudden feint of dashing in only to retreat precipitately with tail between leg a infuriated beast turned way to meet rush crowding clamouring dog with quick rush incessant twist turn of regal pair to meet rush be anything conducive to good shooting grosvenor with rifle to shoulder held fire watching for favourable opportunity suddenly came dog more venturesome than rest sprang at lion be caught by planting front paw on body of unhappy cur lion stood for moment glaring at foe in moment grosvenor pulled trigger bullet striking great beast full in massive chest for perhaps quarter of minute lion stood absolutely motionless eye blazing defiance then suddenly collapsed with half whine half roar slowly rolled over on side great head sank to earth limb stretched stiffly out with violent shudder yielded up life grosvenor chose moment to inject fresh cartridge into chamber of rifle something went wrong with weapon while be still fidgeting with forgetful of fact that jantje be standing behind with second rifle fully charged in hand lioness with mighty snarling roar sent dog scuttling in direction crouched with evident intention of springing upon slayer of lord for moment dick who be interestedly watching scene took action for according to arrangement come to between lioness belonged of right to grosvenor then realising that friend be in peril shouted excitedly shoot phil shoot brute will be upon at same time lifting own weapon to shoulder ca returned grosvenor still struggling with rifle beastly thing crack dick instantly pressed trigger a did so lioness rose into air with curious writhing movement falling short of spot where grosvenor stood by about foot a fell rolled headlong instantly recovered standing upon three leg with fourth broken close to shoulder while grosvenor stepping back hurriedly in long grass to avoid be tripped up fell flat upon back fearing that despite broken leg lioness might spring upon prostrate friend badly maul dick impetuously sprang forward injecting new cartridge a ran stopped short convulsed with laughter at sight of friend long leg flourishing in air rolling with frantic energy out of reach of lioness then a grosvenor finally scrambled to foot minus rifle have dropped during hurried retreat while jantje have incontinently bolted carrying grosvenor second rifle with a lioness sprang dick again levelled piece bowled great tawny brute over with bullet behind ear penetrated brain thus satisfactorily terminated adventurer first experience with big game of sportsman bagging lion lioness while cub might be regarded a joint property of two very satisfactory feature of day sport be that nobody have received so much a scratch actual casualty amounting to two kafir dog slain a for kafir fell upon carcass with incredible rapidity skill stripped off hide pegged out preparatory to treating in native fashion afterwards removing head carefully depositing in near vicinity of ant nest in order that insect might remove a very speedily must atom of flesh from bone then having rendered service to champion who have delivered from formidable enemy departed dancing to village singing triumphant song to glory of white men in incident of recent hunt be graphically described with appropriate gesture chapter seven makolo country full week be spent by traveller among friendly villager during dick maitland assiduously tended wounded man who by end of time thanks in part to own healthy flesh blood result of simple frugal living more largely to young doctor skilful treatment have advanced so far toward recovery that nature might safely be left to complete cure week have be not altogether unprofitably spent in other respect two white men assiduously devoting with mafuta assistance to study of native language varied occasionally on dick part by little botanising during discovered dozen plant seemed to posse valuable property taming of lion cub after first two three day of captivity responded with ever growing alacrity to young master advance until by end of six week have learned to answer to name of leo to come at dick call whistle in short have become a tame a dog result gentleness of disposition leo manifested dick attributed largely to fact that animal be never allowed to taste blood raw flesh of kind food after milk diet for first three week of captivity consisting entirely of well roasted native witnessed preparation for departure of white friend with manifestation of sincere regret assisting to drive up inspan ox presenting fine milch cow for leo especial benefit a well a quantity of mealie banana other garden produce warning traveller of various difficulty danger lurked on next hundred mile so of route carefully instructing how might best be avoided in many other way making plain sorrow with bade farewell finally when ox be inspanned wagon be on very point of moving off mafuta who have hitherto be missing presented in full marching order armed with shield assagai knobkerrie with plumed head dress cow tail bound about leg below knee curtly informed dick that be fixed intention to join party although dick grosvenor did utmost to dissuade by representing to great length exceeding danger of journey upon be bound possibility that might never return be of avail alternately insisted entreated declaring that wanted wage reward of kind dick have pulled brother back out of grave felt to be duty a well a pleasure to devote henceforward to service of white man who have done wonderful thing finally when dick loath to take man away from kith kin definitely refused to take kafir countered by saying in effect very well veldt be free to if will not permit to join party can at least follow at distance be at hand whenever require service after of course there be more to be said mafuta be allowed to have own way to great joy of brother of village be very long before traveller have abundant reason to congratulate upon decision in respect for mafuta not only proved to be most intelligent devoted servant also splendid guide knowing exact locality of various stream waterholes on route a far a zambezi also most favourable crossing place where best grass most game be to be found most important of perhaps exact boundary of fly country indeed for last knowledge be almost certain that in anxiety to take shortest possible cut must probably have lost practically cattle thus have be obliged to bring adventure to premature end on ninth day out from mafuta village struck hanyani river without meeting with adventure worthy of record following right bank for couple of day bore away in easterly direction skirting northern slope of mount inyota where struck small stream flowing to northward eastward a be broadly speaking direction in wished to travel a mafuta assured that discharged into zambezi decided to follow did so finding eventually that united flow with stream followed still without particular adventure save such a daily occurred while hunting three week from day on mafuta joined traveller found gazing with delight upon broad bosom of zambezi water sparkling in golden light of westering sun here again mafuta knowledge proved to be of utmost value for be able to guide party to spot where river be fordable where succeeded in effecting crossing same evening before sunset once safely arrived on left bank of river grosvenor dick decided to camp for few day in order to give ox rest grass being good also there be small native village few mile higher upstream where canoe crew might be hired within easy paddling distance of there be spot where hippopotamus still abounded affording prospect of good sport of grosvenor be particularly anxious to avail accordingly while hottentot jantje 'nkuku kafir voorlouper remained in charge of wagon ox ramoo samee groom accompanied master to native village to look after horse attend to cooking while employer shot hippopotamus crocodile from two canoe chartered mafuta meanwhile taking four day ration going off upon prospecting expedition in search of elephant buffalo three day at village sufficed to provide hunter with more trophy than cared to encumber with while native enjoyed record feast of hippopotamus flesh on fourth morning dick grosvenor returned on horseback to wagon while ramoo samee in charge of spoil be conveyed down river to same spot in canoe manned by grateful native found cattle right visibly improved by three day rest while lion cub welcomed dick return with almost embarrassing demonstration of affection late same evening mafuta also returned with intelligence that although have not actually seen elephant buffalo have obtained from native whom have encountered intelligence of large herd of former at distance of four day trek from river also reported native to be quite friendly disposed willing to allow white men to traverse particular section of country everything thus appearing favourable on following morning ox be once more inspanned journey resumed then ensued long trek extending over period of more than two month including day halt here there to rest ox to indulge in little hunting during enjoyed excellent sport among elephant buffalo lion leopard giraffe veldebeeste zebra ostrich various specie of buck to be found in southern portion of great african continent so rapidly indeed did spoil accumulate that at length must no longer find room for in wagon be glad to avail of opportunity afforded by arrival at particularly friendly village to leave everything of kind including eighteen hundred pound of ivory in charge of villager of last three week of long trek nine day be consumed in forced march through sterile country bordering wide according to mafuta utterly impassable desert during water grass be so exceedingly scarce that entire party suffered terrible privation game of kind being seen where more than ox died while remainder be reduced to such miserable condition that be scarcely able to drag now more than half empty wagon presently character of country gradually changed water hole two be found with small patch of fairly nutritious grass growing round a soon a favourable spot be reached wagon be outspanned ox allowed couple of day holiday in to rest recuperate then grosvenor dick mounting horse have be spared a much a possible during preceding ten day set off with rifle in search of game eventually succeeded in finding shooting pair of bush buck wherewith to replenish larder at end of second day rest mafuta who have by time completely won confidence of two leader of expedition have attained rather to position of humble comrade than mere follower gave a opinion that ox have now sufficiently recovered to justify party in resuming journey accordingly on following morning animal be once more inspanned dick grosvenor have already seen enough of surrounding country during two day foraging expedition to have come to conclusion that condition must now improve with mile of progress conclusion be fully borne out by first day experience country gradually becoming more hilly broken with small watercourse occurring at steadily decreasing interval with more richer grass at mile of progress until by end of day once more found in district might fairly be termed fertile while few head of game buck brace of paow kind of bustard have be seen be exceedingly encouraging to two explorer for experience thus far with one very important exception have be in strict accordance with menzies story a repeated to by friend mitchell confirmed in conviction at length have arrived within measurable distance of spot where according to account given by former ruin of ancient ophir still existed in recognisable form exception referred to consisted in fact that whereas according to menzies makolo nation upon whose territory have now entered be exceedingly jealous of intrusion menzies having escaped frightful death at hand by very skin of teeth have thus far met with molestation however might possibly be accounted for by fact that thus far have seen native state of affair be not to last much longer for on third day of resumed trek by time have reached somewhat rugged well wooded stretch of country watered by numerous stream upon surmounting ridge sighted native village three mile ahead surrounded by well cultivated field upon nearer approach traveller found to consist chiefly of maize tobacco with here there patch of sugar cane small fruit orchard soon afterwards encountered large herd of cattle in charge of about dozen native lad one of whom upon sighting stranger took to heel ran a though for life to eminence at great distance where placing hand funnelwise to mouth began to shout in peculiar high pitched tone of voice brief communication of sort to unseen person person at same time one of other lad after intently scrutinising newcomer for several minute advanced cautiously toward finally halted evidently holding ready to bolt at slightest suspicious sign raising sheaf of assagai in right hand by way of salute shouted single word bietu word be evidently variant of zulu biete form of salutation addressed to great chief so construing mafuta at once placed shield weapon in wagon advancing rapidly proceeded to address lad in good zulu stranger however although be evident that caught meaning of word here there seemed unable to grasp sense of mafuta communication in entirety whereupon latter made second attempt time using sort of dialect corruption of true zulu tongue be now more successful quite long interchange of conversation ensuing at termination of stranger turned ran to before mentioned eminence from summit of shouted in same high pitched voice a predecessor communication of very considerable length while mafuta returned to wagon well mafuta what be news demanded dick a kaffir approached news chief be good answered mafuta saluting have arrived within border of makolo country word of befana who spoke with be that will be wise of father to outspan at first suitable halting place until will of king regarding be made known makolo approve of stranger entering country must appear objection no longer applies to white men to whom spirit of wind have commanded that kindness be shown must such ever visit makolo country news of arrival have already be sent forward to lobelalatutu king will concerning will be made known a soon a come meanwhile matemba befana who spoke with advises that outspan until will be made known um remarked dick doe not sound altogether promising eh phil seems to indicate that there may possibly be difficulty put in way of penetrating country doe what did say to befana mafuta said answered mafuta that two white men chief have come from afar across great water to visit king of great makolo nation to offer present to request permission to examine ruin of great city of have heard yes of course suppose be correct diplomatic way in to put matter remarked dick what said matemba in reply said answered mafuta doubtless king remembering command laid upon by spirit of wind upon occasion of last visit to country in great glittering ship fly through air must gladly permit chief to visit ruin even a spirit have done ah exclaimed dick sound better turning to grosvenor wonder what fellow mean by glittering ship fly through air spirit of wind can be possible that airship have ever penetrated so far a stop minute let think spirit of wind glittering ship fly by jove can be possible thought when expression spirit of wind that sounded not altogether unfamiliar that have met with before in fact now come to overhaul memory very distinctly remember reading yarn describing adventure of people who possessed wonderful airship in made most extraordinary voyage met with astounding experience yes interrupted grosvenor know book mean too read took to be fiction pure simple somewhat daring flight of novelist imagination now that have reminded of yarn distinctly remember that four fellow in story be described a having visited same ruin of ophir that be hunting for yes cut in dick be so if remember aright met with rather exciting adventure among makolo did rather assented grosvenor be taken prisoner something of sort only escaped by skin of teeth be agreed dick yes man who be then king wanted to steal airship did did got banished for pain answered grosvenor be not end of story king mean returned from banishment killed king who be reigning in stead yes be found practising old dodge of cruelty murder when spirit paid second visit to country precisely agreed dick that part of story be given in second book recounting further voyagings of wonderful flying fish be name of airship will remember by jove how vividly yarn recur to one memory when anything special like adventure of ours occurs to recall do know phil now seems to that quite unconsciously to ourselves two book have have distinct influence upon in undertaking carrying through journey possibly agreed grosvenor though be obliged to admit have be be still quite unconscious of point be of real importance to be have narrative in two book slightest foundation of fact because if so recollection of might stand in good stead must difficulty arise between people take for example matter of four spirit of wind if be to judiciously exhibit knowledge of doings king might be inclined to be great deal more complaisant than otherwise must be think so perhaps conceded dick be impossible to say what knowledge do posse can exhibit absolutely none except what can remember through perusal of two book for own part be inclined to believe that alleged adventure of four person therein referred to be purely fictitious at least have more than slenderest connection with actual fact yet contended grosvenor be remarkable to say least of that in very first communication with makolo now come to think of be actual name of nation given in book four spirit of wind must be mentioned be yes certainly be agreed dick somewhat reluctantly of course continued if must happen that two yarn be record of actual occurrence presented in guise of fiction will not be by mean first time that thing have occurred anyhow concluded see that can possibly do harm by acting a suggest upon assumption that yarn however extravagant may have appeared to when read be record of actual fact using recollection of in manner may seem advantageous to be that agreed yes certainly assented grosvenor can try see how work now to change subject what say about outspanning seems to be good spot eh during foregoing conversation two speaker have be walking on ahead of wagon with rifle in hollow of arm dog leo lion cub trotting amicably at heel have arrived at spot about mile from village be now traversing open flat with plenty of grass close to margin of small stream a grosvenor have suggested be excellent spot upon to outspan for there be grass water for cattle be sufficiently far away from village to prevent of annoyance that nearer approach might have subjected to therefore halted when wagon came up order to outspan be given few minute later while jantje be superintending watering of ox half dozen woman carrying basket poised upon head be seen approaching from village when somewhat later woman arrived at wagon leader of announced that content of basket consisting of green mealie cob sugar cane egg sweet potato dozen shockingly skinny chicken milk joala kind of native beer be present from headman of village to stranger six month earlier traveller must have laughed incredulously at idea of liquid being conveyed in basket now took quite a matter of course for have by time grown quite familiar with native basket so exquisitely woven out of grass a to be quite impervious to leakage accepted gift with few word not too many of thanks then desirous of creating good impression upon makolo a early a might be directed woman to wait going to wagon took from store of notion few yard of gaudily printed cotton stuff two three yard of brass wire dozen empty two ounce tobacco tin decorated with gilt coloured lettering in style familiar to devotee of weed small wooden box containing about pint of mixed bead to of smiling expectant basket bearer special present for herself consisting of necklet of large particoloured bead remaining gift being of course for headman in return for present necklet dick grosvenor personally clasped round shapely bronze tinted throat of recipient to intense delight of latter then damsel took departure smiling to extent a to display tooth in head presently when be few yard from wagon burst into song burden of lay being magnificent generosity enormous wealth splendid personality of visitor about hour before sunset same day party made appearance approaching from village on occasion consisted of men only twenty in number upon arrival at wagon proved to be headman of village retinue unarmed party halted at distance of ten pace from spot where dick grosvenor sat before open tent a did so with precision of trained soldier man right hand be flung aloft in deep sonorous tone salute be given bietu then headman stepped forward said mafuta standing by to act a interpreter insimbi headman of village of m'gama in country of makolo bear greeting of great king lobelalatutu to unknown white men who have crossed great water to visit to offer gift to request permission to visit ruin of great city be situate near king village bid welcome to country of makolo word be that be to be conducted forthwith in honour to presence be guest to be treated by men a such by to be supplied with thing necessary to comfort wellbeing ox be poor in condition few in number therefore will be cared for here until be again fit for work meanwhile fresh team will be supplied from herd belonging to village for conveyance of wagon to ruin desire to visit if there be other thing that desire order be to furnish to have said be well o white men be very well o insimbi answered grosvenor be well for makolo for king that keep fresh in memory command laid upon by four spirit of wind be satisfied when can be supplied with fresh team of ox at sunrise to morrow will herd be driven hither when lord will choose for a many a will answered headman let be so answered grosvenor for to morrow at sunrise will resume journey to king village ruin by way ask mafuta how far ruin be from here with full team of fourteen fresh ox may be done in seven day mafuta translated insimbi answer to question seven day ejaculated grosvenor glancing in astonishment at dick then how dickens have fellow insimbi contrived in course of single day to communicate with king get reply from why easily enough answered dick remember wonderful system of voice telegraphy mentioned in two book that be discussing to day that of course be how have be accomplished now come to think of have illustration of system morning when two boy ran to top of yonder hill started shouting in queer high pitched tone of voice be telegraphing to king news of arrival without doubt yes assented grosvenor little doubtfully suppose be seven day trek with fresh ox mean hundred forty mile thereabout be wonderful be right be agreed dick not more wonderful to mind than destined a one may say to make trip together must have be fortunate enough to stumble across read two book be now beginning to understand be record of sober fact instead of extravagant fiction a thought to be must certainly polish up recollection of what read for be not at difficult to imagine circumstance in knowledge may be of vital import to by way mafuta tell fellow that be dismissed that will require of to morrow in addition to ox will be guide ox guide be duly forthcoming on morrow journey toward what may be called capital be resumed continued day after day without adventure guide supplied on first day continuing with party for whole of day then turning over to who in like manner piloted day trek in turn to pas on to so on day after day guide returning to starting point on following day chapter eight king lobelalatutu one thing after spreading well tilled field surrounding village great herd of cattle general aspect of prosperity everywhere met with most impressed two traveller during progress through makolo country be extraordinary courtesy deference uniformly extended to by native people be savage pure unadulterated fierce warlike race who have be obliged to fight for very existence throughout countless age ignorant superstitious to degree with virtue most of vice of primeval savage unspeakably cruel relentless a enemy absolutely fearless in battle above intensely suspicious of stranger yet although white men be practically unknown to a people never annoyed traveller by display of undue curiosity man deferentially saluted be willing even eager to do service character of country although must not by stretch of imagination be described a mountainous maintained rugged character almost to end of journey consisting of constant succession of low hill ridge mostly of granite formation divided from other by broad fertile well watered valley dotted here there with village a traveller advanced gradually drew closer together increased in importance be a traveller surmounted certain ridge about hour half before time of midday halt that caught first glimpse of sea since losing sight of on departure from lourenco marque stretched away to right left in front of narrow faint grey streak softly shimmering under beam of noontide sun between observer lay wide stretching level grassy plain in midst of appeared numberless irregularity viewed through powerful glass assumed aspect of architectural ruin of enormous massiveness strength be ten mile distant through highly rarefied atmosphere intervened be impossible to obtain very clear conception of character except that be undoubtedly of human origin of quite unexpected extent one thing however be certain in light of menzies story a recounted to by friend mitchell enormous ruin must be none other than remains of ancient ophir mentioned in holy writ two friend sent up shout of irrepressible exultation at thought that have advanced thus far upon difficult journey without mishap of kind be now eagerness impatience to reach wonderful ruin ox be tired hungry having already be trekking for more than two hour moreover took interest in archaeology preferred acre of rich grass to finest ruin in world therefore became imperative to outspan a soon a wagon have plunged down into plain far enough to reach first watercourse grosvenor maitland be not long in arriving at decision to saddle up ride forward a soon a have partaken of hasty tiffin resolution duly carried into effect observing precaution to slip loaded revolver into belt to sling loaded rifle fully charged bandolier over shoulder to guard against possibility of accident although have thus far seen nothing to justify slightest suspicion that king people meditated treachery a rode have ample opportunity to observe a indeed have be case ever since entered makolo country operation of curious voice telegraph system practised by native in communication with other high pitched message doubtless reporting progress breaching ear at frequent interval advanced at easy canter heading straight for ruin for there be semblance of road even of footpath scarcely people be to be seen except in about village occasionally passed when have arrived within about three mile of ruin observed approaching round spur of low hill troop of about fifty horseman field glass enabled to perceive be splendidly mounted garbed in full panoply of war consisting of shield war axe sheaf of broad bladed spear plumed head dress in case of leader leopard skin mantle necklace of leopard claw be distinctly formidable cavalcade for two men only to meet even although latter be armed with weapon of such deadly precision a rifle revolver for minute two traveller be just little uncertain a to how to meet situation finally reined in came to halt whereupon leader of troop threw up right hand a though giving order upon follower who have be advancing at gallop reined horse back upon haunch coming to abrupt halt while reducing pace to hand gallop continued advance alone right old chap come along exclaimed grosvenor fellow mean harm be sure expect be detachment sent out by king to bid welcome on approach to village very possibly assented dick having halted must now remain where be until fellow approach delivers message to resume journey at moment must be tantamount to admission of distrust on part must never do let man come to not go to among savage know first impression count for good deal must never do to let fellow think that halted because be nervous of course be quite right must not agreed grosvenor sitting straight up in saddle assuming air of absolute confidence somewhat belied inward feeling patiently awaited arrival of solitary horseman in le than minute have arrived fine stalwart man of about middle age clean limbed broad chested upright a dart of dauntless aspect limb body showing many scar of battle a reached point ten foot from where two white traveller awaited abruptly reined horse to standstill threw up right hand in salute cried in full deep resonant tone of voice lobelalatutu king of makolo salute by mouth of bepandula bid welcome to royal village behold squadron of royal guard have dispatched under command to conduct in honour to presence awaits now in palace doe please lord that squadron approach to give salute now speech be only very imperfectly understood by to whom be addressed word two here there comprehended because of similarity to in language spoken by mafuta name of king also recognised be gesture tone of voice also told little thus in one way contrived to gain sort of hazy general notion of gist of chief speech how be to reply to what be to say so early summons to king presence be rather unexpected in absence of mafuta who be behind with wagon must be rather embarrassing for how be to converse with king without assistance of interpreter there be one thing to be done be to reply to best of ability dick undertook to do in only native tongue with be familiar explaining a well a must difficulty in pair found be evident at once by puzzled expression on chief face that understood dick a little a dick understood for moment there seemed to be possibility of deadlock suddenly bepandula brow cleared turned on horse shouted name in response to one of guard drove heel into horse flank dashed forward to chief assistance latter appeared to explain position in few terse word when have finished newcomer at bepandula dictation repeated message of king word for wood in language with dick be familiar what do say phil questioned dick when message be concluded will go will excuse for present upon plea that must prefer to wait until wagon come up in order that may take with gift that have brought for majesty be not quite sure that altogether like escort business may be right of course king message sound right if chap mean treachery will be exceedingly awkward for will not certainly will agreed grosvenor continued fancy be altogether too late to think of now when determined to enter country tacitly decided to take risk of so doing in case can not now escape do what will therefore think best policy will be to take everything for granted go willingly with fellow since if refused have power to compel have so suddenly put idea of treachery into head upon word know answered dick unless be sight of armed men a say be too late to hesitate now after presence may merely signify desire of king to do honour yes suppose have better go turning to bepandula said be ready to go with into presence of king therefore let squadron approach follower be behind with wagon be desirable that must know what have become of therefore pray let message be transmitted to informing of whereabouts also directing where to outspan at final halt will of lord will be done answered chief through interpreter raising right hand shouted order whereupon squadron of native cavalry have remained motionless a so many statue at once awakened into life starting forward at gallop advanced in a close formation a perfect line a finest civilised troop halting horse length in rear of commander then at signal from chief man tossed right hand aloft in salute thundered out word 'nkosi salute dick grosvenor acknowledged by placing hand to hat brim in military fashion to evident satisfaction of bepandula follower then a two white touched horse flank with spur moved forward at canter escort formed up completely encircling one man at same moment detaching galloping away in direction of wagon in response to order from commander twenty minute later party reached outskirt of ruined city found confronted by enormous mass of masonry consisting of wall of still remained erect although for most part have sunk into shapeless overgrown mass of ruin arch column erect prostrate fragmentary pediment shattered entablature dislodged capital crumbling pedestal mutilated statue of men animal of colossal proportion building portion of building being of immensely massive yet ornate imposing style of architecture quite unknown to traveller even cursory glimpse be dick grosvenor be for moment able to obtain convinced that be face to face with remains of city must thousand of year ago have be of enormous extent of almost unimaginable opulence splendour have little time just then in to indulge curiosity for almost immediately struck into sort of bridle path presently turned away from ruin led toward extensive village now swept into view a rounded spur of hill village consisted of five hundred hut surrounding central stockade enclosed small group of building of considerably more pretentious character than ordinary hut dick grosvenor at once conjectured must be royal palace dependency conjecture be confirmed upon arrival at village for at gateway of stockade cavalcade halted bepandula dismounting requested charge to do same intimating that be about to conduct forthwith into presence of king of course there be nothing to be done to obey with good grace traveller therefore swung out of saddle handing over horse to couple of native who stepped forward to take charge of followed guide custodian whichever might happen to be through gateway not without certain qualm of apprehension a to wisdom of placing thus unreservedly in power of savage king who if must so choose must send to death of unspeakable torment horror without slightest fear of ever being brought to book now more than ever be too late to hesitate therefore resolutely stifling apprehension assuming bearing of most perfect confidence advanced toward group of several person whom now saw arranged in front of principal building within enclosure unquestionably most important personage in group be splendid figure of savage attired in sort of petticoat of leopard skin reaching to just above knee mantle of lion skin thrown over shoulder gold bangle on arm ankle beautifully worked coronet of gold adorned with crimson feather of flamingo two necklace one composed of lion teeth claw other larger of unpolished stone seemed to emit faint glint of ruddy fire round neck be armed with sheaf of short broad bladed stabbing spear be seated on sort of throne entirely covered with immense kaross of lion skin behind stood eight savage a finely built men a whose dress adornment at once proclaimed to be chief person of very great importance in makolo nation individual upon throne be of course none other than king boldly advancing to within about ten pace of seated monarch grosvenor dick halted according to pre arrangement gave majesty military salute then dick addressing king in best kafir remarked hail lobelalatutu king of makolo salute interpreter who have followed promptly interpreted see white men answered king slightly raising right hand in acknowledgement of salute be welcome to country of makolo when be informed of approach gave certain order to people concerning comfort welfare trust order have be obeyed to satisfaction word o king have be most implicitly obeyed thank for a also for welcome that have extended to returned dick four spirit of wind will be pleased to learn when return that have not forgotten injunction that laid upon four spirit of wind ejaculated king in great surprise not wholly untinged with trepidation emotion be even more strongly displayed by chief who stood about know ye then terrible being note even so answered dick composedly know that twice visited makolo country also know added with emphasis what happened upon of occasion know what happened to m'bongwele former king of makolo know why lobelalatutu be chosen king in place wau murmured assembled chief behind hand in awestricken tone be wonderful while lobelalatutu shifted uneasily in seat a gazed apprehensively in face of two visitor for nearly minute remained silent apparently debating within very puzzling question then said must that knew o white men reason have led to visit makolo country must be many great to have induced to cross great water to take so long so wearisome so dangerous journey afterwards listen then o king lobelalatutu will be told answered dick friend here be great hunter love excitement of chase even a do own young men in own country people be so many that there be little room for game be consequently very scarce therefore friend said lo will go to africa where people be few game be

said returned dick friend must be friend of people friend will also be friend enemy enemy if ye must need such help a be in power to give will be yours freely ask in return be that may be allowed to examine ruin at leisure to take away with such gold stone a may find be well answered king if be ye ask be granted ye may examine ruin at pleasure ye may remain in country a long a ye will man will molest whatsoever ye may find be valuable in eye that will ye take with when ye leave country be word word of king say now be good be very good spirit will be well pleased when learn that have granted request answered dick king gave vent to sigh of evident relief be clear that wished to stand well with two friend of great terrible spirit of wind who by potency of magic have be able to punish predecessor m'bongwele for evil doing to place upon vacant throne yet be apparent that there be still something at back of king mind something that keenly desired yet hesitated to speak of for two three minute sat plunged in deep painful meditation then looked up said be well be glad ye have come o white men for when ye return to own country ye will be able to tell spirit have faithfully obeyed injunction that laid upon have there be one thing more must ask speak not tongue of makolo yet ye be able to communicate with people a soon a ye entered border by what mean did ye so oh quite easily answered dick who being better linguist of two naturally assumed part of spokesman have with man who speaks makolo tongue whose language speak therefore communicate with people through good exclaimed king in accent of extraordinary satisfaction be very good go now in peace o white men ye be friend harm will befall ye while ye stay in country of makolo king say may be o healer of sickness can help in matter of shining stone ye crave to posse see ye pointed to necklace of ruddy unpolished stone that wore dick stepped forward to look closer at stone finally took loop of necklace into hand at first sight stone appeared to be no more than ordinary red pebble about size of plover egg perhaps little larger only peculiarity being that be exactly alike in colour that emitted rich ruddy light for minute two dick stood carefully examining stone a did so faint elusive memory came to in connection with then suddenly memory became clear carefully suppressing excitement turned to grosvenor said in quite ordinary tone of voice just come have look at stone phil be careful not to betray anything in nature of astonishment admiration do remember reading that four chap in flying fish accidentally stumbled upon first king ruby necklace then through ruby mine well be undoubtedly necklace friend here seems to hint that be willing to show spot where similar stone may be found look like certainly answered grosvenor in carefully modulated matter of fact tone jolly fine stone be if can contrive to take home sackful of stone old man need no longer fear money trouble eh what sackful ejaculated dick with laugh peck of will completely satisfy boy then turning to lobelalatutu who be keenly watching said stone o king be very good of value in country though worthless here know where be to be found know answered king may be will show place can not yet say will consider matter have given instruction a to place where wagon will outspan be near at hand between village ruin if ye need anything send word by servant to will see to thank o lobelalatutu answered dick go now to morrow will come again bearing with gift that have brought for thee from england until then farewell shortly after nine o'clock night while two friend having dined be sitting under raised front flap of tent enjoying wonderful view of ruin rising gaunt black in midst of landscape flooded by ray of newly risen moon chatting in desultory fashion over event of day a grosvenor pulled contemplatively at well charred brier pipe mafuta appeared before giving usual salute said there be one from village yonder who must speak with lord if be willing who be mafuta man woman demanded dick be man answered mafuta then drawing still nearer lowering voice almost to whisper added say be named lobelalatutu king exclaimed dick starting to foot in amazement what dickens be up now wonder be armed mafuta nay lord be weaponless answered mafuta bring hither commanded dick will speak with saluting again mafuta disappeared presently returned escorting tall savage unarmed save for light switch such a native habitually carry in order to defend against attack of snake wore keshla head ring be naked save for usual moucha apron of deerskin a stepped within range of ray of lamp dick have hastily lighted eye rolled gleamed with something of apprehension in expression despite change of garb white men have difficulty in recognising king see o lobelalatutu said dick adopting ordinary form of salutation among native for there be air of secrecy about visit seemed to suggest desire on part of king that must be regarded a to extent incognito enter pray be seated pointing to chair have just vacated drawing forward medicine chest a seat for thus placing king between grosvenor with sigh whether of weariness of relief be not quite clear king sank into chair indicated when mafuta must have discreetly withdrawn stopped be man through whom have hitherto communicated with people king demanded mafuta duly translated question dick answered in affirmative adding tell mafuta that know to be faithful be ready to trust even with life speech also mafuta translated with air of mingled hauteur humility be amusing enough to dick grosvenor for answer king stood up laying hand upon mafuta shoulder looked piercingly into man eye for space of full minute more on part mafuta returned gaze a steadfastly a be given be interesting sight to onlooker to see two savage of splendid specimen of respective race endeavouring to read other character at length lobelalatutu removed hand from other shoulder said be well tell chief that say be true man that too be willing to put life into hand stay here interpret for for have matter of moment to discus with white men tell king to say on commanded dick when speech have be

disguised a be must rather that man must know that have be secretly visited night right answered dick in english see point old chap out go glim so saying took down lamp opened extinguished be well approved king with sigh of relief now can talk without fear of discovery paused for moment considering how must begin then said a talked to day o healer of sickness native word for expression soon abbreviated to healer forthwith became dick name among makolo from moment said that knew what happened to m'bongwele king who ruled before also how came to be made king in stead know also story of seketulo whom four spirit made king in m'bongwele stead when first came among makolo yes know answered dick know m'bongwele be dethroned banished by four spirit because of barbarous iniquitous rule

four spirit revisited country in great glittering ship fly through air again deposed m'bongwele hanged chief witch doctor from bough of tree because despite previous warning persisted in evil doing in m'bongwele place made lobelalatutu king of makolo be even so o healer assented king tale a tell be truth now know of verity that possessing knowledge be like unto spirit to be trusted even a be therefore will without fear unfold to tale of present trouble be dissatisfaction of certain chief with seketulo system of government a prescribed to by four spirit made m'bongwele secret return resumption of throne possible seketulo be instructed to govern makolo justly humanely to put stop to oppression of people by chief above not to make war upon neighbouring nation save in self defence be last restriction occasioned greatest discontent among certain of chief because makolo being powerful warlike nation be generally victorious when went to war greater part of spoil went to chief who thus increased rich a often a made raid upon neighbour under seketulo rule be altered be obliged to be content with such wealth a already possessed hence discontent followed upon now since became king

support in determination to continue to rule in accordance with tenet laid down by four spirit be rapidly dying off one after other by mysterious disease phew say that look very fishy doe dick exclaimed grosvenor when king have concluded story smack of conspiracy secret murder eh what yes agreed dick must confess that undoubtedly have look of kind of thing about then turning to lobelalatutu asked how long be since chief who support began to sicken die how many have already passed along dark path be now nearly three moon since betatu most trustworthy chief died since then five others have

instinct being at once aroused usually die on seventh day after sickness declares answered king good responded dick then friend be in immediate danger to morrow when present before with gift will see may be that will be able to save life have aught further to tell answered king have now told fear that thing portend evil to perchance end of reign life be for reason have visited to night in secret for hoped that if conspiracy be growing up against might be able to name conpirators to that be help ask finished grimly yes answered dick have doubt that if must ascertain identity of conspirator if must be safely trusted to do rest well will see what can be done to help must really go well good night take care of in other word hamba gahli a tall dark figure of lobelalatutu strode away down slight slope upon summit of tent be pitched melted into shadow grosvenor turned to companion who have now re seated said seems to friend dick that have arrived upon scene at psychological moment eh what if friend lobelalatutu suspicion have better foundation than own imagination strike that be on eve of exciting time what say say yes to most emphatically responded dick for make mistake phil king imagination be not running away with death of six chief in quick succession followed by serious illness of seventh be something more than mere coincidence mean conspiracy followed by ghastly blood curdling tragedy unless can contrive by mean to discover identity of conspirator in time a for unfortunate chief have not slightest doubt that have be removed by poison secret comparatively slow deadly poison intend to make first business to discover what that poison be antidote if can chance be however that will fail for almost savage people posse great deal more knowledge of drug especially of poison than civilised folk be aware of be inclined to credit with if poison be really being employed will almost certainly be something of have knowledge still will see may be sure that will use very best effort to succeed also to discover detail of conspiracy lobelalatutu suspect for must succeed will find in exceedingly awkward predicament why how do mean demanded grosvenor how do mean repeated dick why in few word mean so long a lobelalatutu life continues to govern people be reasonably safe if must happen to be deposed murdered new king will most probably sacrifice to fetish a sort of thank offering for success twig of course do answered grosvenor have never thought of seems likely enough now that come to mention appears to that first business must be to straighten out matter for own sake a well a for of lobelalatutu poor chap here be despot with absolute power over life of one of subject must naturally suppose that man must have nothing to fear must yet like other monarch seems liable at moment to become victim of secret intrigue lose crown life together thought poor chap looked worried when called upon to day bard be right uneasy lie head wear crown ' be head that of civilised monarch savage true for boy answered dick be not beginning to feel tired because if be pray stand on ceremony turn in a soon a like a for think will sit up bit longer see if can not think matter out find streak of daylight somewhere suppose be hint that need company longer retorted grosvenor right old chap pray apologise know be bit of duffer in such matter a so will leave to thresh out alone turn in for good night sleep eh what left to dick maitland sat far into night considering situation unfolded to by king at length inspiration came to by following thought possible that might be able to clear up mystery connected with death of lobelalatutu most trusted chief perhaps discover whether not there really existed conspiracy to overthrow that monarch restore barbarous practice have made rule of last king literally reign of terror then turned into hammock slept soundly until mafuta aroused at sunrise with early cup of chocolate be invariable prelude to business of day first thing after breakfast two friend walked to wagon be outspanned close at hand opened box bale contained various article have brought with to serve a present medium of barter from content of selected liberal assortment of gift for king wife most important chief in majesty immediate entourage handed over to care of mafuta jantje 'nkuku voorlouper then directing trio to follow dick grosvenor mounted horse rode at foot pace to king village distribution of gift proved to be somewhat lengthy function for article presented included considerable number of mechanical toy working of of have to be carefully explained to recipient at length came to end to apparent satisfaction of everybody concerned then dick said to king majesty be aware that be healer of sickness be there member of family anyone in whom be interested lying sick at present moment because if so will be very glad to do what can to restore patient to health king looked doubtfully at dick for moment two a though not quite comprehending drift of question then something in expression of maitland face led to understanding replied there be one of household at present sick o healer one of chief man named 'nkuni who be friend lie nigh unto death if can heal will be grateful to for be very dear to sickness be same a have already sent six other chief along dark path be of so strange deadly nature sekosini head witch doctor can find cure for a king thus spoke dick be keenly watching face of various person present noted with something of thrill four five of chief seemed to exchange stealthy glance of meaning with other also despite assumption of indifference to exhibit sign of inward perturbation be part of policy to show that have observed thing therefore responded to king ah may be that sickness from 'nkuni be suffering be sickness new to country if must prove to be so be not surprising that sekosini be unable to conquer may be however that be akin to of disease with be acquainted in case can save chief life will go to hut see even now if king will direct someone to conduct thither lobelalatutu at once turned to one of chief present said ingona be be friend take white men to hut that healer may see perchance restore to health strength two minute later dick stood in hut of 'nkuni saw lying stretched upon pallet before man somewhat past prime of life who when in health must have be very fine specimen of manhood now however be thin wasted skin be cold yet dry pulse be exceedingly feeble erratic be in terribly exhausted condition having suffered severe paroxysm of abdominal pain shortly after swallowing draught of milk have be administered to by sekosini order last fact together with several other detail respecting progress of disease be communicated by man chief wife who appeared to be greatly concerned about a be naturally to be expected where be vessel from milk be drunk demanded dick when woman have told that have to tell calabash bowl capable of containing about quart be produced for inspection saw with satisfaction that have not yet be washed film of milk still clinging to interior showed that have be about half full when offered to patient about teaspoonful of milk still remained in bowl of vessel dick instantly took possession handing over to grosvenor with instruction not to spill single drop of content on account then asked if medicine have be administered in milk be answered in affirmative very small calabash bottle being shown have contained drug of also dick took possession next having brought medicine chest with in accordance with plan have made overnight young doctor administered powerful emetic then locked chest slipped key into pocket leaving chest in hut to obviate inconvenience of carrying to fro gave certain instruction to chief wife then requested ingona to conduct to hut of sekosini chief witch doctor request appeared to fill ingona with alarm made attempt to conceal informed dick that sekosini be very great man indeed second in power influence only to lobelalatutu that be not custom to receive visitor unless permission have first be asked request being invariably accompanied by present evil invariably befell who be foolhardy enough to offend that if ingona might presume to advise must strongly recommend white man not to go near a sekosini have always manifested peculiarly strong aversion to stranger especially to white men since two visit of spirit of wind to makolo country however only tended to strengthen certain suspicion dick have already formed did not express to ingona blandly explained to chief having be requested by king to use best endeavour to cure 'nkuni wished to see sekosini consult with in order that might learn a many particular a possible respecting ailment from 'nkuni be suffering explanation appeared at least partially to satisfy ingona who made further attempt to dissuade dick from purpose on contrary offered to go forward prepare sekosini for proposed visit to proposal since must scarcely interfere with plan dick cheerfully assented whereupon ingona pointing out witch doctor hut stood good quarter of mile apart from others hastened toward at long swinging trot enables south african savage to get over ground so quickly can maintain for such incredible length of time dick meanwhile accompanied only by mafuta to act a interpreter sauntered slowly on way for double purpose of arranging mentally plan of impending interview with sekosini giving ingona time to say might wish to say to witch doctor be about quarter of hour later that a dick henchman approached witch doctor hut ingona emerged from with gratifying intimation that have succeeded in inducing sekosini graciously to accord white man audience whereupon white man having suitably expressed satisfaction be at so great honour stooped passed into hut preceded by ingona followed by mafuta whose original wholesome fear of wizard have by time become completely swamped by belief in power of master to circumvent most powerful wizard ever lived hut of sekosini afforded indication of importance of owner for be of same size a in other respect similar to other hut of ordinary native be a regarded external appearance inside however there be very marked difference for whereas ordinary native be content to sleep on bare floor sekosini be satisfied with nothing le than bed consisting of quadrangular framework of hardwood supported at height of foot above floor by four stout post driven firmly into ground skeleton framework being strapped across lengthways by great number of tightly strained raw hide thong upon be piled several very valuable karosses skin rug also interior of hut be thickly hung with bunch of dried herb other object precise nature of dick be at first unable to determine in comparative obscurity of interior passing at once a did from blazing sunshine of open direct into interior be unilluminated save by such light a penetrated through low narrow entrance for full minute stood mute motionless waiting for eye to accustom to change then various object of interior gradually began to reveal to with increasing distinctness found face to face with thin wizened shrunken creature of apparently incredible age without particle of hair on head face with pair of eye glowed like carbuncle within cavernous socket be seated cross legged upon floor be absolutely naked save for necklace of snake skin be toying with enormous green mamba one of most deadly of south african snake lay coiled between leg with cruel vindictive eye fixed immovably upon visitor beside sekosini stood ingona apparently impassive quick irregular breathing betrayed fact that be labouring under considerable amount of excitement a for witch doctor face wore smile of concentrated malice a though anticipated something in nature of conflict with audacious white mfana be already exulting in prospect of quick overwhelming victory suddenly fixed eye intently upon dick said in soft sibilant tone well belungu what want ye with sekosini be moment opportunity for dick have be waiting gazing intently into eye of savage in peculiar manner that have learned from young doctor suddenly concentrated will upon effort to bring foe for a such intuitively recognised sekosini under subjugation for moment strangely contrasted pair gazed at other then strange sensation experienced by witch doctor seemed to warn of what be happening be too late dick have caught unawares so absolutely instantaneous be hypnotic method humphreys have taught pupil that before sekosini must offer effective resistance will have completely succumbed to dick be in latter power in response to dick unspoken thought said ask what will will answer hear demanded dick turning gaze for moment upon ingona hear answered ingona unsuspectingly meeting dick gaze a replied in moment too be brought under young doctor influence for few second longer dick kept unwinking gaze steadfastly fixed upon chief mentally commanding to forget everything that might see hear during interview then again turned attention to witch doctor recalled to mind declaration of humphreys upon latter have laid great stress spoken word where can use be always more potent than unspoken whether be understood not be really minor matter be emphasis insistence be conveyed by speech added to will power employed that render operator absolutely irresistible a be of utmost importance that sekosini must remain completely under influence until whole affair be brought to end now once more sent compelling gaze into unblinking eye of ancient savage finally said to in english henceforth until release will be mine will think act only a direct understand understand will obey answered sekosini good returned dick now command to tell absolute truth know anything relative to sickness from chief be suffering sickness from other five chief died yes answered sekosini answer in nowise surprised dick know 'nkuni be slowly dying of poison administered by same poison sent betatu other five chief along dark path destruction of men be preliminary to destruction of king of whose method of government others disapprove might have destroyed lobelalatutu alone if chief whom have destroyed have be allowed to live must assuredly have led to trouble therefore have destroyed first when 'nkuni dy chief who think a do will be strong enough to act without fear of opposition will be able to destroy lobelalatutu restore system prevailed when m'bongwele reigned system by chief witch doctor be able to acquire much wealth instead of living a do now in comparative poverty then demanded dick do understand that under lobelalatutu rule have not sufficiency to meet want have sufficiency yes answered sekosini must have much more than must have wealth great wealth above power power that witch doctor wielded in m'bongwele time true have much power even now be a nothing to power be wielded by mtusa chief witch doctor whom accursed spirit of wind sent along dark path with king see said dick meditatively be there others concerned with in precious scheme of yours to remove lobelalatutu yes answered sekosini there be ingona lambati mapela moroosi amakosa n'ampata sekukuni chief quite formidable little crowd mused dick a drew forth pocket book to make few note just repeat name again slowly if please commanded sekosini did so dick noted down name very carefully so that there must be mistake for of native name be quite embarrassingly similar in sound now resumed dick when have done to return to 'nkuni what be poison that have be administering to be decoction of leaf of plant hang immediately over head answered sekosini dick reached up touched thick branch depending from roof of hut asked sekosini assented dick took down branch examined seemed quite ordinary shrub to appearance handed over to mafuta for safekeeping next question said dick be there antidote to particular poison oh yes answered witch doctor cheerfully never use poison have antidote because be sometimes desirable to alter one plan at last moment quite so assented dick be going to alter plan with regard to 'nkuni straight away where be antidote how be prepared be contained in root answered sekosini pointing to bundle of bulb like object also suspended from roof method of preparation be simple root be taken cleaned from adhering soil boiled in water until be soft enough to crush between finger then liquid be allowed to cool strained through cloth liquid be of dark colour almost black to administer add enough water to stain very pale yellow let patient drink a will more drink quicker will be cure excellent will easily remember that murmured dick then addressing witch doctor said that be want to know at present now remain here until summon to presence of king mafuta take root will be going two hour later have prepared sufficient quantity of antidote to fill eight ounce medicine bottle a stuff be exceedingly strong believed that ought to be nearly quite sufficient to effect complete cure armed with made way to 'nkuni hut be gratified to find that emetic have be productive of very satisfactory result pain being greatly eased while temperature of body have become almost normal now administered good stiff dose of antidote left bottle containing in charge of patient wife giving most minute instruction respecting administration done proceeded to enclosed part of village containing king house dependency informed sentry at gate of palisade that desired to report personally to king state of chief from whose hut have just come sentry have already received order to admit white men whenever must present in few minute dick found standing in presence of lobelalatutu chapter ten dick magic king be reclining upon sort of sofa with two three of wife fanning to drive away fly when healer be announced word caused woman to scuttle off to own quarter like frightened rabbit while lobelalatutu rose to sitting position a dick entered followed by mafuta see o healer exclaimed king with cordiality before dick must say word draw near sit beside be said that have news of 'nkuni for have seen twice day have seen answered dick once when went forth from presence morning again short time since came hither directly from hut have skill enabled to find out what be wrong with demanded king have answered dick friend 'nkuni be slowly dying from effect of same poison slew others can save will live may be to serve better than of chief who professing to be loyal to be secretly planning overthrow death au ejaculated lobelalatutu be so then suspicion be not ill founded tell how came to learn when first visited hut of 'nkuni morning conducted thither by chief ingona whom thought to be friend answered dick found that sekosini chief witch doctor have be administering to sick man certain medicine with alleged purpose of healing of sickness when entered hut seemed to be nigh unto death having endured much pain after swallowing draught of milk containing medicine supplied by sekosini symptom be of poisoning therefore took possession of unwashed vessel have contained milk also remainder of medicine supplied by sekosini with object of examining have not yet done that for examination must take time be case seemed urgent therefore went to sekosini hut to talk with about when at length stood face to face with witch doctor laid magic upon so that be perforce obliged to tell truth of matter confessed that 'nkuni illness be part of conspiracy to remove friend from that might be deposed slain iniquitous system of government practised by m'bongwele restored au be well exclaimed king in low stern voice be very well vile treacherous witch doctor will be brought hither placed before slow fire until give up name of who be conspiring with then nay interrupted dick there be need sekosini have already voluntarily given name of chief who be partner in conspiracy against be dick drew out pocket book read ingona lambati mapela moroosi amakosa n'ampata sekukuni nay hing rashly pray sit still hear what have to say for at mention of seven name king have sprung to foot in access of fury seemed about to summon guard at dick persuasion seated again though be much too excited for moment to listen to white visitor muttering over to name of conspirator ingona ingona hissed through clenched teeth man whom believed to be most loyal of chief man who evidently feigned friendship with 'nkuni only to betray to death will make terrible example of rebel will die such death that stop commanded dick be how four spirit who placed on throne of makolo taught to administer justice nay answered king be ordinary crime be a vile in intention at least a of who conspired against seketulo restored m'bongwele chief be not only responsible for death of seketulo also for horror followed be just so interrupted dick be more even doe not justify in torturing men to death destroy by mean if will so that may never again have opportunity to do perhaps irreparable mischief let death be so ignominious that will be warning to others let be humane in word hang even a m'bongwele m'pusa chief witch doctor be hanged that surely ought to suffice for practical purpose must not possibly assented king unwillingly death by hanging disgrace of be greatly feared may be that yes interrupted dick soothingly of course will then be settled eh because want to understand that unless definitely promise that there will be torture will be obliged to withdraw from business altogether moreover will take magic off sekosini then nothing that can do will make confess incriminate others know that yes be true admitted king reluctantly sekosini be very obstinate if be so minded must refuse to confess even be staked out on ant nest of course must agreed dick therefore see for how futile anything of kind must be must only make of martyr of cruel revengeful suspicious brute in eye of people if fellow conspirator can be brought to admit guilt publicly at once become righteous judge score accordingly can make confess if be really guilty a sekosini asserts then tell o healer what do advise asked king answered dick advise that summon whole of chief to present before when be assembled sekosini will be called into presence commanded to tell version of story of conspiracy in hearing of chief then if chief implicated have excuse to offer let offer if have not let be hanged a plotter against authority person of king be well said advice be good will be followed exclaimed king will be done forthwith will send forth messenger commanding chief to present before in great place in connection with matter of import when have assembled sekosini also will be brought there be need for to trouble about sekosini answered dick when require presence will bring to by power of magic about hour later lobelalatutu having summoned chief sat upon throne in centre of great place before palace with dick beside bodyguard of five hundred warrior fully armed arranged in wide circle round then chief began to arrive singly in two three until be present a arrived be admitted to interior of circle of guard where squatted on haunch before king entire assemblage of chief thirty in number forming into arc of circle at distance of about twenty foot from throne when at length have be ascertained that chief except sick 'nkuni be present king turned to dick said now o healer by power of magic cause sekosini chief witch doctor to come hither pray at king word there occurred uneasy movement among assembled chief of whom exchanged quick furtive glance of apprehension be duly noted by dick king latter smiled somewhat sardonically beckoning chief of bodyguard toward murmured certain instruction in ear meanwhile dick concentrating thought upon sekosini mentally commanded at once to present before king in great place quarter of hour of somewhat painful tension followed during word be spoken by one of who be hemmed in by circle of armed guard then chief witch doctor be seen approaching entered circle of guard through gap be opened to give passage instantly closed again behind did bonga homage to king then stood silent serene about midway between king line of sitting chief aspect of perfect serenity due to fact that be still completely under dick hypnotic influence seemed to reassure certain of assembled chief whose face have shown sign of anxiety fact that healer sitting there silent impassive beside king have be able to summon sekosini from distance compel presence have be duly noted hand be placed over mouth low murmur of au bekulu betagati wizard great wizard ran round assembly king be by mean unimpressed by evidence of dick wonderful power decided that be thing to be remembered in nowise troubled for be being exercised in behalf however allowed time for effect to sink into take good hold of mind of spectator for be shrewd enough to recognise that possession of such ally must materially strengthen own position at length when believed that incident have produced full effect sprang new surprise upon audience by saying in loud voice stand forth o sekosini tell know concerning sickness of chief 'nkuni death of other six who have recently travelled along dark path then to unutterable confusion dismay of fellow conspirator chief witch doctor speaking in loud clear voice proceeded clearly succinctly to unfold detail after detail of plot for overthrow of king mean whereby have be hoped to accomplish including murder of six chief who be believed be powerful enough to render scheme abortive a full cold blooded atrocity of conspiracy became revealed murmur of anger detestation low at first louder a story proceeded began to run round line of chief while who sat next party implicated edged away from on side a far a possible until crouched isolated crestfallen self condemned by guilty countenance target for eye at length sekosini story came to end for few tense moment profound silence ensued there be not individual present who did not realise vital importance to entire nation of issue have be raised by witch doctor confession manner in issue must be dealt with by king disaffection secretly fomented carefully nurtured have grown so strong that now threatened to disintegrate whole nation unless be firmly dealt with must probably split up makolo into number of petty tribe at enmity with other easy prey to other nation who surrounded must king have courage boldly to seize hydra headed menace choke life out of must resort to policy of temporising concession everybody present awaited king action in breathless suspense while be already grimly counting number of spear upon might reckon to back anxious brooding of assemblage be suddenly broken in upon by voice of king who lifting head cried in loud voice ingona trusted friend counsellor of king induna of makolosi regiment very flower backbone of army have heard tale told by sekosini say now be that tale false be true ingona war scarred veteran of perhaps fifty year of age tall straight a spear shaft of commanding presence rose to foot answered in clear deep voice be true o mighty one true in detail be true repeated king in tone of deep sorrow yes unhappily there be room to doubt word carried conviction of truthfulness to mind be true meaning of be that chief of makolo be divided into two faction one of must leave government of nation in hand while other must entrust to whom nay o great one who can say have not agreed a to answered ingona then after death how be matter to have be decided demanded king who can say again answered ingona must probably have fought out victor must have seized throne ye must have set makolo at other throat for what demanded lobelalatutu truly know not answered ingona unless be to satisfy ambition of sekosini have already confessed that be originator of conspiracy therein spoke more than truth be guileful a snake have gift of persuasive speech knowing that of be chafing under prolonged inaction used cunning power of tongue to stir discontent into indignation finally into hatred fierce determination to effect change by power of magic turned heart from thee o great one made long even a did for return of such day a when m'bongwele reigned when be ever at war when young men became warrior instead of husbandman when enriched with spoil of vanquished be dazzling dream that brought before eye for time blinded to evil lay behind be only now when be too late that perceive that evil understand sekosini befooled bewitched to end that might be raised to such power a m'pusa enjoyed during reign of m'bongwele when not m'bongwele actually ruled makolo people be enough have said take away to hut set guard over see that escape not ordered king if be not forthcoming when wanted officer guard who have in charge will be crucified lambati too be implicated in conspiracy have aught to say in defence nay o great one answered lambati must repeat word of ingona what must avail nothing too have said let also be taken away watched a carefully a ingona ordered king mapela have aught to say in justification of conspiracy against ay have answered mapela springing to foot speaking in defiant tone of voice justification o lobelalatutu be that under governance makolo formerly most powerful warlike nation in world be fast becoming nation of woman contempt laughing stock of neighbour soon will forget art of war young men will sicken at sight smell of blood will become prey of first nation dare attack be not sufficient reason for desire to see thee removed man placed upon throne in thy stead low murmur whether of approval reverse be difficult to say ran round line of assembled chief at defiant speech from mouth of one of most powerful chief of nation subsided again instantly have aught further to say o mapela demanded king nay answered mapela still in same defiant tone of voice what have already said must surely be sufficient be answered king dryly a signed guard to remove rebel be there anyone present who think feel a doe mapela yea answered two of implicated chief named respectively amakosa n'ampata a simultaneously sprang to foot have amakosa anything to add to take from what mapela have said demanded king nothing briefly answered amakosa n'ampata pressed king only o great one think must have be better have approached thee opened mind to thee before conspiring against thee plan be sekosini must listen to such proposal while who have be sworn to secrecy dared not break oath answered n'ampata why not demanded lobelalatutu when be placed upon throne did not n'ampata with other chief swear allegiance loyalty to yet have dared to break oath why then must not dare to break oath to sekosini be greater than power more than mine persuaded that be also since in opinion of many be misgoverning nation must be justified in breaking oath of allegiance be answer take away commanded king when have gone called upon two remaining chief moroosi sekukuni to justify if must have naught to say o great one answered moroosi save a be with ingona so be with sekukuni demanded king also be victim of sekosini wile serpent tongue answered chief must never have joined conspiracy have not led secretly to believe that when thou wert gone must be made king in thy stead prospect dazzled for believed must govern better than thou again king waved hand last two of conspirator be led away amid intense breathless almost ominous silence for few minute lobelalatutu sat with chin resting upon chest apparently reviewing situation then lifting head spoke chief of makolo said ye have to day heard how sekosini chief witch doctor seven of most powerful influential among secretly plotted together to destroy by so doing to set at other throat like wolf fighting over carcass ye have also heard what mean be adopted to render plot successful how six of number be sent along dark path by witchcraft of sekosini how must have taken same journey for superior witchcraft of who sits here at side be power that compelled sekosini to come hither to day tell truth be to power that 'nkuni will owe life for healer have promised to save make whole again think ye that be mere chance brought healer friend mighty hunter into land of makolo at moment when for sekosini plot must have be crowned with success tell nay be because have be ordained that whom four spirit of wind set upon throne must continue to rule over be useless to plot against who be under protection of spirit for a ye have seen can lead to detection overthrow of plotter yet eight who have to day confessed guilt before be not equally guilty therefore punishment will not be equally severe have such thing a happened in day of m'bongwele have died lingering painful death have be taught to temper justice with mercy therefore while must be punished for conspiring against lawful king punishment will be in strict proportion to guilt be matter requires careful consideration for while on one hand be determined that punishment will not be too severe be equally determined that will not be weakly lenient go therefore now to morrow will summon again to hear sentence pronounced upon guilty one be dismissed five minute later great place be empty dick having followed king by invitation of latter into house for several minute lobelalatutu remained sunk in profound reverie evidently pondering upon question of exceeding difficulty at length however raised head said give hearty thanks o healer for help have afforded in discovery of who be concerned in conspiracy have day be revealed have for time suspected that something of kind existed dreamed not that be so serious so many of chief be involved in must devise mean by to discover truth be wisdom o healer found way now again desire help of wisdom to enable to apportion to offender punishment proportionate to crime heard what culprit have to say in defence doubt not that saw a did that be not equally guilty be not troubled about sekosini mapela amakosa guilt be indisputable die death if be permitted to live must plot against again n'ampata also be dangerous man too be opposed to system of government be not to be trusted be better that must die than that must live perchance stir up conspiracy against to be suppressed only at cost of many more life chief be not like ordinary men wields power influence authority a think so do follower if be to call people to arm against even must obey country must thus be involved in civil war resulting in much slaughter for sake of people must prevent only way to do be to remove disaffected be not truth o healer undoubtedly answered dick be better that few must die than many who foment rebellion stir up strife incite to act of violence murder be even more guilty than misguided individual who listen to act upon suggestion king nodded agreement with expression of opinion therefore said in order to prevent stirring up of strife incitement to bloodshed sekosini mapela amakosa n'ampata must die a to others be not so sure have conspired against be true consented to slaying of seven of most trusted chief counsellor must have brought anarchy upon people therefore must also be punished yet ingona lambati moroosi sekukuni have be friend have aided with valuable counsel when have be confronted with problem of great difficulty danger never until now have shown least sign of disloyalty be valuable servant whom must be most difficult if not altogether impossible to replace above feel almost certain that in heart be not disloyal that a ingona said have be bewitched led astray by craft of sekosini think that head witch doctor evil influence removed must henceforward be a be aforetime true loyal subject must not destroy if may otherwise be safely dealt with what doe wisdom advise in case o healer be very difficult delicate question upon to advise dick never perhaps felt more heavily handicapped by youth inexperience than did at moment yet be evident that savage king at loss how to deal with problem be practically leaving decision a to fate of four men in hand advice might be must be followed for several minute anxiously pondered upon situation then light inspiration suddenly came to why must not again employ marvellous hypnotic power to solve problem have already done so with perfect success in case of sekosini why not in of others must place under influence then compel to disclose innermost secret of heart thus determining beyond doubt exactly how deep feeling of disloyalty went whether went too deep to be capable of being uprooted replaced by one of absolute fidelity in future point determined must be able to advise with absolute confidence better still enable king to decide for yes be undoubtedly best thing to be done turned to lobelalatutu with sigh of relief listen o great one said ask for advice now be ready to give let four chief ingona lambati moroosi sekukuni be brought hither in charge of guard have placed over then will lay magic upon so that will speak only plain simple truth even a sekosini spoke just now to own condemnation thus will ye be able to judge exactly how far man may be trusted in future be advice good acceptable be very good will act upon forthwith answered lobelalatutu clapping hand to summon messenger gave instruction that four chief must be at once brought into presence few minute later stood before in charge of two fully armed guard dick after allowing to stand for full minute in oppressive silence prevailed in order that mind might be suitably attuned to ordeal be to undergo suddenly rose to foot walking up to man gazed steadfastly at in peculiar manner have already found so marvellously effective at once brought under hypnotic control then retiring to seat have just quitted powerfully willed that man must reply with absolute truth candour to question asked concealing nothing laying bare inmost secret of heart a thus concentrated will upon theirs watched man narrowly presently seeing that be absolutely under control raised hand said in low impressive voice listen o ingona lambati moroosi sekukuni lobelatatutu king great one be about to question further concerning conspiracy in ye have be engaged with sekosini be will that ye will answer question truthfully without reservation concealment of kind ye hear hear o healer will obey answered four a with one voice be well said dick now o great one proceed with question be assured that ye will learn whole truth listen o ingona said king while ago ye attempted to explain to why ye have joined conspiracy fomented by sekosini be there aught more that ye must say in extenuation of crime nothing o great one answered ingona sadly crime be too rank to admit of extenuation be true that there be among who think that even peace may be bought at too high price if price includes forgetting by warrior of art of war impossibility of training young men to fight never since death of m'bongwele have be allowed to wash spear in blood of enemy in opinion of many enemy be consequently growing overbold insolent who be that must presume to judge king action to say to ye will do ' ye will not do ' to do so be crime king who tamely suffers be too weak to govern so powerful nation a makolo yet committed that crime now when be too late when have be done may never be undone greatest shame grief be be ever weak enough to open ear to beguilings of serpent sekosini that ever permitted to turn eye from straight path hide from until too late dreadful consequence must have ensued have sekosini plot succeeded ti pity ye saw not in time ingona said king reproachfully tell now if conspiracy have ripened to fruition must o ingona have taken field led warrior against nay answered ingona must not time be when blinded misled by sekosini plausible argument misrepresentation might have done so that time be past even before arrival of healer have begun dimly to foresee evil must come to nation through plot be in mind to take step for frustration forestalled lambati demanded king nay o great one answered chief conspired against joined enemy be true know now that madness be momentary have time come must have arrayed on side against enemy moroosi questioned king a answered while ago o great one a be with ingona so be be with have gift of fluent speech pray to recall what said to believe that agree with word must fain say again sekukuni reiterated lobelalatutu spoke falsely o king when said be victim of sekosini wile answered sekukuni think a think answered a did only in hope that punishment might be mitigated tell lobelalatutu that if yonder white man have not interfered saved by magic must have fought against even to last man for be to have be king in stead know under rule makolo nation must have recovered lost greatness king for moment looked astounded at bold defiant speech for have hitherto regarded sekukuni a one of most trustworthy chief quickly recovered from astonishment signed guard to lead away prisoner chapter eleven place of red stone day be well advanced when at length dick maitland weary hungry returned to tent where found grosvenor indulging in bath change of clothing after preliminary exploration of ruin seemed to be engaged busily upon affair of state not likely to need so trotted off to take general look round explained well demanded dick what do think of awfully interesting answered grosvenor wonderful people must have be who be responsible for building of city people of refinement know fond of

before attempt anything of sort know that will come out all right good light correct exposure isochromatic screen film bound to come out right y'know found place where professor pal have be digging must have done lot of work johnny end of soil turned over where dug for pavement thing pray what have be about day old chap dick told pretty well in how have passed day even going so far a to describe hypnotic experiment of have said nothing to grosvenor thus far with result that mighty hunter be rendered almost speechless with astonishment hypnotised eh ejaculated well will be shot thought hypnotism be humbug tommy rot y'know collusion that sort of thing yes agreed dick there be doubt that much of be nevertheless hypnotism be perfectly genuine science tremendously powerful agent for good if properly used there be well known institution at nancy for instance where several almost miraculous cure have be effected solely by employment of hypnotism oh yes hypnotism be genuine enough make mistake about hypnotic practitioner can do many wonderful thing by employment for instance do suppose that old villain sekosini must have revealed detail of precious plot to day have not hypnotised suppose must acknowledged grosvenor er say old chap be just wondering whether be quite playing game doin ' square thing by wizard other johnny to make give away under influence of hypnotism eh what ah now said dick raise question of exceedingly controversial character admit of course at first blush regarding matter superficially if may say so certainly must seem have taken unfair advantage of fellow by compelling to speak truth so give away a expressively put yet why ask must not be made to do so be evildoer to be permitted to shelter from consequence of misdeed behind protective screen of lie be right to be handicapped in battle with wrong by what after seems to overstrained if not altogether false sense of justice there can be little doubt that skilful criminal have escaped just punishment of crime simply because have refused to incriminate of course be all right from criminars point of view be right from point of view of community who look to law to protect from own view give for whatever may be worth be that criminal have right to be protected from be interest of community not of criminal have to be considered if by speaking truth furthers end of justice ought to be allowed to do so ay even compelled where compulsion be possible a in case of conspirator here have certain men who for own selfish end deliberately planned to plunge makolo nation into horror of civil war deluge with blood of own people also in pursuance of plan foully treacherously took life of six of most important chief endangered that of seventh be playing game ' in other word be acting openly above board on contrary act be wrapped in secrecy be characterised by vilest treachery must have be successful for intervention for be certain that fact must never have be brought to light have not compelled sekosini to speak truth that being case how must nefarious scheme have be defeated by side playing game if by playing game mean that be not to compel even permit to incriminate to seems to resolve into if one side insists on playing game while other side refuse to do so first must always suffer defeat while other triumph where side insists on playing game represents right justice law order other side represents evil criminality result must be triumph of lawless over lawabiding a euclid observes be absurd qed yes agreed grosvenor suppose be right dick put a put certainly doe seem absurd fantastic distortion of sense of fairness that in ceaseless struggle between good evil latter must be helped former handicapped a much a possible at event in present case think have successfully demonstrated right to act a did now having settled that point propose that have dinner seems to be ready if one may judge by look action of ramoo samee sun have barely risen on following morning when dick grosvenor received invitation from king to present forthwith in great place where conspirator be to be brought up for judgment to be pronounced upon a such invitation be tantamount to command hastily finished breakfast upon be engaged when message reached ordered horse rode away toward appointed spot upon arrival found chief who have be summoned like to hear sentence pronounced already assembling while king bodyguard motionless a statue be ranged in semicircle round throne have be placed in position for accommodation of king stool stood on side of throne upon arrival dick grosvenor be at once conducted to almost immediately afterward king made appearance approaching throne seated thereon while present accorded royal salute dick grosvenor standing saluting in military fashion then at sign from majesty who be entitled to sit did so order be given to lead forward prisoner conducted by guard eight prisoner face set expressionless a mask ranged in line before king then for full minute there ensued profound impressive silence be at length broken by lobelalatutu who commanded in calm stern voice sekosini chief witch doctor mapela amakosa n'ampata sekukuni chief of makolo stand forward listen to doom out of own mouth have ye be convicted of conspiracy against peace of nation sekosini mapela n'ampata amakosa yesterday boldly defiantly acknowledged guilt have nothing to plead in extenuation of sekukuni in addition to being conspirator have proved liar coward for at public trial in presence of now assembled declared to be like ingona lambati moroosi victim of sekosini wile serpent tongue whereas afterward when be brought before privately compelled by healer magic to speak truth acknowledged that former statement be false made only in hope of mitigation of punishment that in foul guilty heart thought a sekosini must have fought against to last man in attempt to overthrow destroy to satisfy unlawful ambition greed of gain five men holding position of high authority trust must have set callously tribe against tribe regiment against regiment man against man until people have fallen strewed ground like leaf of autumn land be drenched in blood be enough be menace danger to nation must die in old day of reign of m'bongwele day be so anxious to restore dying must have be lingering long drawn out excruciating torment under teaching of who put on throne have learned to be merciful sentence be that be led forth hanged by neck from bough of tree ended be cruel iniquitous life there left a example warning to who think such evil thought a yours bind take away in instant guard who have charge of doomed men seized proceeded to bind hand behind with thong of hide prior to leading away to place of execution with one exception submitted silently without protest sekosini however witch doctor seemed determined not to go without firing parthian shot for fixing eye on dick shouted in high piercing voice listen o belungu be through accursed magic go forth day to die death of shame ignominy for for must have kept secret plan must have succeeded must have be triumph though magic triumph now will not always be so too have potent magic by mean of mine eye can pierce veil of future see many thing be to be see other belungu going hence through many danger to far country where other danger await mark though go only one of will return be enough have said be ready so heavily charged with bitter hate malignity be tone of witch doctor voice expression of burning eye that despite sober common sense dick must scarcely repress shudder at veiled threat conveyed by man parting word attention be quickly diverted by voice of king commanding ingona lambati moroosi to listen to while announced decision concerning attend to word o chief of makolo nation said lobelalatutu raising voice so that present might distinctly hear ye be present yesterday when summoned eight conspirator before to defend ye heard ingona lambati moroosi sekukuni declare that there be treason in heart that have be bewitched led astray by sekosini be inclined to believe a doubtless ye be grieved must be obliged to condemn to death who have served well in past might perchance if spoke truth serve well again in future yet how be to know word be in very deed truth be perplexed troubled in perplexity sought counsel from friend healer counsel that gave be good said behold now o great one thou shalt summon men again before thee by power of magic will cause to speak very truth to thee thou shalt read inmost secret of heart thus shalt thou gauge exact measure of guilt in matter a healer spoke so be three who stand before have indeed be beguiled led astray for time from fidelity by wile of sekosini there be treachery in heart confessed that have conspiracy ripened must have arrayed on side while sekukuni confessed that be indeed guilty of that have be charged with therefore although have sinned in conspiring against must consequently be punished yet punishment will not be death sentence upon o ingona lambati moroosi be that ye be banished hence to farthest confines of kingdom be stationed at point where neighbouring nation be most aggressive there ye will be placed in command of troop who guard land there ye will find ample outlet for warlike propensity there if ye will ye may atone for fault by rendering a good service in future a ye have rendered in past have said a last word passed king lip shout of irrepressible triumph rejoicing went up from present for three chief most intimately concerned have many friend be regarded by with esteem respect almost amounting to veneration there be little doubt therefore that king clemency in punishing crime by banishment to point where duty must not only be arduous also honourable did much to strengthen position increase popularity for several day following conspiracy trial nothing of moment happened excitement have be aroused by somewhat sensational discovery of plot sequel gradually subsided until at length everybody be once more going about business a calmly quietly a though nothing abnormal have ever happened meanwhile dick grosvenor diligently applied to systematic exploration of ruin taking of many photograph be highly skilled amateur photographer be also endowed with considerable amount of artistic taste moreover grosvenor have devoted considerable amount of time to perfecting of in science of photography in natural colour have provided with requisite apparatus needed consequently by time that have completed labour found possessor not only of large number of negative of highest value from archaeologist point of view also of several exquisitely beautiful picture in natural colour of ruin a seen under various atmospheric effect such a early morning sunrise sunset latter being exceptionally fine because of gorgeous hue of sunset be characteristic of place be about week after trial of conspirator execution of sentence passed upon that king lobelalatutu sent for tendered hearty thanks for important service dick have rendered in unravelling detail of plot bringing plotter to trial a well a for saving life of chief 'nkuni who under healer sedulous ministration be already up about again king took pain to make perfectly clear that gratitude be deep absolutely sincere even going to length of proposing that must take up permanent residence in country promising that if must do so must make chief offer be made in perfect good faith have of course to be treated with utmost apparent seriousness dick explained highly a appreciated majesty generosity be impossible for to avail of for simple reason that have long ago made other arrangement to must adhere then said king if ye will not remain with help by wisdom to govern great people say now in what way may reward for great service ye have done there be way answered dick ye may remember o great one on day when first came to said be seeker of gold stone glitter shine even such stone a that shine red in necklace wear said that maybe must help in search if will cause to be shown place where such stone be to be found will give leave to take a many a may desire will be reward enough surely if will content ye be easily done answered king will give order that men will go to place dig up a many of stone a ye desire ye will take away with whither ye will be small thing plea not that ye will take so little therefore since journey hence be to be far one will give out of mine own herd forty picked ox young strong to draw wagon to make good such loss a may happen through sickness attack of savage beast will also give order so long a way lie within border ye will be supplied with ye may require be enough be enough o king thank answered dick now behold work here be done give therefore guide to place of red stone send digger after that may be gone for a have said journey be long must hasten will be even a ye have said agreed king when desire ye to leave a soon a ye will be able to provide with guide answered dick then be even now answered lobelalatutu grieve that ye be leaving since can not persuade to stay say go in peace may spirit watch over that journey be prosperous place of red stone be distant one day ox trek from here therefore send forward wagon at once with guide whom will give ye will follow on horse know not whether will meet again o healer of sickness mighty hunter if ye return whole makolo nation will give welcome farewell ' hour later dick grosvenor having dispatched wagon on ahead then gone round to bid farewell to various chief swung into saddle turning back regretfully upon village ruin of ophir cantered off upon two magnificent horse king have at last moment added to gift of ox animal be superb specimen of kind jet black without white hair upon standing about fifteen two in height perfectly shaped with fine clean sinewy leg not too long splendid shoulder haunch skin like satin perfect in temper courageous a lion speedy easy paced jumped like cat be tough a whipcord a found to great satisfaction before many day be past be in fact perfect specimen of exceptionally fine breed of horse peculiar to makolo country mounted on magnificent animal seemed to carry absolutely without effort although of be light weight two rider soon overtook slow moving wagon then carefully noting instruction of guide who be piloting vehicle passed on toward sea gleamed softly in extreme distance quiet steady canter of three hour duration left new mount apparently a fresh a have be at start brought horseman out upon long stretch of sandy beach upon swell of indian ocean broke in long line of diamond spray with never ceasing roar of deep toned thunder with sigh of relief at grateful coolness of sea breeze after stifling heat of plain have just crossed gladly swung out of saddle passing arm through bridle proceeded to look about beach upon found be very ordinary unpicturesque looking stretch of brown sand running practically straight also practically north south a far a eye must see in direction averaged about one hundred twenty yard in width be very flat on landward side be bounded by bank of red earth ranging from ten to about fifty foot in height cut into here there by dongas through one of have descended from plain to level of sand ordinary high water mark seemed nowhere to reach within le than thirty yard of toe of bank there be indication in shape of little patch of dry crumbling seaweed other ocean debris that in stormy weather breaker occasionally reached to foot of bank in place actually undermined at distance of about mile to seaward long line of white water betrayed position of reef um exclaimed grosvenor after have allowed gaze to travel over prospect for several minute be pretty desolate looking spot mistake not at sort of place where must expect to find precious stone be why not retorted dick laughingly gem be sometimes found in most unlikely looking place did not expect landscape to be distinguished by unusual characteristic did 'pon word know replied grosvenor somehow expected to look very different from after however what doe beauty otherwise of landscape matter so long a ruby be really here suppose be here somewhere eh have made mistake come out at wrong spot do think well admitted dick may not have hit precise spot perhaps think can not be more than mile from perhaps quickest way of finding will be to search for now just let think for moment flying fish people started by searching beach professor possessing superior knowledge to others searched face of cliff finally when precise locality of mine have be discovered went to work with pickaxe shovel dug way down to level of pocket think best plan must be to search for hole must still be conspicuous enough to admit of identification let return by way of donga to top of cliff starting from there ride along close to cliff edge taking one direction other ought to come across within mile mile at most right be old chappie come along answered grosvenor preparing to mount a however placed left foot in stirrup be about to spring into saddle dick checked hold on moment phil exclaimed eye intently searching certain part of cliff about quarter of mile distant do see notch in line of cliff over there from here look something like breakdown ' may be very spot want to find anyhow be quite worth examining if must prove not to be mine can at event reach top of cliff by mean of can start search from there come along next moment pair be up cantering toward spot at point toward be riding cliff be quite low crest being not more than fifteen foot above level of beach therefore although notch gap be of insignificant width reached from top to bottom of cliff face offered way of sort from beach to level of plain above a horseman drew near saw that although be breakdown ' collapse of cliff face be undoubtedly caused by artificial excavation have have origin few yard inland from line of crest rode right into found in sort of basin shaped pit one side of having broken away have left gap through have entered single glance around sufficed to assure that have reached place of be in search dismounting flung bridle over horse head to ground leaving to stand a have be trained to do while proceeded at once to search place for precious content have not to look far be evident that time weather have wrought slight change in place since have last be worked change consisting chiefly of fall of earth from side here there pebble singly in little group of dozen so be plentifully strewed about surface of soil very first one examined proved to be exactly similar in character to of king necklace be composed such however be not invariably case many of stone searcher picked up turning out to be quite worthless nevertheless ten minute sufficed to satisfy prospector that source of boundless wealth lay practically within reach of hand for during short period of have secured dozen ruby of varying size from of pea up to pebble a large a pigeon egg while grosvenor have be lucky enough to find specimen a large a duck egg by end of hour have more than doubled amount of find have filled jacket pocket a full a be prudent to load be evident that profitable a desultory haphazard method of search have proved to be much better result might be hoped for from systematic pick shovel work accordingly agreed to suspend further operation until arrival of wagon party of labourer have be placed at disposal by lobelalatutu therefore scrambled out of pit set about searching for suitable site for camp eventually pitching upon spot about quarter of mile distant from mine by time that wagon arrived tent have be pitched day be too far advanced to make worth while for work to be started be therefore decided to give worker good long night rest after wearisome tramp from king village hour after sunset saw entire party wrapped in profound sleep with appearance of sun above sea rim on following morning everybody be once more astir after early breakfast general adjournment be made to mine where under dick maitland superintendence dozen party of makolo be soon actively engaged with native mattock shovel in excavating soil in search of precious stone one half of party being employed upon work of digging while other half turned over excavated soil extracted from stone happened to contain dick grosvenor employing meanwhile in passing from party to party sorting out ruby from worthless stone upturned in way considerable progress be made by midday very handsome pile of ruby have be accumulated consisting however for most part of relatively small stone be not however until late in afternoon that real good luck came to then came in moment party of native who have for time be left to have excavated quite little cavern in side of pit a might have be expected mode of working ultimately resulted in cave in fortunately for worker who be responsible for detected sign of approaching fall in time to avoid being buried by when dust cloud occasioned by presently subsided new face thus laid bare came to be examined be discovered that veritable pocket of ruby have be exposed stone one of of large size especially fine fire colour being so numerous that almost shovelful of earth turned over contained one more be without exception so very much finer than finest have hitherto be found that latter be there then incontinently discarded fresh collection be at once begun whole body of native being concentrated upon one spot so enormously rich did pocket prove to be that when at declining sun gave warning that moment to cease work have arrived dick grosvenor be fain to acknowledge to other eager a former be to make fortune have now collected sufficient ruby to constitute not one two exceedingly handsome fortune in case quantity acquired be a great a must be at prudent to cumber with in view of long arduous journey still lay before chapter twelve life in wild dawn of following morning in latitude preceded rising of sun by bare quarter of hour witnessed awakening of white men camp to scene of brisk activity for after dinner conversation of previous evening between dick grosvenor have resulted in arrival at decision to make immediate start on long trek hoped must end in discovery of mysterious white race rumour persistently asserted to exist somewhere in far interior of great dark continent approximate situation of have gleaned from friend mitchell natal sugar planter breakfast be soon over while jantje be away rounding up cattle driving in preparatory to inspanning dick grosvenor opened case proceeded to reward munificently gang of makolo labourer who have helped in acquisition of ruby with generous distribution of bead brass wire empty tobacco tin length of coloured print toy finally dismissing happy in possession of what to simple savage be wealth beyond anything that have ever ventured to dream of then cattle being inspanned little party headed away inland in north westerly direction striking small stream by outspanned three hour later on day week struck river of importance flowing through exceedingly fertile country abounding in game upward course of river followed for next eight day although led somewhat out of way for found upon scouting in direction wished to pursue that direct course must soon carry into arid waterless district infested moreover by tsetse fly to enter must infallibly result in serious loss of cattle preservation of cattle be now very soon must be matter of vital importance to at two leader of expedition industriously scouting daily toward direction in wished to travel found that have reached point where must be safe for to leave river strike away toward west north west immediately did so country in direction being free from fly consisting of wide rolling plateau rising one beyond somewhat like broad willow step with solitary lofty hill rising in extreme distance district be well watered by number of tiny rivulet be clothed with rich young grass thickly dotted with clump of mimosa palmetto other tropical growth amid game of various kind must be seen moving including small herd of giraffe be much too good opportunity to be missed friend therefore after taking careful note of spot where immense animal be feeding returned to wagon having provided with abundant supply of ammunition changed saddle from horse that have hitherto be riding to two have be presented to by king lobelalatutu cantered off after giving mafuta whom left in charge of wagon stock strict injunction to make for certain indicated spot there outspan await light breeze be blowing happened to be favourable to approach have arrived within hundred yard of large clump of mimosa in have last seen giraffe feeding when heavy swishing crashing of branch caused to draw rein next moment enormous elephant emerged from thicket stood looking about a flourished great branch of foliage in trunk with seemed to be keeping fly at bay for few second seemed to be unaware of presence of hunter stood angrily switching branch about head back grunting grumbling to a though be not in precisely best of temper be immense tusker by far biggest that traveller have thus far encountered that be hero of many battle seemed evident for tusk be broken off short leaving only about foot of jagged ivory protruding from jaw first impulse of two hunter be to swing gently out of saddle take shot at for huge beast be standing in very favourable position nearly broadside on grosvenor happening to notice broken tusk settled back into seat again murmuring a did so let leave poor beggar alone dick be not worth shooting see tusk be practically impossible for animal to have heard grosvenor voice for purposely spoke in low tone in order to avoid attracting elephant attention yet a word be spoken huge brute faced sharply round toward two horseman stood attentively regarding for moment then tossing aside branch with have be whisking threw up trunk trumpeting savagely charged straight toward use waiting let scatter shouted grosvenor obedient to touch of heel bridle two magnificent horse friend bestrode swerved round a though upon pivot dashed off in direction at right angle to other for instant great beast seemed disconcerted at manoeuvre appeared unable to make up mind enemy must pursue first following one of for yard two then turning in pursuit of other presently seemed to dawn upon that must not possibly hope to overtake final choice be grosvenor whom settled down to chase in grim earnest long trunk outstretched to utmost limit immense ear flapping furiously small eye sombre with concentrated hatred a soon a dick saw that brute have definitely marked down grosvenor a prey turned bridle rode in direction parallel with be being followed by pursued pursuer began to shout loudly in hope of again causing elephant to hesitate even if must not altogether divert from pursuit of grosvenor ruse be vain monster glanced viciously once in dick direction refused to be diverted from fell purpose at beginning of singular race there have not be slightest doubt in dick mind a to ultimate result felt absolutely confident that suberbly mounted a be must be able to gallop away from pursuer elude with utmost ease now to consternation began to realise so far at least a grosvenor be concerned escape be distinctly doubtful unless something must be done toward altering existing condition for strong speedy a be horse be frightfully handicapped in race by grass at particular spot happened to be unusually long reaching a high a horse shoulder tough tangled rendering exceedingly difficult for to force passage through while to huge bulk momentum of elephant seemed to offer obstacle at great beast be rapidly gaining upon grosvenor a rapidly forging ahead of dick upon whom began to dawn that unless something be speedily done to prevent tragedy must inevitably ensue looked anxiously about saw that at distance of about mile patch of long rank grass came to end be succeeded by short smooth turf over going must be everything must be desired be much too distant to be of service in present emergency for elephant be gaining at stride must inevitably overtake fugitive long before must reach while horse be already beginning to show sign of distress a plunged panting through obstructing tangle in midst of be constantly stumbling a outflung foot encountered be caught in especially tough patch of knotted vegetation what be to be done something that right quickly if a thought be flashing through dick brain saw friend horse stumble heavily make desperate effort to recover finally roll over disappear completely with rider in dense ocean of greenish grey vegetation while elephant bare fifty yard in rear threw up outstretched trunk trumpeted loud blast of savage exultation there be now one thing to be done only question in dick mind be whether there be time enough left excited a be whether have necessary steadiness of hand to do must be attempted at rate so unslinging rifle set at full cock a galloped held pistol wise in hand pointed full at huge bulk of elephant pulled trigger jar of recoil nearly dislocated elbow for fraction of second feared that be lost even a fear gripped heart turning sick faint enormous beast suddenly halted swayed unsteadily for moment on great pillar like leg then collapsed in heap a did so dick to intense relief saw prostrate horse rider scramble to foot almost within arm length of fallen monster mount ride duffer shrieked dick a saw grosvenor stand apparently stupefied staring at prostrate beast may be only stunned if get up again nothing can save better still empty magazine into skull a lie there be need dear chap answered grosvenor calmly must only be sinful waste of valuable cartridge brute be a dead a mutton bullet caught behind ear right be doubt deeply embedded in brain be splendid shot especially considering that be fired from saddle at full gallop too congratulate on old man before forget let thank for saving life if have not fired a promptly a did must have have sure a fate must have be goner eh what although grosvenor spoke in tone of light raillery thinly disguised depth of feeling stirred a dick fully realised when pulled up alongside friend exchanged hand grip lightly a spoke of incident phil knew right well that be on very edge of disaster at moment dick pulled trigger though must fain have treated whole adventure a joke be none le grateful to dick for timely intervention pressure of hand be quite a eloquent a much outpouring of word by jove exclaimed dick a swung out of saddle loosened girth to enable horse more readily to recover wind what monster be far away biggest elephant have ever seen if tusk have be unbroken must have be prize worth having if only a curiosity a be think will be worth while to waste time in cutting out stump do poor beggar must have be suffering pretty badly from toothache see how tremendously that left gum be swollen that mean abscess at root of tusk must have be dreadfully painful wonder that be in such dickens of bad temper well be of value to except a contribution to larder so may a well be going will mark spot where lie send mafuta jantje for one of foot will furnish with epicurean dinner to night now suppose may a well go look for wagon for of course giraffe cleared out directly rumpus began camped that night in midst of wide plateau dotted here there with low kopje of outcropping granite clothed for most part with melkboom interspersed with patch of low thornbush sun dried grass from fact that have met with water since noon greeted with much satisfaction discovery of willow water hole of two acre in extent within about mile of outspanned for night hour before sunset did not care to approach nearer to water than for upon inspecting place became aware from spoor in mud round margin that be favourite if not only drinking place for animal in neighbourhood past experienced have taught that nocturnal sound emanating from such spot be reverse of favourable to sleep moreover have detected among most recent spoor that of lion for sake of cattle preferred to keep at respectful distance from place frequented by such formidable animal at one spot miniature lake be bordered by patch of reed of considerable extent looked a though might harbour few wild duck therefore a soon a wagon be outspanned two friend took shot gun couple of dog have manifested talent at retrieving made way toward reed warning jantje to be careful to water cattle a far a possible from spot toward be making lion cub by time very nearly half grown must fain have accompanied sportsman for have developed extraordinary attachment to of white master loved nothing better than to accompany on ramble be a obedient a of dog with whom be on best of term be deemed best on occasion that must be taken to water on leash with cattle return with to wagon be therefore left behind much to disgust choosing what seemed to be advantageous position two sportsman accompanied by dog carefully ambushed among reed at distance of about hundred yard from other crouching low patiently awaited course of event have not long to wait for proof of soundness of judgment for have not be in position more than hour by time sun magnified to twice size by evening vapour through glowed palpitating like ball of white hot steel hung upon very edge of horizon when whirring of wing warned to be on alert moment later flock of fifty teal must have be feeding on far off marsh during day settled down upon surface of water with much splashing loud quack of satisfaction at having once more reached what doubtless believed to be haven of safety if really entertained such belief be most deplorably mistaken for fate rule destiny of wild duck ordained that must settle on precise patch of water be fully commanded by sportsman three second later gun spoke practically at same instant up went teal again with great whir of wing loud cry of consternation leaving behind round dozen more of dead wounded floating upon rippled surface of water by time that whole of bag have be retrieved dusk be deepening into darkness star after star be twinkling into view from vast cloudless purple dome above two friend therefore scrambled forth from hiding place perfectly satisfied with thing else prepared to make way back to wagon have not progressed above two dozen pace beyond margin of reed however when grosvenor who be leading way along narrow track through coarse grass uttered sharp ejaculation halted suddenly in track next moment stamping violently on something just before what be matter old chap demanded dick stepping quickly to friend side snake replied grosvenor briefly in rather tremulous tone of voice trod on unintentionally of course beggar turned sand bit take that brute where be thing demanded dick anxiously there responded grosvenor pointing to writhing twisting something squirmed on grass a ground heel of heavy boot on take foot away man let have look at commanded dick a other did a be ordered maitland bent down directed quick keen glance at reptile about six inch of whose body be crushed almost to jelly then quickly pinning flat heart shaped head to ground with muzzle of gun pulled trigger thus effectually put end to creature existence with barrel of weapon deftly whisked still writhing body dozen yard away into long grass then turned sharply to friend sit down old chap quick said show where be bitten somewhat startled by companion abrupt manner grosvenor seated on ground drew up left trouser leg pulled down sock revealed two small puncture close together in lower part of calf of leg barely visible in fast decreasing light see ejaculated dick fumbling in waistcoat pocket a spoke take pocket handkerchief quick tie round leg below knee with barrel of revolver twist a tight a possibly can tourniquet fashion so a to stop passage of blood into body now a drew forth opened penknife blade of made point of always keeping razor keen be going to hurt little bit so set teeth bear old man right go ahead responded grosvenor be brute venomous then ca say responded dick evasively a quickly slashed flesh across across over two puncture be not taking more chance to day boy blood instead of spurting from knife wound oozed forth thick sluggishly whereupon dick without second hesitation applied lip to gash be close together sucked strongly for about quarter of hour spitting out blood gradually began to flow little more freely finally when flow have ceased groped in pocket produced small case containing stick of lunar caustic then from pocket drew forth box of match handed to grosvenor will relieve of said laying hand upon revolver barrel of phil have twisted in handkerchief have be holding in place while can start striking match so may see what be doing then giving revolver extra twist two pulled out own handkerchief deftly secured weapon in place after proceeded by light of match grosvenor struck one after other carefully thoroughly to cauterize wound there remarked cheerfully with sigh of relief a finished task be a much a can do here next thing be to get back to camp a soon a possible right assented grosvenor added a attempted to rise be afraid will have to get to help old chap must possibly of course must responded dick mean that will try just sit where be for little while longer leave to arrange thing therewith drew whistle from pocket of hunting shirt upon blew three piercing blast in quick succession that in breathless stillness of night might have be heard at least mile away repeated signal at brief interval for about ten minute when answering shout be heard whereupon drew three four match from box bunched together ignited held tiny torch aloft to guide mafuta jantje whose voice recognised minute later arrived upon scene anxious to know what be amiss received dick hurried explanation with many au of surprise apprehension then in obedience to brief concise instruction hurried away again at run to return with very commendable celerity bearing grosvenor hammock long pole hacked from nearest tree must find hammock having be spread upon ground patient be under dick anxious supervision laid very carefully upon so that there might be a little movement of body a possible finally hammock having be securely lashed to pole whole be raised upon shoulder of two black by borne to camp arrived there hammock be still with utmost gentleness care slung inside tent lamp be lighted dick proceeded to examine patient afresh by time wounded limb have become terribly swollen grosvenor complained of severe pain about injured region of course be not to be wondered at considering rather heroic treatment to leg have be subjected dick be not very greatly concerned about what caused to look very grave be fact that patient also complained of feeling cold manifested symptom of approaching delirium while whole body be now beginning to be convulsed at rapidly shortening interval by spasm of violent uncontrollable twitching without wasting moment dick now have recourse to alcohol freely dosing patient with neat brandy in hope of inducing condition of intoxication for knew that if must succeed in excess of alcohol in system must neutralise venom patient must be saved be not until have administered nearly quart of spirit that desired symptom began to appear be long past midnight before twitching convulsion entirely ceased patient sank into deathlike sleep by time also swelling of limb be perceptibly subsiding when at length dick turned down lamp disposed to take such rest a might be able to snatch in folding chair by side of friend hammock have satisfaction of knowing that crisis be past phil must live up to moment young doctor have be far too busy altogether too deeply preoccupied in attending upon patient to give attention to indeed be more than vaguely aware of what be happening outside tent although there certainly have be moment when sound of more than usually alarming character have reached ear so distinctly obtrusively a partially to distract attention for fraction of second so now that grosvenor be asleep safe dick began to feel that also must be better for little rest outside sound began to obtrude upon with force persistency must not be denied awoke to consciousness of fact that something quite out of ordinary experience be happening at first be disposed to attribute babel of sound that reached ear to fact that party be outspanned in close almost too close proximity to only water so far a knew existed for many mile round be consequently regular drinking place for living creature in neighbourhood a chum have already ascertained indeed incessant bellowing snorting trumpeting roaring splashing squealing slightly mellowed by distance penetrated to interior of tent be quite enough to justify such idea have scarcely settled in chair beside grosvenor hammock closed eye in hope of wooing sleep to than became aware of other nearer sound dominating first sound of crackling flame frequent low muttered ejaculation occasional soft thud swish of foot running through long grass followed by shout two be almost invariably responded to by low angry snarl while clashing of horn rattling of trek chain almost continuous lowing moaning of ox stamping of horse tethered to wagon whining of dog indicated extreme restlessness uneasiness of animal disturbance be so much greater than usual that dick finally felt called upon to investigate so rising from chair cast quick glance at patient assured that be well there then raising flap of tent stepped forth into open air first sight greeted be that of about dozen fire arranged in circle round about tiny camp in ruddy yellow flickering glare of saw mafuta jantje 'nkuku flitting hither thither tending fire feeding from enormous stack of thorn branch piled up near wagon while ramoo samee indian groom stood with horse talking to caressing soothing excitement by mean in power most of ox instead of lying down be on foot tail swishing agitatedly from side to side head turning quickly way that ear twitching nostril distended sniffing air hoof stamping earth impatiently while eye glowed shone in light of fire ever anon one of must throw up head give vent to low moaning bellow told a eloquently a word state of terror a for dog be huddled together beneath wagon shivering with tail between leg lip drawn back revealing fang in sort of snarling grin leo be only animal who did not seem very greatly perturbed even be awake lay crouching at extreme end of tether eye lambently aglow tail softly beating earth now then ho there mafuta called dick a stood taking in scene admiring generally romantic effect of glowing fire wavering column of smoke uneasy animal flitting figure great bulk of wagon with white canvas tent aglow with firelight mellow star raining down soft radiance what be disturbance about lion baa answered kafir a paused for moment arm filled with great bundle of branch be carrying to fire great bronze body shining with perspiration be beset by if fire be allowed to die down must rush in upon kill stampede whole of ox horse see there there there added pointing into darkness beyond glow of fire dick looked must at first see nothing eye a yet being dazzled by light of flame presently looking in direction toward mafuta pointed caught sight of first one pair of greenishyellow orb then gleaming out of darkness until finally counted le than seven pair of eye intently staring inward by flitting to fro of of pair of eye dick perceived that certain of lion be regularly making circuit of camp in one direction in other apparently searching for unguarded spot at might venture to make dash there be three pair of eye remained stationary a though owner be patiently awaiting signal of sort dick decided be most dangerous of foe at same time most easy to deal with because of immovability so returning to tent first cast quick glance at still soundly sleeping form of grosvenor then took up bandolier threw over shoulder adjusted in position seized rifle satisfied that be fully loaded again made way outside took minute two for eye again to adjust to peculiar condition of light presently again caught sight of one of motionless pair of eye sinking upon one knee raised rifle to shoulder carefully brought two sight accurately in line with point midway between two glowing orb pressed trigger sharp whip like crack of weapon be answered by several low snarling growl swishing of grass suggestive of several heavy body bounding away through while stationary moving pair of eye vanished a if by magic minute two later four five of ox lay down where be tethered to trek chain with sigh of obvious relief be gone baa remarked mafuta a again passed with more fuel must keep up fire for be almost certain to come back again be young lion who have be driven away from pool not allowed to hunt there by old one be hungry yes will come back again will perhaps have to kill two three more before will go away leave alone do think then got fellow fired at demanded dick yes baa answered mafuta with confidence heard bullet strike will find beast dead out there when day break see yonder baa be slinking back there be one pair of eye over there saw in direction yes there be again ah now be gone look there baa see two pair shoot yet wait until come quite close then shoot kill where be that schelm jantje why be not feeding fire if be not kept up will yet lose half ox chapter thirteen mysterious white race two more lion fell to dick rifle night before brute be finally scared out of projected attack upon camp be not until first sign of dawn be paling eastern sky multitudinous sound in neighbourhood of water hole have long subsided into complete silence that watcher felt at liberty to cease vigil snatch hour two of much needed rest meanwhile grosvenor remained completely sunk in lethargic sleep have resulted from saturation of system with alcohol although black have be up working hard night be astir again very soon after sunrise first thing did be to go out bring into camp carcass of three dead lion in order that dick eye might be gladdened by sight of upon emergence from tent then while jantje loosed ox drove to water hole ramoo samee prepared couple of cup of strong black coffee mafuta carried into tent a kafir looped back flap of entrance giving admission to flood of brilliant sunlight brisk gush of cool invigorating air dick stirred uneasily in hammock sat up rubbed eye exclaimed sleepily hillo mafuta surely be not yet time to turn out be seem to have be asleep more than minute then glance fell upon grosvenor hammock memory instantly returned to sprang to foot laid finger upon patient pulse a did so grosvenor uttered low groan opening eye looked dazedly up into eye of friend who bent over hullo dick murmured that say old chap endeavouring to rise what dickens be matter with feel like boiled owl head be aching a though must split mouth be a dry a limekiln look here old man why be holding down in hammock like be not to get up to day eh certainly not at least not just yet answered dick firmly never mind about head mouth what doe leg feel like here just let have look at gently lifting limb pushing up leg of trouser in grosvenor have lain all night laid bare injury swelling although have not quite disappeared have subsided so greatly that limb have once more come to bear semblance to human leg livid purple tint have almost faded out while cauterised wound be perfectly dry healthy in appearance when dick began to gently pinch prod injured member to ask doe that hurt at became evident that there be distinct numbness in limb a far up a knee did not very greatly distress dick sign be indicative of fact that venom in blood have be effectually neutralised a for numbness must probably pas off in course of day well doctor said grosvenor whimsically what be verdict favourable otherwise remember now be bitten by beastly snake last night that did several thing to that made feel horribly queer quite remember how got to tent be brute venomous about a venomous a must well be answered dick need have fear added seeing look of anxiety spring into patient eye danger be quite over now that have to think about be how to cure headache of yours here just in nick of time mafuta have brought coffee take cup drink at once if in course of next half hour feel better will mix draught stop moment just look straight in eye yes be right now drink coffee will completely cure headache will immediately fall asleep waking again in time for breakfast grosvenor obediently took cup drained lay back on pillow thanks old chap murmured that good feel be asleep that be right murmured dick meditatively a eye rested upon other placid countenance why did not remember to try kind of thing last night might have helped matter good deal ah well will not forget next time now mafuta continued turning to kafir what about lion how many did kill last night three baa answered mafuta be to say two lion one lioness full grown quite young in grand condition teeth claw quite perfect be that so queried dick then suppose have be out to have look at yes baa answered black went out brought in be now just outside tent very well said dick draining coffee will have look at what about bath suppose there be chance of one morning eh ramoo samee have brought two bucket of water from hole inkose bath be ready for when will answered mafuta grosvenor sleep appeared to have be extraordinarily beneficial for when awoke to rattle of crockery a mafuta busied in arrangement of breakfast table not only be absolutely free from headache other unpleasant symptom of have complained two hour earlier general condition be also greatly improved swelling of injured limb have subsided flesh have recovered natural colour numb feeling have almost disappeared now remained to remind of disagreeable perilous adventure of previous night be smarting burning sensation of cauterised wound endured with stoical composure indeed laughed at a trifle not worth wasting word about be fully alive to frightful nature of peril from have so narrowly escaped be so earnest profuse in thanks to dick for having twice saved life in course of few hour at young medico laughingly threatened to gag if did not instantly change topic of conversation one of best sign of progress towards complete recovery perhaps be voracious appetite developed when breakfast be placed upon table be not until late in afternoon dick allowed to rise from hammock then be only permitted in order that camp might be moved somewhat farther from water hole with object of avoiding recurrence of annoyance of preceding night by following morning grosvenor be practically well again with injured leg well protected by bandage be once more able to mount horse march be therefore resumed came to unadventurous end in small valley watered by tiny brook a sun be sinking beneath western horizon thenceforward progress be steady averaging about twenty mile day for six day week sunday being always observed a rest day whenever possible primarily for sake of cattle must be confessed be found required at least one day rest in seven upon such prolonged journey a upon be now engaged journey be not altogether devoid of adventure by mean for upon one occasion killed le than five of ox through overwork during hurried flight from neighbourhood of devastating grass fire lost three more at one fell swoop while crossing flooded river six succumbed to snake bite four fell prey to lion seven died of sickness believed to have be induced by eating of poisonous plant after be merely ordinary accident incidental to travel in african wilderness must need too much space to be recorded in detail native whom encountered from time to time during progress be by mean uniformly friendly tact firmness coupled with occasional demonstration of terribly destructive quality of firearm judicious distribution of present among chief secured from actual molestation though there be time when seemed to be figuratively speaking toss up whether must must not have to choose between being turned back wiped out indeed now when have be continuously journeying for nearly three month since have turned back upon friendly makolo nation be daily receiving fresh evidence that be drawing very near to goal of long pilgrimage be by merest chance most extraordinary caprice of king into whose country have penetrated that be permitted to live accorded freedom to pursue journey unmolested for savage among whom now found seemed to be possessed of extraordinarily virulent animus prejudice call will against whiteskins due a traveller eventually discovered to fact that nation of white inhabited adjacent territory between whom black who surrounded on side implacable enmity have existed a far back a history even legend extended from whence white people have come how long have inhabited land of held such stubborn possession there be record to tell grievance of black seemed to consist in fact that interloper a chose to regard occupied whole of peculiarly rich fertile tract of country from though be relatively few in number resolutely refused to be dislodged while surrounding territory occupied by black be comparatively poor sterile ill watered affording ever more scanty subsistence to steadily growing population also there be widespread belief amounting to conviction among black white neighbour be wont to punish such attempt a be made from time to time to drive out by putting prisoner to death in variety of peculiarly hideous form although be by mean clear how belief arose since prisoner ever returned to throw light upon subject be not perhaps greatly to be wondered at if under such circumstance black have gradually come to regard possessor of white skin a incarnation of everything be superlatively detestable person to be destroyed promptly with a little hesitation compunction a one must destroy particularly venomous snake such be feeling grosvenor dick inspired in breast of native in whose hand found upon certain memorable day be at first proposed to put to torture sans ceremonie certain petty chief anxious to curry favour with king intervened in nick of time having made prisoner of entire party sent whole of including wagon ox horse animal generally to king village in order that majesty might have full share of such sport a torture of white men might furnish journey however occupied five day during progress of two white men proved to be so different in respect from only other white men whom black have ever encountered to be possessed of such strange power to be generally such kittle cattle to deal with king learning that stranger be bent upon entering territory of white neighbour ultimately came to somewhat cynical conclusion that must kill two bird with one stone so to speak by allowing formidable stranger to go way inflict maximum amount of annoyance damage upon especial enemy before enemy in turn destroyed unwelcome visitor thus came to pas that after spending close upon fortnight in momentary expectation of hideously protracted death by torture dick maitland philip grosvenor one day found most unexpectedly released belonging returned to permission accorded to proceed upon journey a soon a must instantly availed of permission lest peradventure must be retracted result being that for five day travelled under protection of armed escort until arrived at frontier where escort hurriedly left after jeeringly warning of many evil thing awaited in immediate future scarcely ten minute have elapsed after departure of guard before traveller perceived man intently watching from summit of low kopje about quarter of mile ahead of for perhaps minute stood motionless a statue gazing steadfastly at under shade of hand then turned suddenly disappeared during minute dick grosvenor have brought powerful field glass to bear upon have distinctly seen that skin be white excepting in so far a have become browned by sun that hair be thick black arranged in long straight curl reached to shoulder that be naked save for breech clout about loin pair of sandal upon foot that be armed with long slender spear circular shield target about two half foot in diameter three minute later saw running with incredible speed toward low elevation distant about mile from starting point a traveller discovered when brought glass to bear upon be crowned by low structure so roughly constructed that might easily have passed for mere heap of stone turf later on proved to be sort of blockhouse accommodating outpost consisting of officer ten men two minute later man whom have first seen so exceedingly like that be impossible to distinguish difference at distance of two three hundred yard left blockhouse now perceived be only one of many in sight arranged in somewhat irregularly curved line probably conformed to line of frontier set off at same astonishing speed that first have displayed heading inward from frontier line watched for about five minute then lost sight of over brow of slight undulation beyond roughly constructed blockhouse there be not sign of inhabitant in direction land be rough uncultivated there be cattle sheep to be seen if a strongly suspected blockhouse in sight accommodated few men none of occupant revealed presence made slightest attempt to interfere with uninvited visitor be moot point between dick grosvenor whether must not take bull by horn a be by riding up to nearest blockhouse attempting to get into communication with occupant at once grosvenor be very strongly opposed to such step upon ground that if did so might be summarily turned back ordered to quit country forthwith a phil pointed out with emphasis must be exceedingly tame ignominious ending of long arduous journey policy be to let well enough alone to get a far into country a possible before attempting to open up communication with inhabitant meanwhile to show in possible manner by sober behaviour mission be peaceable one if borderland of mysterious country presented somewhat wild uninviting appearance be not long before traveller perceived that state of thing prevailed only over very narrow belt of territory for a pressed on toward interior first sighted line of blockhouse considerably larger more substantially constructed than first perched upon commanding knoll completely surrounded by stout lofty practically unclimbable stockade then saw few cattle dotted about grazing under protection of quite strong force of armed men similar in respect to individual whom have first sighted people took notice of stranger beyond removing charge well out of route be being pursued by wagon be evident that have desire to come into touch in way with uninvited visitor then mile so farther on herd became larger attendant more numerous next intruder reached what seemed to be belt of farm containing own fortified farmhouse lofty apparently immensely strong solid structure of hewn stone surrounded in many case by moat wet dry with single narrow entrance high up in wall only accessible by mean of ladder unglazed window opening few in number too narrow to permit passage of human being through roof flat protected by breast high parapet structure a whole constituting very efficient miniature stronghold crop appeared to be of most varied character starting with sugar cane on outside margin of what may be called agricultural belt then gradually changing to various kind of grain in turn be succeeded by fruit orchard vineyard last however be not met with until detached farm have be left far behind have be succeeded in turn first by tiny hamlet of dozen house huddled together a if for mutual protection then by village of ever increasing importance dominated by castle like structure looked a though might serve purpose of keep refuge for inhabitant to retire to in time of stress danger however be not reached by traveller until quite late in following day be only referred to now in order that idea may be conveyed of manner in mysterious white race who inhabited country met problem of carrying on agricultural pursuit at same time affording protection to farmer against sudden raid by savage neighbour region belt of small hamlet still lay two mile ahead of traveller when about hour before sunset word be given to outspan in midst of patch of rich pasture watered by small willow stream of crystal clear water by time that sun be sinking behind range of hill rose gradually from plain summit of be apparently about twenty mile distant ox other animal have be watered tent pitched two leader of little expedition having found passable bathing place short distance up stream taken evening dip be impatiently awaiting last meal of day by courtesy named dinner although very inadequately represented usual conception of what that meal ought to be presently viand made appearance haunch of venison cut from buck grosvenor have shot early that morning served sparingly with red currant jelly last pot of have be opened for occasion sweet potato purchased from savage few day earlier flap jack so called because must find other name for made by ramoo samee of flour mealie meal water baked over ember of cooking fire few wild guava a much water from stream a cared to drink followed by very small cup of coffee for coffee sugar be now becoming exceedingly scarce commodity with a ate talked burden of dick conversation being remarkable behaviour of inhabitant of mysterious country in leaving so severely alone course of action be in direct opposition to past experience of african people dick regarded a sinister in extreme settled policy in dealing with savage have always be to approach promptly a soon a met with lose time in making friendly overture leading idea being that if one can succeed in convincing savage harm of kind be intended be just a likely to be amiable a reverse up to now grosvenor have held similar opinion have always most ably seconded dick endeavour to create friendly impression upon native encountered in present case be utterly opposed to usual method fact being that idea of penetrating to heart of country inhabited by mysterious white race have gradually come to be obsession with must hear of nothing being done might by chance interfere with project conviction being that if adopted usual method must inevitably be stopped sent to rightabout have known what be impending anxiety must probably have taken quite different direction two friend be seated in tent partaking of breakfast on following morning when mafuta hurriedly appeared in state of considerable perturbation with information that strong body of armed men be approaching camp upon turning out to investigate saw that be indeed case new arrival being in number about hundred apparently party of soldiery being attired alike in sort of uniform consisting of sleeveless white tunic girt about waist with belt buskin reaching halfway to knee head be bare save for thick mop of black hair arranged in curl reached to shoulder man be armed with long lance spear shield target similar to seen on previous day advanced in single file close order appeared to be under command of man who wore feather head dress whose tunic be adorned with pattern round hem armhole worked in what looked like crimson braid upon be sewn close together large number of small circular disk of polished yellow metal have appearance of being made of brass maybe gold ah ejaculated grosvenor a stood watching approach fear have materialised see dick fellow have undoubtedly be dispatched to conduct back to frontier see safely out of country here end longcherished hope of making acquaintance of mysterious white race be horribly exasperating especially after have actually reached country seen for ourselves people really exists um retorted dick yes be undoubtedly provoking a say hope nothing worse be going to happen than what anticipate must confess that altogether like appearance of thing in general expression upon countenance of fellow in particular seem to detect indication of cold blooded relentless ferocity must cause to convert body into pincushion for spear of theirs with a little compunction a must impale rare moth upon cork with pin may be intention with regard to must rigidly adhere to usual principle of showing fear offering resistance probably if follow plan will not kill on spot while there be life there be hope possibility that chance may turn in favour anyway may happen to hope that will spare black possibly may make slave of well will soon know worst for here come confound dog call off phil if fly at of chap hurt there will be trouble at once here pincher juno pat kafoula befan come in silly duffer come in say d'you hear come in lie down too leo how dare sir dick grosvenor rushed out with aid of sjamboks soon quelled disturbance brought motley pack into subjection animal having made general dash at intruder when latter arrived within fifty yard of wagon while lion cub excited by disturbance have broken rein usually confined to wagon at nighttime have participated in general onslaught at charge of snapping snarling dog approaching body of soldiery have promptly levelled spear interference of dick grosvenor have only just be in nick of time to save animal life little episode left troop commander absolutely expressionless save that latter seemed just trifle astonished when saw dick coolly seize snarling lion cub by incipient mane rate roundly for insubordinate behaviour before ordered brute to retire with dog to wagon next moment in obedience to sign from officer six couple detached from main body of soldiery in trice two young englishman four dark skinned follower mafuta ramoo samee jantje 'nkuku latter absolutely shivering with fear found prisoner with arm tightly bound behind with stout raw hide thong ah ejaculated dick be just what feared might happen still be perhaps better than being killed outright hush interrupted grosvenor sharply listen to fellow giving order to men will be shot if be speaking hebrew something sound uncommonly like hebrew echoed dick nonsense surely mean indeed do then retorted grosvenor never be more serious in life listen yes feel sure be not mistaken be sort of hebrew patois that be speaking hebrew mixed up be true with number of word can make nothing of still can understand enough of what be saying to make out that be giving fellow order to drive in ox yoke to wagon know went in rather strongly for hebrew when be at oxford did pretty well at know what think about dick when come to look at men face seems to that be of quite distinct jewish type eh what well yes certainly be admitted dick hebrew where dickens can have come from goodness know returned grosvenor unless by jove there may be something in idea who be to say that be not one more of lost tribe eh what well of course may be agreed dick be rather brilliant idea of yours old chap may be worth following up if give chance not just now there be more pressing matter claiming attention at moment bond of ours for instance know how yours be mine have be drawn quite unnecessarily tight finger already feel a though be about to burst do think must make fellow understand that there be need at to bind that if will release ask nothing better than to accompany whithersoever may be pleased to take yes think can replied grosvenor at event will try lashing be quite a uncomfortable a yours can be fancy forthwith shouted to officer lengthy if somewhat halting communication in best hebrew at command result being that after long colloquy amazed officer after considerable hesitation somewhat reluctantly gave order for prisoner bond to be loosed after cautioning that slightest sign of attempt at escape must result in instant death of entire party then having scored one success grosvenor attempted by suggesting that jantje must be entrusted with inspanning driving of wagon must be accomplished with much greater facility if ox be handled by to whom be accustomed also officer eventually conceded after carefully considering matter for about quarter of hour meanwhile ox be driven very nearly mad by vain effort of soldier to round up drive towards wagon chapter fourteen prisoner at length after tremendous amount of unnecessary confusion trouble ox be inspanned with usual unearthly yell loud cracking of long whip by jantje mounted upon wagon box creaking lumbering vehicle be got under way ramoo samee following close behind leading horse while dog leo came to heel trotted along close behind grosvenor dick a be wont when master chose to walk be not very often a for soldier arranged a cordon round entire cortege officer in command leading way order be maintained until noon outspan when officer after pressing laid aside aloofness sufficiently to accept grosvenor invitation to join dick at luncheon proved to be thin end of wedge so to speak for man must scarcely sit at same table with two prisoner partake of fare still preserve original attitude of silence toward indeed soon became evident that be consumed with curiosity concerning two people who have travelled distance with such few retainer who seemed to have absolutely knowledge of what fear be who apparently numbered lion a well a dog among domestic animal began by making few tentative remark to grosvenor responded at length then suddenly demanded with air of astonishment that made scarcely effort to conceal how came about that grosvenor total stranger be able to communicate with native of country in what be practically own language then grosvenor entered into long explanation involving brief history of principal seat of learning in england with method subject of study pursued therein including interesting fact that hebrew being commonly regarded a one of most ancient tongue in world be there regarded a especially worthy of attention last statement seemed to be particularly gratifying to young officer vanity have distinctly mollifying effect upon original hauteur coldness thawed visibly even condescended to laugh at mild joke upon grosvenor ventured then sought to further satisfy curiosity by making number of personal enquiry a to where phil friend came from why came how long have be upon journey so on to enquiry grosvenor replied pretty fully when in turn attempted to elicit information respecting destination treatment that might expect to receive upon arrival man at once shut up like trap thenceforward for remainder of journey refused to hold communication with prisoner route lay in direction of range of distant hill judged be intention of captor to cross a went found country gradually changing character by subtle gradation growing ever more fertile more highly cultivated with mile of progress while house increased in number clustered more thickly together at length after passing through one of hamlet emerged upon narrow field path widened somewhat when next hamlet be passed so gradually became more prominent feature until ultimately developed into full blown road rough uneven at first steadily improved in appearance quality until became very excellent much used thoroughfare shaded by tree on hand in short country on extreme frontier be perfect wilderness steadily improved with mile of progress toward interior a regarded evidence of high state of civilisation one of strangest thing however came under notice of englishman be that from moment of arrest inhabitant whom encountered in ever increasing number a day wore on manifested most absolute indifference with regard to not even deigning to cast second glance upon what be clearly most novel unusual sight in country at party encamped at foot of hill toward have be journeying day proved to be much more lofty at much greater distance than have imagined to be when be first sighted whole of next day be consumed in climbing by mean of excellent road to summit of pas where having safely negotiated short length of exceedingly narrow difficult roadway between two enormous vertical cliff emerged upon small plateau of rich grassland afforded good camping ground for night spot where traveller outspanned be bottom of miniature basin of five six acre in extent be surrounded on side by steep slope terminating in series of jagged peak four five hundred foot high that bounded view in direction limited to distance of about mile when after inspanning on following morning crossed little plateau upon have spent night passed round bluff at farther side wonderful prospect at once burst upon astonished gaze for now found that chain of hill up outer slope of have be laboriously climbing during whole of preceding day formed unbroken if somewhat irregular circle of something like forty mile in diameter measuring across from ridge to ridge inner slope of encircling hill being from three to five mile wide with plain of from five to ten mile in width at foot plain in turn encircling lovely lake measuring about twenty mile across very centre of be occupied by island of perhaps three four mile in diameter whole rugged surface of appeared to be covered with building embowered in leafy garden now at last traveller began to really understand wealth importance of people into whose country have entered uninvited for a far a eye must reach even with aid of exceedingly powerful field glass mountain slope plain that lay circling at foot consisted of nothing practically unbroken sweep of highly cultivated land dotted with snug farmhouse bearing ripening crop of various kind interspersed here there with trim vineyard orchard of fruitbearing tree while at distance of from three to eight ten mile apart there nestled among grove of noble shade tree village must have sheltered from hundred fifty to perhaps four five hundred inhabitant through there ran perfect network of road carrying a must be seen with aid of glass considerable amount of traffic among must be distinguished number of wheeled vehicle first have seen since entering country officer who be custodian be evidently intensely gratified at surprise admiration freely expressed by two principal prisoner at scene lay spread out at foot even halted cortege for few minute to enable dick grosvenor to take in multudinous detail conveniently examine through field glass be noticed by two englishman that regarded instrument with most acute curiosity pride reserve deterred from asking question concerning when however dick offered peep through be wholly unable to resist temptation to restrain expression of amazement a glancing through tube at island twenty mile distant be enabled to distinguish such detail a roof window door of house built thereon while of course detail of house in plain below character of several vehicle on road number of ox in team drew be quite unmistakable when grosvenor seeking to avail of temporary relaxation of manner attempted once more to engage man in conversation instantly relapsed into former attitude of unresponsiveness manner soon made clear that be determined to risk complication of kind by allowing anything in nature of familiarity friendliness between prisoner descent from crest of encircling hill to circular belt of plain below be of course quite easy matter compared with ascent of outer slope on previous day gradient of road being practically uniform way just steep enough to necessitate slight application of brakebar to rear wheel of wagon from crest to plain dick noted with surprise that taciturn friend officer in command appeared to be greatly interested in working of exceedingly simple piece of apparatus a though be something with be quite unfamiliar party effected descent reached level plain in about hour half from moment of starting soon found travelling along broad level well kept road among large number of other people most of whom looked at with more le curiosity steadfastly refrained from addressing word of remark to of guard who have in charge about hour after reaching plain debouched into much broader road than by have be previously travelling then became tolerably evident that ultimate destination must be island in centre of lake for road be now traversing be absolutely straight way to margin of lake pointed accurately toward island have be travelling along road for nearly hour be approaching village of more importance than have hitherto passed when there suddenly arose considerable commotion among people on road ahead of who be seen running confusedly hither thither amid great cloud of dust while shout shriek sound of low angry bellowing rose upon stagnant air mechanically whole party came to halt to see what be matter while jantje began shouting to other in greatly excited tone ox be drawing wagon began to low snort sniff air stamp excitedly on ground lunge at other with long horn for perhaps minute be impossible to guess what be happening then shout suddenly grew much louder more excited crowd ahead parted right left a though panic stricken there arose shriek of terror pain perhaps man body be seen to go whirling eight ten foot into air then bulky something presently resolved into huge buffalo bull emerged from dust cloud came charging along road striking out with immense curved sharp pointed horn at everybody in way brute be then only about two hundred yard off be galloping straight toward party with tail high in air head low eye aflame with fury great gout of froth dripping from heavy muzzle for moment soldier seemed paralysed with terror next turned a with one accord leaping irrigation ditch that ran alongside road sought safety in flight across field of young wheat buffalo paused moment in mid career a though hesitating whether must pursue charge wagon team of ox next moment brute have made up mind perhaps attracted by crimson trimming glittering ornament of officer tunic leaped ditch deliberately selected that unfortunate individual a especial object of pursuit position of man at once became one of deadly peril for fast though ran buffalo have advantage in matter of speed be rapidly gaining upon when dick grosvenor sprang to wagon hastily seizing rifle prepared to act dick be first on ground again with weapon sinking on one knee to secure steadiness of aim brought sight to bear exactly behind animal left shoulder fired spirt of flame little jet of filmy blue smoke extorted sharp ejaculation of astonishment from who be near enough to notice be a nothing compared with shout of mingled amazement terror relief went up when huge beast stumbled fell forward on head turned complete somersault lay still slain at very instant when having overtaken fugitive have lowered head to impale shrieking man upon horn with such startling abruptness did huge beast collapse that pursued officer did not realise fact until have run farther distance of thirty yard so even then when at length halted looked back at prostrate motionless animal seemed quite unable to understand that be dead harmless for shouted order to men to close in round buffalo secure with cord before recovered resumed aggressive be not until few of bolder spirit having cautiously approached carcass nearly enough to perceive bullet hole blood flowing from have satisfied that brute be in very truth dead have borne emphatic testimony to extraordinary fact that be able to screw up own courage to point of personal investigation then calmly made way back to road approaching grosvenor demanded explanation of seeming miracle even after have be told rifle exhibited to power laboriously explained seemed quite unable to understand be at last fain to dismiss mystery with impatient shrug of shoulder order for march to be resumed dick have seen man tossed by buffalo have judged by victim shriek of agony that be badly hurt therefore kept eye open a passed along road sharply directed grosvenor to call upon officer to halt when presently came upon group of about dozen person standing by side of road surrounding little group consisting of two person man woman man bleeding profusely from ghastly wound in thigh already grey sharp of feature under shadow of death while woman crouched helplessly in dust supporting wounded man head upon knee without ceremony dick forced way through little crowd of onlooker gave one keen glance at prostrate man then turning shouted to grosvenor chap be bleeding to death phil artery severed apparently just explain to man will tell that with permission propose to save poor fellow life mafuta bring medicine chest here quick little crowd be fast being augmented by new arrival scowled ferociously at to uncouthly clad stalwart figure of young doctor who have so unceremoniously forced way in among remained passive possibly gathering from tone of speech that proposed to succour wounded man did officer in charge of party offer objection obediently called halt when requested by grosvenor to do so few second later therefore dick with grosvenor a assistant be kneeling beside wounded man deftly bathing terrible injury with antiseptic lotion prior to more difficult delicate task of searching for securing end of severed artery have be spouting blood like fountain until dick have applied tourniquet entire operation of dressing stitching binding up wound occupied best part of hour by time roadway be packed with people anxiously enquiring what be amiss eager to get glimpse of benevolent young barbarian who have so strangely come among at so opportune moment who be favourably enough placed actually to see what be going on be filled with amazement despite unreasoning hatred of stranger admiration at deftness with dick first stanched flow of blood then proceeded to dress injury for strangely enough people highly civilised though be in respect possessed most rudimentary knowledge of medicine surgery pinning faith chiefly to virtue of charm incantation knowledge being not nearly sufficient to enable successfully to grapple with so serious injury a with young englishman be so calmly competently dealing a operation proceeded people usually so cold self contained reported progress to who be le favourably situated for observation than in way entire crowd be kept posted up in step until finally great sigh of relief arose from a dick concluded task rose to foot young doctor have not yet finished with patient by mean intended to see safely into own home before left did half dozen of soldier fetching man bed from house carefully lifting thereon carrying in under dick watchful care aided by grosvenor a interpreter done administered soothing fever allaying draught after upon being informed by young officer that must probably have opportunity of seeing patient again hypnotised man subjected to powerful mental suggestion that danger be now past that complication of kind must arise that must rapidly get well without further attention done grosvenor rejoined wagon resumed march delay occasioned by incident of buffalo so retarded progress that be close upon noon before arrived at margin of lake here be curtly informed that be about to be conveyed to island that a be not proposed to take wagon of animal with must indicate what few article thought might require during next few day article must be conveyed across with there be certain indefinable sinister suggestiveness in character of communication seemed to imply doubt in mind of official who made whether individual to whom be made must require anything at after next few day dick grosvenor acting a usual upon general principle of taking optimistic view of everything gave sign that detected anything of covert character in intimation calmly indicated trunk containing clothing medicine chest rifle revolver case of ammunition for same of be duly placed in large craft in shape something between canoe lighter afterward discovered be propelled by sixty paddle at last moment transpired that black attendant mafuta jantje 'nkuku be to be left behind on mainland arrangement also appeared to bear certain sinister significance whereupon grosvenor suggested extreme importance of placing in charge of wagon remaining content part of two case of ammunition to wit explained consisted of terribly powerful magic tampering with by unauthorised person must inevitably have most appallingly disastrous result suggestion grosvenor be informed must receive most careful consideration of authority have satisfaction of believing that not only must probably result in saving life of black at least for time also perceived that hint respecting magic have made very distinct impression preparation for transport of prisoner across lake be soon made in about hour from moment of arrival upon beach be under way circumstance at once struck dick a peculiar be fact that craft in be making passage be unprovided with sail in consequence of have to depend entirely upon exertion of paddler although a happened there be gentle breeze blowing be dead fair for thus boat being large of somewhat clumsy model occupied fully two hour in passage of about eight mile from mainland to island notwithstanding fact that sixty stalwart men be toiling at paddle matter be soon banished from mind of two young englishman by growing interest in mysterious island be gradually approaching for mysterious certainly be in several respect in first place solitary situation right in centre of unknown lake invested with certain aspect of secrecy secrecy always suggests mystery also there seemed to be little traffic between island mainland for during two hour occupied by crossing other boat craft of kind appeared upon part of lake then a gradually drew nearer to island various detail revealed two young englishman became aware that entire island excepting perhaps actual soil of be artificial be to say square inch of surface have apparently be arranged modified by hand of man for bore building be traversed by road formed part of garden tree plant in owed existence precise position to human design arrangement natural feature of island seemed to have be ruthlessly swept away to make room for something forming part of complete comprehensive plan plan bore eloquent

devoid of suggestion of furniture lighted only by small aperture six inch square pierced in outer wall of building must have be at least twelve foot thick chapter fifteen trial verdict well dick exclaimed grosvenor a door be closed upon looked round in dim light percolating through long narrow aperture in wall afforded only supply of air illumination what be present opinion of thing in general well returned dick reflectively outstanding fact dominates others be that have actually penetrated to very heart of mysterious country friend mitchell predicted must never reach have therefore triumphantly accomplished chief object of journey despite difficulty that have encountered for rest cell although be somewhat lacking in comfort convenience a dwelling be at least clean dry pleasantly cool compared with temperature outside be about have to say on matter at present think um retorted grosvenor with suspicion of peevishness in voice be not very much what do think mean to do with be what be trying to get at of course remember that gist of mitchell homily to be go if value life because people like stranger if fellow seriously considered little matter like exploration must soon be thing of past for have noticed that many of johnny whose country have passed through have liked stranger yet have contrived to pull through right thus far of course have be hoping that luck must still hold good that when arrived in country something must happen to enable to create favourable impression upon chappies causing to decide that be exception to general rule be worthy to be treated a honoured guest sort of thing eh what when look round take in detail of apartment seems to that thing have somehow gone wrong ca help thinking that must have more comfortable guest chamber than somewhere in old caravanserai eh what do think have doubt have returned dick yet may consider quite good enough for be not going to worry very greatly just yet must recommend not to do so either be true so far folk have displayed most lamentable disconcerting lack of appreciation of many excellent quality must remember that have not have much opportunity for display of quality a yet opportunity will come doubt when doe will just make friend outside sit up quite know how will do somehow so cheer up old chap fact that have put in here instead of killing at sight so to speak seems to suggest to mind belief that if be displeased at presence in country at least intend to give sort of trial before passing on to executioner oh dash old man talk about executioner began grosvenor when be interrupted by opening of cell door man entered bearing in one hand pitcher of water in other loaf of bread of liberal proportion on wooden platter placed on floor beside prisoner be gone again before grosvenor must sufficiently pull wit together to address food drink be most acceptable for prisoner have taken no refreshment since breakfast that morning day be now drawing to close a must tell by rapidly diminishing light percolated through narrow window fell to upon viand forthwith availing of last departing daylight to find food finally after little further desultory chat in did best to make light of situation disposed a comfortably a must upon floor sought such rest a might be possible under circumstance night followed be certainly not pleasant one for floor be hard sleep be shy of coming to with first glimmering of daylight therefore two prisoner arose weary sore of body in distinctly pessimistic frame of mind found amelioration in fact that hour after hour dragged weary length along bringing visitor food although breakfast hour have long passed noon arrived still footstep approached door of cell when at watch marked hour of three in afternoon without arrival of food without even so much a visit from jailer to ascertain whether not be well with began to ask seriously whether by chance have be forgotten answer came about hour later when door of cell be suddenly thrown open by man who have locked in on previous night who now gruffly summoned to follow emerged from place of confinement gladly enough for have reached that stage of discomfort when one welcome change even though there must be possibility that may prove to be for worse be at once taken into custody by handsomely attired officer in command of ten soldier who armed with short broad bladed spear carrying flaring torch at once closed round word to march be given party moved away along labyrinth of passage turning hither thither in most bewildering fashion until at length reached narrow flight of stone step wound upward corkscrew fashion until emerged into passage after journey of fifty yard conducted into spacious lofty hall lighted at end by large window glazed with what from cursory glance obtained of judged to be talc similar substance number of passage led out of hall down one of party plunged finally passing through doorway into spacious chamber lighted like hall by large window glazed with talc like material already mentioned there be peculiarity about chamber at once attracted attention of two young englishman be wall opposite door by have entered be divided horizontally into two unequal part lower smaller of two being occupied by grille of exquisitely fine carved work executed in kind of greek pattern while upper compartment be filled in with window reaching right across from side to side of chamber threw strong light right down upon precise spot where be halted a two prisoner came to standstill at word of command of officer in charge of party soldier formed into semicircle between charge door grounded spear with clank upon black marble pavement while although room be apparently empty save for officer advanced raising spear in salute exclaimed in loud voice in quasihebrew tongue appeared to be common language of people lord prisoner from afar be present be well replied deep solemn voice from behind grille two friend suddenly realised that be about to be put upon trial for offence of intruding where be not wanted directed gaze upon grille with greatly enhanced interest striving to obtain glimpse of person person behind space of at least twenty foot divided from at distance interstice be too small to afford faintest glimpse of anyone on other side there be pause of perhaps minute then voice have last spoken said let benoni officer who arrested stranger upon arrival in izreel be summoned to give evidence officer in charge of prisoner stepped to door opened spoke few word to someone on other side apparently giving order then closed door again returned to former position in hall did hear that dick benoni izreel two name suggest anything to murmured grosvenor behind hand n o ca say that do except that seem to be not altogether unfamiliar to answered dick in like low murmur familiar ejaculated grosvenor incautiously raising voice must think be why silence interposed officer sternly at moment although grosvenor eye blazed at insult looked more than half inclined to forcibly resent closed lip with fierce snap obeyed injunction at restraining touch of dick hand moment later officer who have brought to island entered closing door behind advanced saluting a faced grille benoni said deep voice from behind screen say what know concerning stranger from afar whom ye yesterday brought across water to bethalia again benoni saluted then facing toward centre of grille proceeded to relate how in consequence of intelligence brought to by runner from frontier proceeded in search of stranger having taken brought to bethalia in accordance with general order providing for such circumstance then proceeded to describe in detail journey making mention of wonderful tube brought distant object near so long a one continued to gaze through from passed on to describe in full incident of infuriated buffalo consternation have created among wayfarer upon road along have charged persistent pursuit of wonderful magic whereby stranger have slain animal from distance at precise moment when have be about to toss into air how finally younger stranger of two have insisted upon interrupting journey to succour man who have be grievously hurt by animal adding that in obedience to order received have early that morning proceeded to mainland to enquire into condition of injured man whom to amazement found to be making favourable progress toward recovery spoke throughout in clear level voice seemed to be concerned only to convey absolutely truthful impression of everything to unseen audience behind grille at conclusion of benoni narrative silence ensued lasting for nearly twenty minute broken only by low sound suggestive of subdued whispering behind grille at length however even ceased silence became almost oppressive for space of about half minute then be broken by voice have before spoken saying white stranger say now by what name be ye known to grosvenor replied name be philip eustace meredith grosvenor that of friend be richard maitland statement be followed by brief silence when unseen speaker said philip eustace meredith grosvenor richard maitland boggled name little especially of grosvenor ye have entered country of izreelites uninvited without even asking permission to do so have sought permission before crossing border must have be refused must have be turned back permitted to depart in peace to enter land uninvited without obtaining permission be against law punishment for offence be slow death here speaker made impressive pause a though to allow statement to be thoroughly absorbed by understanding of most intimately concerned then resumed learn from officer benoni who brought hither that since entering country ye have saved life of two men since men life be more valuable to izreelites than aught else have decided to mitigate punishment to extent ye will live if ye will upon condition that ye swear never to attempt to leave country without royal assent to devote yourselves henceforth to service of izreel in such manner a ye may be directed say now therefore will ye accept life with condition attached to gift will ye go forth from hence to die slow death speech grosvenor carefully translated to dick finishing up by asking what answer will give johnnie dick on one hand have fancy for being marched out from here to die slow death may be something pretty horrible have doubt by sound of on other hand have just a little inclination to bind to end day here among chappies eh what fully agree with dear fellow on point answered dick there be one broad principle upon invariably act be where one be confronted by choice between two evil always to choose lesser of two in case think there can be question a to be lesser of two evil between have to choose because if be foolish enough to choose death must mean end of thing sublunary for whereas if choose life even with condition attached there be always sporting chance of something happening to make matter better for for must rather live even here than die death whether slow quick advice therefore be to take life be offered make best of very well then be agreed returned grosvenor who proceeded forthwith to explain laboriously to unseen judge that accepted alternative of life offered decision be received with low murmur of what sounded like satisfaction on part of behind grille short silence next ensued be followed by further muttering among unseen judge who seemed to be debating important point finally intimation came from mysterious individual that stranger be to be marched to great hall there to take oath formed condition upon accepted life whereupon officer benoni gave order prisoner be marched out of judgment hall through door by have entered making way back along passage have previously traversed party presently found in central hall out of passage in building seemed to radiate traversing now entered much wider passage conducted into what be presumably great hall for be square apartment measuring fully hundred foot way lighted on two adjacent side by lofty window glazed with talc like substance two friend have before observed only in present case glazing glowed with rich colour having be painted dyed with marvellous skill into representation of various apparently symbolical subject a be also light in great central dome supported by massive column occupied about three fourth of roof space of apartment column a well a wall flat portion of roof of hall be also very elaborately decorated in colour while floor be composed of white marble long thin rod might be gold judging from sheen colour depended from great bos keystone of dome supporting group of seven beautifully ornate lighted lamp at height of about twenty foot above floor immediately beneath there be table covered with cloth woven in most intricate elegant pattern apparently of very fine gold thread upon table there lay large roll of parchment manuscript wound upon two golden rod decorated with what looked like pine cone wrought in gold at end behind table stood seven venerable men with long white moustache beard reaching to waist clad in hooded garment of finest wool dyed black reaching to foot hood be drawn so far over head face little of feature must be seen save eye glowed out of sombre shadow cast by hood young englishman still in custody of guard be marched up to within about ten foot of table where be halted whereupon central apparently oldest figure of seven said in deep grave voice at once recognised a have spoken from behind grille draw near stranger take oath will free from ban of law make citizen of izreel for remainder of life lay right hand upon roll with left hand raised toward heaven repeat after swear by sun moon star by light darkness by power of air by flame of seven lamp burn forever will never seek to leave izreel without first obtaining royal assent henceforth will devote to service in such manner a will be directed oath sounded formidable enough after really meant little to who be called upon to take took unhesitatingly with full intention of keeping in letter in spirit since oath be oath form wording might assume done benoni guard be dismissed two newly enrolled citizen of izreel be left alone with seven whom subsequently came to know a elder stern attitude of toward two alien be now considerably relaxed invited phil dick to accompany into much smaller room where to great satisfaction of englishman found substantial meal awaiting to entire party forthwith sat down appetite of ex prisoner be by time brought to fine edge by somewhat protracted fast did full justice to fare placed before to wonder admiration of host who appeared be indifferent trencherman meal over attendant dismissed malachi chief of elder man who have delivered judgment in judgment hall turned to grosvenor said now o philip moment have arrived when elder must decide in what manner whom call dick may best serve izreel

impulsively ask ancient whether know what sail be if will bet must have used yesterday vocation be cut out for can teach how to use sail also how to model craft upon better line by time that have finished that job have doubt will turn up just talk to old gentleman along line see what come of grosvenor did with happiest result ascertained that izreelites knew nothing whatever about sail indeed how to use wind in way a labour saver when told little audience that boat must be propelled corn ground water pumped number of other useful thing done by power of wind alone be at first very strongly inclined to suspect of romancing when further offered to demonstrate to truth of assertion at once agreed to afford facility for so doing cheerfully promised to place at disposal such men material a might require when came to speak of dick qualification a healer of manner of disease injury to human anatomy be even more greatly surprised delighted for astonishing a may appear in case of people so highly civilised in many respect a be izreelites knew practically nothing of medicine surgery pinned faith entirely to efficacy of charm incantation moreover soon transpired that have particular a well a general reason for rejoicing at fact that physician of real proved ability have come among for after considerable amount of discussion among grosvenor be informed that whole nation be racked with anxiety concerning health of young queen myra who seemed gradually becoming deranged especial significance of anxiety being explained by fact stated with utmost gravity that ancient prophecy in placed most implicit faith foretold must ever monarch die without issue fall of nation absorption by savage neighbour must immediately follow point of lay in fact that queen be unwedded insisted on remaining so while savage who surrounded izreel on side be daily becoming more aggressive now here be chance dick explained grosvenor delightedly when have translated above particular to friend sail in with pill potion cure queen marry make prime minister live happily ever afterwards like people in fairy tale eh what will tell chappies that need not worry further about queen for be prepared to cure malady may happen to be of course not answered dick seriously may say if like that will be very pleased to see majesty do what can for pray try to be serious phil for once in way frivolity be well enough at proper time in proper place will not improve people opinion of if see laughing obviously joking over matter seems to be serious enough one for may be sufficiently serious for too in long run yes yes of course assented grosvenor completely sobered by friend grave word quite see what mean old chap promise there will be further ill timed attempt at jocularity on part poor old chappies look bit put out a be will soon make right with therewith proceeded to explain to elder while friend must not promise anything definite without first seeing queen be willing to have interview with at once at majesty earliest convenience must do everything in power to restore to perfect health announcement at once banished glum look grosvenor ill timed levity of demeanour have called up restored matter to favourable condition have be momentarily endangered brief consultation be held at conclusion malachi chief elder hurried away to seek audience of queen with object of endeavouring to secure consent to interview with wonderful doctor from afar meanwhile two englishman be conducted up magnificently wide marble staircase to building formed second story a be of immense edifice in

positively refused to grant audience at when at length succeeded in obtaining admission to apartment by persistent representation that matter upon desired to see be of most vital importance at once angrily ordered out again a soon a understood that have found new physician whom desired to see if queen be willed malachi be very incarnation of pertinacity protested wheedled entreated be indignant by turn to purpose until happened to mention that physician in question be stranger from far country beyond great water when first commanding to repeat statement over again suddenly developed sweet reasonableness caused astonished malachi to doubt evidence of sens by announcing that must see stranger who be to be brought into presence forthwith chapter sixteen dick phil prosper determined to afford majesty time opportunity to repent of sudden decision malachi hastened out of palace a speedily a poor old limb must carry making best of way back to enormous building in stranger be lodged

remarked to dick in quite audible tone phew dick boy did ever see such beauty in born day wonder that old jossers elder be anxious to keep darling alive eh what a spoke faintest suspicion of smile seemed to flicker for moment in eye of queen dick who noticed thought must have be provoked by malachi genuflexion a performed ceremony of introduction pointing to dick first a physician then to grosvenor a friend who have journeyed with across great water who happening in mysterious way malachi did not pretend to understand to posse slight knowledge of izreelite tongue must act a interpreter between majesty physician by time that malachi have finished speech terrible listlessness indifference of queen manner have for so many month be source of anxiety to nation in general elder noble in

friend have said may absolutely rely upon loyal friendship best help at time season possibly may be able to arrange call before day be over meanwhile crave majesty permission for to retire a dick anticipated found chief elder anxiously awaiting return eager to learn young doctor opinion relative to mental physical condition of queen dick with phil for interpreter be not slow to give of course to practised eye have at once be evident that queen myra be simply being worried badgered terrified out of sens by old men who with idiotic prophecy dominating mind desired one thing one only namely to see queen married a speedily a possible to somebody to whom seemed that cared very little dick intended to put stop to at once therefore directed grosvenor to inform elder malachi that queen be in most critical condition that must cure provided that instruction be implicitly obeyed not otherwise last statement set poor old elder absolutely quivering with apprehension dick be not worrying overmuch about anybody else save queen contrived to frighten unhappy elder so thoroughly that at length unreservedly promised for everybody else that word marriage must never again be spoken in majesty presence until dick gave permission also agreed that dick must have absolutely free hand with regard to queen treatment visitor must receive exercise must take so on thus providing for dick grosvenor free admission to palace queen presence a often a chose important matter settled friend retired to own quarter to talk matter over found that various belonging have be brought from cell in have passed previous night be now carefully arranged in own private apartment grosvenor at once went to trunk opened bundled content upon floor feverishly proceeded to sort out half dozen book novel two volume of poem contained exhorting dick to do same in order that poor girl might be provided with new form of amusement with least possible delay be easy for dick to perceive from companion talk that latter have be profoundly impressed by charm lonely state of young queen maitland quietly chuckled a reflected that grosvenor must never have seen have not fled to south africa for distraction from smart of heart severely lacerated by fickle fair one who by way seemed now to be completely forgotten shook head with sudden gravity a thought travelled on into future foresaw possibility of mutual attachment springing up between phil queen must be complication with vengeance determined quietly to do everything in power to prevent ensuing six month passed with rapidity of dream for sooner have two englishman arranged matter relating to queen upon satisfactory basis than discovered that there be cause for anxiety of gravest character in behaviour of savage nation hemmed in izreel on side hitherto have be too busily engaged in fighting other to do more than make desultory war upon izreelites now news of apparently reliable character came to bethalia island city to effect that certain king named mokatto very shrewd fellow by account have entered into friendly communication with ruler of other nation whose country bordered on izreel have pointed out folly of fighting other for particular reason when by uniting force must attack izreelites overwhelm divide country equally among victor counsel there be reason to believe have be accepted for report be almost daily coming to hand of preparation pointed to nothing le than impending attack upon izreel by confederated kingdom be precisely what izreelites have always feared more than other earthly thing when authentic intelligence began to arrive pointing to conclusion that long feared attack be about to be made izreelites grew almost crazy with panic of contending that god be angry at admission of two alien into country that only way by anger must be appeased be by offering stranger a sacrifice upon great altar of temple formed top story of legislative building theory took very strong hold upon certain of most influential of noble who quickly developed extreme jealousy of two stranger whom vaguely suspected of being in unexplained way inimical to interest for time dick grosvenor undoubtedly went in danger of life at length however peril became so imminent that pair agreed to take bull by horn deal with forthwith accordingly convened meeting of seven elder nobility at dick delivered address graphically describing danger in nation stood boldly asserting that only grosvenor must possibly avert of course be rather staggering statement one izreelites be not at disposed to accept unquestioningly without proof dick be equal to occasion grosvenor have discussed matter together have decided upon plan of campaign opposition be silenced by first question what do suppose must happen to queen demanded if be unwise enough to put to death will tell be now on highroad to recovery deprived of ministration must suffer immediate relapse die do need to be reminded of what must follow upon if there be truth in ancient prophecy very thing that most dread must immediately happen in other word destruction must immediately be followed by of entire nation apart from that destruction must be gravest mistake that must possibly make for who be native of greatest fighting nation that world have ever known can teach much in art of war knowledge of be of slightest weapon be poor inefficient know nothing of strategy generalship can instruct in important matter also teach how to make new powerful weapon by mean of will be able effectually to subjugate nation now threaten say then will destroy so involve yourselves in irretrievable ruin will teach how to emerge victoriously from coming struggle with enemy there must be one answer to question jealousy of noble gave way to fear no longer clamoured for death of englishman on contrary be a willing a rest that stranger must be afforded opportunity to make good boast from moment dick grosvenor became virtually dictator of nation victory be perhaps easier from fact that during six month of sojourn have already accomplished much queen for example enlivened encouraged by intimate companionship of two fellow countryman have gradually thrown off incubus of terror be now almost former self again while grosvenor have found congenial occupation in fitting few craft upon lake with sail designing building other craft of greatly improved model including dozen cutter of racing yacht type conceived must be exceedingly useful must savage ever again attempt a have done on several previous occasion to attack island city a for dick densely populated city alone provided with more patient than must conveniently deal with have effected many remarkable cure one of first thing particularly attracted attention of two friend immediately upon arrival in izreel be inadequacy of weapon spear sheaf of spear small round shield target with people be armed now proceeded to rectify by general introduction of bow arrow a auxiliary to spear shield there be abundance of suitable wood for bow to be found in forest on inner slope of mountain on mainland while reed suitable for shaft of arrow grew in inexhaustible quantity along margin of lake when once pattern bow arrow have be made sufficiency of wood reed provided furnishing of man with good bow quiverful of arrow be speedily accomplished there have at first be difficulty in matter of arrowhead have be overcome by discovery of enormous deposit of flint in searching for rich mine of diamond have come to light construction of fleet training of crew having be accomplished grosvenor next took army in hand proceeded to train in use of bow succeeding at length by dint of indefatigable perseverance in converting soldier into army of really brilliant marksman achievement brought time on to nearly nine month from date of adventurer arrival in izreel during first eight month of information have come in from time to time left room to doubt that savage of adjoining nation have combined together be making most elaborate preparation for simultaneous attack upon izreel from side then source of information seemed to suddenly dry up news of description relative to movement of savage must be obtained izreelites be disposed to regard a favourable omen many even asserting conviction that savage have quarrelled among attack from be no longer to be feared dick grosvenor took quite view of matter regarded cessation of news a ominous in extreme dispatched imperative order to frontier for maintenance of utmost vigilance night day also organised strong relay of swift runner radiating from various point along shore of lake to point where attack might first be expected in order that intelligence of invasion might be brought to capital with utmost promptitude strength of garrison in outlying blockhouse be also doubled be put under command of most resolute intelligent captain must be found with instruction that post be to be stubbornly defended until enemy must threaten to surround when be to be abandoned garrison what might remain of be to retire inward to next post so on various garrison contesting inch of ground cutting up enemy a severely a possible gradually retiring inward toward lake bethalia if must not maintain ground preparation did not take long to make since be merely matter of marching supplementary troop to frontier provisioning of various blockhouse fortified farm castle stronghold generally a preparation have be made beforehand week sufficed to place entire nation on defensive still task be accomplished none too soon for on very day succeeding that upon preparation for defence be completed news arrived in bethalia that large body of savage have be seen massing upon various part of border while next day brought intelligence of attack upon almost one of outlying blockhouse of retirement of respective garrison after severe fighting in heavy loss have be sustained by side invasion of izreel have begun be being prosecuted with relentless determination energy chapter seventeen victory triumph end grave news created utmost consternation dismay among elder noble of bethalia for have almost with one accord persisted in believing at last moment savage have shrunk from contest there be however one solitary crumb of comfort in news now came almost hourly from front be severely a izreelites have suffered enemy have suffered ten time more severely having be kept completely at arm length so long a defender stock of arrow have lasted that be only when have become exhausted that savage have succeeded in storming blockhouse driving out defender contained lesson grosvenor dick be quick to profit by sooner did news come to hand than available person be set to work manufacturing arrow thousand of be daily dispatched to front thus far two englishman have remained at bethalia receiving news directing operation from there at urgent request of elder a intelligence continued to arrive from front reporting presence of enemy in overwhelming number retirement of garrison after garrison with detail of terrific fighting in direction be not to be supposed that dick grosvenor must consent to remain tamely pent up in city while chance of life be beckoning from distance must now be covered on horseback in couple of day smart riding consequently induced armourer of town to knock out couple of makeshift sabre intended to take with in addition to revolver magazine rifle announced intention of proceeding forthwith to front have bombshell exploded blown to piece temple formed top story of house of legislature unroofed palace must scarcely have produced more tremendous effect created greater consternation than did simple announcement elder be convinced that if guiding spirit of campaign be ever permitted to take field must inevitably be slain end of thing must come noble be animated by pretty much same uncomfortable conviction a for queen when despite remonstrance entreaty of elder noble dick grosvenor presented at palace to bid majesty farewell promptly ordered arrest of pair gave choice of being confined close prisoner pledging word of honour to abandon intention be in vain that culprit pleaded argued drew most harrowing picture of what must inevitably happen if be not allowed to proceed to front personally supervise operation queen turned deaf ear to that said positively refused to give consent entreated upbraided in turn finally bursting into passion of tear declared that if anything be to happen to phil must die at statement grosvenor incontinently took young lady in arm kissed soothed back into self possession again vowed with ardour that if be how felt about be more than content to remain behind look after provided that must allow dick to go to compromise at once smilingly assented for such be selfishness of lover murder be out at last precise thing have happened dick have foreseen have vowed to prevent if possible because of terrible complication a believed must inevitably ensue two have fallen in love with other chance be that a soon a news reached ear of already jealous noble grosvenor dick must be removed openly privately while queen must at once be ruthlessly forced into kind of marriage that have along regarded with such utter dread detestation here be pretty kettle of fish occurring too at such terribly inopportune moment yet a dick moodily reflected while being ferried across to mainland in one of grosvenor new fast sailing cutter perhaps moment might not be so very inopportune after be fact under able leadership of mokatto savage be pressing izreel a have never before be pressed within recorded history izreel be now literally fighting for life very existence if through help of two englishman country must by chance win out achieve decisive victory over combined enemy be just possible that gratitude that rarest of human sentiment might take form of forgiveness if nothing more in case there be perhaps bare possibility that grosvenor dick might be released from oath permitted to return to own country be doubtful dick decided very doubtful meditation assumed distinctly gloomy tone a having arrived on mainland hunted up mafuta explained to jubilant savage that be about to proceed to front take part in fighting to attempt anything even remotely resembling detailed account of dick maitland adventure during ensuing three week must be impossible for be numerous exciting enough to demand entire volume to do justice to must suffice to say that during eventful period youngster saw enough fighting to satisfy for remainder of life desperate ferocious hand to hand fighting in side ever dreamed of asking giving quarter in disabling wound be immediately followed by death upon spear point of enemy salient characteristic of be continuous ear splitting yell shrill whistling of savage rumbling thunder of thousand of fiercely rushing foot blinding cloud of dust through there appeared phantasmagoria of ferocious countenance gnashing teeth glaring eyeball ruddy flash of ensanguined spear point hurtling knobkerry whirling war club upthrown arm clenched fist reeling body shout of triumph short quick gasp followed home thrust of stabbing spear be kind of thing marked end of day fight when stock of izreelites arrow being exhausted became necessary at last to evacuate stubbornly held position to retire before overwhelming horde of savage despite frightful loss sustained by in course of day fighting seemed daily to increase in number a encircling cloud of contracted with daily retirement of defender towards lake a for dick seemed to bear charmed life for although fearlessly exposed day after day wherever fighting happened to be fiercest most stubborn have thus far received hurt more serious than mere scratch two rather severe contusion from blow of knobkerrie have unhorsed immunity may have be due at least in part to fact that mafuta be always unobtrusively close at hand ready to guard beloved young master ay even to lay down life for if necessary be strenuous day indeed for concerned especially for defender for fighting usually began with dawn continued through day a long a there be light enough to distinguish friend from foe while so far a izreelites be concerned be obliged to maintain watch through hour of darkness in order to be prepared for surprise night attack savage sprang upon from time to time with obvious purpose of exhausting defender strength while mokatto other savage king who have thrown in lot with for purpose of eating up izreelites partitioning country be solacing with assurance that despite frightful daily loss in men be winning all along line dick be artfully drawing after into heart of chain of mountain encircled lake island city of bethalia mountain hill rather for be scarcely lofty enough to be worthy of more imposing appellation be of exceptionally rugged precipitous character to extent indeed that be absolutely impassable except at four point where natural feature have be so far improved upon pass of sort narrow ledge for most part bounded on one side by vertical unclimbable face of rock upon other by appalling chasm have be painfully hewn out of stubborn granite be in direction of four pass that young maitland be now retiring in excellent order enticing enemy to follow for be in pass that expected to win victory intended to convert finally into complete disastrous panic stricken rout of enemy to end have already made certain preparation for news of completion of be anxiously waiting at length news came whereupon having dispatched to commander at other three point identical set of instruction of sufficiently elastic character to leave plenty of scope for initiative on part of leader summoned commander of own division to tent a soon a day fighting be over having carefully fully explained plan to gave explicit instruction regarding conduct upon following day dismissed then mounting tired horse dick rode off up pas at foot pace closely followed by faithful mafuta who dog tired though be after many long day of strenuous fighting chuckled grimly a young master unfolded plan of campaign fighting began with dawn upon following morning be of somewhat different character from of preceding day for hitherto izreelites have always begun day behind shelter of stone wall of sort from have taken best part of day to dislodge from when dislodged have be wont to retreat in more le good order to next stronghold in rear now last of fortified position have be abandoned izreelite army have retired be driven back a enemy firmly believed into mouth of four pass led across hill to lake bethalia have not only entered mouth of pass have retired into until have reached certain spot where natural configuration of surrounding hill be of such character a to constitute position natural fortress capable of being held defended by comparatively small body of men here halted lighted watch fire enemy also halted about mile lower down pas a soon a be dark sent out number of scout with instruction to search for way by savage might slip past during night get round to rear of izreelites of scout never returned to camp who did reported that task assigned to have proved impossible one for after climbing laboriously at risk of neck for varying distance have without exception arrived at point where farther progress be impossible retreat scarcely le so meanwhile izreelite watch fire foremost line of happened to be at turn of pas just where be well within sight of enemy be kept brilliantly burning through night evidencing untiring vigilance on part of izreelite outpost who must be seen by light of fire moving about from time to time when at length first ray of morning sun smote topmost ridge of hill came stealing down side arousing combatant to day of sanguinary strife behold there be izreelites to be seen in neighbourhood of still briskly blazing fire must fresh scout be promptly sent out find trace of then mokatto suspecting ambush sent forward other scout in relay with order to advance up pas relay keeping one next before in sight until leading band must regain touch with enemy when single scout be to return with intelligence strange to say single scout did not return when at fiery chief losing patience at absence of news gave order for general advance up pas impi who led way soon discovered reason for came upon body of scout one after other lying in narrowing roadway with arrow through heart evidently shot from spot near at hand quite inaccessible from roadway yet still enemy be to be seen sign of presence to be discovered until mokatto leading contingent advancing with utmost caution reached summit of pas when found that narrow roadway at point where turned sharply round elbow have be broken down for distance of fifty foot until only space enough be left for men to pas in single file a first man essayed passage of perilous path attempted to work precarious way round perpendicular buttress of rock formed elbow spear wielded by unseen hand be observed to dart forward bury deep in naked breast next moment went hurtling downward off narrow ledge into ghastly abyss that yawned beside a be with first man so be with who followed in desperate attempt to round that fatal elbow until even mokatto fearless resolute warrior a be be fain reluctantly to admit that farther progress by way at least be impossible there be nothing for to call halt consider be next thing to be done to advance be impossible to retreat be equivalent to acknowledgment of defeat after frightful loss already sustained by savage must probably result in rising upon leader slaying in revenge for having fomented so disastrous war while very brief inspection of surroundings sufficed to convince that nothing without wing must possibly surmount vertical rock on one hand descend awful precipice on other yet a looked savage warrior became aware that somewhere there must be path to top of rock for caught sight first of one then of then of many izreelites peering down upon from above then suddenly there came hurtling down from summit of rock five hundred foot above head of savage shower of stone not very big yet big enough falling from height to dash man brain out smash arm leg like dried twig send reeling off narrow pathway to depth below word be given to retire there be other course open to invader for obviously be worse than useless to stand huddled helplessly together upon narrow pathway suffer to be destroyed without ability to strike blow in self defence retreat down pas began then with first rearward movement air pent in between rocky wall of savage gorge began to vibrate with most dreadful outcry of shriek shout yell of dismay panic for a though at preconcerted signal devastating shower of great boulder came pouring over crest of cliff above pas crushing men into unrecognisable fragment hurling by hundred over edge of narrow pathway moreover state of affair prevailed not at one isolated spot only along road a far a be occupied by battalion of savage there be moment of helpless confusion during who be fortunate enough to have escaped first effect of terrible shower stood stricken motionless dumb gazing a in dream at frightful overwhelming destruction have come upon in awful gorge then blind raging panic seized upon survivor who turned fled shrieking down pas intent only upon escaping from ceaseless pounding of merciless hail of boulder madly fighting for precedence with equally panic stricken comrade savagely grappling with who happened to be in front of impeding passage hurling being hurled into ravine gaped to receive scene be appalling beyond possibility of description be not defeat only be not even merely disastrous rout be practically annihilation for of thousand of savage who entered that pas awful death trap on fatal day only hundred emerged from again be so utterly demoralised unnerved with terror that thought of rallying making stand ever entered mind simply ran blindly ahead until fell exhausted there lay absolutely heedless of what might befall a be with mokatto legion in one pas so be with chief who followed in other three pass many of leader mokatto among others be numbered among slain there seemed to be nobody to take lead to assume command invading army have be practically wiped out few survivor have degenerated into flying panic stricken mob dominated only by one idea of escape into comparative safety of own land a for izreelites infuriated at wanton invasion of country fully realising what must have be own fate have savage chanced to have be victor relentlessly pursued flying enemy during whole of retreat down pass must doubtless have destroyed to very last man have not dick personally by mean of imperative message persistently reiterated stayed slaughter by pointing out that victory be too decisive complete for further aggression to ever again become possibility that too relentless pursuit of already desperate men must result in further loss of life among izreelites even representation forcibly a appealed to people who regarded life of men kind a most precious possession of nation scarcely sufficed to curb lust for further slaughter for have become for moment human tiger who having tasted blood abandoned prey only with utmost reluctance with much savage snarling of discontent disappointment at length obvious soundness of dick reasoning gained recognition acceptance by izreelite chief who finally persuaded follower to content with mere ejectment of insignificant remnant of enemy beyond frontier meanwhile dick having paid flying visit to bethalia to satisfy that be well in quarter made arrangement for immediate reconstruction of portion of road through pass have be broken down in order to check advance of invader be temporarily accomplished by building of rough bridge across gap fully recognising how important part have be played by gap sketched out scheme whereby must be made permanent spanned by substantial drawbridge defended at inner extremity by strongly fortified gateway scheme laid before elder who immediately approved of ultimately work be carried out long before many thing have happened in first place victorious izreelites having shepherded last of fugitive over border have returned in triumph to own home have set to work to repair devastation wrought by fighting on land that lay outside circle of protecting hill be considerably le than have be anticipated for so certain have mokatto colleague be of victory that have issued most stringent order against wanton destruction of property result being that such damage a have accrued have only amounted to what be inevitable in course of stubbornly contested fight did not amount to very much where neither of combatant possessed gun other battering paraphernalia of description return of triumphant army to bethalia be pageant exceeding in gorgeousness of display general enthusiasm anything have ever before occurred within memory of living inhabitant of city regular troop be comparatively few in number male izreelite being armed liable to be called upon for active service must occasion for such service arise paucity of number be altogether insignificant detail one thing be of importance counted be that have fought signally defeated force of overwhelming numerical superiority inflicted upon immemorial enemy blow of such crushing severity that lasting peace be now assured little wonder that people so recently hag ridden with perpetual fear often approached perilously close to panic scarcely knew how to give adequate expression to feeling of joy relief now possessed be just little inclined to become extravagantly demonstrative troop conveyed across from mainland in boat landed at one grand flight of step afforded solitary mean of access to island be marched through city to palace house of legislature where received thanks of queen elder for gallantry at last moment be made known to dick to secret profound annoyance discomfiture that nothing must satisfy populace that a one hero par excellence of brief sanguinary war must head troop mounted on horse have carried so gallantly well in press of battle must willingly have avoided distinction if have be possible have indeed fully intended to absent from active participation in pageant note from grosvenor informing that idea have really originated with queen myra that majesty must be intensely disappointed if refused caused good naturedly to set own feeling on one side for nonce consent to become puppet for once in way accordingly be first warrior to pas through gateway gave access to interior of town a emerged from shadow of arch into dazzling sunshine flooded street be met by choir of sixty young woman arrayed in gala attire crowned with rose wearing garland of flower round neck who forming up at head of procession led way singing hymn of triumph rejoicing glorification of victor while others accompanied on flute flageolet cymbal be not all a dick blushing furiously feeling more uncomfortable than ever before remembered emerged from gateway two maiden stepped forward one from side of way while one deftly twined garland of rose round horse neck other catching lad hand gently drew down caused to bend in saddle sufficiently to permit to cast similar garland round neck be distinctly embarrassing situation for modest young englishman to find in a heard shout of greeting acclamation rang out from throat of jubilant crowd who thronged street realised that be outward expression of very real deep feeling of gratitude for important service rendered put embarrassment on one side bowed smiled acknowledgment to frantic delight of spectator in fashion then troop paraded principal street of city while young girl tiny child strewed flower before in roadway populace cheered applauded until spacious park in stood palace house of legislature be reached when halt be called before principal entrance of palace where queen once more in radiant health came forth in few well chosen word expressed fervent gratitude to brave men who have borne so nobly gallantly in defence of country winding up with expression of admiration sorrow for fallen of sympathy for whom relentless cruelty of war have bereaved of nearest dearest then malachi fellow elder appeared pronounced long oration of very similar character going somewhat more into detail dwelt particularly upon fierce undying animosity with savage of surrounding nation have regarded presence of izreelites in country from time immemorial reminded hearer of state of almost perpetual warfare in nation have lived through age described recent attack a most virulent determined that have ever experienced being nothing le than carefully elaborated well ordered plan for complete extermination then touched upon arrival of two young englishman in country spoke of law prohibiting admission of stranger fully explained reason have led to exception being made in case congratulated everybody else upon happy issue of exception going on to say that for warlike knowledge skill of visitor superlative importance of part have played in planning carrying out scheme of defence day of triumph glory for izreel must never have dawned wound up by saying that in acknowledgment recognition of enormously important valuable service young men have rendered to nation fellow elder have felt to be duty to recommend queen to confer upon honour distinction accompanying title of prince roar of delighted approval greeted peroration if perchance there happened to be here there noble two who regarded with disapprobation bestowal of unique honour upon alien be too prudent to permit disapprobation to be suspected in view of apparently universal popularity of act queen acutely conscious of fact that contemplated step effect of announcement of be utterly impossible to foresee quick to recognise that popularity of grosvenor dick must probably never be greater than be at moment determined to make utmost of opportunity upon occasion of public investiture of newly created prince electrified everybody present by calmly announcing in manner seemed to suggest that be doing something be certain must meet with full unanimous approval of people that be intention to espouse prince philip a soon a necessary preparation for ceremony must be made announcement be followed by silence so tense that to make use of much hackneyed expression one might have heard pin drop lasted so long that queen grew white to lip eye began to glitter ominously be possible that noble who for military genius of phil dick must now in probability have be with captive in hand of savage be going to show so selfishly ungrateful a to disapprove of choice impatient stamp of little foot on dais defiant upward toss of head seemed to threaten outburst must probably have caused ear of present to tingle when somebody whose identity be never established began to applaud vociferously applause be almost instantly taken up by others until within moment two vast chamber be ringing vibrant with expression of approval rejoicing verdict though delayed perhaps second two too long for majesty entire liking be decisive unmistakable not to be gainsaid if there be present who recognised that meant final collapse of certain cherished ambition of own be wise enough to say nothing about although queen choice of husband be thus ratified by only section of subject who might possibly have raised objection to great deal of exceedingly delicate negotiation arrangement be found to be necessary number of quite unexpected difficulty hitch arose before path to hymeneal altar be made perfectly smooth for royal lover while on other hand a negotiation arrangement progressed grew increasingly clear that man possessed of grosvenor outside knowledge experience be infinitely preferable from point of view of national advantage a ruler to even most powerful influential of izreelite noble by time therefore everything be settled approval have become intensified into delight there be prospect that phil reign must be highly popular one then in due time came marriage may be dismissed with mere mention of fact since make pretence to being love story although even royal wedding may posse little interest for for whose entertainment story be written have most important effect upon fortune of whose adventure be here set forth for by izreelite law not only made philip grosvenor consort of queen also put into hand actual government of nation made in fact king absolute monarch with power to shape control destiny of nation a seemed to good with nobody to say nay whatever nature of decree might promulgate to whom even queen herself became subject then with regard to dick maitland will be remembered that a well a grosvenor have be compelled to take oath that must never seek to leave country without royal assent now that phil be king that assent be of course to be obtained easily enough obtained be a soon a wedding be over grosvenor be securely installed in new position for inducement there might be for phil to pas remainder of life in strange scarcely heard of land of izreelites such inducement existed in case of dick maitland who be now impatience to return to england provide for welfare of mother if haply still survived accordingly having in due form sought obtained royal assent to departure from

horse in izreel ramoo samee being given choice elected to remain in izreel in capacity of stud groom mafuta jantje returned with dick a matter of course a measure of precaution grosvenor arranged for escort of five hundred izreelite warrior to accompany wagon through country immediately on other side of border for although savage inhabitant have received such terrible chastisement that be scarcely likely to interfere with anyone coming from izreel be deemed wisest to run risk of possible hostile demonstration at day hour of parting came dick fully equipped for journey presented at palace to say farewell moment be not without emotion for although have already be planned that at very distant date maitland must revisit izreel bringing with certain matter grosvenor felt must be highly desirable for to posse a monarch of people of such great potential possibility a izreelites remembered that journey from bethalia to nearest confines of civilisation be long arduous one bristling with peril of imaginable kind who must say that must be accomplished in safety if accomplished must be repeated for life be too full of chance for man to make plan for future with certainty that will be able to
