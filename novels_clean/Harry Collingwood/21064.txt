middy in command tale of slave squadron by harry collingwood excellent book by talented nautical author a title implies be tale of young man who be midshipman in royal navy anti slave trade squadron there be usual accident swimming event young man secures promotion by distinguished performance in capture of slaver well written book by author who from actual trade understands how sailing ship be designed built whose work be by reason more worthy of reading make very nice audiobook of eleven half hour duration middy in command tale of slave squadron by harry collingwood chapter one first prize first faint pallor of coming dawn be insidiously extending along horizon ahead a hm gun brig shark latest addition to slave squadron slowly surged ahead over almost oil smooth sea under influence of languid air breathing out from south east be heading in for mouth of congo be about forty mile distant according to master reckoning night have be somewhat squally royal topgallant sail be stowed weather be now clearing a three bell chimed out musically upon clammy morning air mr first lieutenant who be officer of watch having first scanned heaven attentively gave order to loose set again light upper canvas by time that men aloft have cast off gasket confined topgallant sail to yard dawn come with startling rapidity in latitude have risen high into sky ahead spread well along horizon to north south causing star to fade disappear one after until only few of brightest remained twinkling low down in west a wheeled at stern grating in monotonous promenade of lee side of quarter deck hail came down from aloft sail ho two of 'em sir broad on lee beam look a if be standin out from land what be like can make out rig demanded first luff a halted directed gaze aloft at man on main royal yard who way out to yard arm be balancing upon foot rope steadying with one hand upon yard a gazed away to leeward under shade of other ca make out very much sir replied man be too far off one look like schooner t'other like brig be heading out from land say demanded lieutenant look like sir answered man a be sayin ' be long way off be bit thick down to leeward there so all right never mind cast off gasket come down interrupted mr seaton impatiently then turning to said mr grenvile take glass lay aloft if please see what can make of stranger mr keene to other midshipman of watch slip down below call captain if please tell that two strange sail have be sighted from aloft apparently coming out from congo by time have finished speaking have snatched glass from becket be way up weather main rigging while watch be sheeting home hoisting away topgallant sail royal when keene reappeared on deck after calling skipper be comfortably astride royal yard with left arm round spindle of vane yard hoisting close up under truck with right hand manipulated slide of telescope adjusted focus of instrument to suit sight by time dawn have entirely overspread firmament sky have lost pallor be aglow with richest amber through long shaft of pale golden light soaring straight up toward zenith heralded rising of sun thickness to leeward have by time cleared away two strange sail down there be now clearly visible one a topsail schooner other a brig be long way off topsail of brig be leading being just clear of horizon from elevated point of observation while head of schooner topsail just showed clear of sea brig took to be craft of about own size say three hundred ton while schooner appeared to be about two hundred ton have just ascertained particular when voice of skipper came pealing up to from stern grating near stood with mr seaton alongside of well mr grenvile what do make of replied giving such information a have be able to gather added appear to be sailing in company sir thank will do may come down answered skipper then a swung off yard heard lieutenant give order to bear up in chase to rig out port studding sail boom to see clear for setting port studding sail stu'nbeails a be more commonly called have reached cross tree on way down when captain bentinck again hailed aloft there just stay where be for little while mr grenvile keep eye on sail to leeward if observe alteration in course that be steering report fact to at once ay ay sir answered settled down comfortably for what anticipated might be fairly long wait for few minute be now bustle confusion below about helm be put up ship wore short round yard be swung then several hand came aloft to reeve gear rig out boom set larboard studding sail from royal down rather prided upon being smart ship in le than five minute from moment order be given be sliding away upon new course at speed of five half knot with studding sail set on port side rope neatly coiled down once more ere have happened have returned to former post on main royal yard for quickly discovered that shift of helm have caused head sail to interpose between object be duty to watch be to be remedied only by returning to royal mast head skipper in setting new course have displayed what commended to a sound judgment be at such distance from stranger of whom be now in chase that even most lofty canvas be must for little time longer remain invisible from deck be highly desirable since nearer must approach without being discovered better must be chance of ultimately getting alongside only likelihood of premature discovery of proximity lay in possible necessity on part of one other of to send hand aloft must not guard against captain bentinck therefore hoping that such necessity must arise have shaped course not directly for at intercepting angle to own course by mean hoped not only to hold way with also to lessen very considerably distance between before sight of canvas rising above horizon must reveal unwelcome presence to two slaver a believed strange craft to be be also of utmost importance that must have instant knowledge of discovery of presence in neighbourhood of action that must thereupon take hence necessity for remaining aloft to maintain steady careful watch upon movement have be anticipating indeed hoping that sojourn aloft must be lengthy one for knew so long a stranger continued to steer original course must mean that remained in ignorance of proximity to be not to be for have regained original position on royal yard ten minute when a kept telescope steadily fixed upon saw brig bear up run off square before wind schooner promptly followed example of immediately proceeded to rig out studding sail boom on side deck ahoy hailed two strange sail to leeward have instant put up helm be running square off before wind be also rigging out studding sail boom on side thank mr grenvile replied skipper how do bear from now about four point before beam sir answered very good stay where be minute two longer for be about to bear up in chase want to tell when be directly ahead of ordered skipper ay ay sir shouted giving stereotyped answer to order issued on board ship next instant be bustle activity below a helm be put up preparation be made to set studding sail on starboard side a glanced down on deck saw captain step to binnacle apparently watching motion of compass card a ship paid off so at once directed gaze toward stranger moment be brought in line with fore royal mast head sang out steady a go sir stranger be now dead ahead of thank mr grenvile may come down now replied captain a swung off yard saw skipper first lieutenant with head together over binnacle talking earnestly meanwhile wind scant a be seemed inclined to become more scanty still until at length by six bell be to say seven o'clock course be drooping motionless from yard maintop sail be wrinkling ominously with occasional flap to mast a brig hove lazily over long low undulation of swell only light upper canvas continued to draw ship speed having declined to bare two knot gave little more than mere steerage way loud be grumbling fore aft when little later a hand be piped to breakfast breeze died away altogether shark being no longer under control of helm proceeded to box compass be to say to swing first way then that with send of swell only consolation be that stranger to leeward be in same awkward fix a ourselves for if have wind wherewith to pursue in turn have none wherewith to run away from nobody dawdled very long over breakfast that morning for in first place heat below be simply unbearable in next be far too anxious to allow of remaining in berth while knew that conceivable expedient must be adopted by captain to shorten distance between chase be watch below from eight o'clock until noon be consequently off duty although have be on deck for eight hour of twelve during preceding night be much too fidgety to turn in endeavour to get little sleep therefore routed out small pocket sextant have be presented to by friend making way up into fore topmast cross tree from stranger must be seen very carefully measured with instrument angle subtended by mast head of brig horizon so might be able to ascertain from time to time whether not that craft be increasing distance between decided to measure angle half hour having made first second observation without discovering appreciable difference between employed interval in looking about watching movement of two large shark be dodging off on close alongside ship be clearly visible from post of observation at length a three bell half past nine o'clock struck cast glance round ship before again measuring angle when away down in south eastern quarter caught glimpse of very pale blue stretching along horizon that elsewhere be indistinguishable owing to glassy calm of ocean surface deck ahoy shouted there be small air of wind creeping up out of south eastern quarter thank mr grenvile replied captain who be engaged in conversation with mr fawcett officer of watch be coming along pretty fast continued took good long look sir answered be little more than cat paw at present have appearance of being fairly steady how long do think will be before reach asked second luff probably hour at least sir answered noticed mr fawcett say something to skipper then looked up at sail captain nodded a though giving assent to proposal next moment second lieutenant gave order to range wash deck tub along deck to fill be soon done while of hand be busy drawing water from over side pouring into tub others came aloft rigged whip at yard arm by mean of water from tub be hoisted aloft in bucket emptied over sail until inch of canvas that must spread be thoroughly saturated with water thus small interstice between thread of fabric be filled sail enabled to retain breath of air might come along by time that be done first cat paw of approaching breeze be playing around distending lighter sail for moment two then dying away again light evanescent a cat paw be be sufficient to get brig round with jib boom pointing straight for chase once more minute two later first of true breeze reached began to glide slowly ahead before with squared yard men be still kept busy with bucket however for in order that sail must be of real service to be necessary to keep thoroughly wet involved continuous drawing hoisting aloft of water for sun ray be so intensely ardent that water evaporated almost a rapidly a be thrown upon canvas breeze came down very slowly seemed very loath to freshen tantalising though be to be in favour for thus practically carried breeze down with while two strange sail away in western board remained completely becalmed of latter fact soon have most satisfactory evidence for without having recourse at to sextant be enabled in atmosphere of crystalline clearness to see with naked eye that be steadily raising hour sailing having brought bulwark rail of craft flush with horizon at point of observation by time however breeze have three mile ahead of margin where met overran glassy surface of becalmed sea ahead being very distinctly visible at last too wind be manifesting slight tendency to freshen for looking aft saw that after canvas even to heavy mainsail be hanging in brail be swelling out drawing bravely while little streak of froth foam bell gathered under sharp bow went sliding softly seething aft into wake told that be slipping through water at good honest six knot pace with most welcome freshening of wind necessity to keep canvas continuously wet came to end men glad of relief be called down on deck to clean up mess made by lavish use of water half hour passed strange craft be hull up when captain hailed from deck in wake of main rigging what be latest news of stranger mr grenvile asked have breeze yet reached sir not yet answered expect will in course of next half hour be hull up from here sir must think that ought to be able to see mast head of larger craft brig from deck by time hearing skipper mr fawcett walked forward to forecastle former levelling telescope that carried in hand pointing straight ahead then removing tube from eye captain handed over instrument to second luff who in turn took good long look returned telescope to captain stood talking together for minute two then captain bentinck glancing up at hailed mr grenvile said be about to send glass up to by mean of signal halyard want to keep eye on two craft down there report anything particular that may see going on let know when breeze reach whether keep together when doe so ay ay sir answered when telescope came up made comfortable feeling quite prepared to remain in cross tree for rest of watch breeze meanwhile continued steadily to freshen when at length reached two strange sail ahead of be buzzing along with long easy rolling motion over low swell at speed of fully nine knot with school of porpoise gambolling under bow of apparently out vying others in attempt to see of must shoot closest athwart cut water without being touched by shoal after shoal of flying fish sparking out from bow surge streaming away to port starboard like so many handful of bright new silver coin flung hither thither by father neptune a stranger caught first of breeze squared away before presently saw that instead of steering precisely parallel course a though intended to continue in other company be diverging at angle of about forty five degree brig bringing wind about two point on port quarter while schooner steering somewhat more northerly course held about two point on starboard quarter thus while be running almost directly away from be also rapidly widening distance between other must therefore be very necessary for skipper to make up mind quickly of two craft must pursue for be clear that by manoeuvre on part have rendered impossible for to chase be in act of reporting matter to skipper second lieutenant who be walking quarter deck together when mr fawcett who with captain have come to halt at hail suddenly reeled staggered fell prone upon deck with crash skipper instantly sprang to assistance a did young christy fellow mid of mine who be pacing fore aft on opposite side of deck three four men who be at work about job in wake of main rigging between raised poor fellow up carried below subsequently learned when eventually descended from aloft that surgeon have reported to be suffering from sunstroke be complicated by injury to skull sustained by having struck head upon ring bolt in deck a fell meanwhile during temporary confusion ensued on deck in consequence of untoward incident employed in careful measurement of angle made by mast head of two strange sail with now sharply defined horizon noting result upon back of envelope happened to have in jacket pocket have scarcely done when skipper hailed asking whether seemed to be gaining anything upon stranger whether thought that be running away from replied that breeze have reached too recently to enable to judge hoped to be in position to let know definitely in course of next half hour then explained to what have done be pleased to express approval meanwhile continued to steer course about midway between of two stranger by mean be hoped that must be able to keep in sight in readiness to haul up for one upon seemed to be most decidedly gaining breeze still continued to freshen upon to extent that when watch told be time to re measure angle be bowling along at rate of nearly twelve knot sea be beginning to rise while lighter studding sail boom be buckling rather ominously took angle again rather to surprise found that be slightly gaining upon schooner while brig be fully holding own with if indeed be not doing something even better than reported to skipper who seemed to have made up mind already a to course of action for upon hearing what have to say instantly gave order for helm to be shifted in pursuit of schooner then seeming suddenly to remember that be watch below hailed telling that might come down having reached deck at once trotted below to make preparation for taking sun meridian altitude for be now drawing on towards noon when little later again went on deck found that wind have continued to freshen be now blowing really strong breeze while sea have wrinkled under scourging of to most beautiful deep dark blue tint liberally dashed with snow white patch of froth a surge curled over broke in chase after flying hull canvas be now dragging at spar sheet like so many team of cart horse delicate blue shadow coming going upon cream white surface a ship rolled with regularity of swinging pendulum inch of running gear be a taut a harp string through wind piped sang a though whole ship have be one gigantic musical instrument while over arched blue dome of absolutely cloudless sky in very zenith of blazed sun with fierceness made of eager to seek out such small patch of fugitive shadow a be cast by straining canvas sun be so nearly vertical that bulwark although be high afforded protection whatever from scorching ray two strange sail be by time visible from deck be apparent that in strong breeze be now blowing be rapidly overhauling schooner while brig be not only holding own with have actually increased distance a gradually hauled to wind so a to allow to run away to leeward of pursuit of schooner lasted through afternoon be close upon sunset when arrived within range of plumped couple of pound shot clean through mainsail whereupon skipper saw fit to round to standing back topsail hoist spanish colour only to haul down again in token of surrender whereupon mr seaton first lieutenant in charge of armed boat crew went away to take possession of prize since be only person on board possessing even passable acquaintance with spanish language be ordered to accompany prize proved to be dolores of two hundred ton measurement with a have suspected cargo of slave numbering three hundred fifty have shipped in one of numerous creek at mouth of congo on previous day with be bound for rio grande crew be transferred to shark then second lieutenant being ill quite unfit for service be put in command of with crew of fourteen men instructed to make best of way to sierra leone crew of fourteen included gowland master mate young sinclair first class volunteer a well a san domingo servant of midshipman mess to act a steward cook mate therefore mustered only five forecastle hand to watch thought little enough for schooner of size of dolores a hoped to reach sierra leone in week at outside a schooner be unarmed captain bentinck seemed to think that ought to be able to manage fairly well by time that have transferred ourselves trap to prize have fallen quite dark shark therefore lost time in hauling wind in pursuit of strange brig by time have run out of sight of skipper of dolores professed to know nothing beyond fact that be french be named suzanne be running cargo of slave across to martinique chapter two captured by pirate when in answer to summons of pounder captain of dolores rounded to laid topsail to mast did not trouble crew to haul down studding sail for knew that ship be a good a lost to result be that boom snapped short off at iron like carrot leaving raffle of slatting canvas gear thrashing wreckage for prize crew to clear away thus although at once hauled up for port upon parting company with shark have nearly hour hard work before in dark ere studding sail be got in gear unrove unbent stump of boom cleared away thought hardly worth while to get fresh set of boom fitted sent aloft that night accordingly jogged along under plain sail until daylight when got studding sail once more upon little hooker tried pace proved to be astonishingly fast in light even moderate weather felt convinced that have wind not breezed up so strongly a did on previous day shark must never have overtaken during following two day made most excellent progress weather being everything that one must desire water enough to permit of hatch being taken off unfortunate slave brought on deck in batch of fifty at time for hour to take air exercise while remaining below be furnished with copious supply of salt water wherewith to wash down slave deck clear away accumulated filth proved to be very fortunate circumstance captain bentinck have permitted to draw negro san domingo a one of crew for fellow understood language spoken by slave be able to assure that in course of few day must be restored to freedom otherwise must not have dared to give access to deck in such large party for be nearly men fine powerful fellow who unarmed a be must have easily taken ship from heaved overboard dolores have be in possession just forty eight hour be off cape three point though so far to southward that land be visible when sail be made out on lee bow close hauled on larboard tack heading to southward course of dolores at time being about north west by west a closed other made out stranger to be brig first impression be that be shark having captured lost sight of craft of have be in chase be now returning to station to look for convoy into sierra leone under impression kept away couple of point with object of getting somewhat nearer view of by sunset have raised to half way down course by time have come to conclusion that be stranger a gowland master mate persisted in assertion that be shark still held on a be steering feeling persuaded that if be indeed that vessel must be anxious to speak to while if must prove to be stranger great harm must be done beyond loss of few hour on part night fell overcast very dark lost sight of stranger altogether moreover wind breezed up so strongly that be obliged to hand royal topgallant sail haul down gaff topsail main topmast staysail flying jib result of freshening breeze being that very nasty sea soon got up passed most uncomfortable night schooner rolling heavily yawing wildly a sea took on weather quarter saw more of stranger night although of fancied that occasionally caught glimpse of something looming very faint indefinite in darkness away to windward toward end of middle watch weather rapidly improved wind dropped sea went down with although sky continued very overcast night intensely dark by four bell in morning watch wind have died away almost to calm with first pallor of coming dawn cloud broke away there about mile on weather quarter be to say dead to windward of lay stranger of preceding night black clean cut a paper silhouette against cold whiteness of eastern sky rolling heavily with number of hand aloft rigging out studding sail boom brig be most certainly not shark be heading directly for did not like look of at for be a big a sloop if not trifle bigger showed nine gun of side be obviously bent upon getting nearer view of lost time in getting studding sail aloft on starboard side bracing yard trifle forward shaping course must give chance ultimately to claw out to windward of suspicious looking neighbour must have none of for while be still busy ruddy flash leapt from bow port cloud of smoke blue in early morning light obscured craft for few second round shot came skipping toward across black water throwing up little jet of spray a came finally sinking le than twenty yard away well aimed not quite enough elevation exclaimed to gowland who have charge of deck who have called moment before now who be fellow what doe mean by firing at be frenchman think doe take for slaver by way be not very extraordinary mistake to make have better show bunting think parson to man who be hovering close by bend on ensign run up to gaff end there be harm in doing that of course remarked gowland be frenchman at least be not french cruiser be sure of by cut of canvas besides know french craft on station johnny crapaud have such beauty a brig among if care for opinion grenvile be that yonder fellow be slaver be not too tender of conscience to indulge in little piracy at time when opportunity appears favourable a doe at present have heard that in contradiction of adage that there be honour among thief there be occasionally to be found among slaver few be not above attacking other slaver stealing slave from save bother of run in on coast with attendant risk of loss by fever delay perhaps of having to wait until cargo come down ah expected a much a shot from stranger pitched close to taffrail sent cloud of spray flying over so much for respect for bunting if schooner be armed must make respect exclaimed greatly exasperated at being obliged to submit tamely to being fired at without power to retaliate continued since can not fight will run wind be light brig must be smart craft indeed if in such weather a can not run away from next quarter of hour afforded plenty of excitement for while be doing best to claw out to windward of brig kept jib boom pointed straight at thus having slight advantage of wind contrived to lessen distance between sufficiently to get fairly within range when opened brisk fire upon from pounder on forecastle although aim be fairly good very serious damage be done rope be cut here there be immediately spliced by when have so far weathered upon antagonist a to have brought fairly into wake advantage possessed in light wind over heavier craft began to tell soon drew away out of gunshot so far so good have be hoping that a soon a superiority in speed became manifest brig must bear up resume voyage to destination wherever might be whether be that be piqued at being beaten whether be strong vein of pertinacity in character dominated know not skipper of strange brig hung tenaciously in wake notwithstanding fact that be now steadily drawing away from perhaps be reckoning on possibility that breeze might freshen sufficiently to transfer advantage from to believing that might be case gave instruction to take in studding sail to brace schooner up sharp hoping thus to shake off even did not discourage for promptly imitated manoeuvre although now increased distance from still more rapidly than before meanwhile wind be steadily growing more scant when went on deck after breakfast found that be practically becalmed although small breathing be remained of breeze sufficed to keep little hooker under command give steerage way brig however be glad to see be boxing compass three mile astern of about point on lee quarter be now roasting hot sky be without single shred of cloud to break crystalline purity sun poured down beam upon so ardently that black painted rail have become heated to degree almost sufficient to blister hand when inadvertently laid upon while pitch be boiling bubbling out of deck seam surface of sea be like sheet of melted glass save where here there transient cat paw flecked for moment with small patch of delicate blue came went a one looked at even flying fish seemed to consider weather too hot for indulgence in usual gambol for none of be visible be therefore much surprised upon taking look at brig through glass to see that have lowered be manning couple of boat why pringle said to gunner whose watch be what doe mean surely be not going to endeavour to tow brig within gunshot of be must never do for although there be scarcely breath of wind stirring little beauty be still moving through water so long a have steerage way on ought to be able sir such luck a be afraid answered man may have glass for moment thank sir placed telescope to eye adjusted to focus looked through long intently just a thought mr grenvile said handing back instrument if will take squint sir will see that be getting up tackle on yard arm mean unless be greatly mistaken that be about to hoist out longboat again mean that will stick gun into eye of attack with boat in regular man o ' war fashion ai alongside of yet wo be for hour half if wind die away altogether somehow fancy be going to do what be most afraid of be took long careful look round that in flukey weather brig may get breeze first bring down with when ay there be sure enough there be blue water round can see canvas filling to even with naked eye there swing yard to will be keep fast with boat now if little air o ' wind only stick to for hour will have under gun safe enough be a pringle said light draught of air have suddenly sprung up exactly where brig happened to lie by time have got telescope once more focused upon be again heading up for with weather brace slightly checked quite perceptible curl of white foam playing about sharp bow only helped for about mile then left completely becalmed a before while be still stealing along at rate of perhaps knot quarter per hour skipper of brig allowed ten minute so to elapse possibly waiting for friendly puff of wind to come to assistance seeing sign of such thing hoisted out longboat lowered small gun to looked like pounder into dispatched with two other boat in chase of dogged determination animated pursuer be clearly exemplified by behaviour made attempt to cross with rush stretch of water intervening between settled down steadily to accomplish long pull before a rapidly a possible consistent with husbanding of strength for attack when must arrive alongside a pushed off from brig fired gun hoisted brazilian colour affair begin to look serious pringle said a directed telescope at boat there must be close upon forty men in attacking party mount so much a single gun now wonder what plan of attack will be will dash alongside attempt to carry by boarding think will lie off pound with gun until haul down colour sink may try plan sir answered pringle be to say may begin by trying few shot at with gun if find that good expect will try what boarding will do for wo sink be not game be slave believe have got in hold that be after so if bring boat gun into play will find that will be top hamper will aim at so a to cripple will not hull if can help well will not set foot upon deck if can help said pas word for boatswain to come aft pringle if please will probably be able to tell whether there be boarding netting in ship if there be will reeve bend tricing line at once see clear for tricing up net ay assented gunner think will be wise in so doing sir there be nothing like being prepared pas word for boatswain to come aft added to little group of men constituting watch who be busy on forecastle word be passed presently boatswain came along boatswain said have given spare gear of craft overhaul a yet well sir have have a may say answered that functionary know in general sort of way what have got aboard of have examined anything in detail so to speak fact be seeing that trip be likely to be only short one have be kept pretty busy since joined hooker have found plenty else to do well can tell whether there be boarding netting in ship asked boarding netting answered boatswain oh yes sir came across what took to be pile of 'em down below in sail room yesterday good said then let be brought on deck at once see that be ready for tricing up must boat succeed in getting dangerously near to ay ay sir answered man away hurried forward to attend to matter then turned to gunner mr pringle said have goodness to get arm chest on deck see that crew be armed in readiness to repel attacking boat hope may not come to mr grenvile said gunner if doe be afraid will be pretty bad look out for of considerin ' number of course be only thing to do took look round horizon directed gaze first aloft then over side shook head sun eating up what little air there be remarked gloomily reckon that ten minute will see without steerage way too departed to carry out instruction there seemed only too much reason to fear that gunner anticipation with regard to wind must prove true while stood near transom watching steady relentless approach of boat be by now almost within gunshot of suddenly became aware of gentle breeze fanning sun scorched feature slight distinct responsive heel of schooner to in minute be skimming merrily away at speed of quite five knot under benign influence of one of partial breeze on calm day at sea seem to spring up from nowhere in particular last for hour so then die away again in present case however breeze lasted nearly two hour before failed by time have left brig hull down astern of have enjoyed satisfaction of seeing boat abandon chase return to parent ship partial breeze be among most exasperating phenomenon tax sailor patience be of course only met with on exceptionally calm day not always then consist simply of little eddy in otherwise motionless atmosphere be so strictly local in character that be by mean uncommon to see ship sailing briskly along under one of while ship perhaps le than mile away be lying helpless in midst of stark breathless calm two ship mile two apart may be seen sailing in diametrically opposite direction of with squared yard fair wind under ordinary circumstance fickle evanescent character of atmospheric eddy be of little moment involve considerable amount of box hauling of yard cause great deal of annoyance to exasperated perspiring seaman very inadequately compensated by paltry mile so ship have be driven toward destination aggravating character begin end there when one ship be chasing being chased by be quite different matter for eccentric behaviour of same partial breeze may make difference between capturing prize helplessly watching chase sail away make good escape a be case with ourselves may make precisely difference between losing prize retaining possession of thus felt supremely grateful to erratic little draught of air swept beyond reach of pursuing boat piped very different tune when two hour later beheld brig come bowling along after under influence of slashing breeze while lay becalmed in midst of sea of glass atmosphere so stagnant that even vane at mast head drooped motionless save for oscillation imparted to by heave of schooner over swell have of course long ere got boarding netting up stretched along in stop with tricing line bent on everything ready for tricing up at moment notice remembering number of men have seen in boat felt must brig succeed in getting alongside there be tough fight before in at least of brave fellow must lose number of mess must not help reflecting rather bitterly that if breeze be to favour instead of brig considerable loss of life must be avoided that brig must get alongside soon became perfectly evident for be already within mile of coming along with spanking breeze on starboard tack with yard braced slightly forward plain sail set to royal sheet of jib stay sail trimmed to hair thread drawing perfectly while around atmosphere remained absolutely stagnant looked for to open fire upon a soon a drew up within range although gun be run out be doubtless loaded came foaming along in grim silence doubtless skipper saw a clearly a did that have now did not think necessary to waste powder shot to secure what be already within power aim be apparently to range up alongside on port quarter when at length have arrived within short half mile of with sign of smallest puff of wind coming to help gave order to trice up secure netting then for hand to range along port bulwark in readiness to repel boarder be now too late for to dream of escape for even must breeze that brig be bringing down with reach be by time so completely under gun that must have unrigged with single well directed broadside anxious though be a to issue of coming tussle must not help admiring that brig be truly beautiful craft distinctly bigger vessel than shark longer more beamy with side a round a apple with most perfectly moulded bow that be possible to conceive be coming very nearly stem on to must not therefore see run have doubt that be a perfectly shaped a be bow for estimated speed at fully eight knot for vessel to travel at rate in breeze must of necessity have possessed absolute perfection of form be a heavily rigged a man o war canvas be so white that must have be woven of cotton have evidently be cut by master hand for set of be perfect flatter than have ever seen before be coppered to bend be painted black to rail with exception of broad red ribbon round be pierced for eighteen gun when have arrived within about cable length of

strength of crew for sooner did happen than sheet halyard be let go whole of canvas be clewed up hauled down together man o ' war fashion thus with jib stay sail hauled down square canvas gathered close up to yard by buntlines leech line swerved slightly from previous course headed straight for still sliding fast through water with way momentum remaining to just sufficient to bring handsomely alongside now stand by lad cried must not only beat fellow off must follow up when retreat to own ship will be noble prize well worth taking men responded to invocation with cheer be one of most difficult thing in world to restrain british sailor propensity to cheer when there be fighting in prospect a did so brig yawed suddenly poured whole starboard broadside of grape slap into saw bright flash of gun spouting wreath of smoke snow white in dazzling sunshine next instant felt crashing blow upon right temple sent reeling backward into somebody arm stunned into complete insensibility first sensation upon return of consciousness be that of splitting sickening headache accompanied by most painful smarting on right side of forehead be lying prone upon deck when attempted to raise head found that be in way glued to planking with own blood a soon afterwards discovered so effectually that be impossible for to move without inflicting upon excruciating pain feeble movement however have evidently attracted notice of somebody for a raised hand toward head with vague idea of releasing heard voice identified a of carpenter murmur in low cautious tone move mr grenvile move sir for sake hold on a be sir bit longer for if murderin ' pirate see that be alive will finish off altogether lash up a have done rest of then last chance will be gone have happened then simpson murmured relaxing effort a endeavoured to collect scattered wit why answered chip brig chased remember mr grenvile turn out to be regular pirate a ranged up alongside of poured in whole broadside of grape that knocked over killed five outright woundin six more includin ' after of course have difficulty in takin ' schooner then clapped be on of s'pose thought well enough to give trouble now be transferrin ' poor unfortunate slave with water provision for from ship to own what will do after that lord only know expect will be murderin ' trick be cut throat lookin ' lot enough in conscience yes remembered everything now carpenter statement aided struggling memory enabled to recall have happened up to moment of being struck down by grape shot what terrible disaster be have befallen five killed six wounded out of little party of fifteen in addition to that be in power of band of ruthless ruffian who be quite capable of throwing quick dead alike over side when must find time to attend to who be killed simpson asked hush sir better not talk more just now murmured carpenter if chap got notion into head that be alive a like a not 'd put bullet through skull will soon be finished with job now then will see what sort of fate be going to serve out to dared not look up move head in way to see what be going on by listening presently became aware that last of slave have passed over side that pirate be now transferring cask of water sack of meal from ship to own water being perfectly smooth have lashed alongside schooner with few fender between two hull to prevent damage by grinding of together a rose fell upon long scarcely perceptible undulation of swell about quarter of hour later rumbling of rolling water cask loud scraping sound of meal sack on deck ceased there be pause of minute so then heard voice say in spanish last of meal water have gone over rail senor capitan be there anything else be answer in same language may go back to brig dominique see ready for sheeting home hoisting away moment that join there be little breeze coming be high time that be off now juan be ready with auger quite ready senor answered voice then come below with let get job over said first voice immediately upon heard footstep of two people descending schooner companion ladder ten minute later heard footstep returning presently two spaniard be on deck then there came slight pause a though pirate captain have halted to take last look round be quite sure juan that prisoner be securely lashed asked absolutely senor answered juan lashed a be aware be not in habit of bungling job will go to bottom together living a well a dead bueno commented captain ah here come breeze aboard go juan amigo cast off fore aft dominique hoist away fore topmast staysail moment two miscreant have gone chapter three sinking of dolores a sound of hank travelling up brig fore topmast stay reached ear murmured cautiously to carpenter be safe for to move now chip sir no replied in low strained whisper move muscle for life mr grenvile until tell sir brig still alongside unhung villain of skipper standin ' on rail holdin ' on to swifter lookin ' down on deck a though even now ai quite satisfied that work be properly finished at moment felt faint breath of air stirring about heard small musical lap of tiny wavelet alongside a new breeze arrived brig canvas own rustled softly aloft cheeping of sheaf parrals rasping of hank flapping of canvas sound of voice aboard pirate craft gradually receded showing that be drawing away from when a supposed brig have receded from distance of fully hundred foot carpenter said time in natural voice now mr grenvile may safely move sir sooner do so better for villain have scuttled doubt what water pourin ' into like sluice at very moment so please crawl over to keepin ' well out of sight below rail for will bet anything that there be eye aboard brig still watchin ' of cast loose so can make way down below plug auger hole without loss of time at once made move with intention of getting upon hand knee instantly experienced most acute pain in temple due to fact now discovered that shot have struck down have torn loose large piece of skin of forehead have become stuck fast to deck planking by blood have flowed from wound have by time dried to loosen flap of skin cost most exquisite pain when at length have succeeded in freeing rose to hand knee so violent sensation of giddiness nausea suddenly swept over again collapsed remaining insensible for quite ten minute according to carpenter account even during unconsciousness be vaguely aware of urgent even vital necessity for to be up doing be doubt not that helped to recover consciousness much sooner than must have done for feeling to have alluded once more rose to hand knee half blinded by blood started afresh from wound crawled over to where carpenter lay on deck in what must have be most uncomfortable attitude hunched up against port bulwark with wrist lashed tightly together behind back heel triced up to so that be absolutely impossible for to move help in slightest degree a approached poor fellow groaned rather than spoke thank god that be able to move at last mr grenvile be mortal afraid that 't be up with when toppled over just now for pity sake sir cut loose a soon a can for here lashin have be drawed so tight that have lost feelin ' in hand foot while arm leg seems a though be goin ' to burst what have got knife about sir know what be become of mine of men will be sure to have one if enquire among hurried enquiry soon revealed disconcerting fact that must not muster solitary knife among have lost have have taken from there be therefore nothing for to heave poor chip over on face cast adrift with hand proved to be longer much more difficult job than must have believed owing of course to giddiness arising from wound made sight touch uncertain at length last knot be loosed last turn of rope cast off chip be once more free man when essayed to stand poor fellow soon discovered that trouble be not yet over for foot be so completely benumbed that have feeling in when attempted to rise ankle gave way under let down again upon deck then a blood once more began to circulate through benumbed extremity pricking tingling followed soon grew so excruciatingly painful that fairly groaned ground teeth in agony to allay pain chafed arm leg vigorously in course of few minute be able to crawl along deck to companion then make way below meanwhile taking utmost care to keep head below level of bulwark in order that movement might not be detected by chance watcher aboard pirate craft cast loose three unwounded men carpenter being fourth of little band who have escaped destructive broadside of pirate bade assist to cast off lashing confined wounded be still thus engaged when simpson came up through companion dripping wet glowering savagely muttering to well chip said what be best news from below bad sir pretty nigh a bad a can be answered carpenter have scuttled most effectually bored eight hole through skin close up alongside kelson three of have managed to plug after fashion by time have done water have risen so high that found impossible to get at t'others reckon that sundown will about see last of hooker by time yonder brig will be pretty nigh out of sight will have chance to get away in boat for wonder murderin ' thief forgot to damage there be hope think of saving schooner if of who be able be to go below lend hand said sir not slightest answered simpson if must have got below ten minute earlier something might have be done now can hing very well then said let san domingo take two of uninjured men to assist in getting up provision water while other overhaul boat muster gear get everything ready for putting into water a soon a may venture to do so without attracting attention of brig tempting to return make end of while thing be being done wounded men assisted other down into little cabin of schooner where dressed injury coopered up to best of ability with such mean a be to hand after young sinclair whose wound be slight one bathed forehead adjusted strip of displaced skin where have be torn away strapped firmly in position with sticking plaster meanwhile breeze have sprung up so opportunely to take brig out of immediate neighbourhood not only lasted continued to freshen steadily with result by time that have patched other up be ready to undertake mournful task of burying slain wicked beautiful craft have inflicted such grievous injury loss upon have slid away over ocean rim be hull down by time also water have risen in schooner to height that be knee deep in cabin lost time therefore in committing dead comrade to last resting place in deep then proceeded to get boat into water stock with provision for voyage now with regard to same voyage have thus far be much too busy to give matter more than most cursory consideration time have now arrived when became necessary for to decide for what point must steer when moment arrived for to take to boat poor gowland be unfortunately one of five who have be killed by brig murderous broadside of grape be therefore deprived of benefit of advice assistance in choice of port for to steer be by time fairly expert navigator quite capable of doing without assistance if necessary therefore spread out chart on top of skylight with help of log book pricked off position of schooner at noon day from discovered that cape coast castle be nearest port to reach with wind in quarter from be then blowing must be necessary to put boat on taut bowline with possibility even then might fall to leeward of port whereas be fair wind for sierra leone therefore arrived at conclusion that taking everything into consideration must be wisest plan to make for latter port accordingly determined there then proper course to be steered upon leaving schooner dolores have by time settled so deeply in water that be necessary to complete preparation for leaving without further delay san domingo have contrived to get together bring on deck stock of provision fresh water considered must be ample for need simpson have routed out stowed in boat mast sail oar rowlock in short everything necessary for navigation now remained therefore only to get craft in water stow provision kit in be off a quickly a possible boat of dolores be three in number namely longboat in chock on main hatch jolly boat stowed bottom upward in longboat very smart gig hung from davit over stern longboat be very fine roomy wholesome looking boat big enough to accommodate be left of a well a kit very fair stock of provision in order to afford little more room comfort for wounded men decided to take gig also putting into sufficient quantity of provision water to ballast placing simpson in charge of with one of unwounded two of most slightly wounded men a companion leaving six of to man longboat simpson estimate of time at disposal proved to be very close one for sun be within ten minute of setting when preparation having be completed followed rest of little party over side entering longboat gave order to shove off steer north west in company there be at time very pleasant little breeze blowing of strength just sufficient to permit boat to carry whole canvas comfortably water be smooth western sky be ablaze with red golden glory of glowing tropical sunset pulled off to distance of about hundred yard from schooner then a with one consent men laid in oar waited to see last of little hooker end be manifestly very near for have settled to level of waterway be rolling occasionally on long level swell with slow languid movement dipped rail amidships almost to point of submergence ere righted with stagger hove streaming wet side up toward glitter in ruddy light of sunset a took corresponding roll in opposite direction must hear rush swish of water athwart deck a rolled remained thus for three four minute roll being heavier than one have preceded when quite suddenly seemed to steady then a watched slowly settled down out of sight on perfectly even keel last ray of setting sun gleaming in fire upon gilded main truck moment ere water closed over sic transit muttered a turned gaze away from small patch of whirling eddy marked spot where little beauty have disappeared following up reflection with order hoist away canvas lad shape for sierra leone five minute later be speeding gaily away with wind over starboard quarter sheet eased well off gig with finer line lighter freight revealing so marked superiority in speed over longboat in light weather smooth water with be just then favoured that be compelled to luff shake wind out of sail at frequent interval to enable to keep pace with meanwhile pirate brig like ourselves have gone off before wind have sunk below horizon to level of lower yard have between while be keeping craft under fairly steady observation for what simpson have said relative to behaviour of captain attitude of doubt suspicion latter have exhibited when leaving dolores have impressed with belief that must possibly cause watch to be maintained upon schooner until must sink with object of assuring that none of have escaped to tell tale of atrocious conduct a have already mentioned dolores happened to founder at precise moment of sunset in latitude duration of twilight be exceedingly brief still following upon sunset there be few minute during light must be strong enough to enable sharp eye on board distant brig especially if aided by good glass to detect presence of two boat under sail be curious to see whether anything must occur on board brig to suggest that discovery have be made for few minute nothing happened brig canvas showing up clear cut purple almost to blackness against gold crimson western sky revealed variation in direction in be steering presently a watched quick fading of glowing sunset tint noted how sharp silhouette of brig canvas momentarily grew more hazy indistinct suddenly became aware of lengthening out of fast fading image have just time to note ere merged into quick growing gloom that two mast have separated showing that brig have shifted course be now presenting broadside view to be not alone in marking change be evidenced moment later when a drew up alongside gig have be waiting for simpson hailed with question did ye notice sir just afore lost sight of brig that 'd hauled wind yes said did have suspicion that have done so because have hand aloft to watch for report sinking of schooner hand have caught sight of boat if suspicion be correct have waited until believed must no longer see have then hauled wind in hope that by making series of short stretch to windward will fall in with in course of hour two be able to make end of probably waited until have be lost sight of in gathering darkness then shifted helm forgetful of fact that canvas must show up against western sky for few minute after ours have vanished that be just own notion sir answered simpson mean about wishin ' to fall in with make end of will do too unless can hit upon plan to circumvent quite so said must see to that again fall into hand to avoid doing so can think of nothing better than to shift own helm shape course to northward southward with wind about two point abaft beam by doing may hope to get to leeward of brig in about two hour from now when can resume course for sierra leone with reasonable prospect of running brig out of sight before morning a be heading to northward when last saw best plan will be to steer southerly course so up helm simpson will steer west south west for next two hour keeping sharp look out for brig meanwhile that may not run foul of unawares have be steering new course about hour when became apparent that change of weather be brewing though what nature of impending change might be be for moment somewhat difficult to guess appearance of sky seemed to portend thunderstorm for have rapidly become overcast with dense mass of heavy lowering cloud appeared to have quite suddenly gathered from nowhere in particular obscuring star yet not wholly shutting out light for form of cloud mass must be made out with very fair degree of distinctness must probably also have be possible to distinguish ship at distance of mile be presence of light in atmosphere emanating apparently from cloud that caused rather to doubt correctness of opinion pretty freely expressed by men that what be brewing be nothing more serious than ordinary thunderstorm for have witnessed something of same kind before on coast in much more marked degree be true in case appearance have be followed by tornado brief in duration of great violence while lasted therefore felt distinctly anxious more so a be evident that wind be dropping regarded a somewhat unfavourable sign hailed simpson asked what thought of weather why sir replied wind droppin ' worse luck if must happen to die away altogether even to soften down much more will have to out oar pull for must get out of sight of brig somehow between to morrow morning undoubtedly said be not precisely what mean what be worrying just now be question whether there be anything worse than thunder behind rather peculiar appearance of sky directed glance aloft attentively studying aspect of heaven for few moment be bit difficult to say sir replied at last up to now have be thinkin ' that only meant thunder perhaps heavy rain now that come to mention feel so very sure that there ai wind along with too perhaps one of here tornaders if be what be brewin ' will have to stand by keep weather eye liftin ' for tornader 'd be uncommon awk'ard customer to meet with in here open boat be right there said for reason be especially desirable that boat must keep together for mutual support assistance if need be have heel of in such light weather a present might very easily slip away from lose sight of in darkness therefore think that for present at event in order to avoid such possibility have better take end of painter make fast to stern ring bolt then can go ahead a fast a please without risk of boat losing sight of other be done for next two hour boat slid along in company gig leading towing longboat although of course towing did not amount to much since in longboat kept sail set to help a much a possible be by time close upon three bell in first watch notwithstanding softening of wind came to conclusion that must have slipped past brig assuming suspicion that have hauled wind in chase of to be correct therefore ordered helm to be shifted once more course to be resumed in north westerly direction hour later wind have dropped to flat calm simpson suggested that a measure of precaution in view of possibility that brig might still be to westward of must get out oar endeavour to slip past have for time past be very anxiously watching weather have at length arrived at conclusion that if not actual tornado there be at least very heavy dangerous squall brewing away down there in eastern quarter before when burst not only also brig must be obliged to run since must run faster than boat be no longer desirable very much reverse that must lie to westward of therefore decided to keep fast with oar for present employ such time a might be left to upon task of preparing boat a far a possible for ordeal to seemed probable that be about to be subjected be far le anxious about safety of longboat than be about of gig being more lightly built much smaller craft excellent in way for service in fine weather smooth water yet be not adapted for work at sea except under favourable condition in event of coming on to blow hard feared that in resulting heavy sea must almost inevitably be swamped therefore turned attention to in first instance causing to be brought alongside longboat painter to be made fast to ring bolt in stern of latter thus reversing original arrangement intention being that in event of bad weather longboat must tow gig done caused simpson to unstep gig single mast lay fore aft in boat with heel resting upon firmly lashed to small grating covered after end of boat between backboard of stern sheet stern post while head be supported by crutch formed of two stretcher lashed together placed upright upon bow thwart whole being firmly secured in place by two shroud attached to mast head thus arranged mast formed sort of ridge pole sloped slightly upward from boat stern toward bow lugsail be then unbent from yard stretched across mast fore aft thus forming sort of tent over open boat for about two third of length from stern post luff after leach of sail be then strained tightly down to planking of boat outside by short length of ratline led underneath gig keel result be that when job be finished gig be almost completely covered in by tautly stretched sail hoped must not only afford considerable amount of protection to crew must also keep out breaking sea must otherwise be almost certain to swamp so pleased be with job when be finished that determined to attempt something similar in case of longboat craft be rigged with two mast carrying upon foremast large standing lug jib small lug upon jigger mast latter be to say jigger mast small lug stretched over stern sheet of longboat in same way a have dealt with gig leading yoke line forward on top of sail so that steering arrangement might not be interfered with finally close reefed big lug took in jib when be a ready for expected outfly a be possible for people in such circumstance to be that something more than mere thunderstorm be impending there must now be possible doubt strange light of have spoken have seemed to emanate from cloud have now vanished giving place to darkness so profound that seemed to oppress like material substance silence be a profound oppressive a darkness so profound indeed be that accidental sound happened to break in upon such a occasional lap of water against boat planking scuffling movement of man intermittent flap of sail a longboat stirred upon wandering ridge of slow moving swell smote upon ear with exaggerated distinctness be positively startling to almost painful degree accounted for at time by attributing in part to peculiar electrical condition of atmosphere partly to fact that have be wrought up to condition of high nervous tension by conviction that something did not quite know what be impending for be anxiously on watch that in cimmerian darkness enveloped be obliged to depend for adequate warning upon hearing alone caused to resent be impatient of extraneous sound that be to extent case be evidenced by fact that preparation finished have a with one consent subsided into silence be broken only in low whisper if anyone felt necessary to speak suddenly a sat waiting for outburst of threatened storm long drawn piercing cry pealed out across water apparently from spot at very great distance from be although not very loud most appalling soul harrowing sound have ever smote upon ear violent shudder of horror thrilled from head to foot while felt hair bristling upon scalp a listened to three time in rapid succession did that dreadful heart shaking cry come wailing to ear then be silence again for perhaps minute when men about began to ask in low tense whisper whence came from what creature to must confess sound seemed to be such a might burst from lip of fellow creature in very uttermost extremity of mortal terror must scarcely be for how must mortal man have approached within distance of two hundred yard in breathless calm unless indeed in boat of there have certainly be sign in direction hour before if one be disposed for moment to admit possibility whence must boat come pirate brig have be only craft in sight when darkness fell be scarcely within bound of probability that anything then out of sight beneath horizon must have drawn so near to during succeeding hour of darkness again admitting possibility what dreadful happening must have wrung from human lip such blood curdling sound be eagerly discussing matter of men agreeing with that sound be human while others stoutly maintained that be supernatural boded terrible disaster to boat when discussion be abruptly broken in upon by sound of rippling water near at hand a though craft of kind be bearing down upon at speed sufficient to raise brisk surge under bow next instant voice of san domingo pealed out in piercing tone eloquent of direst terror oh look dere eberybody wha dat with howl like of wild beast rose to foot made frantic dash aft for stern sheet fighting way past other men trampling over unfortunate wounded in bottom of boat quite beside with fright indeed there be excuse for negro extraordinary behaviour for intense a be darkness enveloped water be faintly phosphorescent be thus enabled to discern indistinctly that le than hundred yard distant from huge creature to excited imagination appeared to be between two three hundred foot long have risen to surface be now slowly swimming in direction must carry across bow of longboat at distance of fifty foot frankly confess that for moment felt petrified with horror for creature be streaming with faintly luminous phosphorescence thus despite darkness be possible to see that be certainly not whale other known denizen of deep for have head shaped somewhat like of alligator considerably larger than of alligator have ever seen attached to very long somewhat slender neck carried stretched straight out before at angle of thirty degree with surface of water continually twisted way that a though peering about in search of something suddenly paused lifted head high looked straight toward boat at same moment whiff of air came toward heavily charged with most disgusting nauseating odour about equally suggestive of musk charnel house eye distinctly luminous apparently about two foot apart be directed straight toward longboat next instant began to move toward again stretching out neck instinctively sprang to foot whipped pistol out of belt cocking a did so out pistol men give volley cried next instant somewhat confused pistol discharge shattered breathless silence of night own fire have withheld waiting to see what must be effect of men fire upon monster whether of have hit not must not tell beyond causing creature to pause for instant a though startled by flashing of fire volley seemed to have have effect for horrid thing continued to approach boat while disgusting odour emitted grew almost overpowering must have be within ten foot of boat when aimed straight at left eye pulled trigger of pistol for instant bright flash dazzled so must see nothing distinctly heard phitt of bullet felt hot puff of sickening stench strike full in face became aware of tremendous swirl disturbance of water a huge creature plunged beneath surface be gone chapter four boat in tornado have scarcely begun to settle down again regain control of nerve after distinctly startling adventure when dense canopy of black cloud overhead be rent asunder by flash of lightning steel blue keen dazzlingly vivid seemed to strike water within dozen fathom of while simultaneously be deafened by crackling crash of thunder of such appalling loudness violence that one might have be excused for believing that very foundation of earth have be riven asunder so tremendous be concussion of that quite distinctly felt longboat quiver tremble under influence next instant down came rain in regular tropical torrential downpour causing sea to hiss a though individual drop of rain be red hot starting to work at once in boat with balers to save provision from being ruined happened to be looking away in westerly direction when flash came despite dazzling vividness caught momentary glimpse of pirate brig in direction not more than mile distant from none of others in boat appeared to have seen for one said word only hoped that eye on board have happened to be turned toward at moment must not have failed to see be altogether too near for liking said nothing for seemed unnecessary to disturb men by informing of whereabouts comforted with reflection when squall must come a come now must in very few minute like must be compelled to scud before a must run two foot to one must soon run out of sight have not long to wait after deluge of rain have lasted three minute ceased a abruptly a have begun for space of perhaps minute there be sound to be heard save trickling dripping of water from drenched sail of boat then far away to eastward there gradually arose low moaning sudden fierce puff of hot air struck for instant filling sail of longboat with loud flap leaving hanging motionless again here come lad cried out with starboard oar get boat head round will do lay in again one hand tend mainsheet here aft moaning sound rapidly grew in intensity until became first deep roar like bellowing of thousand angry bull finally deafening shriek while away to eastward long line of white foaming water became visible rushing down toward with incredible rapidity next instant squall struck white water boiled up high over stern of boat burying so deeply that for moment thought be over with that despite precaution must inevitably be swamped good canvas of longboat sail be made fortunately withstood strain a also did stout hemp rigging supported mast a furious blast swooped down upon gathered way be next moment flying to westward before hurricane bow buried deeply in boiling surge now have good reason to congratulate upon fact that in longboat have taken gig in tow for strain of smaller boat kept longboat stern down in great measure counteracted leverage of mast tended to depress bury bow for feel convinced that longboat stout craft though be must have be driven under by tremendous force of wind swamped by inrush of water over bow outfly be accompanied by furious storm of thunder lightning illumination of be most welcome to for enabled to see where be going incidentally revealed to enemy pirate brig scudding away to leeward under goose winged fore topsail with topgallant mast struck now have reason to congratulate upon foresight have suggested to idea of partially covering in boat with sail a protection against inroad of sea for within ten minute of outburst not only be air full of flying sheet of spindrift scud water for precaution referred to must have kept busily baling in addition to short steep tumultuous sea be rapidly rising at frequent interval rose above boat gunwale must have pooped dangerously have boat be left in ordinary unprotected condition a be beyond pint so of water occasionally made way inboard despite precaution needed to be baled out again have trouble first fury of squall lasted about quarter of hour during time thunder lightning be incessant afterwards gradually died away while wind moderated to steady gale be by illumination of last flash of lightning that caught sight of brig hove to on starboard tack under storm staysail with head to northward sight of thus be great relief to for seemed to indicate that have be fortunate enough to escape detection that need have great fear of interference from since fact of having hove to so early indicated keen desire on part of captain to remain a near a possible to coast a night wore on sea rapidly became higher more dangerous difficulty embarrassment increasing in proportion chief difficulty arose from necessity to keep gig in tow for with rising of sea speedily became more dangerous to boat from frequent fierce tug of painter connected two boat together rope be new stout one there be not much fear that boat must break away from other strain set up by alternate slackening tautening of painter a first one boat then other be urged forward by becend of sea be tremendous strained craft to positively dangerous degree yet be not possible for to cast gig adrift for have done so must at once have run away from lost in darkness be unless have set own sail of course must not have be done without depriving her of protection of a covering against breaking sea must have resulted in being instantly swamped at length matter became so serious with that be evident that something must be done very quickly too for of drag be so violent that threatened to tear stern out of longboat be by time leaking badly after considering matter therefore most carefully decided upon course of procedure hoped might better condition somewhat happened that among store have hurriedly stowed away in longboat when preparing to leave schooner be drum of lamp oil intended to use in binnacle lamp at night thought might perhaps also prove very useful for other purpose a well now ordered men to find for fortunately be easy to get at be soon produced be full can have never be opened therefore gave instruction that instead of drawing bung must be punctured with sufficient number of hole to allow oil to ooze through pretty freely done instructed men to clear away longboat painter to bend securely round boat oar in such manner a to make sort of sea anchor of leaving about fathom of end of painter clear to to bend on oil can then when everything be ready shouted to simpson in gig telling what proposed to do giving instruction after in longboat hauled down jib watching opportunity rounded to threw overboard sea anchor with oil can attached took in remaining canvas business of rounding to be very delicate ticklish job for have sea caught broadside on must inevitably have be capsized swamped be fortunate enough to do everything at precisely right moment with result that two boat swung round head on to sea without accident without shipping very much water oar lashed together in middle kept squarely athwartships by mean of span afforded after only merest apology for sea anchor barely gave just sufficient drag to keep boat stem on to sea without appreciably retarding drift to leeward be none worse for since with drift scarcely retarded rode more easily presently when oil began to exude from can diffuse over surface of water there be narrow space just ahead of where sea ceased to break with result that in course of ten minute be riding quite dry comfortable except for scud water came driving along however soon remedied by converting mainsail into kind of roof strained over lowered mast similar to arrangement in gig after save for extravagant leap plunge of boat be very trying to wounded have not much to complain of gale reached height about four o'clock on following morning at hour be blowing very hard with exceedingly heavy dangerous sea in boat must not possibly have lived for precaution have be taken for preservation even a be repeatedly escaped disaster only by merest hair breadth by what seemed to be more combination of fortuitous circumstance than anything else taken altogether that night be one of most tense long drawn out anxiety have ever up to then experienced about two bell in morning watch gale broke from moment strength of wind moderated so rapidly that by eight bell danger have passed boat be riding dry be able to get breakfast in peace comfort greater perhaps from fact that when day dawned pirate brig be nowhere to be seen by nine o'clock wind sea have moderated sufficiently to enable to resume voyage therefore with difficulty secured observation of sun for determination of longitude then proceeded to re bend sail step mast get under way steering to northward westward under double reefed canvas finally about noon be able to shake out reef proceed under whole canvas sea by time having almost completely gone down leaving trace of previous night gale beyond long very heavy swell in hollow of two boat continually lost sight of other although by mercy of providence have weathered gale have not by mean escaped scathless for when have once more settled down have found opportunity to overhaul stock of provision be found that despite utmost precaution alarmingly large proportion of have become damaged by rain sea water to extent indeed that about half of have be rendered quite unfit for use therefore threw portion overboard since there be obviously advantage in wasting valuable space in preservation of useless store did more readily perhaps because calculated that despite heavy loss must still have enough left to carry to destination provided that be not detained by calm on way made excellent progress day reckoning showing that at three o'clock afternoon have traversed distance of just forty mile since getting under way that morning distance be increased to fifty eight by sunset moreover have done well in way for wounded have be carefully looked after hurt attended to a thoroughly a circumstance must allow with result at man reported a feeling distinctly better notwithstanding night of terrible hardship exposure through have so recently passed sunset that evening be clear promising fine night while wind held steady fair be consequently in high spirit at prospect of quick pleasant passage to sierra leone a night advanced bank of heavy cloud gradually gathered on horizon to northward wind began to back round freshen somewhat so that about midnight again became necessary to double reef canvas while sea once more rose to such extent that boat be soon shipping unpleasant quantity of water over weather bow moreover wind continued to back until be broken off couple of point from course so that altogether finally began to look very much a though be in for unpleasant night though perhaps not quite so bad a one have preceded be true that be not just then in actual danger for after strength of wind be more than to shark must show single reefed topsail be more than enough for under canvas be carrying have just given order to haul down third reef when one of men who be engaged upon task of shortening sail suddenly paused in work gazed out intently to windward under sharp of hand next moment shouted excitedly sail ho two point on weather bow d see sir there be ah now have lost again will see sir when lift on top of next sea there now do see sir just under patch of black cloud ay ay see answered for a man spoke caught sight of small dark blur knew must be ship of sort showing indistinctly against somewhat lighter background of cloud behind be about two mile away be steering course must carry across bow at distance of about quarter of mile if held on a be going for moment wondered whether be enemy pirate brig again putting in appearance instant reflection sufficed to dissipate idea for according to probability pirate ought by time to be well on toward hundred mile to eastward of while stranger be coming down with squared yard from northward must contrive to attract attention of craft get to pick up cried have anything in boat from can make flare hurried search be rewarded by production of piece of old tarpaulin that be using a cover protection to stock of provision long strip of be hurriedly torn off liberally sprinkled with oil still remained in drum twisted tightly up ignited flame sputtered bit at first probably from fact that sea water have penetrated to interior of drum mingled to certain extent with oil presently improvised flare burst into bright ruddy flame lighted up hull sail of boat be reflected in broad red splash of colour from tumbling sea came sweeping steadily down upon eye be now eagerly directed toward approaching ship of however entirely lost sight in dazzling glare of torch when after blazing fiercely for about couple of minute until be consumed flare went out left once more in darkness there be answering signal from stranger be coming down fast before steadily strengthening breeze make one lad light a quickly a can cried must not let slip past life may depend upon ability to attract attention get to pick up what be matter with aboard there that have not seen look out must be fast asleep be trader of sort sir be what be matter with answered one of men if be man o ' war slaver there 'd be better look out kept aboard of if have way chap what be supposed to be keepin ' look out must get six dozen at gangway to morrer mornin ' hurry up with flare lad exhorted be a quick with a like ay ay sir will be ready now in twinklin ' of purser lantern answered man who be preparing torch now tom where be that there binnacle lamp again shield from wind with cap man so be get blowed out while set fire to here flare man be still fumbling with flare when stranger be now about mile distant suddenly exhibited lantern over bow people continued to show until have lighted second flare when lantern at once disappeared couple of minute later be near enough for to be able to make out a full rigged ship of seven hundred ton presently swept grandly across bow at distance of about cable length putting helm down came to wind with main topsail to mast finally coming to rest within biscuit toss of to windward a did so became aware of man standing on poop just abaft mizzen rigging next moment hail through speaking trumpet came pealing across water ho boat ahoy what boat be be boat of slaver dolores captured by british sloop of war shark subsequently attacked destroyed by pirate replied have be in boat nearly thirty hour several of people be wounded hoped to make way to sierra leone narrowly escaped being swamped in gale last night presume will have objection to receive ship being apparently british naturally expected to receive immediate cordial invitation to go on board to intense surprise growing indignation there ensued period of silence a though man who have hailed be considering matter be just about to hail again when individual seemed to arrive at decision for hailed all right bring boat alongside accordingly dowsed sail threw out oar pulled alongside a approached lee gangway have be thrown open to receive about dozen men be clustered with lighted lantern man who have hailed before enquired will wounded be able to come up side will reeve whip with boatswain chair for thanks replied think may be able to manage if people will lend hand how many do muster asked stranger presumably master of vessel ten told answered of whom six be more le hurt be fifteen to start with five be killed by fire of pirate be afraid have have bad time takin ' round said interlocutor stand by chap to lend poor feller hand up over side what ship be asked when at length went up side found confronted by very ordinary looking individual attired in suit of thin rusty looking blue serge with peaked cap of same material on head who extended hand in cordial welcome to indian queen of from london to bombay twenty three day out with passenger general cargo answered well said be exceedingly obliged to for receiving for to tell truth after experience of last night be very glad to find good wholesome ship once more under foot open boat be very well in way be rather ticklish craft in to face gale a have last night by by said be boat of yours worth hoisting in yes said be very good boat must be pity to send adrift if can find room for oh dare say can do that answered besides skipper might have word two to say about if be to turn adrift by way mr er grenvile prompted continuing must apologise for not having sooner introduced be senior midshipman of shark be prize master of slaver dolores have instruction to take into sierra leone just so thank ' e answered man be going to say mr grenvile well skipper very queer tempered sort of man be second mate when left home a like a not may kick up row about receivin ' aboard indeed must very greatly surprise if be to order over side again so thought 'd just better give ye hint so a may know what to expect how to act indeed be very much obliged to for timely warning mr said carter name henry carter be reply be actin ' a chief mate now be third when left london understand said captain of yours be englishman presume can not understand possibility of raising objection to receiving party of distressed fellow countryman aboard ship how come to be in command now if be only second when left home well sir be like answered carter starting to explain then interrupted suddenly saying excuse sir see that hand be about to sway away upon tackle hoist in boat will just give eye to if mind see that make mess of job with assistance of shark people boat be soon got inboard stowed after boat crew be bestowed in forecastle steerage there happening by good luck to be just sufficient vacant berth in latter to accommodate wounded matter having be attended to mate remarked to there be vacant cabin in cuddy steward be turned in must take 'em time to clear out get ready for so perhaps might be able to make do with shakedown on cabin sofa for to night there be cabin be very welcome to if like will take watch below on sofa thank very much for exceedingly kind offer said must think of dispossessing of own cabin even for single night sofa will serve turn admirably especially a have sleep last night not much during night before before go below must like to hear how come about that man who be second mate of ship when left england be now master of to bring about such state of affair a must have lost original skipper chief mate yes answered carter be exactly what be happened have have what newspaper must call couple of tragedy aboard here first of skipper who looked a strong healthy man a 'd meet with in day march be found dead in bed on morning of fifth day out next chief mate who of course took command be supposed to be total abstainer be found missin a may say when steward went to call one morning 'd only be in command four day poor chap mate be present skipper cap'n williams gave out that must have committed suicide while in liquor by jumpin out of stern window be found to be wide open on mornin when poor mr mowbray be reported missing very extraordinary commented stifling prodigious yawn now mr carter with kind permission will go below lie down for feel pretty well tired out ay that will be bound do agreed carter way mr grenvile look out for coamin be bit extra high so saying led way into very handsome saloon under ship full poop craft be not regular indiaman be to say be not one of honourable east india company ship for that be very handsome comfortable vessel cuddy be most luxuriously fitted up with crimson velvet sofa capacious revolving armchair screwed to deck alongside table very fine piano with quantity of loose music on top of very handsome picture in heavy gold frame screwed to ship side between port magnificent hanging lamp suspended from centre of skylight with number of smaller lamp hung in gimbal over picture handsome fireplace with wide tiled hearth now filled with pot of plant capacious sideboard against fore bulkhead handsome carpet on deck in fact everything must be thought of within reason to render long sea voyage comfortable pleasant saloon occupied full width of ship sleeping cabin being below with pardonable pride carter turned up flame of swinging lamp be only lamp burning at hour of night to give glimpse of magnificence quite expected having a be done honour of ship carter must now turn down lamp leave to myself still lingered in uncertain sort of way a though must like to say something did not quite know how to begin so at length to relieve embarrassment said what be mr carter feel sure want to tell something well said be fact have got something on mind that 'd like to get off yet dare say will think there be nothing in when tell fact be present skipper very curious sort of chap a expect will find out for afore many hour have gone over head now want to understand mr er grenvile be not sayin ' because happen to get on very well together be fact be not jealous of of position because must fill if 't be offered to be not good enough navigator for think be only right must tell that a like a not will not only blow up sky high for pickin ' men up when find out that be aboard maybe well dunno whether will go quite so far a may refuse to let stay aboard order to take to boat again now if must say will mind if must do such thing take advice go know how may be to morrow if kept sober after turned in will be all right doubt if took bottle to bed with a be lately got into habit of doin ' chance be that will turn out a savage a bear with sore head then everybody fore aft passenger will have to stand by look out for squall thanks mr carter very much for mentioning said gave pretty broad hint a to what might expect out there on deck just now may rest assured that will not forget may also rest assured must so far forget what be due to humanity a to order to leave ship will flatly decline to go of course sir of course will quite right too commented carter be glad to hear ye say so all same will be great comfort to to passenger too to feel that have got naval officer aboard if thing must happen to go at crooked now mr grenvile havin ' said say will wish ye good night hope will be able to get good sound sleep between morning therewith carter at length took off before be fairly out on deck be stretched at full length on sofa fast asleep chapter five strange happening be awakened by entrance of steward who at six bell on following morning came into saloon to brush dust up generally lay table for nine o'clock breakfast head steward apologised for waking informed that there be need for to disturb also that carter have informed of presence commended to care have slept like log felt thoroughly refreshed therefore went out on deck betook forward to eye of ship where stripped indulged in luxury of shower bath under head pump be most glorious morning sun be shining brilliantly with keen bite in ray already although be hour high there be strong breeze blowing from northward under influence of ship be reeling off ten knot under main topgallant sail be greatly surprised to see instead of steering south be heading in for coast on south westerly course made remark upon to carter who again have watch to replied well see sir be fancy of skipper be got sort of theory by hugging coast close takin ' advantage of sea land breeze a blow night mornin ' will do rather better than must by thrashin ' to wind'ard against south east trade know whether there be anything in be first time have ever heard of notion there be in blazin bad temper too by look of will take aft introjuce to certainly said if be to have unpleasantness let have at once get over there be however to be unpleasantness just then at event except in so far a poor carter be concerned for when went aft to where captain williams tall powerful looking rather handsome man in barbaric sort of way with pair of piercing black eye abundant crop of black curly hair with beard moustache to match be standing on quarter deck just outside entrance of saloon captain stepped forward extending hand bade welcome to ship with sign of utmost friendliness gave poor carter terrific wigging for not having called when boat be first sighted for receiving on board without first consulting for how must know mr carter said that boat be not full of pirate le unlikely thing than have happened let tell when come to know coast a well a know will be rather more chary of receiving couple of boat crew professing to be distressed seaman oh said a to mr carter took pretty good care to satisfy a to bona fides before permitting to come alongside at event made sure that be british think there be very few briton who take kindly to piracy perhaps not sir perhaps not at least hope that for credit of countryman be right answered skipper at same time there be many foreigner who speak english well enough to answer hail want to impress upon mr carter fact that be duty to call under peculiar circumstance to allow to decide a to advisability of admitting two boat load of stranger aboard ship please do again sir whereupon poor carter promised to be more circumspect in future slunk away with very much aspect manner of beaten dog felt very sorry for man for even admitting that skipper be right a certainly be thought must have be in very much better taste if have taken opportunity to point out to subordinate in private imprudence of have be guilty instead of administering reprimand in presence of stranger apart from that appeared to that there be not very much wrong with man question arose in mind whether despite protest that carter have thought necessary to address to might not be to extent prejudiced against skipper feeling be somewhat strengthened when a in compliance with captain williams request gave account of recent adventure informed that ship carried doctor at once sent messenger to functionary informing that wounded men have be taken on board during night requesting to give best attention forthwith a skipper stood talking together passenger who have learned from steward that have be picked up during night came hurrying up on deck one after full of curiosity to see individual who have joined ship under such interesting circumstance be duly introduced to to take in what appeared to be recognised order of social importance be first general sir thomas baker wife lady hetty baker rather elderly daughter phoebe returning to india from furlough mr euphemia jennings young wife of important official who have just left only boy lad of five year of age with friend in england for health sake with niece of husband miss flora duncan most lovely girl of about sixteen then came mr mr richard morton people of mean who be going to india to try fortune at indigo planting under auspex of friend former schoolfellow of husband who have sent home glowing account of great thing might be done in way by man of energy with reasonable amount of capital with went three child frank mary susie aged respectively eleven eight six year finally there be messrs fielder acutt boyne pearson taylor five young men ranging from seventeen to twenty one year of age who be going out to take up appointment in company service people be very kind nice to must not help being secretly amused at fiery energy with general denounced what characterised a criminal carelessness of captain bentinck in turning adrift in unarmed schooner with crew of only fourteen hand by jove sir call little short of murder shouted idea of asking ay expecting to take fully loaded slaver into port with only fourteen men to back up gun man ought to be ashamed of be just like navy fellow be constantly asking one to do thing seem impossible yes sir said demurely not infrequently do do exploded yes will do credit to admit that never know when be beaten that suppose be why blue jacket so often succeed in performing apparently impossible that in way weakens contention that captain be guilty of piece of most culpable negligence in sending away without furnishing with battery of gun with to defend ship fortunately at moment breakfast bell rang general wife leading way trooped into saloon seated ourselves at elegantly furnished bountifully provided breakfast table during progress of meal of course have further opportunity to observe behaviour of skipper when rose from table be obliged to confess to myself be puzzled for have be quite unable to arrive at distinct impression of character of man for while on one hand manner to be cordial with somewhat rough unpolished geniality of man of coarse violent temperament striving to conquer natural disposition render agreeable must find fault with arrangement proposed to make for own comfort that of men expression of sympathy with in misfortune be everything must be wished for somehow did not ring true thus when in course of conversation a be very natural under circumstance rather persistently dwelt upon little party adventure captain williams chose to express gratification at having fallen in with rescued from distinctly perilous situation while word be a kind sympathetic a must have be desired expression of countenance seemed to say almost a plainly a word must speak devoutly wish that have gone to bottom rather than come aboard ship continually found mentally asking question be to believe man word expression of eye be sincere in what say be unfortunate possessor of expression habitually give lie to word be for sinister purpose of own endeavouring to produce false impression upon be quite impossible to find satisfactory reply to question yet found certain amount of guidance in manner of passenger toward noticed that one of with exception of general seemed to quail beneath gaze shrink from a for general despite somewhat boisterous manner be gentleman soldier evidently man who knew not what fear be appeared to that be distinctly distrustful of captain williams at length by patiently watching succeeded in finding opportunity to divert conversation from myself party saw skipper glance upward toward tell tale compass hung in skylight a gaze fell again encountered own instantly most malignant ferocious expression swept into eye undeterred by however composedly remarked see captain be heading in toward coast mr carter informs that propose to test practically rather interesting theory that have formed a to advantage of alternate land sea breeze over of regular trade yes growled do mr carter have business to discus plan intention with anybody have warned more than once to keep silent tongue in head man be fool will get into very serious trouble day if doe keep weather eye lifting well said must not blame in case for fault if fault there have be be mine observed alteration in ship course a soon a stepped out on deck morning remarked upon be merely in reply to remark that mr carter explained intention well answered be rather fortunate thing for happen to have such intention for affords chance to get transhipped into one of own craft instead of having to go on with to capetown a must almost certainly have be obliged to do if have followed usual plan stretched away over toward south american coast quite so agreed certainly have advantage a occurred to moment mr carter explained theory have further advantage must find make quite such good progress a hope will be well to windward when eventually decide to stretch offshore into trade wind then think idea have something in demanded something yes agreed doubt very much whether taking everything into consideration will find that advantage be worth consideration skipper did not agree with forthwith plunged into fiery defence of theory lasted until time after have risen from table adjourned to poop in fact so completely monopolised attention up to tiffin time be scarcely able to find time to go forward enquire into condition of wounded have opportunity at to improve acquaintance with passenger after tiffin however captain retired to cabin instead of going on deck again a stepped out of saloon on to quarter deck felt hand slide into arm turning round found general alongside be right said a linked arm in mine in impression that think very highly of captain williams rather peculiar theory concerning advantage of keeping coast aboard a believe sailor term rather than following usual rule of making most of south east trade wind be pretty well acquainted with coast suppose idea on subject must be of value well said fact be sir thomas think very highly of captain theory in theory doubt idea appears somewhat attractive in actual practice must be inclined to say that uncertainty of weather close inshore will probably be found to tell against if sea breeze must be absolutely depended upon to blow day day long land breeze to blow night night long there must undoubtedly be something in experience be that phenomenon be not to be depended upon often happens that when according to rule sea land breeze must be piping up strongly there be absolute persistent calm nevertheless from purely personal point of view be glad that skipper intends to test theory because will afford opportunity to shift party into one of ship of slave squadron one of be pretty certain to fall in with before long ah remarked general with curious indrawing of breath be rather afraid that such might be case paused for few second then taking fresh grip of arm continued do know young friend be rather hoping that will not fall in with of ship of slave squadron consequently men will be obliged to go on with at least a far a capetown be perhaps bit selfish of to entertain such wish do nevertheless indeed said may ask why general of course may dear boy answered be very natural question well fact be that certain very curious happening have taken place on board ship since sailed out of thames proceeded to repeat to story that carter have already told a to disappearance of original captain successor now continued captain matthew death may have be perfectly natural one say that be not up to hour of death looked strong healthy enough to have lived out full term of life moreover be most temperate man in respect have therefore found very difficult indeed to discover satisfactory explanation of very sudden demise between although burgess ship surgeon have never said a much in word firmly believe that occurrence puzzled a much a did indeed very reticence over affair only strengthens suspicion that such be case puzzling a be circumstance connected with captain matthew death consider that associated with death of mr mowbray who took command of ship in place of captain matthew be at least equally so mr mowbray be man of thirty five year of age very quiet unassuming gentlemanly of manner married man with a have understood small family to provide for consequently very anxious to rise in profession ambitious in quiet unassuming way evidently thoroughly steady reliable man for understand that have served under captain matthew for several year one of ever saw touch wine spirit drink of description yet only four day after have attained to what may consider summit of ambition by securing command of fine ship be missing williams present skipper offer exceedingly improbable explanation that poor fellow jumped out of cabin window be drowned while intoxicated believe for moment do of rest of for own part very strongly suspect foul play somewhere very extraordinary explanation williams offer of occurrence only strengthens suspicion well not to put too fine point upon that know more of matter than perfectly honest man ought to know in addition to williams be secret drunkard man of most violent ungovernable temper a will see for ere long will therefore not be very greatly surprised to learn since took command there have be great deal of uneasiness a well a unpleasantness in cuddy for one be rejoiced to find naval officer party of man o ' war seaman on board for know after what have said will keep eye ear open will not hesitate to interfere if see good sufficient reason for so doing navy fellow have trick of cutting in where consider necessary without pausing to weigh too nicely strict legality of proceeding if perchance occasionally step inch two beyond strict limit of law be generally able to justify yourselves what have just told general said be also told briefly by carter last night too seemed to consider necessary to warn that skipper be somewhat peculiar man naturally after such warning have be keeping eye ear open confess find man something of puzzle carter quite led to anticipate possibility that williams might order down side into boat again instead of so far a word even deed be concerned have not least fault to find time that be saying kind thing to morning eye expression of face belied aha so noticed that did observed general yes be quite true have very precisely expressed what have noticed at one time eye belie word of lip very often be to say when chooses to be civil be not always when saw morning quite believed be in for particularly unpleasant day for have appearance of man in very bad temper for reason have seen fit to behave to day never fear will soon have opportunity to see what be like when chooses to let go behaviour be then that of madman be sometimes inclined to believe that really be mad suppose that must do a carter suggests may order men to quit ship will go most certainly not said will only leave ship when can transfer men to other by mean of can speedily rejoin own ship be right be quite right boy approved general well be glad have have little talk with for have eased mind put on alert now come up on poop make agreeable to lady will not thank for monopolising so much of time attention took hint followed up to poop where whole of cuddy passenger be assembled lady occupied with book needlework playing with child while men lounged in basket chair smoking reading chatting danced attendance upon lady first paid respect to lady baker daughter a in duty bound then drifted gradually round from one to until finally came to anchor between mr jennings niece miss duncan observed that in case whatever topic might be upon started conversation talk gradually drifted round to subject of skipper peculiarity from arrived at conclusion that after carter general must have have ground for apprehension that have expressed to now of party of ten who have be received on board indian queen six of be wounded of six three be so severely hurt a to be quite unfit for duty other three of whom be one be able to do such deck duty a keeping look out taking trick at wheel so on excepting be scarcely fit to go aloft just yet did not think right desirable that of who be in fit state to work must eat bread of idleness have therefore seized opportunity afforded by talk with skipper morning to suggest that four unwounded two slightly wounded men must assist in working of ship a for myself said must be very pleased to take charge of one of watch if such arrangement must be of assistance to of course be quite right proper thing for to do although ship carried complement of thirty hand told be not in least surprised that williams must accept quite a matter of course offer of men three of whom placed in port watch three in starboard latter being under boatswain big bullying brow beating fellow named tonkin declined offer of personal service saying that must do quite well without arrangement having be come to made business to speak to boatswain into whose watch two slightly wounded men have be put informing of what have passed between skipper requesting not to send wounded men aloft a did not consider that must safely venture into rigging in partially disabled condition also cautioned men not to attempt to go aloft must boatswain happen to forget what have told order to do so taking care to give caution in tonkin presence hearing in order that there might be mistake misunderstanding be therefore very much surprised considerably annoyed when a be gathered together on poop same evening during first dogwatch heard sound of violent altercation proceeding on fore deck on looking round discovered that disputant be one of own men boatswain latter of whom be threatening other with rope end without waiting to hear see more instantly dashed down poop ladder ran forward pushing way through little crowd who have gathered round chief actor of scene a did so became suddenly conscious of fact that men among whom be forcing way be distinctly ruffianly ill conditioned lot who seemed more than half disposed to resent actively sudden appearance among now then martin said sharply what be disturbance about why be boatswain threatening with rope end why sir answered martin who be suffering from grape shot wound in leg understood to say morning a none of a be wounded be to go aloft yet here be here bobe'un swears a will make go up take turn out o ' fore to'gallan ' clew instead of sendin ' one of own people up to do must climb riggin without bustin ' here wound of mine open again of course not answered thought have made clear to tonkin turning to boatswain that wish of wounded men to be sent aloft man be in fit condition to go up on to topsail yard ai retorted boatswain in very offensive manner while be in watch be goin ' to be judge of what be fit to do what be not fit to do say be quite fit to do job that have ordered to do be goin ' to do too will know reason why what be more wo have brass bound young whipper snapper comin ' for'ard here to interfere with tell be to do what be not to do hope be speakin ' plain enough for to be understood mr midshipman what be name now then continued turning to martin again will obey order must make yer took fresh grip upon rope end with be threatening man drop that rope end at once scoundrel exclaimed angrily for saw by man manner by approving snigger of men who surrounded that have be deliberately intentionally insulting to that unless took firm stand at once ship must speedily become untenable to men must surely be drunk tonkin must never dream of drunk be exclaimed savagely wheeling suddenly round upon will soon show whether be drunk not raised rope end with manifest intention of striking across face with before blow must fall there be sudden rush of foot sniggering loafer who hemmed in be knocked right left like so many ninepin with cry of take that dirty blackguard a lesson not to lift filthy paw again against king officer simpson carpenter mate immensely strong fellow dashed in caught boatswain terrific blow square on chin felling to deck where lay senseless bleeding profusely at mouth put man in iron bellowed furious voice behind turning round beheld skipper glaring like infuriated animal past at carpenter mate who be standing with clenched fist across prostrate body of boatswain for what reason pray captain williams demanded indignantly know how long have be here for did not hear approach unless have instant come upon scene must be fully aware that be boatswain who started disgraceful brawl behaviour be absolutely brutal got further for while be still speaking villain suddenly seized round waist being much more powerful than pinned arm close to side here exclaimed to one of own people standing by just lash young bantam arm behind seize to rail while attend to other before well knew where be found securely trussed up saw simpson martin of men fighting like lion at bay finally overborne by number beaten senseless to deck will be very sorry for outrage before be many day older captain williams said a fellow presently came planted square in front of will indeed sneered thrusting hand deep in trouser pocket balancing on heaving deck with leg wide apart what make think so because will report conduct to captain of first man o ' war that fall in with on coast will be called upon to give account of behaviour supposing that happen to fall in with of precious men o ' war what then demanded why said will merely mean that punishment will be deferred few day longer until arrive at capetown be ah retorted drawing in breath sharply supposing must happen to go overboard quietly dark night like poor mowbray for instance cut in mowbray hissed turning deathly white mowbray who have be talking to about mowbray tell will cut lying tongue out of mouth brave word said very brave word must not frighten individual who told history of poor mr mowbray mysterious disappearance through stern window tell who be what said demanded hoarsely answered will reserve story for other ear than yours very well said then promise that will not live to tell that story turning to one of men who be standing by said cast young cockerel loose take down to cabin lock in bring key to two minute later found below in very comfortable cabin have be cleared out prepared for locked in with company own rather disagreeable thought chapter six stranded what be williams ultimate intention toward found quite impossible to guess for beyond fact that kept carefully locked up in cabin that have assigned to suffered further violence at hand steward bringing ample supply of food when meal hour came round tried to ascertain from fellow how men be faring in forecastle attempt to question caused so much distress terror at earnest request forebore to press enquiry a soon a man have taken away empty plate dish have contained dinner stretched out on very inviting looking bed have be made up in bunk being exceedingly tired soon fell asleep slept night did not awake until steward entered next morning with breakfast rather expected that after night calm consideration of exploit williams must have come to conclusion that discretion be better part of valour must have taken step toward patching up of truce did not spent whole of day also locked up in cabin seeing soul steward who brought meal to be somewhat late that night when turned in a have slept well through previous night did not feel tired even when have bestowed for night did not get to sleep for time for felt that must by time be drawing close in to coast supposing must fall in with man o ' war how be to communicate with if man be going to keep cooped up down below true might succeed in attracting attention of on board ship by waving handkerchief out of cabin port if happened to pas closely enough for signal to be seen if happened also to be on starboard side be side on berth be situated be very strongly of opinion that after what have happened williams must take especial care to give exceedingly wide berth to men o ' war that might happen to sight at length however fell into somewhat restless sleep from be awakened time later by sound of confusion on deck shouting of order trampling of foot violent casting of rope upon deck flapping of loose canvas in wind creaking of yard various other sound usually follow upon happening of anything amiss on board ship at same time became conscious of something unusual in feel of ship for moment be puzzled to decide what be by time have jumped out of berth be broad awake knew what have happened ship be ashore yet must have taken ground very easily for have be conscious of shock even a stood there be unable to detect least motion of hull be a firmly fixed apparently a steady a though have be lying in dry dock went to side put face to open porthole saw that night be clear that sky overhead be brilliant with star by twisting in way a to get raking view forward fancied must see in distance something having appearance of low tree clad shore also heard heavy thunder of distant surf alongside ship water be quite still silent save for soft seething sound a of water gently swelling receding upon sheltered beach seated upon sofa locker strove to recall mentally feature of several river that have visited must fit none of to dimly seen surroundings be visible from port out of have looked one thing be certain be that be in perfectly smooth water entire absence of shock with ship have taken ground be indication that be certainly in immediate danger beyond that situation be puzzling in extreme snug sheltered position of ship pointed strongly to assumption that have blundered into river in darkness yet when again looked out through port little be able to see be suggestive of beach rather than river that be not very far from beach be evidenced by loud unbroken roar of surf then there be puzzling question how did get where be what be look out doing what be everybody doing that one saw land heard roar of surf in time to avoid running ship ashore a continued to stare abstractedly out through port struck that various object within sight be growing more clearly visible presently felt convinced that dawn be approaching at same moment became aware that broad dark shadow lay fifty yard from ship starboard side have be puzzling greatly be sandbank of very considerable extent so considerable indeed that for moment must not make out where terminated meanwhile hubbub on deck gradually ceased surmised that canvas have be taken in transition from first pallor of dawn to full daylight be very rapid in low latitude within ten minute of first faint heralding of day level shaft of sunlight shot athwart scene became in moment transfigured have before be vague illusory stood frankly revealed to eye sandbank now showed a isolated patch about two hundred yard wide perhaps mile long with what looked like by wash channel of about one hundred yard wide flowing between mainland latter being sandy beach backed by sand dune clothed with rank creeper like vegetation few stunted tree top showing behind a ship then lay with head pointing toward south east be able with effort to get glimpse of mile two of shore now that daylight have come must see surf breaking heavily all along also upon seaward side of sandbank upon appeared to have grounded feeling quite reassured a to safety of ship sat down on sofa locker endeavoured by recalling course steered distance run since have be picked up to identify particular spot on coast where now be be use memory of chart be not clear enough have to give up task felt convinced that be somewhere in gulf of guinea a sat there on locker thinking matter over wondering what must be outcome of adventure became so absorbed in own thought gradually lost consciousness of surroundings be only brought back to by sound of sudden commotion on deck loud outcry in thought recognised voice of skipper great violent stamping of foot finally irregular popping of pistol followed by sudden subsidence of disturbance in turn be followed by sound of excitement in cabin on side of one occupied in distance must hear general shouting at top of voice gathered that passenger be only now beginning to realise that something be wrong with ship be turning out dressing hastily few minute later heard sound of cabin door being flung open hurried footstep went speeding past cabin toward companion way led up to main deck then general voice breezed up again from saloon above in tone of angry remonstrance followed by tremendous amount of excited talk amid thought once twice caught sound of woman sob be evident that something very much out of common have happened came to conclusion that be high time for to be at large again taking hand in proceeding therefore whipped out pocketknife without further ado proceeded to withdraw screw fastened lock to door five minute later found in main saloon centre of excited somewhat terrified group of passenger ah exclaimed general a made appearance now perhaps will get at something practical here be young grenvile who being navy man may be supposed to know how to deal with awkward situation here be pretty kettle of fish sir continued turning to ship be ashore captain have blown brain out so say last not least crew headed by boatswain have mutinied against authority of mr carter whom have thrust in here among absolutely refuse to listen to reason in shape form now ask a officer in most gracious majesty navy what be to be done sir be proper step to be taken to extricate from infernal predicament first thing general said be to let hear carter story will probably give fairly accurate idea of precise situation of affair where be here be mr grenvile replied man edging way toward through crowd now said please tell precisely what know about very extraordinary affair well sir be answer really know so very much about when told be not very greatly surprised way that thing have be going aboard ship ever since poor cap'n matthew died have be enough to prepare man for anything mutiny included have middle watch last night a know perhaps know be very overcast dark through watch so be not very surprisin ' saw nothing of land even if be in sight doubt seein ' that be low cap'n williams who ought to have known that be drawin ' in close upon coast never gave warning of ship position said anything about keepin ' extra good look out anything of sort consequently when bobe'un relieved at four o'clock mornin ' did pas on particular caution to a matter of fact have notion that be anywhere near land consequently when commotion of haulin down clewin ' up awoke when upon rushin ' out on deck to see what be matter found that ship be ashore be regularly flabbergasted have much time for surprise anything else either for skipper be on deck in charge must confess that cool way in took everything made think that be nearly so surprised at what have happened a by right ought to have be well hauled down clewed up furled everything by time daylight have come be able to get view of whereabouts so far a must make out seemed to have blundered slap into mouth of river to have grounded on inner side of big sandbank have formed right athwart at distance of about quarter of mile to seaward of general trend of shore line must have managed better if 'd picked berth for ourselves for be lyin ' in perfectly smooth water completely sheltered from run of surf nothin ' short of stiff on shore gale must be at likely to hurt skipper said something about lightening ship ordered bobe'un to clear away boat see ready for hoistin ' out directed to go down into fore peak rouse out hawser must find down there send up on deck be busy upon job with dozen hand to help when suddenly heard terrific rumpus on deck sound of pistol firing when jumped up on deck to see what row be about there be that villain tonkin with pistol still smokin ' in hand talkin ' to men tellin ' that a ship be ashore cap'n gone hand be free to please a to whether 'd stick to hooker not that for part meant to have spell ashore for day two before decidin what next to do just at point interrupted by askin ' what meant by sayin ' that cap'n be gone ' to replied that skipper have shot then jumped overboard believe mr grenvile not for moment for if be not very greatly mistaken saw scoundrel wink at men a told yarn added that bein ' case man aboard be own master free to do a pleased if have anything to say against 'd better say then did say told hand a to everybody now bein own master be nonsense for if skipper be indeed dead must be business to find out just exactly how died command of ship devolved upon intended to take necessary step to get afloat again to carry to destination thought that must settle did by long chalk for tonkin turned to men say look here shipmate for one have have quite enough choppin changin ' about of skipper in hooker ' say ' say so far a be concerned want more have nothin ' to say again carter there be not goin ' to acknowledge a skipper of packet fancy a how of will either of course ' say if there be of a be anxious to have for skipper want to go heavin ' out cargo runnin ' away kedges what not under order instead of goin ashore with into wood huntin ' for fruit be quite at liberty to do so wo say nay may a well make up mind now a other time whether will stick to to so now what d say shipmate who be for carter who be for tonkin ' will be shot mr grenvile if mother son of 'em did declare right off without hesitatin ' for whereupon ordered in here told not to dare to show nose out on deck again until have permission 'd have hove over rail be to tell passenger that might go up on poop if liked that if e'er one of put foot on main deck 'd be hove overboard without palaver now what d 'ye think of sir for mess have of be drinking think asked well yes sir think have answered carter be to say think most of 'em have be pretty well primed just enough know to make 'em reckless there be none of what 'd call drunk not by long way be of men among asked oh be answer men forgot know what be happened to whole lot of 'em sound sick alike be locked up in steerage simpson martin beardmore bein ' in iron what about steerage passenger asked where be why answered carter there be only five of told two of hale cruickshank of whom be thoroughly bad character have chummed in with tonkin lot while jenkins with wife daughter be in own cabin in steerage mr jenkins daughter patsy have be busy acting a nurse to wounded men under dr burgess instruction ever since came aboard be doing very well that be good news said will see that two woman be properly rewarded for trouble now let see how stand how many do mutineer muster told twenty five twenty seven if count in hale cruickshank answered carter how many do muster on side said let just reckon up first of there be nine of men make ten then there be mr carter eleven what about steward oh be right so be cook will do work a usual answered carter ay doubt answered what about fighting quality if must be obliged to resort to forcible measure with mutineer ah said carter if come to fighting be matter steward be youngster with exception of briggs head steward must stand pretty poor chance if came to fight with forecastle hand briggs well be in pantry perhaps 'd better call hear what have to say for head steward be man of about thirty five well built fairly powerful upon being questioned professed willing to place unreservedly under order also to ascertain to what extent might rely upon subordinate that brought fighting force up to even dozen to be speedily added general messrs morton fielder acutt boyne pearson taylor of whom professed to be eager for scrimmage although in case of last mentioned five have suspicion that much of courage have origin in desire to appear to advantage before miss duncan however that brought up to nineteen not counting three under steward against twenty seven mutineer next question be a to weapon mutineer be of possessed of at least knife while be known that tonkin six seven others have one more pistol be also speedily ascertained that have secured pike tomahawk belonging to ship moreover there be such formidable makeshift weapon a capstan bar marline spike belaying pin other instrument accessible to at moment notice if therefore must come to hand to hand fight antagonist be likely to prove rather formidable on own side on other hand possessed brace of pistol with five cartridge sword men also have have cutlass pistol together with certain quantity of ammunition be not to be reckoned upon for considered almost certain that after putting three men in iron must take precaution to secure arm ammunition belonging to of then general also have sword pistol while of other men possessed at least sporting gun in case of three of pistol a well unfortunately be down in after hold among baggage must not be got at so long a tonkin gang be in possession of deck thus only weapon actually available for party be own needed moment consideration to show ours be case wherein strategy rather than force must be employed well then gentleman said when have become agreed upon point appears to that situation resolve thus mutineer have expressed determination to go ashore until have done so can hing beyond holding ready for action at moment notice meanwhile must wear air of utmost nonchalance unconcern for if be to manifest symptom of excitement interest in movement there be doubt among who must be astute enough to observe thereupon to become suspicious let leave ship a many a may please to go more better a soon a be fairly out of sight will release men will then set to work to get firearm up out of hold take such further step a may be necessary to subdue mutineer upon return bring once more under control probably will only find necessary to get tonkin into hand to break neck of revolt bring rest of men to reason now think must be very good plan if few of be to go up on poop take quiet saunter before breakfast just to let men see that stand in fear of at same time can take good look round with object of reporting to what see a for will keep below for present there be nothing to be gained by reminding tonkin of presence in ship if be to see be at large among again might so far modify arrangement a to make matter even more difficult for than be at present quite right approved general agree with word that young friend here have said appears to have got very good grip of situation view accord with own exactly will doubtless be obliged to come to fisticuffs with scoundrel forward before can hope to extricate from very awkward situation must be height of folly to precipitate fight before be fully prepared now gentleman be going up on poop come with who will think that for present at least lady have better remain below thereupon five young griffin made way up on deck at short interval while mr morton did best to comfort encourage weaker member of party not that needed very much encouragement will say that for for with exception of poor little mr morton who be very much more anxious frightened on behalf of child than on own account lady showed very great deal more courage than have looked for from while a for mr jennings miss duncan very promptly came forward to say that if there be way in must possibly render assistance be not to hesitate to make use of while be still talking together in saloon briggs chief steward entered in state of great indignation addressing to carter informed that men demanded fried ham various other dainty from cabin store for breakfast upon venturing to remonstrate with have darkly hinted that unless produced required provision at once together with several bottle of rum must be worse for what do say mr grenvile demanded carter appealing to will let have what ask for certainly said seeing at present be not in position to refuse make good refusal let have ask for be a sparing a possibly can with grog want to have enough to make quarrelsome to render unfit to go ashore go mightily against grain with to serve out good cabin store to pack of drunken loafer a sir remonstrated briggs never mind said be in hand at present can not very well help will have revenge later when have got rascal safe below in iron so have what of inelegantly described a good blow out that morning in forecastle while be having own breakfast in cabin so far a drink be concerned tonkin be wise enough to see to that in view of projected trip ashore man have more liquor than must conveniently carry while sat at breakfast gentleman who have be on deck gave result of such observation a have be able to make from poop after did not amount to much only conclusion at have arrived being that be ashore on inner edge of sandbank have formed athwart mouth of river extent of must not be seen from ship in consequence of fact that there be two point of land one overlapping other hid everything beyond two point general added be thickly overgrown with mangrove land immediately behind be low densely wooded coconut tree palm being apparently very plentiful while few mile inland ground rose into low hill from midst of single mountain towered into air to height of five six thousand foot be still dawdling over breakfast when heard sound of movement out on deck presently briggs who have be instructed to reconnoitre from pantry window commanded view of main deck sent word by one of under steward that of mutineer be getting tackle up on fore main yard arm while others be employed in clearing out longboat be stowed on main hatch few minute later cook came aft with intelligence that have received imperative order to kill roast dozen fowl for men to take ashore with also to make up good sized parcel of cabin bread butter pot of jam pickle dozen bottle of rum in order that might not find short of creature comfort during absence from ship seemed to point to fact that intended to undertake projected excursion in longboat instead of taking two gig much greater piece of luck than have dared to hope for also suggested intention on part to make fairly long day of did not hesitate to instruct briggs to see to that supply of grog must on occasion be liberal one for longer remained out of ship more time must have in to make preparation weather be intensely hot mutineer manifested inclination to exert unduly be consequently almost eleven o'clock in forenoon ere longboat be in water alongside quarter of hour be spent over making of final preparation at length tumbled down over side one after with good deal of rough horseplay considerable amount of wrangling pushed off general three four of other passenger be on poop smoking under awning have be obliged to spread for observing movement of men under cover of pretence of reading when longboat have disappeared general came down to apprise of fact also of namely that steerage passenger hale cruickshank two seaman armed to teeth with pistol cutlass latter at least in probability taken from men have be left behind for obvious purpose of taking care of ship keeping in order during absence of others chapter seven befell mutineer be rather serious news none le vexatious because did not take altogether by surprise general opinion have be that hand be bent upon going ashore that ship must be left at mercy have certainly not be own view for must not believe that man of tonkin intelligence realising a must enormity of offence in not only breaking into open rebellion against lawful authority in inciting others to do same must be so rashly imprudent a to leave free for period of several hour to release men to take such other step a might occur to for suppression of mutiny have felt quite certain that somebody must be left on board to keep under supervision restraint have calculated upon mutineer considering two men sufficient also little perhaps upon difficulty must be experienced in inducing more than two at utmost to forego anticipated enjoyment of run ashore here be four recklessly unscrupulous men powerful determined fellow fully armed left behind to be dealt with by only weapon that must muster among be sword pistol true might be able to lay hand upon few belaying pin to attack with such weapon four men armed with pistol meant that somebody must almost certainly get hurt be most anxious to avoid if possible besides if came to fight there be always possibility that report of pistol might be heard by of party who have gone ashore cause to hurry back before be ready to receive fittingly upon enquiry learned that four men have arranged two in waist one of on side of ship two forward near fore rigging where must command entrance of steerage quarter general who be brimful of courage be fuming with indignation at what termed confounded impudence of men in presuming to mutiny strongly advocated immediate attack with such weapon a came to hand deprecated that step for reason already mentioned suggested that quite possibly little consideration discussion might enable to hit upon plan involving rather le risk carter at once suggested that must try experiment of plying men with drink in hope of making intoxicated a considered that be case wherein end justified mean plan be at once adopted briggs undertaking to carry out to guard bottle of especially strong brandy for delectation although looked at liquor with very longing eye suspicion at once became aroused roughly ordered to take away when instead of doing briggs put down bottle left within reach one of immediately took up flung overboard where may be incidentally mentioned be instantly dashed at swallowed by shark to small astonishment of who witnessed occurrence scheme having failed be suggested time by ship surgeon briggs chief steward have thus far not have freedom in least degree interfered with be understood that in discharge of duty must necessarily pas to fro at frequent interval between cabin cook galley occupant of may be mentioned though surly sort of fellow a discontented with everything a ship cook generally be have declared absolutely neutral up to present have be allowed to do so without let hindrance doctor plan therefore be that be to go forward to steerage a though on professional visit to wounded men briggs be at same time to go forward to galley to discus with cook arrangement for cuddy dinner that evening then a soon a be fairly forward carter be to sally forth together grapple with two men in waist at same time whistling to apprise doctor briggs who upon hearing signal must rush upon grapple with two men on forecastle idea be not to provoke fight to overpower secure four men without giving opportunity to create alarm by firing pistol four therefore be simultaneously to pinion hold until others coming to assistance must help if necessary to secure disarm plan at once decided be quite promising enough to be worth trial accordingly forthwith proceeded to put into execution first of all a arranged doctor sallied forth with number of bandage other material in hand demanded admission to steerage after slight demur be accorded then briggs who have be watching progress of event from pantry window sauntered casually forward stood by door of galley where proceeded to discus with cook advisability of killing pig finally carter having allowed minute two to elapse walked calmly out on main deck together smoking cigar apiece laughing talking a though be acting in pure absent mindedness perfect coolness apparent want of slightest appearance of concern so completely staggered two guard in waist that allowed to get within couple of fathom of one on port side before dawned upon to interfere then cruickshank man on starboard side dashed across deck to support of companion at same time shouting to in very bellicose accent here two get back d 'ye hear what d 'ye mean by settin ' foot on part of deck against mr tonkin express order now hook sharp moment that fellow be fairly clear of hatchway on port side of deck raised hand to lip spat out cigar sent single shrill not loud whistle along deck then sprang straight at immensely powerful antagonist while carter manfully tackled own man at same instant doctor briggs sprang upon pair who be keeping guard on forecastle a arranged none of attempted to do more than just pinion own particular antagonist prevent from drawing weapon trusting to others to help to master secure gallantly others backed up for at sound of whistle young acutt fine athletic young giant dashed out of cabin without paying attention to writhing struggling quartette in way dodged rushed forward to galley to prevent cookie from interfering while fielder boyne pearson taylor other four young griffin rushed with equal celerity to support of doctor briggs carter own particular man struggled savagely in endeavour to free from grasp being much heavier more powerful man than be pinned up against rail threw whole strength into determined effort to break back in effort must have very speedily succeeded have not boyne quickly felled to deck stunned by well directed blow from iron belaying pin to disarm securely bind fellow be work of minute two then breathless with exertion so far a be concerned in considerable pain boyne stood up looked about to see how others be faring looking first of near home saw hale pinned up against rail with young pearson taking weapon away from while carter be busily engaged in seizing up general meanwhile standing by pointing drawn sword at throat to discourage from ill advised attempt at resistance while doctor briggs with assistance of fielder taylor be also busily engaged in securing respective men ship be ours now only remained for to take promptly such step a be necessary to retain possession of when other mutineer must see fit to return first thing to be done be to release own men from confinement instantly did when have great satisfaction of discovering that thanks to skill of doctor burgess assiduous nursing of mr jenkins daughter patsy wounded except two be so far convalescent a to be quite fit for ordinary duty while other two be also doing so favourably that must be made useful in variety of way provided that be not called upon to undertake very severe physical exertion thus very soon found at head of little band of nine armed resolute men of whom be prepared to do bidding to death if called upon now lost time in hustling four prisoner down into fore peak where must do harm where after being securely clapped into iron be bade to make a comfortable a must on top of ship stock of coal while one of men who from comparatively severe character of wound be least likely to be of service to in other direction be stationed in forecastle above fully armed to keep eye upon see got into mischief little matter having be satisfactorily arranged next got hatch off after hatchway roused passenger baggage on deck from respective owner at once proceeded to withdraw such weapon ammunition a possessed after struck various package down into hold again put on hatch now mustered seventeen armed men told of whom be provided with firearm of kind while own nine men general boasted sidearms a well carter have weapon of own neither have doctor briggs three of youngster possessed brace of pistol be quite willing to lend with carter doctor briggs be promptly armed brought number up to twenty against twenty three away in longboat since possessed advantage over mutineer that have ship deck a fighting platform thought that might now regard a master of situation nevertheless did not feel disposed to neglect further advantage that might happen to posse for not of party be fighting men did not know how civilian might behave in hand to hand fight therefore at once began to look round with object of ascertaining what further mean of defence ship afforded be pierced for twelve gun six of side only artillery that actually carried be pair of pounder brass carronades carriage of be secured one on side of main deck entrance to saloon suspected that piece have be put on board by owner more for purpose of signalling than a mean of defence now gave very careful overhaul came to conclusion that be good reliable weapon capable of rendering efficient service when came to question carter about ammunition must tell nothing a have not be aboard ship when cargo be stowed however at suggestion now took possession of skipper cabin proceeded to give thorough overhaul with result that in short time reappeared with key in hand attached to be parchment label inscribed magazine be strong presumptive evidence in favour of supposition that magazine existed somewhere aboard ship little further search resulted in discovery abaft lazarette with due precaution at once proceeded to open receptacle found to very great satisfaction that not only contained supply of signal rocket also liberal supply of powder cartridge for signal gun dozen stand of musket together with goodly number of keg of contained powder while remainder be full of bullet be most fortunate discovery indeed especially in so far a musket be concerned for possession of at once gave definite very decided advantage over mutineer musket be forthwith conveyed on deck together with supply of powder three keg of bullet also dozen cartridge for gun afternoon be by time well advanced might look for return of mutineer at moment therefore loaded carronades with five double handful of musket ball apiece about hundred bullet to gun in place of round shot running forward mounted on topgallant forecastle a being most commanding position in ship then loaded musket placed in rack on fore side of deck house completed preparation now remained be to keep sharp look out while doing so determine upon policy to be pursued when returning longboat must heave in sight having personally seen that preparation be a complete perfect a be possible to make having also posted simpson martin two of own men armed with musket a look out on forecastle at length went aft to poop where passenger be now gathered where saw general mr morton engaged in earnest conversation with carter a made way leisurely up poop ladder general beckoned to to join little group then a approached carter turned to said mr grenvile general mr morton have be discussing together rather curious state of affair have be brought about aboard ship by unfortunate mutiny be fully agreed that a matter stand be most fit proper person to take charge until thing have be straightened out of course forget that in consequence of death of cap'n williams be now cap'n of ship a have just be tellin sir thomas mr morton here have never have experience of fightin ' of kind a like a not if be to attempt to take lead where fightin ' be concerned must make bungle of now seem to be quite at home in sort of thing if will excuse for sayin ' so knew exactly what be right thing to be done have really be in command whole of blessed day although have pretended that be only helpin a may say then have got nine trained fightin men aboard here who will do just exactly what tell who must care to have orderin ' to say nothin ' of about so have come to conclusion so far a fightin be concerned be right man to be in command a cap'n of ship hereby ask to take charge deal with trouble accordin a think best bowed then turned to other two saying sir thomas mr morton occurs to that two in virtue of fact that be in sense doubly interested in matter since not only involves in own proper person also in person of wife family be entitled to express opinion upon proposal of captain carter that a naval officer ought to give opinion most serious consideration be to understand that be in full perfect agreement with mr carter in proposal have just made to most assuredly be mr grenvile answered general captain carter be merchant seaman doubt very excellent man in capacity now find face to face with difficulty such a merchant captain be fortunately very seldom called upon to face naturally feel somewhat at loss on other hand be by whole training well qualified to deal with situation in view of important interest involved captain carter also must like to assume command very well said will do so will use utmost endeavour to extricate from difficulty already have plan for dealing with mutineer when return think ought to prove successful too without need for fighting will require assistance of gentleman passenger to enable to make imposing display of force be all right boy answered general cordially will willingly place under order without reserve so tell must have do will do well said may now expect mutineer to return at moment must be ready for when appear will therefore ask to have weapon at hand when longboat heave in sight lady must immediately go below out of harm way while distribute yourselves along bulwark with firearm levelled at boat must arrange yourselves in such manner that mutineer may be able to see that be armed prepared to fight if necessary by mean hope to overawe bring to reason then completed arrangement being careful to take carter into full confidence treat in respect a master of ship assuming for rather character of first lieutenant than anything else then remained for to do be to sit down patiently await return of mutineer time sped on hour of sunset arrived darkness fell upon scene without sign of longboat began to feel somewhat uneasy a to safety of absentee for be in lonely so far a knowledge went unfrequented part of coast have heard rather gruesome story a to doings of native of treatment that be wont to mete out to white men shipwrecked sailor others who happened to be so unfortunate a to fall into hand a hour drifted past without bringing news at length grew so anxious began to consider very seriously advisability of sending away boat in search of missing men after fully discussing matter with carter however came to conclusion that first duty be to take care of ship passenger that mutinous crew must be left to look after finally having set strong anchor watch went below turned in daylight arrived noon came still there be sign of absentee in fever of anxiety made way up to fore royal yard from lofty elevation made careful survey of inland district there be very little to see beyond two mile stretch of broad winding river dotted with tree grown islet here there country be so densely overgrown with bush tree that nothing upon surface be to be seen a to longboat be nowhere visible be not much astonished at because from glimpse be able to catch of river have very little doubt that characteristic be precisely of other river in region namely somewhat sluggish current of water thick with foul fetid mud swampy margin overgrown with mangrove numerous willow winding creek mangrove bordered discharging into on side be highly probable that failing to find firm bank upon to land along margin of river mutineer have proceeded in search of such spot up one of creek there be canoe to be seen on part of river surface be visible from look out only suggestion of human life anywhere in neighbourhood be to be found in what took to be thin almost invisible wreath of smoke rising above tree top at spot two mile distant that wreath of smoke might of course indicate position of mutineer bivouac on other hand might thought far more likely indicate location of native village if latter suspicion must prove to be correct must not feel that situation of mutineer be one full of peril having taken careful mental note of everything have seen descended ratline making way aft invited carter general mr morton to join in main saloon happened just then to be vacant when arrived there told companion what have seen what feared then laid before proposal must take ship galley very fine six oared boat with nine men one of carronades mounted in bow go in search of missing men general morton must hear of for moment be quite willing that boat must be dispatched to search for longboat crew if matter must be arranged very strongly protested against idea nine fighting men must leave ship pointed out must be at mercy of mutineer if be to miss if be to get back before possibly must be still worse open to attack from hundred of savage must native by chance have discovered observed helpless predicament be pointing out to that stand be taking rendered idea of search impossible since considered wise prudent to dispatch weak search party must not dream of ordering of own men away upon such expedition in command of anyone when heard call on deck next moment simpson presented at entrance of saloon to say that longboat be in sight pulling hard for ship so far a must be made out there be only five men in whereupon with one accord dashed out on deck made best of way to topgallant forecastle afforded good view of approaching boat be now few minute past three o'clock ship time arrived on forecastle snatched telescope from hand of look out a flourished instrument toward boat with remark there come sir buckos in seem to be in tearin hurry too see how be makin ' spray fly oar buckle be workin ' harder just now than have done for many long day will warrant levelling instrument upon approaching boat saw that a simpson have informed there be only five men in who a look out man have observed be pulling a though for life boat although heavy one be positively foaming through water long stout ash oar men be labouring at bent sprang almost to breaking point at stroke there be something very seriously wrong somewhere said gravely fellow be bringing news of let come alongside simpson muster shark at gangway to disarm men a come up side must happen to have weapon about two minute later longboat dashed alongside a men flung in oar man who have be pulling bow sprang to foot yelled heave line mate for god sake let come aboard want to see mr carter quick right bully boy answered simpson here be line for ye look out chap be in too much of hurry now order be that be to come up side one at time if have got such little matter a knife pistol about just fork over thank ' e next man a man climbed inboard without demur drew empty pistol knife from belt handed over now then lad said a fellow faced round confronted where be rest of men who left ship yesterday out with story a quick a please where be rest repeated with white quivering lip while eye rolled voice rose almost to scream why of 'em be dead lucky beggar t'others be in hand of savage away there in wood be bein ' slowly tormented to death one at time while t'others be forced to look on wait turn at least be how read what have seen how come five men to be here demanded have managed to escape from savage be not with rest when be taken why sir answered fellow be like here stop moment interrupted tell whole story a briefly a possible from moment when pushed off from ship side yesterday then will get something like clear coherent account of what have happened yes yes be right grenvile agreed general a stood beside very upright stern looking lip white eager light of battle already kindling in eye will be saving of time in long run certainly think so said now man heave ahead with yarn well sir resumed man shoved off from ship side three twenty of a know beg pardon sir forgot be on deck never mind about lad interrupted go ahead a quickly a possible shoved off from ship pulled away into river what happened then nothin ' at sir be reply just pulled into river a soon a be fairly inside started to look round for spot where must get ashore try where must must find nothin soft mud must have bore weight of cat much le of man while be huntin ' for place came across narrer creek just wide enough for to pull into tonkin up hellum say a will try in there so pulled along for matter of nigh upon mile when at once creek come to end find boat nose jammed in among lot of mangrove root then pore jim nesbitt ups volunteer to try scramble along mangrove see if can find spot firm enough for to land upon when 'd be gone about quarter of hour come back again say have found place so actin ' upon tonkin order one of grab fowl bottle what not away go in pore jim wake presently out come at place where mangrove stopped bush began where mud be hard firm enough to walk upon little later come upon sort of path through bush follerin ' presently come into little open space where there be nothin ' grass with big tree growin ' round there brought to anchor cried spell ho ' then have grub drop two of grog smoke

people be still alive mean beat weapon out o hand after lash together with hand behind march off into bush twenty thirty of 'em stoppin ' behind to make sure that of lad a be down be also dead d 'ye know how did that sir why by just choppin ' off head with great sword made of what looked like hard wood seven of pore chap lost number of mess in way then savage cleared out carryin ' head away with

while t'other three must go back to boat take care of seein ' away from scattered ember of fire be so dark that must hardly see hand before agreed that 't be use attemptin ' to do anything until daylight so got up into tree again held on where be in case o savage must come back precious lucky thing be that thought of doin ' so for be solemn truth be tellin ' gen'lemen have very much more 'n got settled back on perch when back come about dozen o ' savage creepin ' out from among tree a quiet a cat start searchin ' whole place up down a though 'd lost somethin mate reckoned up that nigger have seen counted time yesterday have found after massacree that be all accounted for so 'd come back to look for be fort'nit thing for that be pretty well hid by leaf also that nigger did seem to think of lookin ' for up in tree by by just a day be breakin ' took theirselves off again when 'd got fairly away out o ' neighbourhood climbed down again others follered suit mike here made sail along path that nigger have gone while other three topped boom for boat onderstandin bein ' that be to get afloat swung round ready then wait till mike j'ined well mr carter sir gen'lemen mike here

native village a call so shortened sail got in among bush creepin ' for'ard until must see what be happenin ' when at last be able to get pretty clear view sight saw be enough to freeze man blood 'd

what have done persuade navy gent to fit out hexpedition to rescue others so away came a fast a must when got to boat be aground have to wait long time until floated here be sir oh gen'lemen for love o ' god do somethin ' if ye can to save pore chap what be bein ' tormented to death over there chapter eight rescue for few second after close of man harrowing account there be dead silence among then general wiping perspiration from face turned to said grenvile friend be situation for to grapple with very difficult situation be confess for on one hand unhappy men must be rescued at hazard while on other be equally imperative that ship in must be protected from possible not to say very probable attack by savage now what be to be done of course will understand that be ready to play part that may assign to may be permitted to suggest must probably be more useful in leading shore expedition than in other way thank general yes doubt be right be very difficult situation a say must have moment two to think out then turning to five horrified seaman who have returned in longboat ordered to go forward get cook to give something to eat drink for must be in need of service of of sooner later while one of must have to come with in boat a guide five men whom addressed thought of mutiny having by time be most effectually frightened out of head turned slouched away forward a meekly a lamb moment that be gone be surrounded by excited crowd of passenger of whom have come down from poop to listen to story of five returned seaman one of have more le unpractical suggestion to make be rather unfortunate that have heard what have passed for very graphic narrative told by eye witness of gruesome happening of past night powerful suggestion of what be probably taking place at moment away yonder in wood have so acted upon vivid imagination of woman one two of be visibly upon very verge of hysteric while be more le in state of mortal terror a to what might be fate must native take into head to attack ship for that presence of so many white men a have encountered must suggest to astute native mind idea that ship be somewhere near at hand be so exceedingly likely that might almost be accepted a foregone conclusion terrified though woman be behaved marvellously well quietly retired when requested to do so in order that men might be left free to discus detail together even while chatter be raging round at most excited pitch mind be busy upon detail of only plan be at feasible entire available fighting force counting in whole of male passenger surgeon briggs three assistant jenkins steerage passenger cook five men who have escaped from savage amounted to thirty be of course quite impossible to form from account of five escaped seaman anything like accurate estimate of number of savage believed must be quite safe in setting down at not le than three hundred there be also four prisoner reflected that a have not suffered harrowing experience of five escaped men must probably be still in much too insubordinate frame of mind to be of use therefore determined to leave where be for present reckoned however that not man must leave village to attack ship for other purpose until gruesome sport upon be at moment engaged have be played out to end therefore came to conclusion must be quite justified in throwing balance of strength into land expedition accordingly divided force into two equal part placing simpson in charge of ship entrusting with defence with small crew composed of surgeon four steward cook jenkins steerage passenger messrs morton fielder acutt boyne pearson taylor one of own men named sharland whose wound rendered useless for arduous land service although might be made very useful at pinch aboard ship left for landing expedition general carter seven shark five men who have escaped in longboat thus force consisted of fifteen men considered that landing force be far more formidable of two since numbered among nine trained fighting men while in improbable event of attack upon ship party left on board must have advantage of deck a fighting platform if hard pressed saloon deckhouses to to retreat also left musket boarding pike a well of course a own personal firearm two brass carronades a for general have sword shark carried cutlas apiece man of also have brace of pistol in belt pocketful of cartridge what most trusted to for creation of good wholesome panic among savage be dozen signal rocket have found in ship magazine arrangement being now complete general bade hasty good bye to wife daughter who bore very bravely upon occasion tumbled down over side into longboat into briggs have already with commendable forethought passed large basket of provision for sustenance of ourselves such of mutineer a might be fortunate enough to rescue be nearly two o'clock in afternoon when shoved off took few minute to reach river entrance passing through presently found in broad lagoon like expanse of water two mile long by about mile wide dotted here there with small tree clad island of might have be a much a ten twelve acre in extent while others be mere heap of mud just large enough to support clump of dozen so of coconut tree tiny thicket of bamboo greater part of lagoon be evidently very willow for dotted about here there be to be seen partially submerged trunk of tree other debris appeared to have be swept down into present position by bygone flood have ultimately grounded on mud there be just sufficient current wind to reveal deep water channel of about two hundred yard wide running in fairly straight line through lagoon toward most distant extremity there be numerous object dotted about surface of lagoon at distance have appearance of floating log when drew near to proved to be in almost instance head of basking alligator before have be in river ten minute be startled by huge black bulk breaking water close alongside boat turned out to be hippopotamus now higgins said whereabout be creek of yours see sign of thus far oh be way on ahead yet sir answered man keep straight up through deep water sir please will tell when come in sight of that unfortunate mutineer have penetrated distance into country soon became evident for traversed entire length of lagoon fully mile of river after have narrowed down to about quarter of mile in width ere sighted break of kind in thick entanglement of mangrove tree lined margin of stream even so higgins informed be not creek of be in search believed lay nearly mile farther up stream of one actually in sight denied knowledge soon became convinced that have escaped notice of mutineer break in question be on northern bank of river be to say on same side a creek of be in quest when first sighted be about quarter of mile distant a drew nearer to saw that deep water channel led straight to from main deep water channel at point about cable length distant kept eye upon spot a creek gradually opened out for must not help thinking that presented almost ideal spot wherein slaver might conceal a watched suddenly saw column of thick smoke shoot up above tree top at point estimated to be not much more than two hundred yard from mouth of creek in direction toward latter seemed to be trending while at same moment blare of horn dub dub dub of tom tom be borne faintly to ear by fitful breeze oar cried sharply silence fore aft listen of men instantly laid upon oar a boat went surging along with way that have on distinctly heard above quiet lap gurgle of water against planking sound of have spoken with occasional swelling of sound conveyed idea of many human voice raised in monotonous kind of chant how much farther do say creek of yours be higgins demanded why sir answered man must say a be best part of mile higher up ai mike ay about must think answered mike swinging round on thwart shading eye with hand a gaze searchingly swept river bank other three escaped mutineer expressed like opinion be general trend of direction took when followed savage asked why answered higgins instantly catching meaning be westerly sir be mike ye remember that run of creek be some'at down stream when went a'ter savage kept on bearin ' away towards left did depend o sir that there smoke be where village lie row that hears be made by savage doorin ' tormentin ' of one of pore unfort'nit shipmate be of same opinion that creek away on port bow appeared to lead so nearly in direct line toward point from smoke be rising seemed to offer such temptingly short cut to village where diabolical work be undoubtedly going forward determined to take slight risk of being mistaken make for forthwith therefore gave coxswain order to starboard helm bit feel way cautiously in over mud oarsman to give way keep strict silence in minute le have passed out of main deep water channel be gliding through willow water covered flat mud bank on side of stream men dipping oar deep at stroke to get timely warning of approach to water not deep enough to float boat bottom yet sir reported stroke oar at frequent interval at report coxswain starboarded extra half point so until at length boat nose be pointing straight for mouth of creek at stroke of oar fiendish uproar of horn tom tom shouting chanting whichever be seemed to come to ear more distinctly with more ominous import at boat entered creek canal at once gave order for hand who have cutlass to draw for man to look carefully to priming of pistol having be done pulled ahead once more now rapidity with mingled sound be guiding increased in volume told that be quickly approaching scene of action presently a though to dissipate doubt might still be lurking in mind distinctly heard at frequent interval piercing scream of man in mortal agony do hear that grenvile whispered general through set teeth why man cry make one blood run cold to listen to how much farther do mean to go before landing will go on until bring sound abeam of whispered back be moving very much faster here than must ashore especially when come to creeping through mangrove tree root so will get a close to place a can before landing oar for at moment swept round rather sharp bend in stream caught glimpse at great distance ahead of what thought looked very much like stern of canoe projecting from among tree on port held up hand for silence be so near to scene of action now that have raised shout must instantly have attracted attention maybe have temporarily suspended whatever operation might be proceeding party be altogether too weak to justify in incurring risk there appeared to be one life in immediate jeopardy ashore there whereas premature alarm might result in loss of several of rescuing party possibly complete failure of expedition strongest hope lay in possibility of effecting complete surprise so hardened heart held up hand to enjoin most perfect silence whispered coxswain to sheer boat little closer to port bank then a boat seemed to have plenty of way on ordered stroke to pas word to lay in oar noiselessly for in bow to stand by with boat hook painter order have just be obeyed be gliding along in absolute silence when short distance ahead caught sight of break in mangrove looked wide enough to admit boat signed to coxswain to point stem for few second later slid into kind of cavern formed of overarching branch of belt of mangrove gliding along narrow canal of about sixty foot in length finally brought up alongside good firm bank of soil on there be room enough for to land movement be effectually masked by thin belt of scrub appeared to be intervened between three four hundred yelling chanting native who be now making air ring vibrate within short hundred yard of at same time became aware that agonising shriek a of one in mortal agony have ceased din of discordant sound be now so tremendous that there be very especial need for observance of great amount of caution on part yet disembarked with scarcely sound drew little party up in two line shark being placed in front rank others immediately behind now men said have just one last word of caution to give before attack remember that have not come here for express purpose of fighting native to rescue fellow countryman therefore order be that a soon a be accomplished retreat be to be at once made to boat man pausing except to support comrade who may be in difficulty propose to begin attack by discharging whole of rocket a rapidly a possible into thick of crowd of native then to charge upon with sword cutlas reserving pistol fire for emergency hope by plan to scatter savage cause retirement for at least few brief minute during must dash in cut loose prisoner retire with to boat there must be no more fighting than be actually necessary to enable to accomplish purpose general patted approvingly on back excellent lad excellent whispered there spoke prudent commander foresee that will do well in profession now let get on one moment general if please said want to reconnoitre before advancing into open right answered will go with nodded consent at once led way toward screen of bush interposed between ourselves village distance to be traversed be merely sixty seventy yard to cover be obliged to make way through sparsely scattered mangrove took le than minute to accomplish journey then found that bush be much le dense than have appeared to be since be enabled without least difficulty to penetrate to spot where whole party must comfortably stand where intervening screen be so tenuous that ourselves unseen must see everything be happening in village be so obviously proper spot from to make attack that general at once went back to bring up men while remained to make such few observation a brief time at disposal must permit found that be on what might be termed right front of village be tolerably important place consisting of two hundred roomy hut constructed of wattle sun baked clay thatched with palm leaf hut however have interest for now be scene be being enacted in wide open space in front of village riveted attention space be occupied by crowd of fully thousand black men woman child most of whom be practically naked of whom be slowly circling in weird kind of dance round small area in midst of be planted eleven stout stake at distance of about fifty foot apart stake be of course upright stood about ten foot high be therefore easy enough to count stake owing to dense crowd surrounded be exceedingly difficult to distinguish whether not anything anybody be attached to found difficulty in arriving at tolerably accurate surmise a to purpose of stake for four of be charred quite black a though by action of fire while thin wreath of pale brownish blue smoke still eddied circled about one of four tone of chant now being sung by savage be very different from have reached ear while in open river be more subdued did not convey suggestion of savage exultation have be dominant note of other also now noticed that deafening clamour of horn thumping of tom tom have ceased idea conveyed to mind be that one act in drama of absorbing interest have closed that be about to open have time for further observation a general now came up with men at once proceeded to make final arrangement for instant attack now lad said see hundred of dancing savage want to plant rocket in such manner that will rake through whole crowd if must finish up by setting fire to hut so much better fire rocket one after a rapidly a possible moment that last rocket have be fired will spring out into open make dash for post to believe will find missing men secured use cutlass a freely a may be needful reserve pistol for emergency then having cut men loose must retire in body to boat get out of creek a quickly a possible now be ready then begin to fire rocket with preliminary sizzle strong odour of burning powder twelve rocket tore weirdly screaming in rapid succession out of clump of bush into thick of crowd of dancing savage ricochetting hither thither a encountered obstacle scattering shower of fire in direction finally exploding with loud report many of having previously embedded in dry thatch of hut effect of discharge be tremendous cumulative a first rocket plunged into throng sudden silence ensued savage stood death still gazing with eye of horror upon hissing fiery thing a darted hither thither inflicting painful burn bruise wherever went then long before first have run course second be also among playing similar antic working havoc like first then out swooped third at driving whole party crazy with terror producing state of utterly indescribable confusion a fourth rocket tore out of midst of belt of bush general yell of dismay arose then ensued regular stampede native knocking down falling over other in frenzied effort to escape from onslaught of fiery monster before last rocket have sped there be not savage to be seen whole swarm of down to child even having somehow managed to make escape into adjacent bush from cry of terror must still be heard proceeding while several of hut be already bursting into flame in midst of deserted open space eleven upright stake be now plainly visible four of ala black half consumed with fire with great heap of still smouldering faintly smoking ash in midst of be discernible calcined fragment of human skeleton around base while to of other seven be bound naked body of white man now forward lad cried dashing into open with drawn sword in hand cut loose seven men then form up ready for retreat to boat if be quick may do that came to do before savage return be run of few hundred yard from bush to post in minute be around cutting hacking at multitudinous coil of tough creeper bound prisoner to post in couple of minute last man have be released dazed speechless at suddenness of deliverance from lingering death of frightful torment such a have beheld inflicted upon four of unfortunate companion rescued mutineer be being hurried down to boat to bundle in pell mell scramble in ourselves shove off be work of few brief minute presently found once more in creek with bow pointed river ward eight men straining at oar a swept foaming past interminable array of mangrove with gaunt root like leg of gigantic spider sprawling out into black foul smelling water well exclaimed general taking off panama hat mopping perspiring head face with huge red silk handkerchief be good job well done without loss of man too except of course unfortunate four that be too late to save have managed affair exceedingly well young sir a will be happy to bear witness at time place have somehow quite know why have sort of prejudice against navy service train youngster like to do such work a have seen done to day ca be wholly bad bad sir exclaimed navy bad why on contrary although perhaps be not absolutely perfect be most glorious service that man can possibly enter be proud to belong to see note must not crow yet over success savage will probably be rallying by time since find that be not being pursued if must choose to follow along bank of creek may yet make smart for boldness ay agreed general may somehow fancy that will rocket seemed to frighten pretty well out of skin believe that will get over terror in hurry by jove sir be brilliant idea of yours rocket meanwhile rescued men be crouching in bottom of boat silent of with face buried in hand lying back a though dazed with eye closed one of last noticed have finger of two hand locked together lip be moving a though prayed be returning thanks to god for deliverance presently opened eye gaze met mine full noticed that flushed slightly a though ashamed at having be detected so nodded to said need to be ashamed good fellow if be thanking god for mercy have one of abundant reason to be thankful to day yes sir said even more perhaps than rest be makin ' ready to begin upon when broke in upon 'em therewith burst into violently hysterical passion of tear result doubtless of reaction arising from sudden unexpected rescue from horror of death from protracted torment such a have witnessed in case of other four for now appeared that without harrowing reader feeling by entering into unnecessary detail suffering of one two of unfortunate men must have be prolonged to extent of quite three hour ringleader tonkin have be singularly enough man who have be subjected to certain peculiar refinement of torture while inflicting what one must readily conceive must be most excruciating agony be not of nature to produce death save by long drawn out process of physical exhaustion spoke such comforting word to poor creature a must think of at same time not forgetting to administer little much needed stimulant food production of latter reminded that felt atrociously hungry thirsty a soon a be safely clear of creek once more in main channel of river fell to upon basket of provision briggs have so thoughtfully provided for refreshment note what must grenvile have thought of much more perfect service of present day wonder hc chapter nine night attack arrived safely alongside ship just a sun be dipping beneath western horizon to great relief joy of whom have left on board learned with much satisfaction that nothing whatever of alarming character have transpired during long absence occupant of cuddy be very naturally anxious to be furnished with fullest detail of afternoon adventure left telling of to general retired below to indulge in luxury of good wash complete change of clothing before sitting down to dinner that tragic occurrence of day have put effectual end to mutiny be of course foregone conclusion be not at surprised to learn that within quarter of hour of return men having doubtless consulted together in forecastle have come aft in body to express to carter contrition for insubordinate behaviour to request that might be allowed to turn to again at same time giving most elaborate assurance of good behaviour in future a matter of fact soon became perfectly clear that there must never have be mutiny at for tonkin who be sole instigator a well a murderer of unfortunate captain williams who have provoked turbulent boatswain to highest pitch of exasperation by alternation of jovial good fellowship with truculent arrogance of demeanour poor carter seemed to find little difficult to make up mind how to deal with matter a confessed to somewhat later same evening pointed out to that chief offender having be removed there be exceedingly small likelihood of recurrence of insubordination especially a men have really nothing to complain of in treatment in matter of food looked at after event outbreak wore very much appearance of impulsive act on part of men skilfully engineered by tonkin for evil purpose of own now effectually frustrated therefore advised carter to let resume duty with distinct understanding that upon own behaviour during remainder of voyage must depend whether not be called to account for disastrous act of insubordination argument of mine coupled with hint that must need service of hand to protect ship must native take into head to attack also to get afloat again convinced at once have aft spoke to in term have suggested although ugly awkward incident of mutiny be ended be by mean out of wood for ship be still hard fast aground having apparently run upon sandbank on top of springtide looked more than likely that must be necessary to lighten considerably before must hope to get afloat again meanwhile there be savage to be kept in mind have lesson of afternoon brought home to good wholesome realisation of danger of meddling with white men have on other hand only inflamed against made resolve to wreak terrible revenge question be one felt impossible to answer meanwhile that must do while in present helpless condition be to keep bright look out night day to hold ready for emergency needle to say carter took especial care to see that there be slackness negligence on part of anchor watch night whole of duty being undertaken by own men while be up about at frequent interval through night hour of darkness passed uneventfully when dawn appeared there have be neither sight sign of savage anywhere near ship at six o'clock morning usual routine of duty be resumed on board hand being turned up to wash deck generally perform ship toilet before breakfast noticed with satisfaction a went forward to get usual shower bath under head pump that carter have caused four prisoner to be released from fore peak believed that rest of hand might now be safely trusted to keep quartette in order immediately after breakfast in forecastle hand be again turned up good stout hawser be bent on to kedge anchor be then lowered down into longboat run away out broad on ship port quarter other end of hawser be then led forward along poop main deck to windlass believed must be better able than capstan to withstand strain that intended to put upon done hawser be hove taut main hatch be then lifted quantity of cargo be hoisted out deposited in longboat alongside other boat also being lowered into water by time that longboat be a deep a must swim be close upon high water men be then sent to windlass with order to endeavour to get pawl two succeeded in doing ship quarter being by time slewed so far off sandbank that now lay with regard to general run of at angle of nearly forty five degree then windlass positively refused to turn further even to extent of single pawl men therefore left a felt that nothing be to be gained by snapping hawser be now strained to utmost limit of endurance fully loaded longboat be now dropped astern longboat of dolores in have be picked up will be remembered carter have felt impelled to hoist inboard be brought alongside in place too be loaded a deeply a be safe to venture be noon by time tide have turned ship remained immovable men dinner hour have arrived second longboat be therefore dropped astern hand knocked off for midday meal in addition to longboat indian queen carried jolly boat dinghy four very fine roomy gig two of hung in davit in wake of mizzen rigging while other two be supported on gallows stood abaft mainmast will be seen therefore even apart from longboat gig of dolores ship be very well supplied with boat only two of two longboat be thus far loaded gig although be of course of much smaller capacity than longboat having fixed thwart be not so adaptable for purpose of temporarily receiving cargo be nevertheless capable of being made very good use of in afternoon be brought alongside loaded one after until four of ship own gig be a deep in water a be prudent to put when also be dropped astern leaving only dinghy gig of dolores unutilised dinghy of course be too small to be of use a temporary receptacle of cargo felt that must be unwise to deprive ourselves of service of remaining gig for other purpose therefore decided in conjunction with carter that if must prove necessary to lighten ship still further must discharge two longboat on to sandbank considerable area of remained dry even at high water then strike cargo down into empty boat a be by time within hour of sunset men have be working very hard day arranged to let knock off after clearing up deck replacing hatch to take good rest in view of possibility that might be obliged to call upon during night must savage elect to become troublesome night fell calm gracious upon scene air breathless sky without cloud with thin strip of new moon hanging in western sky in wake of vanished sun anchor watch be set by time have taken bath changed clothes dinner hour have arrived gathered round hospitable board briggs satellite have prepared for everybody be in best of spirit for men have not only worked well have also displayed very manifest desire to eradicate by behaviour bad impression have be produced by recent lamentable lapse from path of rectitude excellent progress have also be made in task of lightening ship finally savage have shown disposition to interfere with there be consequently good deal of lively chatter during progress of meal when be over piano be opened have very excellent music lady having retired rose to go out on deck take final look round ere turned in before went thought desirable to say word two of caution gentleman said have just come to end of very delightful evening hope that will all enjoy unbroken night rest there be reason so far a can see why must not must none of forget that so long a ship remains where now be be exposed to possibility of attack by savage therefore while ask to keep watch even to remain awake strongly urge to keep weapon beside ready loaded so that if by unfortunate chance must be necessary for to call upon to assist in defending ship may be able to respond without delay umph grunted general better tell exactly what mean grenvile be men here so can speak quite plainly have observed anything to day indicative of disposition on part of native to attack general have not said know of reason why must not have perfectly quiet undisturbed night rest a did last night merely thought advisable to give word of warning because native along coast to be treacherous in extreme very much given to doing precisely what least expect to do beyond see cause whatever for uneasiness believe good night gentleman sound sleep pleasant dream to when stepped out on deck found that character of weather have changed during three hour so that have spent in cuddy young moon have of course set time before sky have grown overcast seemed to be threatening rain cloud be sweeping up from about south south west light breeze seemed likely to freshen be blowing from direction driving great mass of chill wet fog along before of so dense character that be scarcely possible to make out foremast from head of poop ladder altogether threatened to be distinctly unpleasant night for unfortunate men whose duty must be to keep look out through hour of darkness carter in thick pilot cloth jacket be walking to fro on poop with short pipe stuck in corner of mouth when joined hullo carter said be change of weather with vengeance when did happen why answered carter fog closed in upon just after sunset same a have done night since have be here breeze have only sprung up within last half hour look a though 't be going to freshen too so think said how be coming broad off starboard bow be yes about agreed carter tide be rising be not continued freshening breeze having suggested idea to in turn wished to suggest to companion ay risin ' fast answered will be high water about midnight reckon just so agreed idea wished to suggest to have clearly not yet dawned upon although ought to have done so without need of hint from so without further beating about bush said now think carter that with nice little breeze blowing from precisely right direction must be quite worth while to loose set square canvas throw aback cut in a at last caught idea why of course do mr grenvile thank ' e for hint 'd be precious sight more helpful than kedge will have done at once started to go forward to call men what about cable said have got bent anchor ready to let go if must happen to back off bank said coming to halt again have be so busy with one thing know will have done a soon a have got canvas on better do that first have suggested must trust kedge to hold in breeze with square canvas set n o perhaps not agreed dubiously well then will get port cable bent anchor cockbill ready for lettin ' go before touchin ' canvas how must that be much safest think said let go for'ard see what be exact state of affair there what be state of hawser ah still quite taut a tested tension with foot arrived upon forecastle found anchor stowed inboard cable below hand being called including shark made short work of business for while one gang went below cleared away cable roused up on deck rove through hawse pipe ready for bending third got anchor outboard then while jones shark boatswain mate party bent cable got everything ready for letting go in case of need carter men climbed into rigging beginning at topgallant sail loosed square canvas overhauled gear saw everything clear for sheeting home hoisting away to set canvas trim yard aback be now work of few minute be soon done with immediate result that ship from having slight list to starboard came upright with just slightest possible tendency to heel to port now mr carter said ship bilge be no longer bearing upon sand think therefore if be must send hand to windlass let endeavour to get pawl two that canvas be doing good work up there may be that if helped bit with pull on hawser must come off ay agreed carter so might will try man windlass lad see if can move at hour work now may get ship afloat so save ye good many hour breakin ' out cargo to morrow ay ay sir answered men cheerfully enough considering that have be awakened out of sound sleep dragged out of warm bunk to come up work in chill pestilential fog after having worked hard day tail on to handle bully tail on heave heave raise dead shouted man mike who have be one of lucky five to escape capture by savage got first pawl easily enough then by time hawser be once more a taut a bar a lightly rested foot upon to test tautness felt very gradually slackening meant one of two thing that kedge be coming home thought improbable that ship be very slowly sliding off bank so cried to men who have desisted from effort for fear of parting hawser there give heave away again lad keep steady strain on hawser want hour yet to high water men again threw weight alternately upon lever once more great pawl clanked once twice thrice then long pause clank then further pause foot be still on hawser felt that be steadily although very slowly yielding there be moment when must almost have sworn that felt ship jerk ever so slightly sternward so ventured to stimulate men little further hurrah lad cried there move hang to one complete turn of windlass be own heave again heave responded men hoarsely flinging whole weight upon elevated lever while opposite grasped corresponding depressed handle gripping deck with naked toe bent back bore upward until muscle in straining body cracked again clank clank spoke pawl again yet again clank then after long heaving straining pause clank again shorter pause again clank clank clank then a men struggled fought desperately with stubborn windlass ship jerked perceptibly twice pawl spoke in quicker succession ship surged again with wild hurrah from men a lever suddenly yielded to began to leap rapidly up down indian queen gathered way slid off into deep water well there with windlass cried carter delightedly let go to'gallant topsail halyard sheet man clewlines fore main clew garnet stand by to let go anchor ay ay sir be response from topgallant forecastle ready with anchor stand clear of cable meanwhile merchant crew be clewing up hauling down to accompaniment of usual cry what therefore with carter command seaman call violent flinging down of rope upon deck there be very considerable uproar going on upon deck be not at surprised when general clad in dressing gown emerged from below with sword in one hand pistol in other to enquire what racket be about explained situation to be expressing great gratification at fact that ship have be got afloat again when carter gave order to let go anchor gone sir answered jones a heavy splash sounded under ship bow instantly followed by yell of large canoe two of 'em three four there be whole fleet of canoe closing in round sir where away demanded unceremoniously breaking away from general dashing forward to topgallant forecastle up ladder of scrambled with considerable loss of shin leather there sir d see responded jones sweeping arm in wide circle a pointed into fog wreath be whirling round fog darkness together rendered extremely difficult to see anything by dint of peering at length distinguished several shapeless dark blotch at distance of about fifty fathom from ship arranged apparently in form of wide semicircle on side of opposite to on lay sandbank jones however be not quite right in statement that be closing in upon for appeared to be lying quite stationary at least be only paddling just sufficiently to avoid being swept away by sluggish tide be running there be very little doubt in mind that have very narrowly escaped ugly surprise be by mean certain that might not yet look to be attacked view of situation be that native have gathered about in hope that in fog darkness might be able to steal alongside climb aboard in such overwhelming number a to secure possession of deck overpower by taking by surprise that have be restrained from making attempt only by sound of bustle activity have accompanied endeavour to get ship afloat lay down from aloft hand at once shouted sending voice pealing up through fog to figure be to be dimly seen sprawling on yard dragging at heavy festoon of canvas jones find musket a smartly a can musket sir ay ay sir here be one answered man fishing one out from hiding place thrusting into hand lifting piece to shoulder levelled in direction where canoe seemed to be congregated most thickly aiming so a to send bullet flying pretty close over head of savage pulled trigger distinctly heard plop of bullet a struck water beyond be a still a death meanwhile at call men aloft have come sliding down backstay be now mustering on fore deck awaiting further instruction at same moment general came forward to announce that have quietly called men passenger who must be on deck in moment bringing firearm with will place at head grenvile said if will tell how can most helpfully assist will see to detail of task that may assign to thousand thanks general answered perhaps can not do better than muster men on poop if detect disposition on part of canoe to close in upon ship fire into without hesitation be time for half measure must deal decisively firmly with fellow will find in very awkward predicament right agree with there will not find wanting hope responded sir thomas a turned to walk away aft simpson san domingo beardmore come up here on topgallant forecastle called at call up came men with inevitable answer of ay ay sir simpson said want san domingo to take charge of port carronade while jones beardmore attend to starboard one ship have now swung to anchor be lying fairly steady so when once have trained piece will not need much alteration run close up to rail depress muzzle so that discharge will strike water at distance of about fifty yard will afford room for charge to spread nicely if canoe approach within distance fire upon will arrange for more ammunition to be sent to at once then descended to main deck finding carter arranged with that must descend to magazine with one of men who must be trusted to be careful send up ample supply of ammunition done next act be to range crew of ship along main deck port starboard side with musket in hand giving strict injunction to fire upon canoe that might see attempting to approach ship arrangement have taken considerable time to describe really occupied two three minute during not sound of description have come from canoe however must occasionally be caught sight of dimly showing when mist wreath thinned for moment meanwhile own disposition being complete tense silence reigned throughout ship broken only by occasional low muttered word from one man to suddenly shrill pealed out from somewhere in fog away on port hand followed next instant by thin whirring sound in air about ship accompanied by sharp crisp thud here there along bulwark thin reedy pattering on deck object of sort fell close to foot upon groping for found that be arrow at same moment loud fierce discordant yell burst out round ship rattling splash of innumerable paddle dashed into water reached ear here come here come cried men musket flashed out of darkness down in waist of ship steady lad steady cried fire until can see what be firing at take good aim before pull trigger at moment whole host of canoe came dashing at out of fog darkness sharp irregular volley of musketry rattled out fore aft in midst of bang bang rang out carronades almost simultaneously discharge be immediately followed by most fearful outcry of shriek groan two large canoe have received content of carronades paused in rush went drifting slowly past on tide heaped with motionless body of crew in sinking condition in nowise checked rush of other canoe came foaming toward with crew plying paddle while other half maintained fierce fire with bow arrow reload carronades on forecastle cried then train to rake main deck fore aft half of in waist retreat to topgallant forecastle other half to poop defend two position to last gasp let know when carronades be ready be careful so to depress muzzle that none of charge will reach poop so saying made dash for main deck entrance of saloon locked slipping key into pocket then followed rest of party up on to poop bade pull two poop ladder up after poop topgallant forecastle thus formed two citadel of sort capable of being pretty fairly defended except in face of overwhelming force now lad cried load musket again pepper savage a swarm in over bulwark if can not turn back rush by mean look to simpson jones to sweep main deck clear with carronades fire until see that be absolutely necessary in order to save ship here come now lad stand by a last word left lip leading canoe dashed alongside next instant thirty forty savage must be seen scrambling over bulwark leaping down on main deck seemed somewhat disconcerted at finding one to oppose paused irresolutely a though not quite knowing what to do perhaps fearing trap of sort meanwhile others came close upon heel while general volunteer suddenly found hand full in repelling attack upon poop by way of mizzen chain a for part of crew have retired to poop at order formed up along fore end of structure now a one after reloaded musket comrade on topgallant forecastle opened brisk if somewhat irregular fire upon multitude of savage who came pouring in over bulwark into waist of ship by light of musketry flash saw several of savage throw up arm fall to deck so many of indeed in proportion to number of shot fired that felt convinced many of bullet must be doing double triple duty for savage who fell at least dozen fresh one came in over bulwark to take place soon recognised that such musketry fire a ours must be absolutely ineffectual to deal with overwhelming odds brought against how warmly congratulated have not be foolish enough to attempt anything like systematic defence of waist of ship have done that must have be exterminated within first minute of attack a be be doing very well at end of ship at event for although savage quickly recovered after first moment of astonishment at finding nobody on main deck to oppose began to pour in hot fire of arrow not one of party who be somewhat scattered be lying down most of behind sort of shelter be hit by time that attack have be raging five minute however there must have be quite three hundred savage crowded on main deck between poop topgallant forecastle affair began to wear very serious aspect for defender for by time black be making desperate effort to climb up on to poop carry by escalade few of have sustained more le serious hurt in resisting critical moment when must either conquer go under be close upon be about to call to simpson to ask whether be ready on forecastle with carronades when voice rose above din hailing poop ahoy look out there aft for be goin ' to fire ca hold out here half minute very well answered fire a soon a like sooner better then added jump to foot everybody on poop run a far aft a can shelter yourselves behind companion skylight anywhere until have fired carronades have just time to make good rush for shelter leaving native who be endeavouring to storm poop evidently much astonished at sudden inexplicable retreat when two carronades barked out simultaneously terrific hubbub of shout yell down in waist ceased a though by magic to be succeeded next instant by surely most dreadful outburst of scream groan human ear have ever listened to carnage knew must have be terrific must not do to trust to effect of alone must instantly follow up by action of sort must complete panic already begun so shouted hurrah lad now down on main deck of drive remainder of savage over side before have have time to recover from dismay seizing hold of first rope came to hand swung off poop down on main deck began to lay about right left with sword remainder of party fore aft instantly following example for few second savage who still stood on foot how very few there seemed to be of appeared to be too completely dazed by what have happened to take step to secure safety even allowed to be shot struck down without raising hand to defend then in moment sens seemed to return to panic upon have reckoned took place glanced about saw that whereas minute before deck upon stood have be crowded with surging throng of excited fellow savage striving to get within reach of hated white men be now heaped cumbered with dead dying with only stray uninjured man left here there incontinently with shrill yell of terror made for bulwark tumbled over careless apparently whether dropped into canoe into water so long a must effect escape from awful shamble many of of course dropped into canoe made good escape splashing commotion alongside frequent shriek of agony told only too plainly that many of in haste have missed canoe fallen into water where shark be making short work of a for a soon a panic set in retreat be fairly under way held hand allowing poor wretch to get away without further molestation in two minute from moment of terrible discharge of carronades not native remained on deck of indian queen save who be either dead too severely injured to be able to escape chapter rejoin shark a soon a savage who must leave ship have gone roused out a many lantern a must muster lighted hung in fore main rigging stood here there along rail preparatory to going round of deck beginning gruesome task of separating dead from wounded while be doing general who claimed to posse knowledge of surgery retired to main saloon having roused out mr jenkins daughter patsy impressed into service a assistant proceeded to help burgess to attend to wounded of own party of whom be one arrow having transfixed through left shoulder so effectually that barbed point projected out at back have received wound moment before discharge of carronades have be scarcely conscious of hurt at moment man can not plunge into thick of melee with arrow through shoulder not know something about sooner later hurt have quickly become very painful inflamed doctor declared that mine be worst case of insisted must for reason be first treated therefore submitted with good grace for there be many matter calling for immediate attention in few minute head of arrow be carefully cut off shaft withdrawn from wound wound carefully washed dressed then with arm in sling jacket loosely buttoned round neck went out on deck to see how matter be proceeding there only seventeen living body be found among prostrate heap with deck be cumbered seventeen after burgess have done what must for placed in one of many empty canoe still remained alongside ship towed craft into river where moored in position that must be likely to attract attention of native thus lead to investigation of rescue of cargo of wounded be a much a must do without exposing to very grave to mind quite unnecessary risk however be not done until return of daylight enabled to see what be about dead having be got rid of own wounded attended to hand turned in to secure little very necessary rest deck being left in charge of anchor watch consisting of messrs acutt boyne pearson taylor who very kindly volunteered to see to safety of ship during few remaining hour of darkness pointing out that must be perfectly easy for to rest during day while crew of ship be engaged in doing what be necessary to enable to make early start from spot have brought so much adventure into life of have be so disastrous to of little community at daylight hand be called first work undertaken be removal a far a possible of trace of preceding night conflict by dint of hard labour at length succeeded in so far effacing stain that ordinary eye must scarcely be likely to identify a what really be be at event something gained there be other mark however be impossible to obliterate such a scoring of deck plank pitting of mahogany maple woodwork forming fore bulkhead of poop by bullet have formed part of charge of two carronades when be fired to rake main deck be obliged to leave a be having succeeded in thus far straightening up matter that lady passenger must venture on deck without too violent shock to susceptibility hand knocked off to go to breakfast meal over kedge be weighed stowed then boat be brought alongside one after process of striking cargo back into hold be vigorously proceeded with work be of course done by ship crew under carter supervision own little party of men thus have opportunity at last to treat to much needed rest indeed so far a be concerned burgess insisted must at once turn in remain in bunk until must give leave to rise in such climate a must not be answerable for life a matter of fact have already begun to realise with pain of wounded shoulder exhaustion arising from want of sleep must not hold out much longer felt more than thankful after hot reception have given native there be not much probability of further fighting therefore gladly retired to cabin having swallowed composing draught burgess mixed for slept until following morning when felt so much better that worthy medico rather reluctantly consented to rising in time to sit down with rest to tiffin same evening by dint of hard work crew succeeded in completing stowage of last of cargo securing hatch hoisting in boat before knocking off somewhat later be to say about three bell in second dogwatch carter availed of springing up of land breeze to lift anchor stand out to sea under easy canvas on following morning when went on deck indian queen be out of sight of land standing to southward under plain sail with nothing in sight head of topsail of brig hull down in south western quarter be stretching in toward coast close hauled on port tack took very little notice of craft at time for be then too far distant to show much of even when viewed through ship telescope while yard be so braced that only edge of sail presented to view remembering recent experience with brig at spot not very far distant from where then be strongly advised carter to keep wary eye upon movement land breeze be then fast dying away thought quite possible that might have opportunity to see little more of stranger when sea breeze must set in same sea breeze set in while in cuddy be sitting down to breakfast when after meal be over adjourned to poop found carter regarding stranger with little uneasiness through telescope a joined handed instrument saying just take squint at mr grenvile tell what think of to mind seems to be steering in such way a to close with must like to have opinion upon accordingly took instrument soon have stranger sharply focused in lens be then broad on starboard bow be still hull down have risen just to foot of fore course be set while mainsail hung in clewlines buntlines be running down with squared yard have studding sail set a carter have remarked seemed to be steering in such manner a to intercept be brig of about same tonnage a shark of craft somehow reminded sufficiently to invite closer more detailed scrutiny presently be able to make out that flew pennant be consequently man o ' war be true that shark be not only brig on west african station british have two others knew of three under french pennant craft in sight be not french must swear to longer looked at more firmly convinced did become that be none other than dear old shark must not be absolutely certain of identity until hull must heave up clear of horizon that jaunty steeve of bowsprit hoist spread of topsail be very strongly suggestive of shark a lowered glass from eye happened to glance forward caught sight of jones simpson seated forward on topgallant forecastle smoking pipe a animatedly discussed topic of absorbing interest catching eye beckoned to come aft to poop take telescope jones have good look at brig said a climbed poop ladder hat in hand then pas instrument to simpson let do same then tell what think of two men took instrument one after other ogled stranger through with greatest intentness must see clearly even before simpson took over instrument from boatswain mate latter have already arrived at pretty definite conclusion with regard to well said when at length simpson have ended scrutiny handed back instrument to what do think of why sir answered simpson if ai shark be own sister to be can say jones what be opinion asked why just same a carpenter sir answered jones be shark right enough know steeve o that bowsprit too well to be mistook a to what that brig be be shark will have pleasure of slingin ' hammicks aboard of to night verily believe be right said at event will know for certain in course of half hour meanwhile can do harm by going forward passing word for shark to have everything ready for shifting over must surmise prove to be correct so really think that yonder brig be own ship remarked carter when two men have gone forward again well if must prove to be so will be very sorry to lose so will of lose lose whom hope be not going to lose anybody have already have loss enough voyage goodness know exclaimed general emerging from companion at moment have evidently caught word two of what carter have be saying wanted to know about why sir thomas mr grenvile belief that brig yonder to be own ship shark answered carter if turn out that be right of course men will be rejoinin directly be just sayin ' that will be very sorry to lose sorry by george must say so cut in general must have be precious bad job for everybody in ship if have not be lucky enough to pick up men why sir must man jack of have be dead a mutton by time so think that craft yonder be ship do continued turning to well if be will have to join go without saying carter here speaks more than truth when say that will be very sorry to lose know that will be if must be that must say good bye to now must not be end of acquaintance know will never do have fought side by side boy will expect to write to from time to time to let know how be getting on will write to also if can give address from letter can be forwarded on to will be address for next year two probably producing card scribbled something upon handed to now continued about rejoining ship of yours must be possible for to accompany on board must like to make acquaintance of captain have little talk with very clearly understood that kind hearted old fellow wished to do good turn by making much more favourable report of conduct than must be possible for personally to make be not so foolish a to regard lightly neglect help of must legitimately avail in professional career therefore said oh yes sir thomas have doubt that can be very easily managed be quite sure that captain bentinck will be delighted to see can go aboard in same boat with return to ship can be afterwards arranged for right then be settled now will leave for there be little matter wish to attend to before people leave ship with very kindly smile nod old gentleman turned left presently noticed that be deep in conversation with first one then of passenger who be now mustering on poop meanwhile breeze be freshening two craft be nearing other fast brig gradually edging little farther away to southward at same time by mean by time presented so nearly perfect broadside view of herself to that must see end of gaff to presently saw british ensign run up now there be longer doubt a to being shark for figurehead consisting of gilt life size effigy of fish after be named must be distinctly made out glittering under heel of bowsprit in reply to challenge of course lost time in running up own ensign beyond doing that there be need for further signalling for be by time clearly evident that intended to speak presently little party of nine came marching aft bag baggage to lee gangway where stood waiting in readiness to go down over side san domingo depositing kit temporarily in stern sheet of longboat while hurried down into cabin to get few belonging together negro have just returned to deck with when shark ranging up within biscuit toss of hailed ship ahoy what ship be that indian queen of from london to bombay with passenger general cargo replied carter have officer nine men belonging to on board sir will send boat for will lower one of ours be that mr grenvile stand beside sir asked voice now recognised despite speaking trumpet a of captain bentinck yes sir replied for have nine men with survivor of prize crew of dolores saw skipper turn to mr seaton who stood beside say something to other replied then former hailed again very glad to find that be safe mr grenvile shouted have better take room heave to will do same need not trouble about boat will send one of ours carter flourished arm by way of reply then gave order main tack sheet let go man main clew garnet trice up lay aft here to main brace of stand by to back mainyard down helm man let come to wind at moment sir thomas came up to said grenvile lad come down on to main deck with moment will have word two must like to say to men before leave ship certainly sir thomas said down trundled to where little party of shark stood lovingly eyeing movement of ship a be manner of sailor abusing in while lad said general a faced round at approach be about to leave return to own ship where doubt not will receive warm hearty welcome from messmate before go wish on behalf of myself rest of passenger of indian queen to express to very high appreciation of splendid manner in have conducted yourselves while on board ship still more of magnificent service under leadership of gallant young officer mr grenvile have rendered not only to owner crew of ship also to passenger there can be manner of doubt that under god by gracious mercy have be mean first of rescuing bulk of crew from death of nature too horrible to contemplate secondly ourselves passenger from fate equally horrible by so doing have laid under obligation be utterly impossible for adequately to requite particularly at present moment be intention to go on board ship to express personally to captain very high opinion of conduct of one of meanwhile passenger a body have deputed to invite acceptance of bag content amounting to ninety sovereign be to say ten pound man a very small inadequate expression of gratitude to wish long life prosperity thank ' e sir thomas thank ' e sir be gentleman of right sort be ay good fighter too sir sha forget how went with into village away yonder to help save poor shell back so on so on man felt incumbent upon to say something in reply to sir thomas speech still more by way of thanks for handsome gift have come to through by time that pleasant little ceremony of presentation be over two vessel be hove to carter who of course saw heard what be going on must need come down have say also mr grenvile men of shark began a soon a general back be turned have be very pleased to see what be just be done be only sorry that have power to do a much on own account whereas be now cap'n of ship be only third mate when hauled out of dock at london consequently have money of own for makin ' present such money a be in ship belongs to owner have power to spend otherwise than in certain way a dare say understand agree with word that general said about splendid conduct savin ' life of crew passenger when get back home will of course see owner report everything to if be men take to be will be sure to do handsome thing by a for can only thank very heartily for help have given shark boat came alongside just then men passed down dunnage into amid brisk fire of good humoured chaff from shipmate such enquiry a hello jim have got so much a monkey parrot to cheer up with so on then followed belonging down side stowed away in boat while be busy saying adieu to occupant of poop of whom expressed deep regret at parting with then sprang down into boat general followed shoved off amid much cheering from forecastle much waving of hat pocket handkerchief from poop pull from ship to brig be short one in few minute have satisfaction of finding once more standing on deck of shark come on board sir reported touching hat to captain who with first lieutenant be standing on quarter deck near gangway a entered have taken rather by surprise mr grenvile remarked skipper gravely acknowledging salute quite expected that must be at sierra leone by time see that be wounded appear also to have lost men circumstance coupled with fact of coming to from yonder ship lead to fear that matter have gone very seriously wrong with prize have indeed sir be sorry to say answered before tell story sir will permit to introduce to general sir thomas baker one of passenger aboard indian queen who have expressed desire to have conversation with very pleased to make acquaintance sir thomas remarked skipper exchanging salute with general then offering hand perhaps will do favour to step below to cabin with can then have chat together meanwhile mr grenvile if one may judge from appearance sooner report to surgeon better will be for a touched hat retired led way below closely followed by general well grenvile here be exclaimed morgan a entered cabin have be expecting for saw come up side what be extent of damage what have done with dolores be worse shoulder head shoulder eh well let help off with jacket shirt easy doe there now sit down in chair make comfortable while cooper up have surgeon aboard ship shoulder of yours appears to have be attended to very passably now spin yarn while give overhaul gave brief account of myself of what have befallen since leaving shark while morgan patched up work yarn came to end about same time well said a rose to leave cabin think skipper will have much fault to find with when hears story must help loss of schooner upon other hand there seems to be very little doubt that saved indian queen from destruction passenger crew from very terrible fate expect that jolly old buffer general what be name have come aboard with express purpose of making confidential report to skipper upon conduct if story at bear out own ought to do good now be going to put on sick list for day two have be worked quite hard enough of late wounded too must take care of for little while need not stay below know must not go on duty for be not fit for shoulder of yours need looking after will give good deal of trouble come to again at eight bell afternoon from surgeon cabin made way to midshipman berth where received a boisterously hearty welcome a mid must desire have be there scarcely five minute when san domingo who have already installed in former berth popped head in at door said with broad grin mistah grenvile sah de first leptenant wish to see on deck sah leaving shipmate itching with curiosity to hear yarn have just begun to spin made way up to quarter deck where found mr seaton in charge ship still remaining hove to ah here be grenvile exclaimed first luff a stepped up to touched hat be anxious to hear story of adventure since left understood that captain have sent below to surgeon have seen yes sir said have be with for quite hour while dressed wound have put on sick list sir be about best place for must think judging from look answered companion of course continued wily old welshman availed of opportunity to extract story from trust morgan for however have only weathered on to extent of hour so will get even with yet before done now heave ahead lad give whole yarn from clew to earing whereupon have to go through story second time when have come to end began to reckon up mentally how many time more might reasonably be expected to tell for fact be be already becoming little tired of thank grenvile said mr seaton a brought yarn to conclusion most interesting yarn exceedingly exciting experience of course be not for to mete out praise blame in official capacity be to say be for captain to do unofficially merely a friend may perhaps venture to say that so far a can see have nothing with to reproach have much to be proud of be unfortunate that must have lost five of number be particularly sorry that mr gowland must have be among for mr gowland be particularly trustworthy reliable navigator one must possibly have foreseen that must have be attacked by piratical slaver ah here come captain friend general what fine looking old fellow general be came straight toward where first luff be standing a approached captain bentinck said well general since be quite determined not to stay to lunch with let at least introduce first lieutenant to before go sir thomas very courteously expressed pleasure that must afford to make mr seaton acquaintance introduction be duly made then captain said sir thomas have be giving very full detailed description of everything have happened since joined indian queen mr grenvile recital have afforded great deal of pleasure appear to have handled extremely difficult situation with equal courage discretion may a well say at once so far a part of adventure be concerned be quite satisfied sir thomas have also have something to say about part of adventure relates to loss of dolores here thought detected twinkle of amusement in skipper eye brought there possibly by repetition of general frank criticism of commanding officer conduct in turning adrift in unarmed vessel from gather that be in way to blame for unfortunate occurrence think will be confirmed in opinion sir when have heard grenvile own version of occurrence a have said mr seaton whole affair appears to have be just one of that one must possibly have anticipated well must bid adieu said general for have kept poor carter waiting most unconscionable time see marching to fro upon poop yonder in state of terrible impatience good bye dear boy god bless for be downright good lad in way forget to write to keep posted a to how be getting on good bye captain bentinck be delighted to have have very great pleasure of making acquaintance be much obliged to for listening to so patiently good bye mr seaton good bye good bye old gentleman bustled away beaming benignantly upon sundry made way down into boat meanwhile have be hauled up to gangway five minute later boat returned to shark be hoisted to davit two craft filled away upon respective course with mutual dip of ensign much waving of white pocket handkerchief from poop of indian queen must be called upon to relate story yet once again time to captain be of course inevitable be considerate enough to defer recital until dinner time that evening when second lieutenant master be guest at table be very kind sympathetic in matter of loss of dolores admitted be inevitable under circumstance warmly reiterated expression of satisfaction at everything have done aboard indian queen chapter eleven successful boat expedition same evening made land from mast head just before sunset four hour later came to anchor off mouth of river bar of have too little water on to permit of passage of shark visit to spot be result of certain information skipper have acquired few day previously from master of palm oil trader hailing from liverpool upon strength of rather hoped to be able to take by surprise especially notorious slaver have long eluded cruiser be now stated upon fairly reliable authority to be somewhere on coast be believed to have entered particular river canvas having be snugly furled boat under command of first lieutenant master boatswain gunner be manned armed dispatched into river whole expedition being of course under command of mr seaton in whose boat went peter christy one of midshipman while young keene midshipman contrived to smuggle down into master boat of course applied for leave to go with expedition being on sick list be peremptorily forbidden even to dream of such thing for morgan surgeon declared that in run down condition be utterly unfit to face risk of exposure to fever laden fog must certainly be encountered in river night be not especially favourable for expedition intended to take ship by surprise for although sky be somewhat cloudy be by mean sufficiently so to obscure very materially light of moon be then in first quarter must set shortly after midnight meanwhile light must facilitate passage of boat across bar after accomplishment of plan be to endeavour to discover position of vessel that be after failing other craft might be in river then ambush boat until moon have gone down gave boat cheer a pulled away watched until vanished in shadowy obscurity inshore after a expected to see nothing more of until daylight watch be piped down going below turned in night however be intensely hot atmosphere of midshipman berth intolerably stuffy therefore slept poorly be up down at interval of about hour through night listening for sound of firing hoping perchance reflection of gun flash on cloud might indicate that boat have found quarry once twice about three o'clock in morning of who like be on qui vive thought caught muffled sound of distant firing coming off to on damp night breeze everlasting thunder of surf on sand mile away be so loud that might easily have be deceived that something important however be happening ashore be evident for about time saw reflection of brilliant glare in sky lasted nearly hour then gradually died down at seven o'clock next morning doubt be set at rest by appearance of two craft slashing brig very smart looking little schooner coming out over bar with shark boat in tow ten minute later rounded to anchored close to now have opportunity to take good look at prize needed second glance to assure that be perfectly superb example of shipbuilder art long low extraordinarily beamy carried spar big enough for craft of twice tonnage upon spread area of canvas made of stare in amazement combined with exquisitely perfect line gave speed enabled to defy pursuit dona inez a brig be named be craft of three hundred eighty six ton register drew only ten foot of water aft while francesca schooner on tonnage of one hundred twenty drew only six foot that have be built for express purpose of slave traffic be apparent at first glance be moreover completely fitted for traffic for have slave deck have manacle meal water on board slave report of mr seaton first lieutenant who presently came aboard be eminently satisfactory expedition have succeeded in locating two ship on previous night before setting of moon have then lain in ambush behind point only two cable length from prey until about two o'clock next morning when with muffled oar have pulled alongside two craft simultaneously boarded without resistance surprised overpowered anchor watch secured crew under hatch having be done prize crew having be placed in charge of vessel remainder of party led by mr seaton have landed captured extensive slave factory occupant of be evidently preparing for reception of large coffle of slave set fire to burning whole place to ground have be accomplished at cost of only two men slightly wounded expedition have thus be completely successful for dona inez be craft capture of have be especial object while have secured in addition second prize have destroyed factory immediately after breakfast captain proceeded to make arrangement with regard to prize first of crew of francesca be transferred to dona inez with crew of latter vessel safely confined in hold then prize crew be strengthened finally brig be placed under command of mr fawcett then captain sent for mr grenvile said be going to prove to by placing in command of francesca that loss of dolores have in wise shaken confidence in remember of course that be on sick list have consulted surgeon relative to proposed arrangement assures that few day at sea will be far better for health than remaining on coast aboard shark duty will be easy for intend to send with jones simpson boatswain carpenter mate who be with in dolores rather stronger crew than have in craft may also have mr keene to keep company will sail in company with brig will be under command of mr fawcett since learn that craft contrary to ordinary usage of slaver be heavily armed be not likely to suffer molestation time on voyage to sierra leone thank sir said be very much obliged to for continued confidence in will find have not be misplaced a to health really think will get well quicker at sea than must by remaining here on coast may have san domingo again a cabin steward sir why yes certainly if like mr grenvile answered captain good naturedly fellow be rather good man believe appears to have taken particularly strong fancy to by way there be one thing omitted to mention mr grenvile be that will have to be own navigator must brig by chance part company for mr freeman will accompany mr fawcett in brig master tell that be very reliable navigator therefore ought not to have difficulty upon score now have better run away turn over to three decker dived down into midshipman berth found shipmate keene there also although really ought to have be on deck pas word for san domingo said to sentry on duty outside a man duly passed word turned to keene said now then young man hurry up get kit ready a fast a please be to come with in francesca exclaimed youth with incredulous delight really mean do grenvile be only having on indeed be not answered skipper have just told that may have think that little real hard work in small vessel will do lot of good there fully agree with added grimly oh hard work be hanged exclaimed lad joyously be not afraid of hard work a very well know dick will be simply glorious to get away from taut discipline of shark for little while to say nothing of possibility of such adventure a last pirate wo have own way time if attempt to meddle with can tell for schooner mount eight long nine carry long eighteen on forecastle say grenvile ca manage to have little cruise on own account skipper must forgive be sure if be lucky enough to take in prize two not to be thought of friend answered severely be to make best of way to sierra leone best of way do understand besides brig be to sail in company fawcett wo stand nonsense even if be disposed to listen to suggestion at moment san domingo came along want mr grenvile asked yes san domingo said get kit of mr keene ready also own a quickly a possible be to go aboard schooner yes massa sartinly hab um ready in nex ' to time answered negro with expansive smile of joy irradiating face p'rhaps hab anoder adventure who can say muttered to be getting well on toward noon when prize having be thoroughly overhauled such deficiency a be discovered made good from store of shark mr fawcett formally took over own respective command three craft weighed made sail in company confess felt in exceedingly buoyant spirit pain of wound be completely forgotten a with young keene beside stumped fore aft on short quarter deck of schooner keenly compared behaviour with of bigger companion sea breeze be piping up strong there be enough sea running to render advantage in favour of two brig yet notwithstanding be able to spare shark topgallant sail still keep pace with good a be schooner dona inez be better so much better indeed that in order to avoid running away from fawcett be obliged not only to furl topgallant sail also to take single reef in topsail while even then brig persisted in creeping ahead have to be constantly checked by keeping weather leach of topsail shiver be undoubtedly wonderful craft doubtless fawcett be extremely proud of fear that poor captain bentinck felt somewhat disgusted at indifferent figure that shark be cutting compared with other two craft for quite unexpectedly made signal to part company fired gun went in stay preparatory to bearing away on southerly course few minute later san domingo emerged from companion with news that luncheon be ready very well said then to simpson who have charge of deck keep eye on commodore mr simpson if must signal let know by way might set topgallant sail think will bear ay ay sir answered simpson with grin at mr have given away aloft there two hand loose to'ga'nt sail cast off clewlines buntlines see ready to sheet home hoist away followed by keene dived through companion descended ladder be in reality staircase entered little vessel main cabin be first time that keene have be below a passed through doorway giving access to apartment looked round began to understand meaning of negro ecstatic grin a stood aside to permit to enter cabin be very roomy one for so small vessel being about fifteen foot long about same width at fore end tapering away aft of course in accordance with shape of vessel be not however size of cabin so much that arrested attention a general effect of extreme elegance apartment presented man who be responsible for fitting up must have be individual of distinctly sybaritic taste to begin with locker ran fore aft on side be luxuriously soft comfortable to sit upon be upholstered in rich crimson velvet with thickly padded back of same material carried high enough to afford soft cushion for back of head of sitter to rest upon be wide enough to form most comfortable couch be evidently intended to serve purpose for at end be furnished with great pile of richly embroidered silken cushion lining of cabin above couch locker be of bird eye maple highly polished divided up into panel by pilaster of polished satinwood centre of panel being occupied by large circular port scuttle of very thick clear glass set in stout gun metal double frame so arranged that port must be opened for admission of air above port handsome rod of polished brass with ornamented end be screwed to panelling from rod depended miniature curtain of crimson velvet fringed with bullion must be drawn when necessary to exclude too ardent ray of sun on one side of door in fore bulkhead stood very handsome sideboard of polished satinwood surmounted by mirror in massive gilt frame worked into semblance of ship cable on other stood equally handsome bookcase well filled with a afterwards ascertained beautifully bound book romance poem like in spanish language after bulkhead be adorned with very fine trophy in form of many rayed star composed of weapon such a sword pistol dagger ax skylight be very large occupying nearly area of part of deck be over cabin in centre of hung large exceedingly handsome lamp of solid silver suspended by massive chain of same metal while one end of skylight be occupied by barometer hung in gimbal other by tell tale compass elegant little apartment naturally demanded that appointment must correspond so did for table afterwards found to be made of solid walnut polished to brilliance of mirror be covered with immaculate tablecloth of snowy damask upon glittered table equipage of solid silver cut glass dainty porcelain with handsome silver centrepiece filled with recently cut flower apparently gathered no later than previous day in flower clad forest on margin of river have just left gasped with amazement a well might at sight of little interior glowing sparkling with evidence of almost palatial luxury seated ourselves in silence for word completely failed although be not very easy matter to reduce british midshipman to condition of speechless astonishment indeed did long remain in abnormal state for after gazing about for moment with open mouth protruding eye keene burst out with here san domingo black villain stand there grinning until corner of mouth reach back under ear come forward explain where did find thing eh massa keene protested negro not right dat young gentleum must call deir faithful servant black willain after hab work hard to make um conf'ble keep um bert tidy aboard dat dirty old shark mo '

have ham tongue little of thanks answered jack will take great deal of if mind for somehow have managed to find enormous appetite having finished meal went on deck again found that during absence below breeze have moderated very considerably to extent indeed that simpson have just sent hand aloft to loose royal main topmast staysail to cast loose gaff topsail be moved thereto doubt by fact that brig have fallen somewhat astern of be also making sail have acquired habit of regarding shark a decidedly fast ship manner in dona inez own little schooner slid through water be revelation to especially when wind fell quite light a did toward close of afternoon then indeed when speed have dwindled to about four knot canvas collapsed at roll of vessel for lack of wind to fill be able to hold own with brig while still later when wind have fallen so light that horizon have become invisible oil smooth surface of ocean showed scarcely wrinkle in satin smooth fold to indicate that there be still faint movement of atmosphere gradually drew ahead of consort at rate of about knot per hour even contrived to retain command of little barkie keep head pointed right way when brig have begun to box compass continued calm until shortly after midnight night when faint breathing came creeping up to from eastward to spread studding sail hour later be bowling merrily along at speed of nine knot wind not only held through night freshened with sunrise throughout day succeeding night speed never fell below eleven knot while for hour so when breezed up especially strong log showed that be doing close upon fourteen with dawn of third day after have parted company with shark found about two mile distant from consort vessel steering to north westward with wind well over starboard quarter starboard studding sail set wind be blowing moderate breeze there be long very regular sea running be doing ten knot very comfortably little francesca sliding over long liquid hill down into broad valley a easily buoyantly a sea gull in schooner be showing rag must spread brig have royal stowed in order that might not run away from at seven o'clock san domingo entered cabin with cup of chocolate informed a to state of weather whereabouts of brig so on intimated that be time for to turn out if wished to indulge in usual luxury of salt water bath under head pump accordingly tumbled out going on deck made way forward along heaving plank into eye of little vessel be just about to place under clear sparkling stream of salt water gushed from spout of pump when sound of loud snap overhead caused to look aloft saw that royal halyard have parted that yard be sagging down with own weight sail bellying out with pressure of wind in jones acting boatswain who have charge of deck instantly observed trifling mishap shouted order for sail to be temporarily clewed up for hand to go aloft bend halyard afresh meanwhile proceeded to take bath be giving vigorous towelling afterwards when man who have gone aloft hailed deck with cry of sail ho about two point before starboard beam what doe look like demanded boatswain be tidy sized brigantine schooner sir for can see head of topgallant sail gaff topsail be steerin ' pretty much same way a ourselves by look of very well that will do look alive with royal halyard there want commodore to signal askin ' how long be goin ' to take over job will have ready to sway away in le than minute sir be be rather awk'ard job answered man mr jones shouted be good enough to signal commodore that there be strange sail in northern board will ay ay sir answered jones dived below for signal book be kept in main cabin minute later have temporarily hauled down main topmast staysail to permit clear view of flag be busily exchanging signal with brig meanwhile having dried went below to dress presently heavy footstep sounded on companion ladder bunch of horny knuckle rapped at state room door come in cried a door opened jones poked head in commodore signalled to haul wind p'int sir reported very good mr jones have goodness to do so said boatswain vanished upon returning to deck after completion of toilet found that brig have like ourselves hauled up point set royal with result that be slightly increasing distance from change slight though be in course of two vessel caused stranger gradually to approach other on line converged at very acute angle surmised that fawcett have set royal with twofold object of increasing speed of approach toward stranger of avoiding awakening of suspicion on part of stranger sight of ship with royal stowed in such moderate weather might be likely to arouse by midday have raised stranger sufficiently to enable to see whole of royal just head of topgallant sail from deck while from royal yard whole of canvas be visible down to top half of foresail be therefore in position to pronounce not only that be brigantine also that be slashing big craft probably quite a big a dona inez a afternoon wore on however seemed to be raising higher came at length to conclusion that like have slightly hauled wind thus manifesting distinct if not very strongly marked desire to avoid closer acquaintance with in turn went far to confirm in suspicion have already arisen within mind that be slaver probably from bonny gaboon with cargo of black ivory on board afternoon maintained close watch upon commodore with aid of splendid telescope have found aboard schooner momentarily expecting to make signal must indicate that shared suspicion none came at length dawned upon that be purposely abstaining from holding communication with lest by doing so must strengthen suspicion stranger might be entertaining a to character noticed that at eight bell in afternoon watch again altered course hauling up point without receiving signal from promptly did same that be gradually overhauling chase be evident from fact that be slowly raising while be unable to head reach upon at sunset must see foot of topsail from deck while have not altered bearing from by so much a quarter point since have last hauled wind if in francesca be gaining upon dona inez be doing so in still more marked degree craft being at time last mentioned quite eight mile ahead of about two point on weather bow question now arose in mind whether must endeavour to dodge during night must find exceedingly difficult to do so for there be now good moon in sky affording sufficient light to enable man with keen eye to keep craft at distance from in sight without very much trouble on other hand there be very heavy mass of cloud banking up to windward fast overspreading sky must obscure moon later perhaps for time cut off enough of light to give stranger chance must wish to avail of therefore sent one of keenest sighted men have with up on topsail yard a soon a began to grow dusk with instruction to keep eye on stranger immediately report to must happen to lose sight of for knew from hearsay experience that slaver be a wily a fox be in habit of adopting sort of queer expedient to evade pursuit not content therefore with sending hand aloft to watch stranger maintained almost continuous watch upon from deck with aid of francesca excellent telescope be day night glass meanwhile cloud bank continued steadily to overspread heaven at length obscured moon shutting off so much of light that immediately became difficult in extreme to discern chase longer even with assistance of telescope be not in least surprised when minute two later look out aloft hailed to say that have lost sight of have not must still see through glass although with momentarily increasing difficulty a pall of cloud crept onward across sky ever cutting off more still more of moon light at length moment arrived when also be compelled to admit to myself must no longer see removed telescope from eye for minute two to give strained smarting eyeball rest closed eyelid in order to completely exclude from even such dim uncertain light a still remained then knowing exactly where to look for stranger once more pointed instrument in direction searching horizon closely carefully for smallest blur might betray effort be useless have vanished chapter twelve exciting chase now arose question what have become of chase have simply lost sight of in growing obscurity be still steering same course a when last seen have captain availed of obscurity to put in practice trick in order to give slip brought telescope to bear upon dona inez in hope of gathering from action clue a to whether not still held chase in view be carrying on holding to original course inference to be drawn from be that aboard must still see stranger even a looked string of lantern soared up to peak from position be hidden from chase by intervention of brig head sail when signal be at length complete found a have quite expected that be question a to whether still held stranger in view signal answered in negative by mean of whip from lee lower yard arm keeping lantern quite low in hope that must thus escape observation of chase then got second signal from commodore read steer a at present for one hour then failing further order haul wind to north east signal acknowledged in like manner a first while doing so saw that brig have taken in studding sail hauled wind noted time found to be close upon seven o'clock hour later while keene be below at dinner faint boom of distant gun came floating down open skylight to ear simpson who have charge of deck poked head down through opening to make report commodore signalling again sir snatching signal book from locker upon have be thrown dashed upon deck presently by light of binnacle lamp deciphered signal a follows tack to south east right said answer in studding sail mr simpson then heave about on port tack keep eye on commodore also keep bright look out to windward for sign of chase by time got below again be once more seated at table schooner be in stay immediately afterwards long easy floating gliding movement of vessel running off wind be exchanged for quick violent jerking plunge heavy lee lurch of same craft driven under heavy pressure of canvas into high steep head sea ten minute later be again on deck be just thinkin ' sir of takin ' in to'garns l remarked simpson a joined on weather side of tiny quarter deck where be engaged in futile endeavour to avoid heavy shower of spray be now flying over weather bow a far aft a mainmast be got good deal more than can comfortably carry there be nothin ' to be gained by whippin ' stick out of believe 'd travel quite a fast good deal easier if to'garns l be stowed sir sign of chase yet mr simpson said sir not when looked last there be answered carpenter mischief of be that there be knowin ' where to look for be a much a man can do to make out commodore in murk where be commodore demanded out there dead to wind'ard of about four mile away answered simpson better take in to'garns l have sir continued cocking eye aloft to where in dim light spar must be faintly seen whipping buckling like fishing rod at mad plunge heave of sorely overdriven little vessel that be being overdriven be perfectly evident not only from tremendous quantity of water that be shipping forward at furious dive into head sea from steep angle of deck sloped at inclination of fully forty five degree with lee roll from cataract of green water poured in over lee rail upon such occasion deck indeed to leeward be so flooded that man must have passed along to leeward without imminent risk of being washed overboard yes said at last clew up topgallant sail mr simpson topsail also while be about be right ship be being over pressed believe that what may lose by taking square canvas off will be more than made up to by gain in weatherliness will look up nearly point higher under fore aft canvas only go along very nearly a fast simpson needed second bidding thought a did on matter result proved correct for while there be perceptible diminution in schooner speed due to loss of square canvas looked higher went along much more easily comfortably than have done before now for look at commodore said when have snugged down little vessel took telescope from becket in hung in companion way yes there be dead to windward of driving along a must just make out under main topgallant sail be perfectly dark on board there be sign of slaver must see presumed that have in sight from brig must have heard something from latter for be at time very dark blowing strong condition generally be such that matter of a little a even two three mile might make difference between seeing not seeing stranger eight bell came watch be called jones boatswain relieved simpson latter bidding good night went below explained to jones reason for taking square canvas off ship be graciously pleased to express approval yes sir said believe have done right thing even now little hooker have got that can comfortably carry if be to pile more on to 'd do good only strain to piece open seam fact be mr grenvile that here willow beamy craft ai intended to sail on side bury below sheer strake begin to drag to sag at once be doin ' quite a well a can be reasonably expected in such sea a a be proved by way that be keepin pace with commodore will just take bearin for fun of thing see how much head reach on durin ' next hour saying trotted aft to binnacle very carefully took bearing of brig made to be exactly east south east hour sped with sight sign of chase to cheer then jones went to binnacle to take bearing of dona inez once more boatswain be long time getting bearing to satisfaction for little vessel be leaping plunging most furiously compass card be none too steady in bowl at length stepped back from binnacle with air of triumph exclaiming there mr grenvile what d 'ye make of sir whereupon in turn stepped up to binnacle with equal care took bearing make east by south half south said east by south half south be answered jones exultantly mean sir that have head reached on brig to extent of p'int within last hour too in breeze sea so heavy that brig ought to walk away from hand over hand well must have believed if have seen seein ' be believin ' have heard say more than that continued taking up glass levelling at dona inez be blest if believe a be weatherin on too take glass mr grenvile tell whether think a have drawed up bit closer to commodore since eight bell struck to humour fellow took telescope a requested certainly when got brig focused in lens image appeared to be more distinct also perceptibly larger than have be when last looked at hour sped on without change of sort except when at length midnight arrived there be longer room to doubt that since have taken in square canvas thus relieved overdriven little hooker have steadily if somewhat slowly head reached weathered upon commodore then a there seemed to be prospect of further news from consort night went below turned in leaving instruction be to be called at once without fail must anything occur to render necessary presence on deck must commodore exhibit further signal in le than five minute be fast asleep be awakened next morning by loud knocking of steward at state room door six bell mistah grenvile sah here be coffee announced san domingo a stood balancing cup saucer in hand swaying to still lively movement of schooner although struck at once that be not nearly so lively in motion a have be when turned in at midnight raised in bunk peered through closed scuttle be let into side of ship little craft be still lying over far enough to cause sea to wash up over glass obscure view occasionally there be nevertheless interval of quite long enough duration to enable to note that morning be overcast lowering with decided thundery look in sky that sea have gone down very considerably while have be lying asleep well san domingo said be there sign of chase where be commodore de chase sah be about four mile to wind'ard ob bearin ' about point abaft de beam de commodore be 'bout mile half astern of astern of commodore astern of did say exclaimed incredulously yes sah answered black quite unmoved dead astern ob hab weadered head reached on durin ' de night have made signal since came below asked not dat be aware ob answered fellow if massa wish will go on deck ask mistah simpson never mind said doubt mr simpson must have called have such be case what canvas be under plain sail to de royal sah very well that will do said taking cup draining find bath towel san domingo then may go minute later be on deck still in sleeping rig looking about weather be pretty much a have judged to be from glimpse have caught through state room port a san domingo have said dona inez be about mile half so dead astern of that two mast be in one while in precise position negro have indicated there lay fine spanking brigantine thrashing along under perfect cloud of canvas to royal by way appeared to have a much hoist nearly a much canvas on a topsail nothing to report sir said simpson coming up to a emerged from companion made out chase about two bell morning did not call sir a showed sign of shiftin ' helm commodore have said word night reckon will be bit surprised when see where be to tell truth simpson be bit surprised myself said be wonderful little craft to have beaten inez a have done too in strong breeze turning away went forward took usual salt water bath now meditated a took up position beneath spout of head pump signed to man in charge to get to work rule in chasing when one be abreast to leeward of chase be to tack like to tack without instruction from superior officer because know what plan may be may have scheme of own for circumventing of friend yonder if hear anything from by time be ready to go below dress will just take small liberty of asking for instruction for of course brigantine be quite aware by time that brig be running in couple therefore there need be further squeamishness on part a to interchange of signal between brig douche at end walked aft again pausing at head of companion ladder said to simpson mr simpson be good enough to get out flag carpenter be balancing upon dancing deck a spoke with telescope at eye looking at brig have got so far in speech when interrupted with exclamation signal from commodore sir what be asked read out flag to said right acknowledge dived below into cabin where at once turned up signal in code book consisted of one word tack hastily closing book again dashed up companion ladder shouted to simpson mr simpson 'bout ship at once if please when be round upon other tack have coiled down let men clear away long gun on forecastle get up few round of ammunition may perhaps get chance to have slap at fellow little later ay ay sir hand 'bout ship roared simpson a descended again to state room to dress heard give order to down helm next moment little hooker rose to even keel with terrific slatting of canvas whipping of relaxed sheet a came head to wind then after vicious plunge two head on into long sea paid off on opposite tack heeled over to port shivering slatting of canvas with accompanying tremor of hull ceased long easy floating plunge soaring be resumed a again settled easily into stride long gun ready sir reported simpson when at length stepped out on deck fully dressed will try shot too far off said must not get anywhere near still yes may waste charge just by way of letting fellow understand that be in earnest give muzzle good elevation so aim that may see that want to pitch shot across forefoot at same time let see colour of bunting shot be accordingly fired ensign hoisted so far a former be concerned might a well have saved powder for ball although very well aimed fell long way short have effect of causing to show colour proved to be french fired more for there be nothing to be gained by wasting ammunition be quite clear that stranger have intention of heaving to until absolutely compelled to do so held on therefore uneventfully until be fairly in brigantine wake then tacked again without waiting for order from commodore be by time eight o'clock watch be called boatswain came aft to relieve simpson san domingo appeared with announcement that breakfast be ready before going below however ordered young keene to bring up sextant with very carefully measured angle between brigantine main topmast head top of transom when have secured clamped instrument laid aside for reference later then instructed jones to pick out best helmsman must find in watch send aft to tiller explaining reason for so doing after performance of last night said think need have fear a to ability to overhaul brigantine want to do more than want not only to overhaul also to eat out to windward of so cutting off escape in direction to accomplish thus bring sooner to action if mean to fight must have thoroughly good man at tiller one who will let go along clean full yet at same time coax humour little barkie inch to windward that can yes sir perfectly understands answered boatswain know exactly what want mr grenvile have got very man for job will see to sir took tiller rope out of hand of man who be steering giving instruction to send bill bateman aft found young keene in high feather at prospect of tussle with so formidable opponent a brigantine promised to be dispatched breakfast in double quick time after lighthearted companion got out pistol proceeded to clean load carefully in anticipation of moment when might be needed when be done went forward to supervise personally sharpening of sword by armourer meanwhile took sextant on deck have squint through at chase be satisfactory to find that be overhauling rapidly then having secured observation of sun for determination of longitude gave order to clear for action operation in case of so small hooker a francesca be very simple matter have just completed preparation comfortably when jones called attention to fact that commodore be in stay presently be round on other tack heading well up for so far have gained on that when at length crossed hawse there be quite two mile of clear water between commented upon singular fact to jones remembering that when parted company with shark dona inez be distinctly better sailer of two while now be beating in own weather be not very difficult to understand sir answered jones fact be that then did know here little beauty how to get best out of while now doe be that there be about a must not otherwise understand phenomenon be obliged to accept explanation be satisfied with six bell arrived by time commodore be once more in wake having tacked again while have clawed out about mile to windward of chase drawn so close to determined to try effect of shot from long eighteen upon gun be accordingly reloaded carefully trained schooner luffed sufficiently to bring gun to bear clear of head gear at proper moment gunner who be squinting along sight gave order to fire linstock be applied gun exploded shaking little vessel to keel a helm be put up to keep away again eye be strained to note effect of shot struck water fair true close astern of chase without doing damage so far a must see be soon apparent that have fallen too close to to be pleasant for next moment fore rigging be alive with men who swarmed up on to yard a put helm up kept away upon south westerly course with wind well over port quarter that skipper be taut hand who kept men well up to mark be immediately afterwards evidenced by wonderful man o ' war like rapidity with rigged out studding sail boom set whole cloud of studding sail on port side up helm keep away shouted a saw what brigantine be at away aloft there out boom get larboard stu'nbeails upon a quick a please lad steady a go to man at helm how be head sou west by west half west sir answered man keep at said course be then steering be about point higher than of brigantine by following hoped to drop into wake again in due time without losing ground be now once more running off wind quick jerky motion of schooner have given place to series of long easy buoyant floating movement much more conducive to accurate shooting than have preceded therefore resolved to try effect of at least one more shot from long gun especially a became apparent that brig have at last found upon best point of sailing be gradually creeping up to while be anxious to have to myself honour glory of bringing brigantine to action without assistance of commodore therefore gave order to reload forecastle gun to aim high with object of disabling chase aloft so clipping wing gun be accordingly made ready at proper moment fired gunner waiting until surge have swept under little vessel be just settling into trough in rear of with stern down in hollow bow pointing skyward again came flash jarring concussion jet of white smoke moment later young keene who in excitement have scrambled half way up fore rigging to note effect of shot better gave cheer of exultation hurrah yelled bravo thompson well shot clean through topsail near shave of clipping topmast out of presently fired again time cutting royal stunsail sheet setting sail violently flapping with result that have to be taken in before sheet must be spliced be not to be allowed to have matter own way very much longer for while be reloading long gun jet of flame followed by puff of white smoke like little wad of white cotton wool suddenly leaped from brigantine stern port pound shot came whistling overhead neatly bringing down fore topgallant mast with attached on way be now in very pretty pickle forward for be wing be clipped much more effectually than have clipped of chase now too commodore came romping up to hand over hand be however not yet beaten by long way while good strong gang be at once sent aloft to clear away wreck on deck kept up brisk persistent fire upon chase with long gun whether be that thompson hand have lost cunning that flapping banging of wreckage overhead disconcerted spoiled aim certain be that made more hit just then by time that wreckage have be cleared away everything made snug aloft once more commodore have forged ahead of have begun to open fire brigantine returning fire briskly from one stern port while peppered from other presently further misfortune time very serious one overtook happening that fired at same instant while shot clipped off brigantine topmast studding sail boom like carrot close in by boom iron shot passed through topsail so severely wounding topmast on way that before anything must be done to save spar snapped short off about way up length there be again hampered with further lot of wreckage to clear away meanwhile commodore profiting by damage that have inflicted upon brigantine rapidly overhauled two craft maintained brisk fire upon other until dona inez having ranged up alongside chase took in studding sail went at hammer tongs broadside to broadside continued until brig fore topmast having be shot away broached to ran foul of brigantine to promptly made fast by mean of grappling iron next moment cessation of gun fire flashing of cutlas blade in sun popping of pistol told that boarder be at work avast there with long gun cried boarder stand by mr keene have goodness to take charge stand by halyard men be ready to settle away everything fore aft a range alongside stand by also with grappling iron mr keene will range up on brigantine port side oh dick might let go with old chap have got sword sharpened pistol ready expressly for purpose of boarding pleaded jack ca possibly dear boy answered somebody must look after schooner be that somebody so please say more about now lad continued must make short work of business for if craft lie alongside other for ten minute in sea will grind other to piece will go to bottom together so strike strike hard moment that find yourselves on enemy deck mr jones tell off six men to remain in schooner with mr keene five minute later be within cable length of brigantine on deck of fierce stubborn conflict be still raging appeared to that commodore party be finding work cut out to avoid being driven back on deck of own ship settle away fore aft cried main fore halyard peak throat jib halyard let go man downhauls then muster in waist starboard side steady jack starboard may steady so now stand by grapnel heave hurrah lad follow take care that none of drop between two hull next instant be leaping scrambling pell mell in over bulwark of brigantine leaping down on deck be already slippery with blood cumbered with killed wounded fortunately by boarding on brigantine port side a did took crew in rear so greatly disconcerted while appearance imparted fresh courage to commodore party that after vainly striving to stand against for nearly minute flung down weapon cried for quarter while remainder made clean bolt of forward darted down fore scuttle promptly closed upon chapter thirteen sierra leone brigantine be ours first thought being for safety of three of craft at once gave order for grappling iron to be cast loose for brig schooner to haul off to safe distance then looking round deck of brigantine noticed freeman acting master of dona inez away aft with coat off one of own men binding up wounded arm of officer hastened aft not seriously hurt freeman hope said hullo grenvile that returned thanks rather painful not very serious hope by jove frenchman fought stubbornly if have not come up in very nick of time must have gone pretty badly with can tell seem to have come off scot free by look of yes be right thanks not scratch said where be mr fawcett see aboard here no answered freeman poor chap be below aboard brig be afraid be bad job with last broadside that craft fired into be at pretty close quarter a perhaps noticed skipper be very severely wounded by large splinter abdomen torn open hamilton assistant surgeon be greatly afraid that will go badly with by jove said be awfully sorry to hear must see do think really know answered freeman hamilton be man of whom must ask that question best plan think will be to go aboard a soon a possible meanwhile suppose will take charge make necessary arrangement certainly said of course will take command of brig keene must take command here with just enough men to enable to handle ship by by have full cargo of slave aboard perceive there must be possible doubt a to last for there be thin bluish white vapour of steam curling up through grating closed hatchway effluvium emanating from be almost unendurable continued have better get back aboard brig set crew to work to repair damage aloft a quickly a possible other damage must remain until arrive at sierra leone will do same a soon a have seen prisoner properly secured own damage be slight a soon a have put matter in train aboard schooner will send simpson party aboard here to see to thing while go aboard to hear what hamilton have to say will have to use brigantine boat expect to get back to own craft have not left enough hand with keene to enable to send boat arrangement duly carried out owing to one delay be nearly three o'clock afternoon when be able to pay promised visit to brig by time hamilton have coopered up most serious case be able to spare moment ah grenvile exclaimed a descended into brig cabin by way be almost a sumptuously arranged a of francesca medico be then using a surgery be glad to see to learn that need of delicate attention skipper be very anxious to see poor chap must not signal for to come aboard a freeman told that intended coming a soon a possible that in meantime have hand pretty full looking after thing in general affair have be a sharp thing of kind a have ever known think how be now hamilton do think can see without detriment to asked certainly if be not asleep a to will investigate be reply will not harm to see continued hamilton on contrary may do good for fancy that wish to arrange certain matter with when have done that will perhaps be able to compose give chance not that think there be much hope for tell candidly for pity sake let manner to betray fact that be taking very serious view of case if can get ashore into hospital alive may perhaps pull round so pray shove ahead with repair a fast a possible carry on like fury when fill away again trust said if carrying on ' will get ashore alive will do now perhaps have better ascertain whether can see not for sooner be free again to look after matter sooner will be able to make start without further loss of time hamilton tiptoed to door of skipper state room having very gently turned handle looked in beckoned to enter mr grenvile to see sir said surgeon ushering in ah mr grenvile come in be glad to see said poor fellow extending hand to make room for yourself on sofa locker there never mind clothes pitch down anywhere will never want again oh know sir said affecting to misunderstand a took garment one by one hung upon hook screwed to bulkhead coat for instance said holding up will clean very well must think waistcoat trouser well be afraid will need new one for seem to be past repairing misunderstand grenvile said never mind will not talk about just now have other more important matter wish to speak about first of a to loss fear have be very heavy have not sir said on contrary be very light indeed compared with of enemy have lost only five killed eleven wounded case being most serious of latter hamilton tell that hope to have hand of up a hearty a ever within month doe doe really say that god be thanked for good news exclaimed poor fellow with more energy than must have expected from man presenting such ghastly appearance a did for cheek be sunken white a chalk lip be quite blue fact be grenvile continued that want to die yet if can help not that be not prepared to die if be god will to take for thanks be to be ready to go at moment if call must come a men must be especially soldier sailor who be peculiarly liable to receive summons at moment notice no be not that must like to live little longer if might be so for for many reason chief of be have wife at home whose whose heart dear fellow be getting little excited saw that of course must be bad for so cut in never fear sir exclaimed cheerily will ride squall out right have not doubt of must not judge by present feeling know just now be exhausted with loss of blood pain of wound intend to carry on get ashore in hospital within next three day please god once be out of close cabin in nice airy ward with proper nurse to look after will begin to pull round in way will astonish be in danger sir hamilton told so must think ought to know be useless to lie unless be done boldly inwardly prayed that pious fraud might be forgiven well well hope so poor fellow gasped at event will try to hold on until arrive then perhaps may get step if got that get step sir cut in again of course will get only wish be half a certain of getting ten thousand year that uncle have promised to leave when dy get step why sir be a good a in pocket already think so asked doubtfully wish must feel a sure of a do boy ay wish must feel a sure of a be that will get commission for get will if anything can say will help to that reminds grenvile wish to say how perfectly satisfied highly pleased have be with conduct gallantry in affair handled schooner with very best of judgment indeed for fellow might have slipped away from altogether will take care to make quite clear to commodore in report to thanked very heartily for exceedingly kind intention toward then passed on to discussion of certain other matter with detail of need not weary reader when left hour later hamilton assured that patient although exhausted with long talk be none worse rather better for visit have taken out of diverted thought into more cheerful channel have done good must play up step ' business to very last ounce concluded when went on deck upon leaving poor fawcett be gratified to find that making good of damage aboard brig be progressing apace that freeman must be ready to make sail about sunset while aboard prize be ataunto again with damaged sail unbent sent down fresh one bent in place schooner also have sent up rigged new topmast set up rigging got yard across topsail set with topgallant sail royal ready for sheeting home therefore at once proceeded on board own little hooker packed master jack off bag baggage to take charge of prize to young gentleman ineffable pride delight then a soon a be ready made sail in company carrying on day night arrived at destination without further adventure early in afternoon of third day after engagement with slaver have of course during passage made frequent enquiry day a to progress of poor fawcett best news that must give be that while seemed to be worse be certainly no better a soon therefore a anchor be down went alongside brig having dispatched messenger ashore in schooner gig with message to hospital authority proceeded with difficult delicate job of conveying invalid ashore to facilitate carpenter of brig have under hamilton supervision prepared light strong framework somewhat of nature of cot with stout rope sling attached thereto when be ready for patient removal be placed on cabin table six stout fellow then entered state room carefully lifting wounded man bed out of bunk gently carried into main cabin laid just a be on cot stretcher fortunately accomplished without seriously discomposing patient surgeon then administered soothing draught effect of be to put sufferer to sleep in few minute hamilton having foreseen that must be practically impossible to convey stretcher burden up on deck by way of companion ladder without injury to patient have caused plank to be removed from fore bulkhead thus making passage into main hold through now carried stretcher laying gently down on slave deck immediately beneath main hatch then sling of concern be hooked on to tackle have be lowered down hatchway patient be next not only hoisted up through hatchway also slung over side lowered down into stern sheet of boat waiting alongside to receive rest be easy pulled ashore lifted burden still on stretcher out of boat carried up to hospital where be at once placed in bed have be made ready to receive without awaking so that when at length opened eye be to find comfortably settled in fine light airy ward with one of hospital surgeon re dressing wound change did immediate good before left building have satisfaction of learning that there be possibility of recovery although very little likelihood that must ever be fit for active service again meanwhile rest of wounded rather such of a be deemed advisable to place in hospital have also be taken ashore be free to attend to other matter be not necessary to describe in detail conduct of business found must be necessary for to transact suffice to say have most satisfactory interview with commodore of station at end of complimented very highly upon what be pleased to designate a sound judgment great gallantry with have played part not only in capture of brigantine also in affair of indian queen a crowning mark of approval presented with acting order a lieutenant with assurance might trust to to see confirmed emboldened by favourable reception on part of great man ventured to hint believed poor fawcett recovery must be greatly hastened if must be reasonably assured of getting promotion to old fellow very kindly replied leave that to lad leave to be not so very old yet be not able to remember how youngster feel in matter of promotion to sympathise with will probably be seeing mr fawcett to day venture to hope that visit will do more good than doctor in hospital come dine with to night want to hear story of indian queen affair in little more detail there be other matter upon may have something to say to bring shipmate what did say name be keene ah yes bring mr keene with full of elation at good news felt have to communicate to fawcett hurried to hospital found to regret that be not quite so well having exhibited symptom of relapse doctor therefore seemed at first somewhat disinclined to let see upon explaining to have little bit of very good news to communicate said that of course make great difference yes may see for five minute suppose will be long enough to communicate good news then come away again know way up look in here on return let know result of interview went up found poor fellow looking very haggard ill brightened up somewhat upon entrance perhaps read good news in jubilant expression well what be grenvile said look a though have something good to tell have said pretending not to notice altered look have although perhaps be not acting quite fairly by commodore in forestalling be coming to see sir although did not absolutely state a much in so many word have not slightest doubt that intends to give step have given acting order therefore can not in common fairness withhold promotion from naturally must not take into confidence categorically state intention toward before mentioning matter to feel a certain that will get step a do that be at moment sitting by bedside well that be good news indeed thank for so promptly bringing to exclaimed invalid must not forget to congratulate grenvile upon good luck tell plainly think fully deserve although acting order be excellent thing in way will have to pas before can get confirmed know have served full time at sea yet yes said completed last month be rather awkward about having to pas though fear there be very little likelihood of being able to go for examination here be a may be returned lieutenant anyhow can not get away from here just yet may be say will may be that opportunity may occur before leave how did commodore treat did seem fairly favourably disposed to yes indeed said fairly favourably ' hardly describes manner to must have spoken of a very favourably ' well be right glad to hear congratulate most heartily say that old boy be coming to see now understand boy if can put in good word for without shoving in bow first knocking old gentleman eye out with flying jib boom will worthy fellow be now quite different man from what have be when entered room few minute earlier therefore thought favourable opportunity to top boom haul off so thanking very sincerely for kind intention in favour shook hand bade good day promising to look in again upon on morrow keene duly dined with commodore that evening when cloth have be removed servant have retired old gentleman said well mr grenvile called upon friend fawcett afternoon have fairly long chat with in spite of doctor poor fellow will never be of further use afloat be afraid may yet do good service ashore if fellow can patch up sufficiently to enable to go home think will yes think will be very much better when left than when arrived old boy eye twinkled good humouredly be wonderful continued what little promotion will do for man in condition talking of promotion mentioned to that have given acting order at seemed greatly pleased said several thing about young gentleman will not repeat be very pleased to hear since go to confirm good opinion of have already formed reminded that before acting order can be confirmed must pas examination now do feel to be in trim to face examiner at moment yes sir said provided of course that try to bother with catch question ' of kind have real bearing upon one practical capability have worked fairly hard from moment when first entered service character will bear investigation be pretty good seaman believe mr teasdale master aboard shark be good enough to report to sk to captain bentinck only other day that be trustworthy navigator good enough to take ship across atlantic for instance without assistance asked old gentleman yes sir said must not hesitate to take ship anywhere if required good exclaimed commodore like confident way of speaking like to see young fellow who belief in well well will see will see then asked to relate to whole story of loss of dolores of indian queen incident from clew to earing a put told complete yarn a sat cross legged in low lounging chair with cheroot stuck in corner of mouth listening nodding head from time to time frequently breaking in with question upon point wished to have more fully explained also put master jack pretty completely through facing so that when at length rose to go have acquired very fair amount of information relating to mixed commission sat few day later to adjudicate upon prize with result that three be duly condemned thus became entitled to very nice little sum of prize money for there be not only value of three craft also head money upon brigantine cargo of slave upon declaration of judgment by court three vessel be promptly advertised for sale by auction brought to hammer three week later a be well known that three be exceptionally fast craft competition for possession be expected to be particularly brisk event justified expectation for upon day appointed for sale attendance be record one bidding remarkably spirited to extent indeed be case that many of knowing one present hazarded confident conviction that of bidder present must probably be found if truth about must be ascertained to be secret agent of slaver that vessel must at very distant date be found to be employed again in former trade brig be first craft offered for sale after very spirited competition be ultimately knocked down to jew marine store dealer at very handsome figure then followed brigantine also realised exceedingly satisfactory price with disposal of craft competition slackened very considerably be not to be wondered at for schooner although smart little craft be not nearly so valuable especially from slave trader point of view a of others yet when be at length knocked down went for full value on whole party most intimately concerned have reason to be very well satisfied with total result of sale be not until next morning that fact be allowed to leak out that francesca have be purchased into service meanwhile have practically nothing to do therefore spent most of time in study preparing for examination so might be ready to avail myself of first opportunity to pas must present filled in gap by visiting fawcett at hospital be pleased to find since cheering visit of commodore have be making very satisfactory progress be on afternoon of day succeeding sale of prize that commodore sent for well said when presented suppose be beginning to feel rather tired of kicking heel about ashore here be not yes sir said must confess that be especially now that mr fawcett seems to be progressing so satisfactorily toward convalescence have hoped that shark must have be in ere for although have not be altogether wasting time feel that be not earning pay moreover prefer more active life than be leading here quite right young man quite right approved commodore nothing like active service for ambitious young fellow like understand that have be working up for examination lately well to be quite candid with think chance of passing here be very bright not because consider unfit to pas mind because may be time before opportunity offer be misfortune perhaps may be remedied have heard suppose that schooner have be purchased into service yes sir have said alert in moment for hoped that abrupt reference to transaction boded good for be exceedingly glad to hear went on for be very smart handy little vessel may be made exceedingly useful in many way so thought therefore bought remarked old gentleman be original intention to have made tender to shark in capacity must no doubt have proved a say exceedingly useful may further tell subject to captain bentinck approval intended to have put in command of certain news have reached morning have altered plan concerning at event for present instead of making tender to shark now propose to send across to west indie with dispatch of utmost importance will therefore be so good a to proceed on board forthwith take command give store thorough overhaul report to what deficiency if require to be made good in order to fit for voyage across atlantic have issued instruction for former crew to be turned over to from depot ship will be a well perhaps for to take over dozen extra hand from late prize crew of brig must like to be able to give mr freeman a master ca spare so will have to be own navigator by way what sort of navigator be keene oh said laughingly can fudge day work a well a most people sir ah said old gentleman wonder whether boy will ever be brought to understand that fudging ' be good except to bamboozle master how must of manage if by chance fell to to take ship into port must only fudge ' day work well will take with hark ye lad for own sake must make stick to work do properly so that may be ready for emergency may happen to come along come dine with to night bring young monkey with will talk to like dutch uncle see if ca stir up to sense of responsibility one word more lad opportunity to pas may occur while be over yonder if doe very strongly advise to seize be assured will sir exclaimed oh sir really know how to express gratitude to for giving such splendid there there never mind about boy interrupted old fellow hurriedly know that must say so there be need for to repeat a to gratitude can best show that by proving worthy of trust be putting in a have doubt will now run along get aboard ship sooner can report ready for sea better will be pleased with forget to night seven sharp be probably most elated young man on west coast afternoon a hurried from commodore presence made way aboard sweet little francesca where found whole of former crew keene included already installed hullo grenvile what be meaning of be enquiry a went up vessel low side passed through gangway what be in wind here have be turned over at moment notice there be already rumour floating about sail to night said be not quite so bad a mean that be bound to west indie at earliest possible moment also mean jack villain have received strict order from commodore to work down until be a fine a sharp a needle will hear more about to night lad when go to dine with so stand by look out for squall west indie hooray cried jack land of beauty romance of solitary cay with snug little harbour of sheltering slashing pirate schooner patiently waiting for to go cut out land of fair woman hospitable men land of sugar plantation lovely flower delicious fruit land of of disastrous hurricane furious thunderstorm yellow fever poisonous reptile horrible mystery of voodoo worship so on so on cut in oh be hanged retorted jack recklessly be precious sight better than pestilential west coast at event say what will a to work be right care how hard work in reason dick know that have be atrociously lazy beggar always more ready to skylark than to do anything useful be going to turn over new leaf now be indeed need look incredulous have wasted time enough intend now to buckle to make useful commodore may jacket ' a much a plea to night know deserve will say nothing just promise to be good boy in future be jolly kind hearted old chap care who hears say so well done jack said have not heard talk so much in earnest for long time joking aside be very glad indeed old fellow to hear that be going to turn over new leaf a very truly say have wasted time enough moment have arrived when if wish to make headway in profession a suppose do must begin to take life seriously realise that be not sent into world merely to skylark although skylarking within reasonable limit at proper time be possibly harmless enough amusement chapter fourteen pirate brig again duly dined with commodore night be able to promise that must have complete requisition before noon next day at expressed much pleased after dinner when cloth have be drawn servant have retired dear old gentleman gave very long serious talking to did both great deal of good for at least jack too believe felt profoundly grateful be pair of very sober lad when at length bade good night made best of way aboard saucy little francesca jack got to work at daylight next morning by dint of really hard labour be not only able to keep promise of previous night to commodore to do rather better for be barely eleven o'clock when entered office handed requisition read very carefully through from beginning to end asked if felt quite certain that embodied whole of requirement upon replying be at once signed bidding to be off at once to get executed then to report to saw that be very anxious for to get away a quickly a possible therefore went straight from to various people concerned badgered so unmercifully that bulk of requirement be alongside that same evening while by breakfast time on following morning last boatload have come off felt free to go ashore leaving jack in charge report ready for sea be at office even before commodore that morning expressed a being much gratified at expedition with have completed preparation then unlocked desk extracting two packet therefrom said a handed to there be written instruction there be dispatch charge to take utmost care of guard with life if necessary for be of most vital importance so important indeed be that tell frankly must not feel justified in entrusting to so youthful officer a have anybody else must send have not therefore can not help have confidence that will do very utmost to carry out instruction in entirety be that proceed to sea forthwith make best of way to kingston in jamaica carrying on night day pausing for nothing nothing mind for be matter in hour ay even minute be of importance if must happen to be attacked must of course fight not otherwise remember if there must be prospect of being captured wait until last possible moment until chance of escape be gone then sink packet remember must on account be allowed to fall into hand of enemy upon arrival at kingston be at once to make way to admiral let hour be what will day night place packet in own hand there need say more now for will find matter fully set out in written instruction now good bye boy god speed safely to destination know not what may lie before on other side whether will ever meet again in world remember that in will always find friend ready to help to best of ability who will always be glad to hear of welfare good bye lad god bless with hearty grip of honest old hand dismissed hour later be under way beating out to sea showing rag that must stagger under toward belt of calm separated sea breeze from trade wind be blowing briskly in offing so profoundly impressed be with urgency of matter have be entrusted to that when at length shot into calm belt rather than lose time by waiting for trade wind to work way inshore to spot where be lying ordered out sweep turning little hooker nose to westward swept out until caught true breeze then be out studding sail to windward away went again at racing speed luckily nothing have be done by government people to spoil little beauty sailing quality be precisely a have be when engaged in original nefarious trade except slave deck have be taken out of long before sundown have run african coast clean out of sight to joy of hand fore aft have one adventure if indeed must be called such on passage across atlantic occurred on eighth day out from sierra leone up to then have sighted nothing have have very fine passage trade wind blowing fresh enough time to enable to maintain average speed of nine knot throughout passage on day of be now speaking about six bell in afternoon watch sighted large sail ahead ten minute later following in wake of first be of course hull down when first sighted broad on port bow standing to northward close hauled on starboard tack a be carrying on heavily be travelling fast rapidly rose other then became evident that second craft very fine handsome brig be in pursuit of other be full rigged ship apparently british west indiaman surmise of ours a to nationality of leading ship be soon confirmed for a rushed rapidly down toward two hoisted colour in response to immediately displayed british ensign following up by hoisting series of signal to mizzen royal mast head when completed read stranger astern suspected pirate here be pretty business indeed very nice question for to decide on spur of moment what be duty under circumstance on one hand here be british merchantman doubtless carrying very valuable cargo in imminent danger of being captured plundered possibly crew massacred for brig be overhauling indiaman hand over hand while on other be explicit emphatic instruction of commodore to pause for nothing be certain that unless interfered indiaman must be captured instinct within rose up in protest against idea of leaving to fate while word of commodore be if must happen to be attacked fight not otherwise reflected for moment two then decided upon course of action if went on a be going must pas very close to indiaman if shifted helm about point to southward must pas quite close to brig therefore determined to make very slight deviation from course see what must happen must not hope to divert brig from chase of so valuable prize a ship be just possible that might by opening fire on pursuer be lucky enough to bring down spar otherwise damage sufficiently to afford indiaman chance to escape therefore ordered helm to be shifted gave instruction for crew to go to quarter to double broadside battery to open fire on brig with long eighteen moment that must come within range that moment be not long deferred presently thompson gunner shouted think can about reach now sir then fire a soon a be ready replied aim at spar be far more important to shoot away topmast than to hull fellow ay ay sir answered thompson saw stoop behind gun directing gun crew with hand a squinted along sight of weapon second two a schooner rose over back of swell fired aim be splendid one elevation be scarcely sufficient for shot struck craft weather bulwark fair between mast making splinter fly excellent exclaimed admirable alter elevation thompson for be nearing fast try again a quick a like gun be reloaded again fired time whether due to over eagerness other cause gunner made bad shot ball striking water astern of distance beyond brig then while men be reloading nine jet of flame smoke leapt simultaneously from brig side nine round shot tore up water unpleasantly close under bow how must do to train gun of port broadside forward return compliment asked keene who be standing close beside jack on account said be saving up two broadside for possible emergency if be to fire now there must be time to reload before be down upon go hearty see that gun of starboard broadside be so trained a to concentrate fire on point at about fifty yard distance at moment long tom spoke again next instant loud cheer broke from lad for shot have taken brig fore topmast just below sheave of topsail tye away went fore topsail topgallant sail royal over to leeward while flying standing jib fore topmast staysail collapsed drooped into water under forefoot with result that instantly shot up into wind well done thompson cried will do with long gun now stand by starboard battery a pas under stern slap whole broadside into pirate if such indeed be for brig showed colour proved to be remarkably smart crew for wreckage have scarcely fallen when fore rigging jib boom be alive with men laying out aloft to clear away wreck indiaman be now safe for must be away out of sight long before brig must repair damage sufficiently to resume pursuit if skipper of ship be a smart a ought to be must be own fault if allowed brig to find again wished to make assurance doubly sure therefore a swept close past disabled craft at imminent risk of being dismasted by broadside however people be too busy to fire slapped starboard broadside right into stern with extremely satisfactory result that moment later mainmast tottered with attached fell over side while scream of wounded rent air must have punished very severely indeed for got in reply be one solitary gun fired out of stern port did damage quarter of hour later be out of reach not ropeyarn worse for encounter took very particular notice of brig while be near although be differently painted having nothing now in way of colour to relieve jet black side save narrow scarlet ribbon must almost have sworn that be identical brig have destroyed dolores made island of barbados shortly before noon on following day passed southern extremity soon after four bell in afternoon watch at distance of about mile getting peep into carlisle bay a swept past without calling in there be several men o war whole fleet of merchantman lying at anchor in bay off bridgetown led to conjecture that large convoy have just arrived from home be mustering there for homeward passage trade wind still favouring blowing brisk breeze sighted saint vincent same afternoon passed northern extremity about midway through second dog watch finally on fourth day after passing barbados made island of jamaica anchored off port royal just a eight bell of afternoon watch be striking moment that anchor be down jumped into gig leaving jack in charge pulled ashore in hope of finding admiral in office although feared that hour be rather late by luckiest possible chance however happened that being exceptionally busy just then have deferred departure for kingston caught just a be about to leave old gentleman seemed good deal put out at finding that be still to be further delayed with gesture of annoyance broke seal of packet containing dispatch began to read first one standing before have read much above dozen word however look of vexation gave place to one of astonishment that in turn to one of intense satisfaction well will be shot most extraordinary aha begin to see light yes yes of course capital splendid know how to checkmate only just in time though by jove heard mutter a read on at first almost inaudibly louder louder a excitement grew until have completed perusal of principal document then turned over again looked at date looked at a though must scarcely believe eye finally turned to said on what date be dispatch handed to young gentleman told do mean to say sir that have made passage across in fortnight demanded yes sir said happened to be exceptionally favoured in matter of weather have carried on day night in fact studding sail have never be off from moment when squared away until took in for good about hour ago what be name young man be next question for a yet have only read dispatch leaving covering letter other document for perusal at leisure very well mr grenvile good name by by excellent name name to be lived up to remarked when have answered come dine with at pen to night must like to have little further talk with seven sharp returning on board found that during absence health officer have be off have at first manifested very decided disposition to make thing exceedingly unpleasant for because have gone ashore before receiving pratique however explanation afforded by jack be bearer of important dispatch for admiral coupled with fact that have clean bill of health have mollified a matter of fact heard more about having effected change of clothing hailed shore boat to come alongside in proceeded to kingston admiral pen be situated distance up hill at back of town a have fancy for walking so far decided that if possible must hire sort of conveyance to take there question be where be to obtain one for although there be plenty of vehicle in street must see sign of existence of such establishment a livery stable anywhere at length after have be searching for nearly hour decided to enquire looking about for most likely suitable place at to do so saw large two story building lower portion of seemed to consist of office while from mat curtain sheltered balcony above table chair stood therein guessed that upper floor be private part of establishment glazed door giving access to ground floor part of building bore upon in gilt letter word todd mcgregor general merchant decided to enter found in large warehouse like place reeking of many odour of sugar coffee predominating while whole tier of bag containing commodity be stacked against side wall huge conglomeration of miscellaneous good article lumbering remainder of floor picking way through reached back part of building found partitioned off to form office wherein number of men in gingham coat in shirt sleeve be busily at work writing letter inscribing entry in ledger day book at entrance one of glanced up then came forward asking what must do for stated difficulty upon said there certainly be livery stable in kingston at must hire vehicle to convey to pen think will be quite unnecessary for to do so upon present occasion for happen to know that mr todd be engaged to dine with admiral to night indeed believe be at moment dressing upstairs be sure will be delighted to give seat in ketureen if will be good enough to give card will take up to at once oh said be quite impossible that can thus trespass upon kindness of total stranger not at all answered interlocutor mr todd will be only too pleased assure a to trespassing upon kindness ' must surely be first visit to part of world must not talk like have be long in arrived afternoon only with dispatch from west coast said have never be in west indie before ah account for now if will kindly take seat let have card can arrange little matter in very short order what must do under such circumstance hand over card still protesting two minute later new acquaintance reappeared with invitation for to walk upstairs be ushered into large room with light so greatly dimmed by closed jalousie bare floor polished to such glass like slipperiness by daily application of beeswax that first ran foul of chair then very nearly foundered in endeavour to preserve balance thought caught sound somewhat like of suppressed titter must not be certain however heard very gentle musical voice say how do do mr grenvile be very pleased to make acquaintance lucy dear please throw open jalousie be so dark here that mr grenvile can not see where be then a jalousie be flung back evening light streamed into apartment became aware of rather stout lady very pale still good looking although have probably passed over to shady side of forty standing before with outstretched hand waiting patiently for to take while young woman of about twenty year of age be advancing upon from window with easy grace elder lady introduced a mr todd young lady a daughter lucy then invited to be seated explaining that husband be dressing must join in course of few minute a matter of fact be about twenty minute before mr todd typical scotsman from head to heel speaking a broadly a though have just arrived from glesca instead of having be resident in kingston for quarter of century made appearance certainly did not regret delay for twenty minute be among most pleasant have ever spent in life mr todd soon proved to be one of gentle kindly mannered sweet dispositioned woman with whom one instantly find on most friendly cordial term while miss lucy with equal celerity revealed a sprightly high spirited maiden without particle of artificiality about bright vivacious of manner with plenty to say for at same time thoroughly sensible a for mr todd be a have said typical scotsman ought to have added of very best sort for from beneath superficial businesslike keenness shrewdness natural kindliness geniality of disposition be constantly peeping through a instance of may mention that within five minute of meeting be insisting upon making house home for a long time a might be on island invitation wife daughter be seconding with earnestness left room to doubt absolute sincerity may a well say here now that when subsequently put hospitality of delightful warm hearted family to proof so far from performance falling short of promise must not have be treated with greater kindness consideration ay may even add affection have be own nearest relative be to say mr todd arrived at pen few minute before seven o'clock be forthwith ushered into drawing room where be received in most hospitable fashion by sir timothy lady tompion where found already assembled several captain other officer from men o ' war then in harbour with sprinkling of merchant from kingston planter from neighbouring estate very genial jovial character in several way having first introduced to lady tompion allowed minute two to pay respect to sir timothy very kindly made known to officer other guest present dinner having be announced filed into dining room took place dinner be distinctly sumptuous affair included many very delicious dish viand with then made first acquaintance need not dwell upon part of entertainment let suffice to say that enjoyed amazingly more so perhaps from fact that everybody from lady tompion downward seemed to be vying with other to put at ease make feel comfortable later however found that be mistaken a to people be not making special effort in behalf be simply exhibiting that remarkable geniality friendliness of feeling appears to be engendered by breathing air of lovely island at moment arrived for to make adieu go when stepped up to lady tompion to say good night exclaimed oh be not going back to ship to kingston for matter to night sir timothy intends to sleep here have already made necessary arrangement fact be explained in lower tone of voice that want to have long chat with so mr todd will have to excuse for once see that have already made up mind to carry off prisoner to own house must defer that until next time with most charming smile to mr todd who be standing close by waiting to say good night guest having departed sir timothy led way into study having invited to make comfortable in cane lounging chair while settled in said since parting from at port royal afternoon have found opportunity to read private letter from commodore accompanied dispatch what said therein respecting have greatly interested have therefore arranged for to sleep up here to night in order may have opportunity for quiet chat with may tell young gentleman that commodore report of conduct upon certain occasion have very favourably impressed so much so indeed that be more than half inclined to keep here instead of sending back will see will see now just give detailed account of entire service from time when first entered navy tell a must to ordinary friend for conversation be not official be not report from midshipman to admiral just friendly chat between elderly gentleman young one thus encouraged got under way spun yarn a best must sir timothy interrupting from time to time to ask question to elicit from explanation of point have not made quite clear sat there talking until close upon three o'clock in morning when at length rose to retire to respective room sir timothy remarked well mr grenvile have listened to story with great deal of pleasure satisfaction what have told have fully confirmed in half formed determination to keep here on station for present come to at office down at port royal at let see yes say three o'clock to morrow rather afternoon will then have something more to say to oh there be matter upon intended to speak to understand from commodore that be anxious to pas so that acting order a lieutenant may be confirmed now happens very luckily for that examination of midshipman have be arranged for next week will take place aboard achilles must strongly recommend to send in paper at once for from what have told to night have doubt that will be able to pas without slightest difficulty now good night breakfast will be on table at eight o'clock sharp on following afternoon landed on wharf at port royal entered admiral office at moment when six bell be being struck aboard flagship old gentleman be busy at moment signing number of paper paused for moment to wave to seat then resumed labour presently having completed signing of paper sir timothy delivered to secretary who be waiting for then unlocking opening drawer in desk withdrew somewhat voluminous bundle of document placed on table before said be letter dispatch from merchant here in kingston a well a bristol liverpool london underwriter admiralty at home drawing attention to fact that of late be to say during last three four month certain ship outward homeward bound have failed to arrive at destination be suggested that since during period there have be weather bad enough to explain account for loss of well found ship failure to arrive may possibly be due to presence of pirate pirate operating somewhere among island perhaps in water of western atlantic very considerable amount of exceedingly valuable property have thus mysteriously disappeared strong representation have be made to whitehall vigorous measure must be taken to solve mystery with result have be ordered to investigate order arrived about week ago up to present have be quite unable to obey for very good sufficient reason ship at disposal be needed for work even more important than hunting down of hitherto merely supposititious pirate adventure however with indiaman mysterious pursuer go to prove that there actually be pirate at work must take immediate step to put stop to activity brings to most serious difficulty have vessel available for service excepting schooner officer except whom can place in command of must not feel hurt young gentleman if say that under ordinary circumstance must a soon think of attempting to fly a of confiding so difficult dangerous service to mere midshipman what commodore have written concerning supplemented by what heard last night from own lip encourages to hope to believe young a be may yet prove worthy of confidence have decided to repose in appear to be one of rare young men who carry old head upon young shoulder have proved capable of thinking for of possessing courage to act upon own responsibility exhibited very sound judgment resource in affair of indian queen also in affair of indiaman certainly saved from capture be therefore going to take upon responsibility of giving roving commission to hunt down destroy pirate greatest difficulty will of course be to find fortunately for everybody concerned clipped wing so effectually that will be unable to do more mischief until have refitted to do will have to go into port somewhere first task therefore will be to endeavour to discover whereabouts of port therefore advise to spend few day while schooner be renewing store overhauling spar rigging so on in making diligent enquiry among craft arriving in port with object of ascertaining whether of happen to have sighted disabled brig if so where in what direction be steering in event of securing clue by mean will at once proceed to port toward must appear to be steering continue investigation there if must in way be fortunate enough to get upon track will of course follow up clue act a circumstance seem to direct if not will have to prosecute search enquiry until be successful service be exceedingly difficult one to confide to so young man a young a be seem to posse quality necessary to ensure success must succeed achievement will tell heavily in favour now be have to say to at present except that have better get to work forthwith report progress to here from time to time let know when schooner be again ready for sea have better allow full week for enquiry here if at end of time have failed to learn anything must consider what be next best thing to be done forget examination chapter fifteen sail in search of pirate having received dismissal from admiral returned to francesca summoning purser gave instruction to overhaul store prepare requisition for everything necessary to complete for two month cruise then sending for boatswain gunner carpenter in like manner instructed to overhaul hull spar standing running rigging content of magazine to report to defect shortage of store in respective department generally to prepare little craft in way for task lay before then there still remaining couple of hour of daylight jumped into gig again pulled aboard four vessel have arrived during day for purpose of enquiring whether of have sighted fallen in with disabled brig a be to be expected met with success be not in least disappointed for have anticipated no other result indeed calculated that ordinary slow sailing merchantman who might perchance fall in with pirate must scarcely be expected to reach kingston until at least three four day after francesca then availing of very pressing invitation have received from new friend mr todd made way to house where spent most delightful evening with family upon learning that expected to remain full week in port good people at once proceeded to plan for benefit number of pleasure jaunt to place of interest in neighbourhood be far too profoundly impressed with importance of task assigned to responsibility rested upon young shoulder to avail of very great kindness further than to spend evening two with divided time pretty evenly between schooner personally seeing that detail be overlooked in preparing for important task various craft arrived in port from day to day keene eager to assist undertook to penetrate in mufti lower more disreputable part of town to haunt wharf upon chance of picking up small item of information relating to mysterious brig might prove of service to effort availed nothing for on eighth day after arrival be better off than have be at beginning contrived however to filch few hour be necessary to enable to go up for examination with result passed with flying colour so examiner be kind enough to say good friend sir timothy at once confirmed acting order presented with commission bestowed upon rank of lieutenant in most gracious majesty navy on evening of eighth day after arrival at port royal went ashore to report to admiral discouraging fact have failed utterly to obtain information from of inward bound ship relative to piratical brig for none of apparently have sighted craft moreover jack keene enquiry be practically a unsuccessful a own for although have encountered one two doubtful character frequenting low tavern near wharf who seemed to have knowledge of such vessel be vague hearsay quite valueless although have failed so entirely to obtain information ship company have be kept busily at work with result that schooner be now a perfect in item particular of hull equipment a human hand must make therefore wound up report with statement that be ready for sea must sail at literally moment notice so much better remarked admiral since there be nothing to be gained by further delay have better make start forthwith so that may be able to work way out through channel secure offing before nightfall now have formed plan for conduct of cruise only of most general character sir replied according to reckoning brig be by time very nearly if not quite at rendezvous where will refit fear therefore there be not much likelihood of falling in with for time to come until have refitted be once more at sea in fact in order may not throw away possible chance idea be to stretch out toward middle of caribbean having arrived there to work to windward over track that brig must have to follow if be making way toward head of gulf then if fail to fall in with may be worth while to overhaul grenadine there must be several small island among well adapted a rendezvous for pirate there be just possibility that may find there failing that see can do anything else than work out clear of island haunt ground where track of inward outward bound trade meet since seems to that be spot where be most likely to find brig when resume operation excellent exclaimed old gentleman approvingly have thought out identical scheme suggested to hope that by following will succeed in laying fellow by heel speak craft that may fall in with make enquiry whenever have chance perhaps may be lucky enough to pick up slaver two so make cruise profitable one in double sense for if surmise of yours must happen to be correct that pirate brig be identical craft stole slave from prize dolores afterwards destroyed fellow may have played trick on other slaver in case will be glad enough to give information may lead to capture now sooner that be off better for will have none too much daylight in to work out clear of shoal so good bye lad good luck to take care of ship crew bring fellow back with a prize so saying with hearty handshake old gentleman dismissed quarter of hour later saucy little francesca in charge of pilot be turning to windward on way out to open sea sea breeze lasted just long enough to enable to clear shoal handsomely gain offing of about three mile then died away left wallowing helplessly in heavy swell be running meanwhile sun sank beneath horizon in one of blaze of indescribable glory of colour seem to be peculiar to west indie darkness closed down upon like shutter star leapt out of rapidly darkening blue overhead with soft lambent clarity of light be never beheld save in tropic then after tumbling about uncomfortably for nearly hour felt land breeze squaring away before soon ran off into true breeze of trade wind following three week passed uneventfully in carrying out first part of programme upon sir timothy have agreed including very careful fruitless search of entire group of grenadine between grenada saint vincent after proceeded toward spot be to be cruising ground called at little town of kingstown in latter island for few hour in order to replenish supply lay in stock of fruit thus far have be favoured with splendid weather on fifth day out from saint vincent observed that barometer wind be falling simultaneously by sunset trade wind have died away to nothing western half of sky looked a though be on fire horizon in quarter be piled high with great smear of dusky smoky looking cloud heavily streaked with long splash of vivid orange crimson colour a spectacle be magnificent magnificence be gloomy sombre threatening beyond anything have ever beheld nevertheless have seen sky not altogether unlike before experience have taught that such gorgeously lurid display of colour always portended approach of bad weather very frequently of hurricane type furthermore sailing direction for west indie warned that be now in part of world be subject to such terrific outbreak of atmospheric strife therefore resolved to take time by forelock fortunately in such small craft a schooner amount of work involved in operation of snugging down be not great in le than hour have got yard topmast down on deck whole of canvas snugly stowed with exception of foresail having be close reefed remained set so that might retain sort of command over vessel meanwhile calm continued although regular swell showed disposition to subside heavy cross swell be rapidly rising caused schooner to plunge roll in jerky irregular manner with such violence at length became almost impossible to stand without holding on to something while to attempt to move about became positively dangerous to add still further to unpleasantness of situation little hooker be constantly shipping water so heavily over rail bow taffrail that be frequently up to knee in although port have be opened to allow to run off contrived to complete preparation before became too dark to see be well for that did so for when darkness came be darkness might be felt for be a though be hemmed in by great black wall might be touched by merely stretching forth one hand while heat of stagnant atmosphere be so oppressive a to cause perspiration to pour from in stream disagreeable state of affair continued without break of kind until about five bell in first watch when cry of astonishment alarm broke from watch on forecastle head at sudden appearance on bowsprit of ball of light of sickly greenish hue immediately recognised a corposant although have never seen one before have frequently heard spoken of described be certainly weird uncanny sight to behold under such circumstance be well calculated to strike awe into mind of superstitious seaman from suddenness mystery of appearance from ghostly unnatural aspect a poised out there on end of spar clinging tenaciously thereto alternately flattening elongating a swayed in unison with violent movement of schooner while men be still gaping at open mouthed sickly radiance faintly illuminating face causing to wear horrible aspect of decomposing corps two others appeared one on of lower mast head for perhaps two minute might have be little longer last two ghostly lantern swayed lengthened contracted with wild plungings of little craft then one on foremast head let go hold went drifting away astern until be lost to sight while one on mainmast head came gliding down spar until reached flooded deck vanished a though extinguished by washing of water while be happening corposant on bowsprit end also let go hold came floating inboard along spar causing regular stampede of watch who incontinently came rushing aft a far a mainmast to get out of way of uncanny visitor however vanished a reached knightheads ah remarked gunner who have charge of watch mean that be in for heavy blow sir have seen thing often enough afore have always noticed that when of 'em come inboard like two extra bad weather be sure to foller partic'larly remembers case in p'int when be up mediterranean in old melampus be listen broke in unceremoniously a low hoarse murmur became audible above voice of gunner monotonous swish splash of water across deck in over bulwark creaking groaning of ship timber surely be wind coming at last at same moment gust of hot air came screaming scuffling over square off starboard beam causing foresail to fill suddenly with report like of gun careening schooner to covering board hard up with helm man hard up let pay off before shouted to man at helm while sound have heard increased rapidly in volume long line of white foam rendered luminous by phosphorescent state of water appeared broad on starboard beam sweeping down upon with appalling velocity fortunate be for that preliminary puff have come to help for lasted just long enough to permit little hooker to gather steerage way partially to pay off far enough be to say to bring onrushing hurricane well over starboard quarter indeed have gale happened to strike square abeam with way on ship be convinced that must have inevitably turned turtle with a be when few minute later wind swooped down upon with fury of famished wild beast leaping upon prey with mad babel of terrifying howl shriek utterly baffle description little vessel heeled down beneath first stroke until lee rail be buried water rose to level of hatchway coaming for fact that be at moment not only forging ahead also paying off there must have be end of hand then there for what seemed to be in anxious condition veritable age be probably no more than brief half minute little vessel lay there quivering in timber seemed paralysed with terror a though be sentient thing wind yelled raved through rigging spindrift scud water showing ghostly in phosphorescent light emitted by tormented water flew over in blinding drenching shower then with sudden jerk schooner rose almost upright with water foaming about bow to level of head rail sped away to leeward at pace seemed absolutely impossible to even so swift craft a have proved to be scudded thus before gale for nearly hour when availing ourselves of temporary lull in fury brought schooner to wind hove to on starboard tack even then so tremendous be force of wind that although showed to nothing close reefed foresail little vessel be buried to level of rail so violent be first swoop of hurricane that surface of ocean be a be crushed flat by slightest irregularity presented be instantly torn away swept to leeward in form of spray thus for first hour so be impossible for sea to rise at end of time however tormented ocean began to assert although crest continued to be torn off by violence of wind sea steadily rose gathered weight until by midnight little francesca be being hove up flung about a violently a cork upon surface of turbulent stream now of schooner many good quality revealed for despite furious violence of wind wave little craft rode raging sea a buoyantly a daintily a sea gull shipped not so much a spoonful of water excepting of course such a flew on board in form of spray even of small quantity have very little after schooner have be brought to wind for tremendous pressure of gale upon spar rigging upon small area of close reefed foresail laid over at so steep angle caused to turn up so bold weather side that most of spray flew clean over be swept away to leeward temporary lull in gale of have taken advantage to heave to schooner lasted only just long enough to enable to accomplish manoeuvre be well for that availed so promptly of opportunity for other occurred on contrary after brief lull gale seemed to increase steadily in fury to extent indeed at length felt must not have be in least surprised have schooner be blown bodily out of water whirled away to leeward like autumn leaf needle to say that night be one of intense anxiety to for responsibility for safety of schooner hand aboard rested entirely upon shoulder have already done be possible in way of precaution while felt that despite magnificent behaviour of little craft exceptionally heavy sea might at moment catch at disadvantage break aboard in event must most probably founder out of hand so great indeed be anxiety found impossible to quit deck for moment although subordinate be thoroughly steady trustworthy men have far more experience than with men forward be totally different mind be thoroughly imbued with seaman maxim let look out who have watch whose watch be below turned in without slightest hesitation qualm of anxiety trusting implicitly to in charge of deck to do everything might be necessary to ensure safety of ship to seemed a though terrible night must never end even when at hour of dawn arrived there be perceptible amelioration in condition darkness remained a intense a have be at midnight be not until eight bell in case eight o'clock in morning that feeble glimmer of daylight came filtering through opaque blackness of firmament over head dimly revealing shapeless mass of flying cloud scud permitting to view surroundings for space of about quarter of mile contracted a be view be more than sufficient to impress with deep overwhelming sense of impotence of man in presence of god power a manifested in appalling demonstration of elemental fury now even more than during hour of darkness did appear to be constantly on point of being lifted out of water by terrific strength of wind a often a schooner be hove up on summit of sea thus exposed to full force of hurricane must feel tremble perceptibly lift when wind struck beneath upturned bilge a for sea have never seen anything like before have since when people desire to convey idea of exceptionally heavy sea speak of a running mountain high in case of be now speaking expression appeared to be exaggeration at for a wave after wave came sweeping down upon with uplifted menacing crest looking up to crest from liquid valley in front of seemed like gazing up side of mountain be threatening to fall upon crush to atom indeed wild upward sweep of schooner heeling almost to beam end a be flung aloft upon breast of onrushing wave be experience terrifying enough to turn man hair grey yet after watching movement of schooner for about hour noting how time after time when little barkie seemed to be trembling on very brink of destruction unfailingly came to in time to avoid being overwhelmed grew so inured to experience found able to go below make excellent breakfast with perfect equanimity be about five bell in forenoon watch have by time grown light enough for to discern object at distance of about mile when a schooner be tossed aloft to crest of exceptionally gigantic wave simpson whose watch be simultaneously caught sight for moment of something indistinctly seen a be through dense cloud of flying scud water have appearance of ship of kind directly to windward of next instant lost sight of a sank into trough between wave have just passed beneath that be sweeping down upon when topped wave soon afterwards again caught sight of object time held in view long enough to identify a large brigantine hove to like on starboard tack under storm staysail unlike however have top hamper aloft forward seemed to be making desperately bad weather of glimpse that caught of be of course very brief at comparatively long interval for be only when craft happened to be on summit of wave at same moment that be able to see yet two fact concerning gradually became clear to first of be that be undoubtedly slaver so much short stumpy mast enormous longitudinal spread of yard told second be that be steadily settling down to leeward at more rapid rate than a be only to be expected from fact that be exposing much more top hamper to gale than be must not be long therefore before must drive away to leeward of probably passing at very great distance now although be fully convinced that craft in sight be slaver yet have thought whatever of attempting to take just then for very simple reason to do so under circumstance must be manifest impossibility in such awful sea a be then running must only work gun at very infrequent interval with utmost difficulty while if be to hit must do so only by merest accident even if must contrive by mean to compel to surrender to must not take possession of interest in be therefore no greater than with sailor caught in heavy gale watch movement of ship in same predicament a own meanwhile by imperceptible degree be steadily driving down toward until at length be so close so directly to windward of that almost succeeded in persuading that there be moment when must catch through strong salt smell of gale whiff of characteristic odour of slaver with living cargo on board be alone in respect for simpson man who be tending schooner helm asserted that also perceived now question arose for moment at least be even more important than whether have have not slave aboard be whether must pas clear of not have settled away to leeward until have approached to within couple of hundred yard a two craft alternately came to fell off alternately appeared a though stranger must pas clear of ahead fall off run foul of moment have arrived when became necessary for one other of to do something to avert catastrophe a aboard brigantine gave indication of disposition to bestir ordered simpson to have fore staysail loosed set intending to forge ahead leave room for other craft to pas athwart stern fore staysail sheet be accordingly hauled aft four men laid out on bowsprit to loose sail be soon done then when next settled into trough of sea be consequently becalmed for moment halyard be manned sail hoisted brigantine be by time so dangerously near to that even when be sunk in trough of sea be possible for to see mast head over crest of intervening wave now kept eye on with momentarily increasing anxiety for appeared to that be in perilous proximity to hideous disaster then a schooner swept upward on breast of oncoming wave saw spar of brigantine forging slowly ahead a ship to belonged fell off heart stood still blood froze with horror for became apparent that two craft be sheering inward toward other that nothing short of miracle must prevent brigantine from falling foul of destroying for a spar rose higher into view saw that people too have set fore staysail that two craft impelled by additional spread of sail be rushing headlong toward other middy in command by harry collingwood chapter sixteen vicissitude of fortune hard up with helm shouted hard over with must take chance of being swamped better than craft must be destroyed dashing aft lent assistance to man who be tending helm then ensued breathless hair raising fifteen second during seemed impossible for schooner brigantine to avoid collision in case must have sunk other out of hand then when two craft be not more than fifteen foot apart schooner head fell off turned broadside on to sea people smartly hauling down fore staysail brigantine drew slowly ahead clear of bowsprit end missing mainboom by merest hairbreadth danger be over during minute so of frightful suspense stranger crew have spent in rushing madly aimlessly about deck execrating in voluble spanish opportunity have be afforded to ascertain that brigantine be named san antonio that be beyond question slaver with cargo on board contrived to avoid without shipping so much a drop of water thanks mainly to fact that brigantine have served at critical moment a floating breakwater for putting helm down again moment that be clear of came safely to wind again on weather quarter have allowed matter to remain a be before narrow escape san antonio must soon have parted company with for a said before be driving to leeward much more rapidly than be now that must not suit at for since have made certain that be slaver be determined to capture a soon a weather must moderate sufficiently to allow to do so therefore when have drifted about mile to leeward of gave instruction that helm must be eased up a often a opportunity permitted result of be that contrived to make own lee drift amount to about same a hers thus maintaining more than bare half mile of water between shortly after noon gale broke sky quite suddenly cleared hour later be able to set fore staysail shake reef out of foresail in order to steady ship although sea be still running too high to permit of bearing up running down to brigantine managed to edge down little nearer to so that by eight bell in afternoon watch have reduced distance to something like eighth part of mile at distance be able to maintain pretty close watch upon craft hour later detected sign indicative of determination on part of crew to make sail evidently distrusted a neighbour be desirous of putting little more water between seeing took long look round to ascertain what chance might be must attempt to bear up run down to there be still very high steep dangerous sea running to attempt to run before must be hazardous in extreme for must happen to be pooped by even single one of least must happen to must be that deck must be swept very possibly must lose several men overboard to save whom must be impossible in mountainous sea while be quite on card that schooner might be swamped out of hand go to bottom with crew remembered that among store there be quantity of lamp oil believed that few gallon of towed astern in porous bag must smooth water sufficiently to prevent sea from breaking aboard during short time that must need to enable to run down to brigantine gave order to have bag prepared dropped over stern meanwhile crew of brigantine have not be idle for scarcely have given order to prepare oil bag when people proceeded to set jib close reefed topsail double reefed mainsail with evident determination of escaping from neighbourhood with a little delay a might be thereupon ordered colour to be hoisted shot to be fired across forefoot a gentle hint for to remain where be to surprise for slaver often fight when find opposed to superior force brigantine promptly replied to single shot by letting drive at with starboard broadside of four pounder none of however came near for sea be altogether too high to allow of accurate shooting for reason refrained from firing second time replied to antagonist by making sail for now appeared a though have hope of escaping to windward by outsailing weathering upon evidently people did not know little francesca first quarter of hour of chase sufficed to prove that san antonio must not possibly escape in manner that people have evidently believed must be successful not only did outsail also contrived to edge down upon to within about cable length when skipper deliberately opened fire upon with broadside gun apparently with hope that lucky shot must knock away spar two aboard thus compel to abandon chase be game two must play at since rascal seemed determined not to yield without fight cleared away long tom proceeded to return compliment to shoot with degree of accuracy in such sea be impossible be particularly anxious to avoid hulling fellow for knew that must mean killing of several of unfortunate slave in hold therefore gave instruction to men working gun to exercise utmost care to fire only when must be reasonably certain that shot must not strike brigantine hull by observing precaution at length succeeded in shooting away fore topmast thus rendering helpless to continue flight whereupon like sensible fellow ran spanish flag up to gaff allowed to flutter there for moment then hauled down again in token of surrender chance encounter with brigantine thus ended satisfactorily enough so far a be concerned however be not until next morning that weather have moderated sufficiently to enable to take possession of prize when found that have captured very smart vessel of two hundred sixty five ton measurement with cargo of three hundred slave on board bound for havana lost time in turning over to jack keene with prize crew of twelve men with instruction to take into port royal for adjudication to await there arrival of schooner before parting company seized opportunity to question crew of san antonio a to brig of be in search professed to know nothing whatever of by midday sign of hurricane have disappeared sea have gone down trade wind have returned blowing briskly out from about east north east be therefore fair wind for prize hour after have secured meridian altitude of sun for determination of latitude master jack bore up dipped colour squared away now ensued fortnight of uneventful wearisome cruising along parallel of deg north latitude between meridian of deg deg west longitude that being line upon thought most likely might encounter pirate at least news of during period sighted spoke not far short of forty sail of one sort outward homeward bound learned not word must furnish with clue to whereabouts of craft that be so anxiously seeking be beginning to fear that quarry have betaken to other cruising ground altogether when one morning at dawn simpson who have charge of watch sent down word to say that there be brig in sight that must very much like to come up look at a seemed to recognise accordingly without waiting to dress tumbled out of bunk made way up on deck be on bowline under short canvas at time to eastward of silver bank tail of have cleared about hour before while stranger be apparently hove to dead to windward of hull down from deck there be not much to be learned by looking at stranger from level of deck therefore slung glass over shoulder made way aloft a far a main cross tree from full view of be to be obtained before so much a taking single look at through telescope behaviour assured that must be ship of war craft of decidedly suspicious character for ordinary trader must be lying hove to just where be inference therefore be indisputable that if not man o ' war must be lurking just off entrance of windward passage for unlawful purpose if by chance craft in sight must prove to be one that be after believed must be able to recognise upon first glimpse of through telescope when got aloft brought instrument to bear upon found however that be just in very thick of dazzle of newly risen sun be not until have be aloft quite quarter of hour be able to see at distinctly even then must discern detail of painting must not make out whether hull be painted black green whether have painted port merely narrow ribbon have showed against strong light of eastern horizon simply a dainty jet black silhouette rising falling lazily upon long swell after looking long steadfastly at came to conclusion in first instance that be not man o war in next that general shape style of rig be sufficiently familiar to justify in belief at least suspicion have seen before at event be obvious duty to get near enough to to enable to ascertain what business have to be lying to just where have happened to find accordingly gave simpson instruction to make sail then see clear for action be evident that might be character of stranger aboard be fully a wide awake a ourselves for sooner did start to make sail than did same with celerity too must not have disgraced man o ' war within five minute of having given order to make sail craft be thrashing hard to windward under plain sail to royal then be not long in discovering fast a be francesca stranger appeared to be nearly if not quite a fast although in schooner seemed to be rather more weatherly of two however might simply mean that skipper of brig be intentionally allowing to close very gradually with in order that might have opportunity to get nearer look at so be enabled to form better judgment regarding character while making own preparation if indeed happened to be craft for be looking of became increasingly convinced a gradually neared brig for although be now painted dead black to bend without relief whatever of colour there be certain little detail peculiarity of shape rig felt convinced have seen before at length about three bell be to say half past nine o'clock in forenoon watch skipper of brig seemed to have made up mind to definite course of action for suddenly put up helm squared away came running straight down for whereupon in schooner at once went to quarter cast loose gun opened powder magazine got good supply of ammunition up on deck at same time hoisting colour stranger apparently be not quite so willing a ourselves to display hue of bunting at event saw none might have be due to fact that gaff end be obscured from view by spread of topsail when about mile to windward of brig must now see be most beautiful craft suddenly rounded to clewed up course royal hauled down flying jib throwing open port let fly whole broadside of pounder at shot humming close over head considerably cutting up rigging at same instant great black flag went soaring aloft to gaff end so said to simpson who be standing close beside that clear ground enables to know just where be with black rag staring in face there be possibility of making mistake return fire lad a gun come to bear be careful not to throw single shot away aim at spar first then when have crippled will close finish off in talking thus be reckoning without host for brig carried more than twice weight of metal in broadside battery long thirty two on forecastle a against own long eighteen in word soon found that have caught tartar for crew be quite a nimble a own quite a good shot be worse thus when came to playing dismantling game seemed to be object of craft soon found that be suffering much more severely than antagonist skipper of brig saw quite a clearly a did presently believing that have completely in power bore up ran down toward with evident intention of boarding mr simpson said that fellow look very much a though intended to lay aboard ought to suit great deal better than playing at long bowl so please have broadside long gun double shotted will give everything can a range up alongside then board in smoke instead of waiting for to board excellent plan sir think answered simpson boardin bein boarded be two very different thing although chap may be ready enough to follow skipper on to deck will take good deal of fight out of if find that be beforehand with that have got to defend own ship instead of attackin ' will go see everything ready to give warm reception when come alongside be not long kept in suspense for to do pirate justice came on to attack with symptom of perfect fearlessness have only just sufficient time wherein to make preparation when taking broad sheer brig rounded to shot alongside at moment when be within about fathom of bulwark lined with swarthy unkempt looking desperado holding in readiness to fling in upon deck gave word to fire whole double shotted broadside with charge of canister on top of simpson have quietly ordered to be rammed home on top of round shot went crashing into making very pretty general average among crew among spar rigging crew of boarder seemed to have be swept out of existence so severely wounded be mast that shock of collision with schooner moment later sent of over side fortunately into sea instead of across deck there lay sheer hulk secured to by grappling iron people have promptly hove quite unable to escape hurrah lad shouted have now can not escape boarder follow away went helter skelter over own bulwark of brig into thick cloud of smoke that hung over brig deck completely obscuring everything upon quite expected to find that final broadside in addition to bringing down brig mast have swept crew practically out of existence be therefore most disagreeably surprised to discover that despite havoc have undoubtedly wrought evidence of became clearly visible a breeze swept smoke away pirate still numbered at least two to one be apparently in nowise dismayed at havoc last broadside of ours have wrought on contrary received with utmost intrepidity in instant of francesca found ourselves hemmed in pressed so vigorously that instead of sweeping deck carrying brig with rush a have fully expected must be with utmost difficulty that be able to hold ground at pirate captain easily distinguishable among rest by good look smartness of dress be here there everywhere apparently at same moment urging on encouraging men in fluent spanish while defended from simultaneous attack of three of people with consummate ease fought cheerfully joyously like man who enjoys fighting with reckless jest on lip with ferocity be terrible to behold twice crossed sword with on first occasion have hardly engaged when be so severely jostled that suddenly found completely at mercy gave up a lost for sword be descending straight upon defenceless head a eye glared tiger like into mine when apparently through sheer caprice diverted stroke instead of cleaving to chin a must easily have done vigorously attacked man next to while on second occasion occurred minute two later contented with simply parrying thrust then permitted to be separated from by rush of men for ten long minute fight raged most furiously on brig deck fortune sometimes favouring for moment then deserting in favour of pirate battle occasionally resolved for moment into series of desperate single combat during men savagely clutched other by throat stabbed at other with shortened weapon then merged again into general melee in man seemed to strike recklessly at enemy within reach regardless of own safety then while fight be still in full swing suddenly received terrific blow on top of skull fell senseless upon deck last conscious sensation be that of being trampled remorselessly under foot by furious rush of men when at length recovered sens found that be lying undressed in cot suffering from nerve racking headache of so violent character must scarcely endure to open eye to brilliant sunlight flooded cabin of be occupant for first minute two after recovery sens be so utterly confused that found impossible to recall anything have happened save that somehow have be struck down in fight gradually a lay there wrestling with state of confusion in found plunged memory returned recollected everything up to moment when have be struck down on deck of pirate brig then began to look about with view of ascertaining where be found that exceedingly roomy comfortable cot in be lying be slung from beam of equally roomy luxurious cabin be furnished with degree of mingled elegance comfort be seldom found afloat in day indeed be very far from being common even now whole of after end of cabin be occupied by series of window of semi elliptical shape beyond sparkling sea must be seen through delicious balmy refreshing breeze be blowing broad locker arrangement handsomely worked in choice mahogany stretched right athwart cabin immediately beneath stern window upon stood several beautiful flowering plant in pot of elaborately hammered brass locker forming top of long sofa divan upholstered in crimson velvet also stretched across full width of cabin interior paintwork of apartment be rich creamy white imparting deliciously cool bright appearance to furniture contained consisted of among other le important matter table of elaborately carved mahogany large bookcase full of book many of be in sumptuous binding rack containing about dozen chart four chair one of different pattern from others very fine thick carpet be exceptionally good only fault must find with be that lacked uniformity of design suggested idea that have be acquired in more le haphazard way at different time place by time have completed survey of cabin in lay have sufficiently regained control of sens to realise be certainly not aboard francesca that being case where be undoubtedly aboard pirate brig on deck of have be struck down senseless then arose question what have become of schooner shipmate have be captured sunk driven off that fight be over have probably be over for time be evident for although there be sound of much movement on deck overhead with jabber of many voice in spanish intermingled with frequent call command stir bustle be of quiet orderly character conveyed to practised ear suggestion that people on deck be engaged upon task of repairing damage for moment idea presented to that might possibly have proved victor that brig be in possession be dispelled next moment by reflection have such be case speech on deck must have be english not spanish must probably not have be left unattended a mental balance gradually recovered so did anxiety touching fate of francesca comrade intensify until at length felt must endure suspense no longer must turn out investigate for accordingly made effort to raise in cot instantly sank back with involuntary groan for not only did effort result in immediate severe attack of vertigo also became aware of fact that in addition to injury to head have received very painful hurt in left breast close above heart to get up dress a have intended be obviously impossible only thing to be done therefore be to remain where be until somebody must come to lay thus for perhaps quarter of hour longer fretting fuming at helplessness still more at ignorance of what have happened to schooner when door of cabin opened softly rather good looking young spaniard approached cot on tiptoe seeing that eye be open probably detecting look of rationality in smiled a finger closed gently upon wrist to feel pulse so senor said have recovered sens at last there be moment when almost began to fear that must slip through finger pray senor who may be where be asked to reply to question in regular order senor answered spaniard be miguel fonseca surgeon of brig name of be barracouta be prisoner guest be not quite sure of commander captain ricardo captain ricardo repeated what be other name ah senor can not tell know only a captain ricardo answered companion thank very much for information said there be one two matter of much greater importance to than captain name can tell for instance what have become of schooner crew assuredly senor answered surgeon beat off with great loss taking advantage of fact that have dismasted with last venomous broadside that poured into just a ran alongside people made good escape doubt very much whether will ever reach port indeed be most probable that have gone to bottom by time for schooner be terribly cut up appeared to be making great deal of water when hauled off made sail will get in right senor said have very little fear of if managed to get from under gun without being sunk will somehow contrive to keep schooner afloat until reach port now perhaps can tell how be that happen to be here doe captain take care of wounded prisoner nurse back to health a rule by mean senor answered fonseca with grin usual practice after fight be to fling wounded dead alike to shark while unwounded be afforded option of joining walking plank why have made exception in case senor be more than can tell be mystery will not attempt to fathom must care to hazard guess a to whether action bodes good evil know be that happened to be standing by when after retreat of schooner people be clearing deck of dead wounded that when be about to be thrown overboard suddenly interposed ordered to be taken below placed in own cot instruction being to attend to hurt at once before attending to even most seriously injured of own people um be rather queer behaviour be commented a fonseca nodded continued pray when did happen about five hour ago immediately after fight be answer have be attending to own wounded during interval have only just finished with be afraid will lose good many of men fought like fiend struck very shrewd blow indeed there be moment when began to think captain ricardo have made serious mistake in determining to run down lay aboard for minute two looked very much a though people be about to give way before indeed believe must have done so for fact that men grew discouraged gave way when fell will not do at here be talking to when be of utmost importance that must be kept perfectly quiet now not word if please allow to dress wound afresh so saying softly opened cabin door said something in low voice to someone who be apparently waiting outside then closing door again returned to side of cot began with very gentle finger light touch to remove bandage be wrapped about breast shoulder said be most serious injury pike wound when did get have really not slightest idea when how got answered then stopped suddenly for a spoke suddenly remembered that when sprang aboard brig at head of boarder be conscious for moment of having received violent blow on chest memory of however have instantly vanished in excitement of fierce struggle promptly ensued yes said that must have be related occurrence just a have happened just then low tap came on cabin door in response to fonseca bidding young mulatto lad entered bearing large basin of warm water towel bandage lint other matter good now stand there francois hold basin while foment wound ordered fonseca who forthwith proceeded to bathe patch up in most careful skilful manner there said when have at length attended to hurt made tolerably comfortable think will do pretty well now for hour two wound in breast look very much inflamed be only to be expected from character of weapon with be inflicted have applied lotion ought to allay inflammation somewhat will prepare nice soothing cooling drink of may take a much a please when have finished francois who will remain here to look after will bring further supply what now need more than anything else be sleep so if must experience slightest inclination way please yield to without hesitation now senor will bid adios for present will come have look at before dark so saying withdrew from cabin a quietly a have come chapter seventeen ricardo pirate must have slept for at least three hour probably much longer for when awoke with start discovered that night have fallen cabin lamp be lighted man whom at once recognised a pirate captain be leaning over gazing at face with intentness be doubtless cause of abrupt awakening a opened eye started back a though detected in act of felt ashamed then recovering again bent over to astonishment said in perfect english well young gentleman hope be feeling better for long sleep thanks yes said at least intolerable headache from be suffering few hour ago have almost entirely passed away wound in breast be still exceedingly painful more so think than when surgeon patched up ah said be sorry to hear that fonseca must come look at again told that be likely to prove troublesome if can avoid gangrene until ship get in think will pull through right be very kind of to concern a to welfare also somewhat inexplicable that must do so said be captain of ship be not yes for present answered for how long may be permitted to retain position be quite affair be given to understand that men be extremely dissatisfied must have spared life motto must know be dead men tell tale have acted in strict accordance with thus far doubtless account for immunity that have so long enjoyed yours be first life have ever spared thank said suppose ought to feel very much obliged to somehow disaster have absolutely ruined prospect in service so might just a well have killed outright by way why have spared surgeon informed that spare only who join hope anticipate possibility that will join companion laughed heartily yet there be slight ring of bitterness methought in laugh said have not spared in hope that will join have managed thus far to do fairly well without assistance be sanguine enough to believe that even must decline to throw in lot with will continue to rub along after fashion without be not reason for sparing by by what be name if may presume to ask be rather awkward to be entertaining guest whose name even one doe not know name answered be grenvile richard grenvile be lieutenant in britannic majesty navy quite so remarked companion caustically guessed a much from uniform bear good name young sir very good name be one of devon grenviles yes answered be devon through on side mother be carew be good old devonshire family ah ejaculated ricardo a called with quick indrawing of breath a though what have said have hurt though how must have done so be quite inexplicable must have sworn lucy carew boy be living image of mother recognised likeness moment that came face to face when boarded have three time spared life on account twice while fight be in progress again when people must have heaved still breathing body to shark good heaven exclaimed be possible that can ever have known mother ay answered ricardo extraordinary a may appear to once knew mother well however broke off hurriedly be not moment in to become reminiscent wound be troubling can see will call fonseca to dress afresh meanwhile be under apprehension a to safety will protect with own life if necessary although think will quite come to so saying left cabin to return few minute later accompanied by surgeon assistant francois mulatto boy with utmost care on part of fonseca to accompaniment of sundry malediction in spanish muttered under breath by ricardo a involuntarily winced now then during process wound be laid bare carefully examined be by time terribly inflamed horribly painful seemed to gather from grave anxious look on fonseca face that regarded a somewhat serious said nothing however gave very thorough fomentation dressed carefully bound up again done administered sleeping draught left in charge of francois to whom gave certain whispered instruction must not catch when presently retired ricardo followed out of cabin saw more night for sleeping draught though somewhat long in operating have effect at last sank into feverish troubled sleep in be vexed by sort of fantastic fancy in of mother man ricardo seemed to be associated together most incongruously then there be moment when seemed to awake to find ricardo fonseca bending over anxiously others in appeared to be sitting up in cot talking veriest nonsense to francois who on such occasion seemed to be entreating with tear in eye to lie down again remain quiet then ensued further phantasmagoria of most extravagant description of subsequently remembered little nothing save seemed to be consumed with fever liquid fire be rushing through vein instead of blood be continually tormented by unquenchable thirst state of discomfort endured for age apparently in reality however lasted only week at end of period emerged from delirium to find comfortably nay luxuriously disposed upon large bed in spacious room overlooking extensive garden gorgeous with strange brilliant hued flower fragrant with mingled perfume sloped very gently down to sandy beach beyond be visible through wide open casement of apartment wide stretch of landlocked water in centre of floated hull of vessel have difficulty in identifying a barracouta room occupied be elegantly furnished wall be decorated with several oil painting that to uneducated eye at least appeared to be exceedingly good dotted about room here there be little table upon of stood vase of magnificent flower be scene upon eye opened a awoke from first natural sleep have visited since disastrous day when have be struck down upon deck of pirate brig lay for minute motionless drinking in beauty delight of revelling lazily in sensation of relief from pain fever be now enjoying then a unconsciously sighed with excess of pleasure became aware of slight movement beside bed glancing round perceived middle aged negress bending over looking anxiously into eye bueno senor be again at last exclaimed in accent of great satisfaction a placed cool hand upon brow for moment then proceeded to smooth rebellious lock with tenderness be almost caressing continued fever have quite gone now senor have nought to do save to get well strong again a soon a possible spoke in spanish accent manner be of one who have be accustomed life to associate with cultured people who be pray demanded in same language where be be mammy answered old nurse of senorita senor ricardo housekeeper be now in senor ricardo own house ay in own room too what be young english senor to senor ricardo wonder that must be cared for thus scarcely knew whether last remark be in nature of soliloquy whether be to take a question addressed to treated a latter replied really know mammy stop moment let think yes seem to remember did dream captain ricardo said have once known mother can not be possible must have dreamed yet that part of scarcely seems to be dream matter matter answered mammy musingly will doubtless know truth sooner later now senor be past time when ought to have taken medicine be sleeping so peacefully must not bring to wake take now be sovereign remedy for kind of fever never yet knew to fail then if be thirsty may have just one glass of sangaree took potion swallowed obediently have intensely not altogether disagreeable bitter taste then quaffed generous tumbler of sangaree that old lady handed oh that sangaree have never tasted before though have often since then drunk beverage have never again enjoyed draught so much a did that particular one be precisely idea of nectar aha old woman a watched keen enjoyment with emptied tumbler senor like that good will have more little later now must go see to making of broth for senor be strength that must now build up so saying old nurse glided softly out of room leaving to enjoy glorious scene be framed by wide open window at foot of bed have lain thus for perhaps five minute when door of room again opened there entered young girl of sixteen year of age be actual age subsequently learned looked quite two year older who came to side of bed stood looking down upon with large lustrous eye beamed with pity tenderness then a laid cool soft hand very gently upon forehead said in softest sweetest voice to have ever listened oh senor grenvile be good to see looking so very much better will recover now there be time ah how long ago seems be yesterday when thought that must never live to see light of day be mammy wonderful knowledge of medicine that saved have not captain realised critical state driven men to incredible exertion to get ship into harbour quickly must not have lived senorita said how can sufficiently thank for kind interest exhibit in unfortunate prisoner for suppose be what be senor oh be quite mistaken interjected companion at least corrected be mistaken in character of imprisonment that certainly be prisoner in sense be quite true hope be think will find imprisonment very intolerable imprisonment character must be intolerable seems to grumbled then checking exclaimed let talk about do mind telling who be face seems familiar to somehow yet be certain have never before seen be by chance captain ricardo daughter girl face clouded somewhat a answered oh be not captain ricardo daughter be orphan have never known what be to have father mother be prisoner like yet find state by mean intolerable captain ricardo have be kindness to indeed must not have be more kind to have really be daughter ah said be glad to hear for sake seems strange man very curious commingling of good evil trait of character kind gentle to thus far to yet relentlessly cruel bloodthirsty in prosecution of accursed calling name senorita will not tell that oh yes certainly why must not answered companion be called lotta carlotta josefa candelaria dolores de guzman name be dick be not why certainly be exclaimed how in world did know that because answered when be brought ashore yesterday captain ricardo sent for said young fellow be dick grenvile son of once very dear friend of mine want lotta mammy to do utmost to nurse back to health strength again mammy have be doing so with marvellously satisfactory result said that suppose account for fact of face seeming familiar to probably saw once twice during delirium yes admitted certainly did see once twice well lotta suppose may call lotta may not senorita sound so very formal doe not suggested oh yes certainly assented companion may call dick may not senor sound so very formal doe not quaint mimicry of earnestness of manner be irresistibly droll of course may agreed eagerly well lotta now let remember what be be about to say oh yes of course how came to be prisoner in power of man ricardo very simply yet in manner that must scarcely credit be reply must know that mother died just after be born father when be just two year old up to then mammy have looked after when father died estate be taken in charge by people whom father have appointed to look after what do call people trustee call in england suggested yes assented lotta be father trustee guardian empowered to look after interest manage estate until must arrive at age of eighteen when be seven year of age trustee decided to send over to old spain to be educated accordingly went in charge of wife of one of with mammy to look after be educated at convent of santa clara in seville where remained until fourteenth birthday when be taken out of convent placed on board ship bound to havana guardian having decided that have received a much education a be necessary that time have arrived when ought to return to cuba take place a mistress of household owner of vast estate of be heiress then terrible misfortune befell ship on board be passenger caught fire be utterly destroyed everybody be obliged to take refuge in boat then to add still further to misery gale sprang up boat became separated suffered dreadfully during gale be several time in greatest danger of being drowned then when gale be over sailor in boat knew not in direction to steer so went drifting aimlessly hither not knowing where be going hoping day after day that ship must come in sight pick up very soon food water became exhausted suffering intensified to extent that of men went mad threw into sea a for became so weak at last that lost consciousness did not again revive until found on board barracouta with mammy looking after arrived here before be well enough to walk here have remained ever since be to say nearly two year well exclaimed be most extraordinary story extraordinary not only from fact of having be heroine of such terrible adventure even more so from circumstance that be rescued have be taken care of ever since by ricardo one must have thought that must have be most natural thing in world for to have callously left to perish how many of boat crew be alive when picked up only two sailor mammy answered lotta afterwards heard that sailor have joined ricardo have never have desire to escape seek protection of guardian demanded only at very rare interval even then feeling be not very strong be extraordinary answer see lotta explained be perfectly happy where be be most lovely spot in to live most lovely have ever seen ricardo be kindness to during rare period when be at home a call have never expressed wish that have not gratified have possible comfort what with guitar garden morning evening swim making clothes for find so much occupation know what be to have wearisome moment now that have come to be companion to can not think of anything else to wish for charming naivete of remark fairly took breath away be careful that girl must not be allowed to guess from manner that have said anything in least remarkable before must reply sound of approaching footstep became audible lotta remarked now here come fonseca suppose will have to go will come back again when leaf a rose to foot door opened spanish surgeon entered good morning senorita exclaimed how be patient vastly better mammy tell see be busy preparing broth for senor grenvile must not have until have thoroughly satisfied that must be good for well senor a seated on side of bed laid finger upon pulse be looking rather more like living being than be twenty four hour ago mammy medicine be simply marvellous will say that for although old witch will not tell of what be composed um yes eye bright almost too bright pulse strong decidedly too quick have be talking too much will not do senorita have slipped out of room by time must either stay away not talk to now let look at wound proceeded very carefully to remove dressing appeared be progressing very satisfactorily so re dressed broken pate have healed needed further looking after administered sleeping draught then retired after informing must have mammy broth later that in meantime sleep be of more value importance to than food have not be gone ten minute before be fast asleep several day elapsed never saw ricardo although be told by lotta mammy that have frequently looked in upon while slept thanks to good nursing be making very satisfactory progress although still far too weak ill to be able to rise from bed meanwhile be able to see by simply looking out of bedroom window that barracouta be being rapidly refitted so rapidly indeed that conjectured ricardo must have made point of always keeping entire spare set of mast spar rigging sail on hand in readiness for such emergency a have arisen in connection with fight with francesca at length when have be ashore nearly fortnight noticed that brig be once more ataunto apparently ready for sea same night ricardo entered room having made exhaustive enquiry a to state of health took seat by bedside with air of man who purposed to indulge in long chat last fortnight have done wonder for said thanks to unremitting care of lotta mammy think will now be able to pull round without further attention from fonseca that reminds to tell that go to sea at dawn to morrow of course fonseca go with assures that now need nothing good nursing good feeding to restore completely lotta mammy will be able to give will not mind leaving in charge hope oh said not at indeed have to thank for quite extraordinary amount of kindness must scarcely have done more for have be father think so said good be glad to hear say that because ah well be useless to think of now by way be mother still living be when last heard from home said hope will live for many long year to come say amen to answered extraordinary man when next see say that dick courtenay saved life for sweet sake tell also that despite everything be said against be innocent will understand what mean will believe perhaps after year ah continued springing to foot striding up down room if have believed at time must never have become what now be have have faith in must have borne everything else shame disgrace dishonour ruin must have borne when to loss of be added loss of esteem respect love be too much have nothing left to live for save revenge by heaven have have fill of do actually mean to say that be once mother lover gasped ay answered bitterly accepted lover must have be husband for accursed villainy of one who why speak of mischief be done be irremediable surely pretend to suggest that father ejaculated

consummate villainy a ever dragged honour of british naval officer in mire pshaw let speak of other thing suppose have wondered what be ultimate intention toward have not well will tell once reproached with having ruined professional career dear boy have fear of anything of kind be misfortune not fault that be too strong for if sir timothy tompion oh yes in answer to look of surprise know sir timothy quite well know think doe if sir timothy have only known that be sending out to fight barracouta must have given if not bigger ship at least twice a heavy armament twice a strong crew so when come to hear story will not blame for failing to take have fear of therefore because feel convinced that ill success in fight with will in nowise prejudice professional prospect be intention being well to take to sea with next trip put ashore somewhere whence can easily make way to port royal else to put aboard first ship bound for kingston that may chance to fall in with to provide against possibility of fortune going awry have decided to make heir therefore stop moment please think can guess what must say that positively refuse to have anything to do with wealth acquired by robbery murder quite right dear boy be precisely what must expect ay wish to say when be englishman sometimes used to hear people say that circumstance alter case be one of wealth propose to bequeath to have not be acquired by through objectionable practice came to through merest accident nobody be aware of existence save lotta if be indeed pirate hoard a be not at unlikely there be nothing to prove such be case assuming for moment that be so be there anything to tell name of pirate who got together name of from whom took in case if be spoil of pirate gang must have operated about hundred year ago since be now all undoubtedly dead gone a also be from whom be taken have a much right to a anybody may a well have lotta will show where lie concealed since will never make use of be at liberty to help to whole of a soon a please there be one thing more wish to say to be about lotta by way what do think of lotta interrupted to enquire think be sweetest most charming most lovely girl have ever lived exclaimed enthusiastically for have fully availed myself of opportunity for making acquaintance have fallen over head ear in love with although have hitherto refrained from saying so because be not love story one of adventure ah exclaimed ricardo grimly yes see inevitable have happened well well have nothing to say against will mother unless have greatly altered since knew however to revert to lotta be afraid that without in least intending have done that poor girl very serious wrong fell in with boat in mammy two spanish sailor be starving just a light air of wind have dropped to dead calm a matter of fact drifted right up alongside boat so that became impossible to avoid taking who be living out of even pirate have gentle moment occasionally sight of four perishing of hunger of thirst in craft have literally drifted alongside be more than must endure therefore hauled up out of boat brought round cared for have be inmate of house ever since lotta seemed quite content to remain never murmured never expressed slightest desire for life different from be living ashore here where lotta be content mammy be supremely happy therefore well got fond of child resolutely refused to allow thought to turn in direction of sending away from coming have altered everything can see that when go will have to go too must never be happy here again without be certain moreover eye have be opened of late to great wrong have be doing be rich heiress ought now to be in possession of property therefore when return by time will doubtless be quite well again will give charge of lotta mammy ask to see that former be safely placed in care of guardian while be away time will arrange plan by matter can be brought about will explain everything to upon return now think have said everything have to say will therefore bid good night good bye since will sail at daybreak hand included will sleep aboard to night hope that when return will probably be in about month from now will find quite well strong again a ricardo pronounced last word rose with evident intention of going one moment please said hastily pray go just yet have be doing talking thus far now wish to say word two by mean answered with laugh a resumed seat say on promise very best attention now that came to point suddenly found hesitating have spoken upon spur of moment with very definite purpose in mind quite unexpectedly found entirely at loss for word at length seeing ricardo look of surprise at hesitation plunged desperately in medias re look here stammered be to say oh hang find very difficult to know how to begin want very particularly to say something to want to say if can without hurting feeling ricardo laughed grimly say on without fear remarked stop to pick choose word in time have be compelled to listen to word have seared very soul word drove desperate made what be can scarcely have anything to say will hurt more keenly than have be hurt already moreover have now grown callous so say on without fear intense concentrated bitterness with uttered last few word gave courage moreover felt certain that companion must recognise kindly feeling actuated so without more ado proceeded what wish to say be have somehow contrived to convey to mind impression that be very deeply injured man that have be driven to adoption of present mode of life by great terrible wrong moreover have be kind to lotta especially kind to lastly reference to former friendship with mother have be such that have be impossible for to avoid feeling very deeply interested in now why must not abandon present mode of life say that posse treasure have come into possession by perfectly honest mean to to use own word have a much right a anybody why not take that treasure then go away to part of world where be not known there begin life afresh ah said ricardo have asked that question more than once without obtaining satisfactory answer to must like to do so be possible for be very heartily sick of life that be now leading there be time when soured embittered by a cruel wrong a man must inflict upon fellow man believed must find consolation if not actual happiness in wreaking of vengeance upon englishman whom must get into power whose wealth must take from by force time have long passed revenge believed must be so sweet have turned to dust ash in mouth now be so weary of life that bullet steel must rid of must be more welcome than other earthly thing when be too late have begun to realise full depth of villainy to see what contemptibly cowardly creature have be in permitting to seek ignoble method of revenge a piracy a said be now too late yes too late surely not broke in have forgotten homely old adage that be never too late to mend ' what have done can never be undone be true can be repented of reparation can be made if not directly to person injured yet by doing good to others where have opportunity will not think matter over again time with determination to arrive at right decision will think over certainly said a to arriving at right decision be a may be if can see way to decision may be that will take will consider matter while be at sea promise that wrong will be done during progress of cruise if can possibly help think can for always make point of confining navigation of ship strictly to myself nobody aboard ever know where be until choose to tell will therefore be easy for to take brig to spot where there be little chance of falling in with other craft then perhaps if can cruise for month six week without taking prize men may be content to accept share of booty disband especially a must tell that may divide own share between now good bye with many thanks for sympathy chapter eighteen treasure cave when awoke rather late next morning after somewhat troubled restless night traceable doubt to long conversation with barracouta have vanished nothing remained to mark late anchorage save buoy to have be moored now ensued period of almost perfect bliss to for have by time reached that precise stage of convalescence where danger be past yet in patient be still so very far from being well that must be waited upon hand foot tended with a much solicitude a though be utterly helpless babe such attention be afforded in most perfect acceptable form by lotta mammy small wonder be therefore that progress toward recovery be rapid in just month from day on barracouta sailed must find strong enough to admit of rising from bed donning clothes for hour two be now practically again save be so weak a to need support attempted to stand with lotta on one side mammy on other be soon able not only to totter from one room to even to get into garden for few minute sit there in comfortable basket chair drinking in renewed health strength with breath of soft warm deliciously perfumed air now began to look daily nay hourly for return of brig ventured to indulge in hope that when came must have satisfaction of learning that last conversation with ricardo have borne good fruit that have decided to abandon piracy to devote remainder of life to doing good a sort of atonement for countless shocking crime of have be guilty meanwhile strength came back to fast from moment when be able to get into open air within fortnight be practically former self again be scarcely needful to say that during long tedious period of convalescence have enjoyed many long confidential chat with lotta with mammy sometimes with together thus by time even lotta be fain to pronounce once more quite well in further need of nursing have very few secret from other have confided to earnest hope regarding ricardo in hope cordially joined also told what ricardo have said a to becoming heir taking possession of private hoard of treasure naturally led to arrangement being made for early visit to hiding place hiding place appeared be situated in large natural cavern in secluded spot on shore of bay be spot wherein ricardo have originally found hidden to have sound of very great insecurity lotta informed that so far be from being case well a knew locality of cavern be often greatly puzzled to find entrance at length on certain afternoon two set off to find mysterious hiding place inspect treasure according to lotta description promised to be of absolutely fabulous value passed down through garden for almost entire length then bore away through side path to left in order a companion explained that might avoid shipyard more particularly men working therein ricardo have most rigorously enjoined lotta on several occasion never to expose to view of men in wise remind of presence in settlement to speak truth be very strongly inclined to believe at event on particular occasion lotta be very much more anxious for safety than be for own be that a may avoided shipyard by simple process of passing along back of through ricardo private garden be compelled to say be astonished beyond measure at completeness of establishment a then saw for first time be perfect dockyard in miniature with warehouse capstan house mast house rigging shed sail loft in fact possible requisite for keeping not only one a many a three four craft in perfect order from what saw in passing judged that there must be at least fifty men regularly employed about place wonder that barracouta be busy ship depredation of most extensive character must need to be to maintain adequately such establishment in working order upon leaving precinct of garden plunged into wood completely veiled movement from men working in yard upon emerging from found at edge of low cliff down face of path zigzagged to beach yard now be completely hidden from from by jutting shoulder of cliff descending to beach found on narrow expanse of firm white sand whole of be evident be covered at high water be now so hard that scarcely left indication of footprint upon traversing for about quarter of mile entered sort of labyrinth of huge mass of sandstone have fallen to beach from time to time from steep now lofty cliff impended overhead here be most effectually sheltered from prying gaze by enormous mass of rock between wound devious way for perhaps hundred yard until lotta stopped with remark now dick have reached end of journey look about see whether can find entrance to cave have come to visit looked diligently round way must see absolutely nothing that in least degree resembled opening in rock at length somewhat impatiently said so neither do laughed companion will have to look for a usual be somewhere about here continued pointing to series of horizontal ledge ran along face of cliff just opposite where stood moving forward saw lotta stoop down to examine ledge then moved slowly along cliff face for distance of few yard when to amazement suddenly vanished before very eye sprang forward until reached spot at have disappeared be still unable to see anything of lotta cried anxiously where be what on earth have become of be here dick answered girl voice seeming to issue from ground at foot then for first time noticed that there be what appeared to be slight dip in inner edge of ledge upon closer inspection proved to be fissure just wide enough for man to squeeze through be into fissure lotta have dropped promptly followed presently when eye have become accustomed to dim twilight of place found that be in small cave like hollow of rocky cliff measuring about eight foot in direction floored with very fine dry sand of treasure there be sign must discover in direction unless be artfully concealed in one more of many small hole recess saw here there in rocky wall lotta observed perplexity laughed heartily well dick where be treasure banteringly demanded surely be not so very difficult to find now that have be told of existence oh will find never fear young woman answered confess that be so ingeniously concealed that doubt whether anyone ignorant of existence must find except by most extraordinary accident therewith proceeded to grope feel about in various fissure cavity with rocky wall of small cavern be honeycombed without success at length to great chagrin be obliged to abandon search confess beaten yet be very simple when know remarked lotta in high glee at discomfiture follow dropping upon hand knee proceeded to crawl into one of cavity have be searching must have declared be not nearly capacious enough to receive full grown man nevertheless lotta completely disappeared within after when have fairly entered cavity found that what have appeared to be back wall gave appearance of being only about two foot in depth be really one of two side wall narrow passage turning sharp off to right just wide enough high enough to travel through comfortably on one hand knee wound round in what seemed to to be about half circle of about fifty yard in diameter inner end gave access to enormous cavern very roughly circular in shape about four hundred foot across in direction be most extraordinary place one of peculiarity be that instead of being pitchy dark a one must naturally expect to be in such place whole interior be suffused with very soft greenish twilight quite strong enough when one eye became accustomed to to permit one to see from one end of cavern to other with quite tolerable distinctness where light came from be impossible to say for roof of cavern appeared to be formed like wall of solid rock from fact that shaft of light be plainly visible overhead issuing from wall roof conjectured that light entered cavern through rift in rock that greenish tinge be imparted to by foliage through filtered prior to passage through rift greater surprise be in store for presently discovered that wall be literally covered with sculptured figure of men animal done in high relief about life size sculpture appeared to be record of hunting fighting episode be executed with great vigour skill in reply to astonished enquiry lotta informed that ricardo attributed work to original carib very probably be right treasure be neatly arranged in recess near narrow passage by have entered cavern pretty careful inspection of soon convinced that ricardo have be only speaking truth when assured that although be probably booty of dead gone gang of pirate have certainly have hand in accumulation for everything bore unmistakable evidence of having lain where be for great many year probably at least hundred if one might judge by date on few of coin examined formed part of treasure man who accumulated store must have be individual of very enterprising nature for there be great pile of strong solid wooden case packed to brim with doubloon piece of eight two hundred eighty five gold brick weighing about forty pound brick encased in original raw hide wrapper in be brought down from mine now hard dry shrivelled quite large pile of rough shapeless ingot of gold silver conveying suggestion that at various time large quantity of gold silver plate jewellery have be run through melting pot finally leather bag containing not far short of peck measure of gem of conceivable description of stone being cut evidently taken from piece of jewellery of various kind have probably be broken up melted have not most remote idea of value of whole be convinced that must be something fabulous afterwards learned that be right spent nearly two hour in cave partly because there be so much of interest there to engage attention partly because of delightfully cool temperature be positive luxury after extreme heat of house by day by night before left cave to return to house lotta jestingly proposed that must stock place with provision use a place of abode whenever heat became unduly oppressive although suggestion be made more in jest than in idea became so attractive when proceeded to discus further that on following day actually took step to carry out proposal spent best part of day in stocking cavern with provision rug so on to extent that must easily have endured week siege there have be necessary for good supply of excellent water have be found percolating through rock in small side passage off main cavern thereafter regularly spent great part of day in cavern always making rule to take with little more of everything than really needed at length when period of two full month have elapsed since sailing of barracouta with sign of return began to feel somewhat anxious be now practically a well in health a have ever be in life began to pine for return to active service be also desirous of seeing lotta safely removed from present dubious somewhat dangerous surroundings into position be hers by right to achieve two result be necessary must get away from where be either by fulfilment of ricardo promise to by other mean to get away from where be a expression occurred to suddenly remembered that have not faintest idea where be since lotta be a ignorant a be on subject determined to ascertain by mean exactly where little paradise of spot be situated a first step toward ascertained roughly latitude of spot by mean of quadrant found in ricardo room a result of discovered be undoubtedly somewhere on island of cuba since there be only two spot on coast line of island must possibly have precise latitude very soon managed by reference to one of ricardo chart to determine that rendezvous be on north side of island nay be able without difficulty to identify precise spot on chart week passed still with sign of return of barracouta impatience to get back to civilisation friend grew so acute be seriously entertaining idea of stealing boat from dockyard making escape in only consideration caused to hesitate be that a fully intended to take lotta mammy with did not care to expose to peril discomfort of boat voyage until other resource have failed few more day have passed when about two o'clock one morning be rudely awakened by individual who have entered room be roughly shaking by shoulder started up in bed quickly gathering confused wit together recognised voice be addressing a of fonseca surgeon of barracouta hullo fonseca exclaimed where in name of fortune have sprung from be barracouta in yes senor grenvile answered have just arrived at peril of life took advantage of bustle confusion attendant upon coming to anchor to slip quietly over side swim ashore in order may warn to rise at once make escape while may taking senorita old woman with if must save life be perhaps even dearer than life to senorita why ejaculated a sprang out of bed started groping for material with to strike light have happened then that must be necessary for to fly for life ricardo be stop exclaimed fonseca laying hand upon arm a be about to light candle do that must dress make preparation in darkness for must dominique see house lighted a must scarcely fail to do must leave everything come ashore at once rather than that senorita must slip through finger yes ricardo be dead have sighted nothing in shape of sail from time that left here a result of men rapidly grew discontented dominique juan who have long be jealous of ricardo envious of power took advantage of incited crew to mutiny precious pair made way to ricardo cabin murdered in sleep then when dead body have be first exhibited to men afterwards tossed overboard dominique offered a captain in place of ricardo a happened to be only reliable navigator among be chosen with juan a lieutenant that done be decided to abandon cruise forthwith bear up for rendezvous in order to lay in fresh stock of necessary before undertaking cruise soon discovered that so far a dominique be concerned restocking of ship be only pretext to enable to return here at once for quite purpose namely to put effectually out of way by drawing knife across throat to posse of senorita now dominique be villain without single redeeming trait of character there be love lost between therefore since have taken something of fancy to have desire to see senorita lotta victim of such consummate scoundrel blackguard a dominique determined to give word of warning if possible here be now know where senorita can hide yourselves hide must that forthwith for friend dominique may turn up at moment if find lady here earthly power can save think that perhaps if be to take to wood for time must be best plan must help so far a lay in power by be good fellow fonseca interrupted grasping hand will not forget what have done to night know of place where think can hide safely for day two will take senorita mammy there with look here why must not join must surely be quite tired of leading life a tired broke in tired be not word to express loathing of never liked must never have have anything to do with if must have helped be compelled by ricardo to join have never since have chance to escape well have one now if care to join said while have be talking brain have be working have already thought of scheme for getting away from here will join most willingly senor answered fonseca will stand by through thick thin must succeed in enabling to escape eternal gratitude will be yours very well then said be settled now if have valuable among personal belonging in quarter ashore here that particularly wish to take away with be off at once get then rejoin here a for must go call mammy at once direct to arouse warn senorita now be off with return a quickly a possible so saying hustled out forthwith hastened away to little room knew be occupied by negress entered without ceremony arousing old creature acquainted a briefly a possible with situation of affair directed to arouse lotta forthwith then returned to room have be occupying be actually ricardo own sleeping apartment busied in collecting together half dozen chart be scattered about room thought might be useful a well a ricardo quadrant copy of current nautical almanac by time have got one two other matter together fonseca have returned few minute later lotta mammy appeared latter loaded with huge bundle of wrap spare clothing belonging to beloved mistress having enquired whether be now ready for instant flight received prompt affirmative reply gave word to evacuate premise forthwith filed out into garden shaping course for treasure cave have determined must be place of refuge until must perfect plan for effecting escape a happened be not moment too soon for have traversed little more than length of garden when sound of voice in somewhat boisterous conversation not far ahead first brought to abrupt halt then caused to retire precipitately from path to shelter of coffee bush close at hand behind silently crouched until speaker have passed on up path be dominique juan somewhat worse for drink consequently speaking in considerably louder key than be in least degree necessary a passed pursued way up toward house be not at difficult to divine from conversation fate have planned for lotta a well a for moment that be far enough beyond to permit of doing so with safety again emerged upon path down pursued way silent a shadow arriving ten minute later at point where became necessary for to turn off through wood on way toward cave at point paused for moment to look back at house a did so noticed faint light suddenly appear in one of room friend dominique juan have evidently arrived there be lighting up place prior a doubtless fondly anticipated to giving pleasant little surprise a continued to watch light suddenly grew brighter have found lamp lighted be now in room have be wont to occupy minute later light vanished from that particular room almost immediately showed from window of from position conjectured must be that lotta have occupied that flight have by time be discovered seemed pretty evident for house be rapidly lighted up in room be not difficult to conjecture that two half drunken ruffian be prosecuting heated vigorous search for missing one that be actually case soon became evident from fact that french casement of room have be mine suddenly flew open man whom presently identified a juan came staggering stumbling down path at run alternately yelling curse at missing one shouting to person person unknown to come up to house forthwith a bird have flown whereupon swung quickly upon heel plunging into wood hastened after companion whom overtook just a be about to enter cave arrived at destination lighted candle for few minute to enable to make such hasty preparation a be absolutely necessary then stretching out upon soft sandy floor composed ourselves to finish slumber have be so rudely interrupted chapter nineteen audacious scheme seemed that have scarcely closed eye ere be aroused by mammy who informed that be broad daylight that breakfast be quite ready whereupon starting to foot shaking fine sand from clothing looked at watch be amazed to discover that be nearly eight o'clock accordingly hurried away to spot at spring gushed out of rock hastily performed ablution returned to where others awaited before falling to upon most appetising meal mammy have prepared from various viand with have so luckily stocked place everything be cold of course for now that flight be known must never have done to risk lighting fire for mere pleasure of having hot chocolate for breakfast lest errant wreath of smoke must betray locality of hiding place lead to search might possibly result in capture cold though meal be be none le welcome when have finished rose to foot with announcement intended to go forth upon reconnoitring expedition against decision lotta at once protested most vigorously in protest be joined by fonseca who very generously offered to go in stead declared that in untoward event of unavoidable encounter with of men consequence to must certainly be fatal while for must probably amount to nothing worse than somewhat severe cross questioning a to how managed to get ashore without using boat be reason for such extraordinary haste question believed must answer satisfactorily without difficulty be anxious to get information at first hand to see everything with own eye in order might be able to frame plan with certainty therefore put aside objection forbidding of to leave cave until return sallied forth observing possible precaution against being seen being taken unawares upon emerging from entrance to cave after having first taken most careful look round made way with much circumspection to crown of high knoll ness jutting out little way into bay from believed must be able to get good view of yard ascertain in first instance what might be happening in direction crest of knoll be crowned with thick tolerably extensive clump of bush screened by hoped to be able to see hear anything might happen to be transpiring among various shed at same time to keep eye upon brig where lay at buoy about mile from shore when however reached hiding place be disappointed to find be considerably farther away from wharf building than have expected that while must see pretty well what be happening down there a well a command excellent view of brig must hear nothing save occasional shout be even more upon what must hear than upon what must see depended for necessary information upon to base plan there be spot at distance down front of slope thought must suit purpose admirably if must only reach without being seen at once determined to make attempt be somewhat peculiarly shaped outcrop of rock with hollow in middle of believed that if must gain shelter without discovery must be able to see from nearly a well a from where be while must certainly be able to hear very much better only question be how to get there after very carefully examining surroundings from shelter of screen of bush came to conclusion that only plan must be to descend to beach again by way have come enter wood a though intended to return to house skirt until came very nearly to far end when by concealing in thick extensive bed of fern might reasonably hope to gain desired spot without very great difficulty danger accordingly having first carefully looked about to assure need not fear being seen cautiously emerged from hiding place a cautiously made way down to beach again from be easy to gain shelter concealment of wood ten minute found heedless of danger of snake bite painfully wriggling way through bed of fern lifting head above frond occasionally to make sure be steering straight course twenty minute later saw safely ensconced in hiding place from must see hear distinctly without being seen for nearly hour appeared a though have have trouble for nothing for people on wharf in shed seemed to be going about regular daily business with perfect deliberation entire absence of hurry be so characteristic of spanish seaman be beginning to consider seriously question whether after might not be advisable for to endeavour to approach house even perhaps enter in quest for information when saw dominique juan suddenly appear upon wharf enter small dinghy in pulled off to brig then a tiny craft approached barracouta few figure appeared on deck by time that dinghy reached brig side hand seemed to have mustered on deck evidently have be taking matter easy aboard to celebrate return to harbour almost immediately after arrival of new captain lieutenant on board boatswain whistle sounded minute later gig cutter be lowered hand apparently got into gave way for shore ten minute later landed on wharf drew up into semblance of rank file noticed that man carried brace of pistol a well a usual long murderous looking knife in belt then juan stepped forward started to ring large bell be suspended from gallows like arrangement immediately number of men came swarming out from various shed formed up facing comrade who have just come ashore from brig carefully counted last found that including dominique juan mustered forty two others totalled up to fifty six when last man appeared to have presented dominique gave order call over roll if please senor juan therewith juan drawing roll from pocket proceeded to call man by name briefly responded by declaring to be present then man apparently having be accounted for dominique stepped forward said lad have called off from regular work morning to engage in man hunt rather hunt for two woman two men will not need to be reminded by that one of chief most recent cause of dissatisfaction with ricardo be extraordinary behaviour in connection with young sprig of naval officer whom captured when engaged british war schooner francesca instead of heaving young cub overboard to shark a ought to have done late chief for extraordinary reason never condescended to explain to chose to keep young fellow alive not only so also to give surgeon strictest injunction to nurse back to health be so totally at variance with usual practice that a have already explained to of there must only be one reason for that reason have never have slightest doubt be that have formed plan to betray into hand of british by saving young officer life hoped not only to use a channel of negotiation with british authority also to purchase immunity from punishment for having secured must seize earliest opportunity after execution to return here quietly posse of immense hoard of treasure that have accumulated by year of toil peril be because be thoroughly convinced of did away with ricardo for be life ours hung in balance be not sufficient to put ricardo out of way of doing mischief young english officer remained still remains until also be removed there can be safety for one of be knowledge caused to abandon cruise return here now what do find why that senorita lotta old nurse have disappeared now want to note particularly significance of last fact that not only have three disappeared so have fonseca what doe mean why without doubt mean that surgeon also be in plot with ricardo against that have also to reckon with how when disappeared can not tell know that be with in brig when executed ricardo must therefore have slipped ashore in mysterious manner immediately upon arrival have warned englishman who thereupon must have taken to flight carrying off girl nurse fonseca with be four person want to hunt down bring back to rendezvous can not have gone very far can not get away for a of be aware be impossible to make one way very far inland from here be completely shut in on landward side by inaccessible cliff englishman doe not know be by mean certain that girl surgeon know be therefore of opinion that will be found endeavouring to make way into back country by way of false gap want therefore to spread yourselves in such way that one of must inevitably find either by overtaking by intercepting on return when find impossible to escape landward will go with a measure of precaution juan with dozen men will secrete in house yonder in order must by strange chance miss fugitive may be taken when return to house a must sooner later in search of food one man will remain here on wharf a watchman look out not that think there be slightest likelihood of fugitive coming way be good generalship to take possible precaution if jose who be to remain here must chance to sight of runaway just ring yard bell wait for in house to join now men hope understand four person must be found brought back to englishman alive dead other three must be brought back to alive girl at least absolutely uninjured remember in case of fonseca le be injured more acutely will suffer from punishment intend to inflict upon for treachery now forward to house first from there spread yourselves over country in direction of false gap march thereupon whole party with exception of one solitary individual whom took to be jose who be told off to keep watch ward upon wharf filed off along wharf up pathway led to house from have fled few hour before took twenty minute to reach bungalow ten minute later saw mob of men issue from disappear inland for few minute shout must be heard a called to other then dead silence fell upon scene broken only by chirping chirring of myriad of insect haunted bushy growth with whole face of country be covered occasional call of bird a for jose first act upon being left to be to scrutinise carefully whole face of visible country under sharp of hand then seat in shadow of capstan house light pipe abandon to soothing influence of weed now happening of last hour have set thinking hard first of there be dominique remark about impossibility of anyone escaping inland during period of convalescence have seen enough of country while wandering about in lotta company to convince that statement might be quite true although lotta have never said word to lead to believe that be aware that be so if there be possibility of escaping landward only alternative be to escape by going out to sea boat voyage be undertaking not to be rashly entered upon especially where woman be in case inconvenience discomfort to say nothing of danger of such attempt be such a to make pause long consider matter very seriously in bearing before determining to engage in such venture yet something must be done must not continue to inhabit cavern indefinitely way of escape must be found for after what have fallen from dominique lip while addressing men felt that there be such thing a safety for of while remained within arm reach of miscreant most serious feature of case so far a boat voyage be concerned be that even biggest of available boat be one of barracouta gig be much too small to justify in attempt to make passage to jamaica in for must breeze happen to pipe strong boat must not possibly live in boisterous sea must at once be knocked up if on other hand brig longboat have happened to be in water other craft big enough to accomplish voyage in safety pulled up suddenly for distinctly audacious idea have at moment occurred to a well worthy of consideration why not take brig true be big craft for two men to handle if must be got safely out to sea beyond reach of pursuit by boat must be sailed under such short canvas one man must take care of for whole watch without very much difficulty trouble must be to get aboard get under way take out to sea without being detected pursued unless here pulled up again for audacious idea have occurred to looked at jose appeared to be in distinctly drowsy condition if indeed not already asleep overpowered by heat lulled to slumber by unwonted quiet of surroundings then looked carefully around to see whether must detect trace of man hunter saw none be undoubtedly well out of way by time pulled together braced up for immediate action for suddenly dawned upon be never likely to have more favourable opportunity to carry bold scheme into effect than at moment presented to quietly emerged from place of concealment once more crouching low among fern crept slowly with infinite caution toward somnolent jose gradually working way round until must just see clear of corner of capstan house twenty minute of work brought right up to gable end of building from position again reconnoitred jose be unmistakably fast asleep therefore practically at mercy a have intention of killing man if must possibly avoid so extreme measure must have wherewithal to bind securely must undoubtedly be obtained in capstan house therefore removed shoe carrying in hand stole on tiptoe round corner of building keeping wary eye on sleeper a did so presently slipped noiselessly in through open door found in long spacious apartment abundantly stored with ponderous hempen cable hawser anchor of various size pile of sail neatly stopped up quantity of chain of various kind coil of rope sufficient appeared to to fit new gang of running rigging to dozen ship like barracouta bundle of block single double threefold sister dangling from beam in fact almost conceivable article must possibly be needed in fitting out of ship there be part of coil of brand new ratline close to hand must serve purpose admirably therefore whipped out knife cut off a much a required seized double handful of oakum belaying pin with to form gag cut off length of marline with to secure gag in place then having made running bowline in end of length of ratline stole still in stocking foot to door very cautiously peered out at man be sound asleep seated on ground with back propped against wall of capstan house leg stretched out straight in front of arm hanging limply at side with back of hand resting on ground turned palm upward head sunk on breast pipe fallen from mouth lying in lap silently stealthily crept toward until stood by side then without pausing moment dropped noosed ratline over shoulder at same moment grabbing by collar dragging forward to allow noose to drop to middle hauling taut a did so thus confining arm to side then a opened mouth with evident intention of letting out yell popped belaying pin wrapped in oakum into mouth at same time hissing into ear be silent a value life then turning over on face rapidly trussed up in such fashion felt confident must never get free again unaided finally dragged inside capstan house adjusting gag in such manner while not interfering unduly with comfort must effectually prevent from raising alarm then having assured have nothing to fear from hurried off made best of way to cave where found occupant suffering greatest uneasiness in consequence of prolonged absence few hasty word from sufficed to put in possession of plan then gathering up such few personal belonging a have brought with left cavern hurried away to wharf managed to reach unobserved temporarily concealed in capstan house where jose be found still safely trussed up then leaving lotta fonseca mammy in building sallied out to make final arrangement hoped to do without interference since part of wharf where be operating be not visible from house there be of course risk that in house might at moment take into head to come down to wharf to see how jose be faring be therefore of utmost importance that what have to do must be done quickly walked to edge of wharf looked over two gig cutter of barracouta be lying alongside other at flight of step about dozen fathom away only other boat must see afloat lying just astern of there be several boat hauled up high dry on wharf must need thinking about with reference to scheme have in mind slipping down landing step cast adrift three out of four boat re moored in string one to stern of so that by manning leading boat must tow others after then returned to capstan house proceeded to look for carpenter maul quickly found be now ready for what fondly hoped must prove to be last act in little drama be about to give word to march when fonseca who appeared to have be speaking to jose stayed senor grenvile said have just be exchanging few remark with friend jose here who have made certain representation to that think demand consideration quite understands of course that be about to attempt to escape fully recognises that have power to prevent contends that if go off leave here dominique will certainly torture to death a punishment for permitting to be taken by surprise from what know of dominique be afraid poor jose have only too good reason for apprehension that being case implores to take with even if afterward deliver up to authority since must infinitely rather be hanged than remain here at mercy of dominique what say senor do feel inclined to accede to request looked at jose poor wretch be evidently in paroxysm of terror be muttering eagerly behind gag while gazed up at with eye be eloquent with pleading take gag out of mouth said let hear what have to say upon first attempt to raise voice brain with belaying pin must have trifling now fonseca at once removed gag jose instantly burst forth with perfect torrent of prayer for mercy intermingled with most earnest graphic representation of what must happen to if left behind must take with willingly jose said if must be assured that must be faithful to oh senor doubt implore take with senor if feel that can not trust put in iron when get on board swear to senor will indeed be faithful to take senor try very well said will must not expect to trust too much at first therefore fonseca put gag back into mouth for moment then cast foot adrift so that can walk down to boat instead of being carried while be doing will take final look outside attend to certain little matter before leave so saying picked up maul walked out of building careful look round satisfied that there be nobody in sight a for party up at house be about time for midday meal be probably getting therefore made way to spot where hauled up boat be lying deliberately smashed in two three of bottom plank of thus rendering quite unserviceable for moment then returning to capstan house gave word to march whole party now five in number including jose filed across wharf down step into leading gig painter be cast off fonseca taking oar apiece pushed off with other three boat in tow made way slowly toward brig then suddenly dreadful apprehension seized by jove fonseca exclaimed have never thought of until moment what be going to happen if there be people left aboard brig have be quite taking for granted that hand came ashore morning of course can not be at sure that did presume did not by chance notice senor precisely how many men landed did demanded fonseca yes said did including dominique juan numbered forty two forty two repeated fonseca now just let think considered for about minute then said so far a can remember senor forty two must include hand same will not be amiss to approach ship warily get aboard if possible noiselessly then once aboard can soon ascertain whether anyone be there if perchance there must be can not be more than one two at most whom can probably overpower if once get footing on deck few minute later opened out house clear of wood kept eye on wondering how long must be ere must attract attention of juan with must have seen almost immediately for in le than minute saw dozen men rush out on to gallery that ran round building stand staring straight at evidently talking excitedly together while then a with one accord set off racing down path at breakneck speed toward wharf shouting to gesticulating wildly a ran took matter very quietly knowing that there be not boat left must swim a believed must be made to swim without couple of hour work being done upon then turned gaze toward brig for argued that since cry reached quite distinctly must also reach brig if anyone have be left aboard cry must soon create alarm might expect to see movement on board saw nothing craft maintained appearance of being absolutely deserted five minute later stole up alongside quietly scrambled aboard by way of main chain chapter twenty how adventure ended a dropped in over rail alighted upon deck flung quick glance along fore aft in search of trace of occupation there be nothing to indicate that anyone have be left on board stole forward listened intently at fore scuttle there be sound of movement down in forecastle must catch suggestion of deep breathing snoring a must probably have be case have anchor watch be left on board ignoring responsibility gone below turned in determined to make quite sure swung leg over coaming quietly dropped down into close pungent smelling place for moment must see nothing for only light entering forecastle came down through hatch eye be dazzled with brilliant light of outer world presently sight came to saw that bunk hammock be empty that apartment contained nothing more dangerous than heterogeneous assortment of clothes boot oilskin other article common to seaman therefore made way on deck again ran aft where encountered fonseca just emerging from cabin where like have be on exploring expedition like mine have proved fruitless a met exchanged news eye wandered away shoreward noticed that juan companion have reached wharf seemed to be busying about one of upturned boat have taken precaution to stave upon getting ship glass have difficulty in discovering that be busily engaged in attempt to patch up make serviceable with evident intention of coming in pursuit of by jove fonseca exclaimed must bestir fellow may nab after jump down into gig cast jose adrift bid come aboard instantly have not moment to lose a spoke made dash at trysail brail cast off proceeded to drag upon fall of outhaul tackle presently fonseca returned with jose lent hand with will latter seeming to be quite a anxious a of to avoid being taken by former companion then rushing forward laid out on jib boom cast loose inner jib fonseca jose at once proceeded to hoist then hauling jib sheet over to windward cast off slip by brig be a usual secured to buoy then ran aft put helm hard down brig be now adrift with stern way on with helm hard down soon paid off when hauled aft lee jib sheet at once began to forge ahead unfortunately for be almost dead beat of nearly two mile out to sea with not very much room to manoeuvre in if therefore people ashore happened to be specially handy with tool might yet get boat repaired in time to give trouble for smart ship a barracouta undoubtedly be small amount of sail now have set be only sufficient to put along at about two knot in hour barely to give steerage way carried main topmast staysail be fine big sail stay reaching from main topmast cross tree down to foremast within about ten foot of deck sail now got on with great advantage speed at once increasing to nearly four knot under canvas soon found that griped rather badly be to say required undue amount of weather helm to hold straight to course therefore loosed set fore topmast staysail after not only practically steered further increased speed to not far short of five knot have now a much canvas set a three men must very well manage quite enough to keep going so soon a must get outside only anxiety be lest must have trouble with people before must pas out clear of head into open ocean once there knew that must easily run away from rowboat that must launch reminded that have le than four boat towing behind that retarded speed to quite perceptible extent summoning fonseca jose to assistance therefore showing lotta how to manipulate helm in such manner a to keep brig going through water hauled up first one gig then other succeeded in hoisting to davit other two also hauled alongside dropping couple of cold shot through bottom cast adrift by time that be done have drawn well over toward southern shore of bay moment have arrived for to heave in stay be just little anxious a to manoeuvre having doubt a to whether brig must stay under such short canvas a now have set upon putting helm down apprehension be at once set at rest for came round like top be fully confirmed in conviction that must be unwise to attempt to get more canvas on vessel for although trysail worked two stay sail jib proved to be quite a much a three men must well manage having made long leg across bay now have to make short one sooner be round than took look at juan party through telescope just to see how be getting on to amazement appeared to have already executed sort of repair of boat that have be working upon for a brought glass to bear upon saw that have turned over be carrying down to water edge with evident intention of launching while stood watching actually got afloat then while one man got into immediately started baling remaining five hurried off to wharf disappearing into one of shed presently reappeared carrying oar boat hook rudder bottom board stretcher other matter of boat furniture carried down to where boat be lying having placed in position jumped in pushed off by jove fonseca be after already exclaimed now if have managed to make good repair of boat will overhaul before can get clear of bay will mean fight for certainly mean to give in if can help if can muster dozen musket few round of ammunition ought to be able to keep fellow from coming alongside having advantage of deck to fight from see know well what be about be not attempting to follow be pulling straight for entrance keeping close under lee of land yes see answered fonseca a took telescope from applied to eye see also senor that one man be kept busy baling with bucket so be evident that boat leak badly may be that before can overtake will be obliged to give up go back to save boat from swamping under possibly agreed nevertheless think must be only wise of to take reasonable precaution therefore will feel obliged if will be good enough to go below look out dozen musket will doubtless know where to find having found load with ball bring up on deck to certainly senor there will be difficulty about assented fonseca will go at once forthwith vanished down companion way quarter of hour later returned with six loaded musket in arm deposited upon stern grating then went below for remaining half dozen meanwhile have be slipping quite nimbly across bay by time fonseca have returned with second lot of musket have neared land sufficiently to render necessary for to heave about again by time that have tacked be full again boat have neared to within about mile became practical certainty that unless something quite unforeseen occurred must be obliged to fight passage out to sea be now making long leg again leaving boat almost astern of going at least a fast through water a be if not somewhat faster then a stood at wheel steering with thought wandering away into past idea suddenly entered head said to fonseca by way fonseca can tell whether be brig that six month ago attacked little schooner called dolores over on guinea coast after taking cargo of slave out of scuttled in cold blood leaving survivor of crew to go down with man looked at in consternation why how on earth did come to know of rascally transaction senor demanded because said happened to be in command of dolores at time be one of who be left to perish in be prize have be given charge of with order to take to sierra leone how extraordinary exclaimed pray how did manage to escape senor told whole story concluding by saying have have rod in pickle for brig ever since vowed then must find take having succeeded thus far be not going to allow to be baffled by dozen men in open boat when next went about saw that be heading well up for narrow passage formed entrance of bay boat have made such good progress that be quite open question whether brig must first reach believed that if must reach with lead of even so little a quarter of mile must get out without coming to blow must boat succeed in approaching closer than foresaw that must inevitably overtake in narrow must be very worst place possible for since be beating out against trade wind spot that be now approaching be so exceedingly narrow that there be scarcely width enough for even so smart vessel a barracouta to work in must sooner be about nicely gathering steerage way than down helm must have to go again must have hand quite sufficiently full in looking after ship just there without additional worry of being obliged to drive off boat therefore determined must there presently prove to be doubt about matter must edge away down upon boat have out with while still have room in to manoeuvre ship brig boat be now approaching other on course converged at about right angle boat being on lee bow drawing ahead at pace threatened to bring unpleasantly near if did not actually carry across forefoot a drew nearer noticed that despite continuous baling be going on aboard boat have settled so deeply in water that must scarcely hope to keep afloat half hour idea came to that if must avoid for length of time need fear further trouble from for must simply swamp with crew leave to swim for life carefully examined shore through telescope to see whether there be spot on pursuer must beach boat get rid of water by simple process of turning over pouring water out of must see such spot whole shore right out to narrow be steep to with confused fringe of great mass of rock upon must be quite impossible to haul up boat a two craft drew close together became increasingly doubtful whether must be able to avoid boat unless by adoption of especial measure at length saw when time must arrive for to heave in stay pursuer must have actually cut off therefore stood on until have arrived within about hundred yard of by time be dead ahead of lying upon oar waiting for to endeavour to pas when calmly put brig helm hard up instead of down wore round on other tack going back over pretty nearly same ground that have traversed few minute before to intense disgust disappointment of juan companion who have evidently quite made up mind that have fairly caught moment that manoeuvre have so far developed a to be understood occupant of boat sent up yell of execration began to shout manner of dreadful threat at while frantically strove to get crazy boat round in order to come after in chase soon became apparent that boat being in waterlogged condition oarsman almost worn out with fatigue pursuer have not ghost of chance of overtaking a well a recognised when be too late then dawned upon that might evade with utmost ease for practically a long a chose by simply repeating last manoeuvre until boat must sink under event by way must not much longer defer after pursuing therefore for nearly mile suddenly abandoned chase turning boat head in direction of wharf devoted effort to successful accomplishment of return did not wait to see how fared a soon a be fairly out of way tacked again hour later found fully employed in negotiating exceedingly difficult navigation of narrow successfully accomplished after several exceedingly close shave of rock border passage on hand hour of work sufficed to take clear when emerged into funnel shaped channel leading into open water of bahama channel be close upon eight bell of afternoon watch when finally went out clear of everything by time be quite ready for appetising meal mammy arrogating to herself duty of cook have prepared for in ship galley under short canvas took best part of three day to beat up to cape easternmost extremity of cuba safely weathered about four bell in forenoon watch on third morning after escape then weather being fine with wind well over port quarter for run through windward channel across to morant point ventured to get little more canvas on craft setting topsail quickened up speed to close on seven knot weather continuing fine through day succeeding night sighted broken water on formigas bank next morning at breakfast time passed quarter of hour later at noon of same day sighted morant point easternmost extremity of island of jamaica rounded two hour later pilot boarded about six bell off yallahs point finally entered port royal harbour let go anchor on very last of sea breeze just a bell of flagship be striking four in first dog watch now that have actually arrived must see that fonseca still more jose felt considerable amount of anxiety a to what be likely to befall in consequence of connection with so notorious formidable pirate a ricardo be able pretty well to reassure surgeon at least for have told story believed must not be very difficult for to satisfy authority that have be compelled to join pirate have never be permitted least chance to effect escape on rare occasion when barracouta have be obliged to call at ordinary port further there be fact to of course must bear personal testimony that have warned lotta of fate designed for by dominique rest after death of ricardo have most loyally aided to effect escape so far a jose be concerned did not feel quite so sure of being able to screen told that believed must at least ensure that punishment must not be more severe than involved in compulsory entry on board british man o war for too have loyally done fair share of work on passage round to port royal fellow however took care to leave nothing to chance for time during same night contrived to entice boat alongside in made way to kingston where vanished made attempt to go ashore otherwise communicate with admiral on night of arrival for have be on deck practically whole time of passage snatching hour two of sleep when how must felt now be entitled to must be better for thorough good night rest next morning be up betimes having breakfasted went ashore in shore boat presented for admittance at admiral office so a to catch a soon a old fellow must arrive from kingston prior to however have sighted identified little francesca lying about mile farther up harbour looking a smart saucy a though have never be mauled by pirate there be very few people moving so early in morning hastened to take shelter in office a be anxious to avoid meeting of former friend acquaintance until have first have interview with sir timothy be getting well on toward eleven o'clock when at length barge dashed up alongside wharf came bustling along toward office smartening up other person who did not seem to be infusing proper amount of energy into work a came along a entered heard office messenger say something to in low tone to responded what nonsense must be mistaken mooney else have be drinking morning not drop honour have passed lip mornin ' heard man answer furthermore sir gentleman inside minit waitin ' to see ye next moment sir timothy entered rose to foot well will be shot so be gasped then grasped by hand shook heartily exclaiming welcome back to port royal boy welcome back now sit down tell in dozen word for be frightfully busy morning where have be what have done with thereupon resumed seat spun yarn not in dozen word exactly a briefly a possible confining to statement of just leading fact incident reserving detail for more suitable occasion mentioned lotta ventured to ask sir timothy advice a to how must proceed in matter of procuring lodgment so on until trustee must be communicated with must be restored to charge oh a to answered sir timothy there need be difficulty at must dine with at pen to night of course so that can give yarn at full length have better bring young lady with lady mary be best person to decide what to do with accordingly that afternoon took lotta ashore with having looked in upon todd on way needle to say received most hospitable friendly welcome hired ketureen drove up to pen where lady mary having be previously prepared by husband forthwith took possession of carried off to own private room from reappeared more until dinner time when to amazement lotta be led forth to be presented to assembled company attired in rig lady mary maid have devised upon spur of moment in senorita looked so surpassingly lovely that sight of fairly took breath away sir timothy with inherent kindness of heart be one of most pronounced characteristic took care be hero of evening making spin yarn in detail to guest at end thereof awarding great deal more praise than be in least entitled to lotta slept at pen night after guest have left four be to say sir timothy lady mary lotta resolved into sort of council be ultimately arranged that lotta be to remain at pen a guest of lady mary sir timothy until trustee must be communicated with arrangement made with for to return take possession of home property meanwhile be to resume command of francesca in proceed to pirate rendezvous destroy place utterly making prisoner of who must be found about place of course taking care to bring back booty pirate might have be found to have accumulated be proper to say here did not consider necessary to mention to sir timothy anything about ricardo private store of treasure hidden in cave felt that ricardo have be perfectly right when said that have a good right a anybody to be quite determined that must be lotta mine to bring about result felt that best plan must be to keep whole matter to myself happened that francesca be quite ready for sea there be therefore nothing to wait for except few necessary article of clothing for accordingly within forty eight hour of arrival in port royal aboard barracouta be at sea again in schooner on way to demolish lair of pirate carrying on heavily arrived in bay on afternoon of second day out anchored in such position that not only wharf various shed also bungalow be within range of schooner gun then while one half of crew remained on board to take care of vessel guard against possibility of pirate playing off own trick upon stealing schooner other half armed to teeth accompanied ashore proceeded to collect convey to schooner booty of kind that must find seemed worth carrying off not pirate appeared to say nay indeed little investigation soon made apparent that act of running away with brig have caused to take alarm make escape in certain of boat have damaged plain evidence be discovered of fact that have hurriedly repaired four of boat have gone off carrying away with portable booty in shape of coin bullion jewellery etcetera leaving only that be too bulky to be stowed in boat found sufficient of latter however in shape of valuable merchandise to load schooner very nearly down to covering board having stowed safely away set fire to whole place never left until building including bungalow have be utterly destroyed thus ended long persistent pursuit of one of most pestilent formidable gang of pirate have haunted atlantic west indian water for many year there be very little more left to say sir timothy be good enough to award great deal more praise for conduct over affair than felt
