eased poor fellow mind upon point soon afterwards arrived alongside saint george found first lieutenant duly handed over despatch read with curious twitching about corner of mouth having mastered content retired below asking to wait minute two at moment attention be attracted to midshipman in main rigging who with exaggerated deliberation be making unwilling way aloft to mast head a turned out certain familiar something about young gentleman caused to look up at more attentively then at once recognised recent acquaintance lord fitz johnes at same moment second lieutenant who be eyeing

responded ci devant lord fitz johnes now plain mr tomkins in squeaky treble a made feeble momentary show of alacrity just then caught eye taking off hat made ironical bow of recognition to responded by pressing body against rigging pausing in upward journey to give due effect to ceremony spreading leg a widely apart a possible extending hand toward finger outspread thumb of right hand pressing gently against point of nose thumb of left interlinked with right hand little finger salute be made still more impressive by lengthened slow solemn twiddling of finger be only brought to end by second

second acquaintance lord tomnoddy by side a looked at felt strongly inclined to ask whether also have changed name since last meeting oh look here hawksbill commenced be glad have come on board wanted

in alluding to at to tell truth have taken rather liking for in spite of ah ahem be mean that struck a being first rate fellow notwithstanding little failing at have hinted be quite good enough way to pas muster without necessity for attempt to clothe with fictitious attribute of kind of course in ordinary run of event will soon be laughed out of weakness there be place equal to man of war for speedy cure of sort of thing process be often very painful one to patient have passed through so can speak from experience so very painful be to that even at risk of being considered impertinent have ventured to give friendly caution in hope that good sense will enable to profit by so save many bitter mortification now hope have not offended by mean lord replied grasping proffered hand on contrary be very sincerely obliged to at moment first lieutenant of saint george reappeared on deck coming up to with mr austin letter open in hand said friend mr austin writes that be quite out of egg on board daphne asks to lend couple of dozen here be take down for important despatch with out of midshipman on board have be intrusted be simply request for loan of two dozen egg sends to for instead of procuring from shore because be afraid may lose of boat crew evidently mr austin have not high opinion of that fondly imagined have be sorry to say can not oblige mr austin think can overcome difficulty if mind being delayed quarter of hour so have packet wish to send ashore if will give lord southdown here who seems to be friend of yours passage to hard off again will look after boat crew for whilst purchase egg of course acquiesced in proposal whereupon lord southdown be sent into captain cabin for packet in question on reappearance few minute later jumped into boat went ashore together lordship regaling on way with sundry entertaining anecdote whereof humorous friend tomkins be hero managed to execute respective errand without losing of boat crew duly putting lord southdown on board saint george again returned triumphantly to daphne with consignment of egg handed over intact to mr austin after dived below just in time to partake of first dinner provided for at expense of most gracious majesty george iv for remainder of day during whole of next until nearly ten o'clock at night be up to eye in business of completing store etcetera generally in getting ship ready for sea at daybreak on second morning after have joined fore topsail be loosed blue peter run up to fore royal mast head boat hoisted in stowed messenger passed after hand went to breakfast at nine o'clock captain gig be sent on shore at be skipper came off boat be hoisted up to davit canvas loosed anchor tripped away went down solent out past needle with slashing breeze at east south east stitch of canvas set from topgallant studding sail downwards chapter four boat excursion into congo skipper instruction be to effect that be in first instance to report to governor of sierra leone be to port therefore that now made best of way breeze with started carried handsomely down channel way across bay of biscay ship proving to be regular flyer everybody from skipper downwards be in very best of spirit then came change wind backing out from south west with squally weather placed at once upon taut bowline simultaneously with change of weather most disagreeable discovery be made namely that daphne be exceedingly crank ship however accomplished passage in little over three week after remaining at sierra leone for few hour only proceeded for mouth of congo off expected to fall in with fawn ship have be sent out to relieve proceeding under easy canvas in hope of picking up prize by way in hope so however be disappointed reached destination in twenty three day from sierra leone sighting fawn at daybreak closing with hour afterwards skipper came on board daphne remained to breakfast with captain vernon whom skipper being total stranger to coast posted up pretty thoroughly in current news a well a such of dodge of slaver a have happened to have picked up said that at moment there be ship in river intelligence whether trustworthy however must not state have reached of daily expected arrival of three ship from cuba also confirmed very extraordinary story have be told skipper by governor of sierra leone to effect that large cargo of slave known to have be collected on shore up river awaiting arrival of slaver have from time to time disappeared in most mysterious manner at time when a far a must be ascertained craft men o ' war be anywhere near neighbourhood at fawn filled away bore up for jamaica whither be to proceed preparatory to returning home to be paid off crew manning rigging giving parting cheer a did so two hour later royal dipped below horizon be left alone in glory on parting from fawn filled away again upon starboard tack wind being off shore at noon brought ship to anchor in nine fathom of water off padron point projecting headland on southern side of river mouth at distance of two mile only from shore order be then given for men to go to dinner a soon a meal must be got ready being understood that notwithstanding fawn assurance a to there being ship in river skipper intended to satisfy of fact by actual examination moreover deserted state of river afforded excellent opportunity for making unmolested exploration of making acquaintance so to speak in order at future time if occasion must arise might be able to make dash into without feeling that be doing so absolutely blindfold at pm gig be piped away mr austin being in charge with for aide hand being fully armed wind have by time died away to dead calm sun be blazing down upon a if determined to roast a sat have long pull before for although ship lay only two mile from shore have to round low spit called a mr austin informed shark point six mile away in north easterly direction before must be said to be fairly in river for point then away stretched perspiration streaming from men at pore fortunately tide have begun to make before started be therefore in favour have sounding line with used at frequent interval by aid ascertained that at distance of one mile from shore willowest water between ship shark point be about three half fathom at low water be at spot distant three half mile from point mile further on suddenly deepened water to forty five fathom at distance of only quarter of mile from point a rounded lead gave fifteen fathom shortly afterwards shoaling to six fathom depth be steadily maintained for distance of eight mile up river extent of exploration on occasion on return journey kept little further off shore found corresponding increase in depth of water result fully satisfied that need have hesitation about taking daphne inside must at time seem desirable so to do immediately abreast of shark point be extensive creek named banana creek hereabouts river be fully six mile wide on making out mouth of creek be first intention to have explored on rounding point fairly entering river made out so many snug likely looking opening on southern side that determined to confine attention to side first in first place immediately on rounding shark point discovered bay at back of roughly triangular in shape about four mile broad across base perhaps three mile deep from base to apex at further end of base of triangular bay descried mouth of creek at apex bottom of bay latter of examined first making discovery that mouth opening gave access to three creek instead of one be however too willow to admit anything drawing over ten foot even at high water land adjoining be also so low bush so stunted consisting almost exclusively of mangrove only partial concealment must have be effected unless ship upper spar be struck for occasion low rigged vessel such a felucca must indeed find complete shelter in of two westernmost creek easternmost have only three foot of water in when visited shore on side consisted only of brownish grey fetid mud of consistency little thicker than pea soup facility for embarking slave be so utterly wanting that felt sure need not trouble ourselves at future time about of creek other creek that have described a situated at further end of base of triangle forming bay be undoubtedly more promising though like others must only receive craft of small tonnage having little bar of own across mouth on at half tide be about time of visit there be only seven foot of water bank however be tolerably firm solid jungle be thicker higher though little more than cable length wide at mouth be nearly mile in width little further in branching off from right left there be three four other snug looking little creek wherein ship of light draught might lie a comfortably a if in dry dock wherein by simply sending down topgallant mast must be perfectly concealed mr austin must greatly have liked to land here explore bush bit on side of creek mission just then be to make rough survey of river rather than of bank so reluctantly made way back once more to broad rolling river pull of couple of mile close along shore brought to entrance of creek for length of two mile averaged quite mile wide when took sharp bend to right in southerly direction at same time narrowed down to le than quarter of mile in width for first two mile have plenty of water be to say there be never le than five fathom under keel with narrowing of creek shoaled rapidly so that by time have gone mile found in stream about hundred yard wide only six foot deep mangrove swamp however have ceased grassy bank shelving gently down to water on side ended in narrow strip of reddish sandy beach bush here be very dense vegetation extremely varied whilst foliage seemed to embrace literally colour of rainbow green of course predominated be of conceivable shade from pale delicate tint of young budding leaf to olive be almost black then there be ruddy bronze of leaf appeared just ready to fall thickly interspersed among green be large bush with long lance shaped leaf of beautifully delicate ashen grey tint others glowed in rich mass of flaming scarlet whilst others again have leaf thickly covered with short white sheeny satin like fur can not otherwise describe gleamed flashed in sun ray a though leaf be of polished silver of tree be thickly covered with blossom exquisite in form colour while a to passion plant other flowering creeper be here there everywhere in such countless variety a must have sent botanist into seventh heaven of delight that vast extent of jungle be not tenantless have frequent assurance in sudden sharp cracking of twig branch a well a other more distant more mysterious sound occasional glimpse of monkey be caught high aloft in gently swaying branch of forest giant bird of gorgeous plumage more le discordant cry constantly flitted from bough to bough swept in rapid flight across stream be so enchanted with beauty of secluded creek though time be flitting rapidly away mr austin must not resist temptation to push little further on notwithstanding fact that have already penetrated higher than ship even of small tonnage must possibly reach men nothing loath accordingly paddled gently ahead for mile at point discovered that tide be met stopped by stream of thick muddy fresh water creek river whichever choose to call have narrowed in until be only about hundred foot across water have shoaled to four foot tree in many place grew right down to water edge root of indeed be actually covered here there more lofty one leaning over stream on side mingled foliage overhead formed leafy arch completely excluding sun ray throwing that part of river overarched into deep green twilight shadow to eye have to become accustomed before be possible to see anything hundred yard ahead of there be long continuous tunnel formed in way on entering men with one accord rested on oar allowed boat to glide onward by own momentum whilst looked around lost in wonder admiration a shot into watery lane roll of oar in rowlock ceased silence became profound almost oppressively so marked emphasised a be by lap gurgle of water against boat planking not bird be here to be seen not even insect except mosquito by by soon began to swarm round in number amply sufficient to atone for absence of other life picture presented to view by long avenue of variegated foliage looped festooned in direction with flowery creeper loaded with bloom of most gorgeous hue deep green almost black shadow contrasted here there with long arrowy shaft of greenish light glancing down through invisible opening in leafy arch above lighting up into prominence feathery spray drooping flowery wreath be enchantingly beautiful be sitting motionless silent wrapped in admiration of enchanting scene more enchanting perhaps to from striking contrast to long monotony of sea sky only upon eye have so lately rested when slight sharp crackling sound proceeding from apparently short distance off in bush on port bow arrested attention boat have by time lost way men abruptly roused from trance of wondering admiration be about once more to dip oar in water when mr austin uplifted hand arrested sound continued at interval presently without so much a rustling of bough to prepare for apparition magnificent antelope emerged from bush about fifty yard away stepped daintily down into water quick eye detected in instant unwonted presence of boat ourselves instead of bowing head at once to drink a have evidently be first intention stood motionless a statue gazing wonderingly at be superb creature standing a high at shoulder a cow with smooth glossy hide of very light chocolate colour except along belly on inner side of thigh where hair be milk white long sharp gracefully curving horn be so close to that must even distinguish greenish lambent gleam of eye mr austin very cautiously reached out hand for musket lay on thwart beside have almost grasped when in millionth part of second a seemed to so rapid be there be flashing swirl of water directly in front of deer before startled creature have time to make so much a single movement to save immense alligator have seized by foreleg be tug tugging at in endeavour to drag into deep water deer however though taken by surprise at disadvantage be evidently determined not to yield without struggle lowering head made lunge after lunge at antagonist with long sharply pointed horn have so excited admiration holding bravely back with three disengaged leg while give way men shouted mr austin in voice made leafy archway ring again steer straight for crocodile tom plump boat right on bow oar lay in stand by to prod fellow with boat hook drive into under arm pit if can that believe be most vulnerable part animated by first lieutenant evident excitement men dashed oar into water with tug made stout ash stave buckle like fishing rod sent boat forward with rush alligator crocodile whichever happened to be be however in meantime getting best of struggle dragging antelope steadily ahead into deeper water instant in spite of beautiful creature desperate resistance be only few second in reaching scene of conflict yet during brief period buck have be dragged forward until water be up to belly hold water back hard of cried mr austin standing up in stern sheet musket in hand a ranged up alongside frantic deer now give with boat hook drive well home into be sort ben like must let go well struck now bang crocodile have suddenly released hold upon antelope creature sooner felt free than wheeled round on three leg fourth be broken above knee joint probably bitten in two made gallant dash for shore first lieutenant be quite prepared for such movement have anticipated in fact buck have barely emerged from water when be cleverly dropped by bullet from mr austin musket boat be thereupon promptly beached buck throat cut carcass stowed away in stern sheet pretty completely filled be just about to shove off again when first lieutenant caught sight of banana tree with fruit just in right condition for cutting so added to spoil three huge bunch of banana a much a man must conveniently carry deepening shadow now warned that sun be sinking low so shoved off made best of way back to river when reached found that there be small drain of flood tide still making land breeze not yet having sprung up mr austin determined to push yet little higher up river boat head be accordingly pointed to eastward four mile further on hit upon opening into at once made way have sooner entered creek however than found that like first have visited forked into two one branch of trended to south west other in south easterly direction chose latter soon found pulling along channel very similar to last one have explored except in present instance first of chain of hill stretching away to eastward lay at great distance ahead of pull of couple of mile brought to bend in stream in few minute afterwards found sweeping along close to base of hill in channel about quarter of mile wide with from three to four half fathom of water under twenty minute later channel again divided one branch continuing on in easterly direction whilst other varied from half to three quarter of mile in width branched off abruptly to northward westward mr austin chose channel suspecting that must lead into river again suspicion quarter of hour proved correct sun be by time within hour of setting shark point rather top of mangrove growing upon lay stretched along horizon good eleven mile off so be high time to see about returning tide have by time turned be running out pretty strongly in mid channel land breeze also have sprung up though where be close inshore did not feel very much of be swaying top of more lofty tree in way be sure must have gladdened heart of boat crew so oar be laid in mast stepped lug hoisted in ten minute be bowling down stream what with current breeze of got in full strength a soon a have hauled little further out from bank at rate of good honest ten knot per hour sun went down in bewildering blaze of purple crimson gold when be within five mile of shark point ten minute afterwards night glorious night of tropic be upon in loveliness heaven be destitute of cloud save low bank down on western horizon soft velvety blue black of sky be literally powdered with countless million of glittering gem remember that ever before since saw so many of smaller star a for larger star planet shone down upon with effulgence caused to be reflected in long shimmering line of golden light upon turbid water presently boat lug sail spread above before like great blot of ghostly grey against starlit sky began perceptibly to pale brighten until stood out clear distinct bathed in richest primrose light with shadow of mast drawn across in ebony black striking top of sail first light swept gradually down in le than minute whole of boat with crew ourselves be completely bathed in looked behind to ascertain cause of sudden glorification behold there be moon sweeping magnificently into view above distant tree top full orb magnified to three four time usual dimension painted glorious ruddy orange by haze began to rise from bosom of river under magic effect of moonlight noble river with background of tree bush rising dim ghostly above wreathing mist swift flowing water shimmering in golden radiance presented picture dream like beauty of word be wholly inadequate to describe be willing to confess that admiration lost great deal of ardour when mr austin informed that mist imparted so subtle charm to scene be forerunner of deadly miasmatic fog make congo so fatal river to european be by mean sorry when found three quarter of hour later once more in safety alongside daphne having succeeded in making good escape before pestilential fog overtook prize buck banana be cordially welcomed on board old barkie banana being carefully suspended from spanker boom to ripen at leisure whilst buck be handed over to butcher to be operated upon forthwith so far at least a flaying be concerned on morrow hand fore aft enjoyed unwonted luxury of venison for dinner mr austin having duly reported to captain vernon that river be just then free of shipping hove up anchor same evening at end of second dog watch stood off from land night under easy canvas chapter five vestale about three bell in forenoon watch next morning look out aloft reported sail on larboard bow on being questioned in usual manner shouted down to further information that stranger be brig working in for land on starboard tack under topgallant sail that have look of man o ' war by six bell have closed other within mile few minute afterwards stranger crossed bow laying main topsail to mast lowered boat perceiving that captain wanted to speak of course at once hauled wind backing main topsail hove to about couple of cable length to windward of brig be a beautiful craft a seaman eye have ever rested on long low upon water with superbly modelled hull enormously lofty mast with saucy rake aft to very taunt heavy yard mounted seven gun of side apparently of same description weight a own long pounder there be what looked suspiciously like long pounder on forecastle be flying french colour certainly looked at least a much like english a did like french ship boat dashed alongside in true man o ' war style side be duly manned presently there entered through gangway man dressed in uniform of lieutenant in french navy be of medium height rather square built skin be tanned to deep mahogany colour hair bushy beard be jet black a also be piercing restless eye though rather handsome man feature wore fierce repellent expression however passed away a soon a began to speak bon jour mbeieu began raising uniform cap bowing to mr austin who met at gangway what chip dis be eh sir be britannic majesty sloop daphne what brig be that sair be franch brigue of war vestale be jules le breton first leeftant at serveece be le capitaine of vaisseau sir be first lieutenant name be austin with bow captain vernon be in cabin do wish to see at moment skipper made appearance from below stepping forward french lieutenant be presented to with due formality by mr austin being watch on deck be promenading fore aft just to leeward of group consequently overheard pretty nearly everything passed vestale appeared from monsieur le breton statement have just returned to coast from fruitless chase half across atlantic after large barque have managed to slip out of congo dodge past three week previously be now about to look in there once more in hope of meeting with better fortune judging from course be steering that have just left river monsieur le breton have by order of capitane dubosc ventured upon liberte of boarding in order to ascertain latest news skipper of course mentioned exploring expedition of previous day assured of total absence of ship from river finally invited into cabin to take wine with be below fully hour when returned to deck frenchman be chattering away in very broken english in most lively manner gesticulating with hand shoulder a only frenchman can notwithstanding animation with be conversing must not help noticing that eye be over ship not in abstracted fashion evidently with object of thoroughly taking stock of struck too that english be too broken to be quite genuine rather to be strictly correct that be not always broken to same extent for instance once twice used word uttering a plainly a must at other time noticed that called ze dee detected ringing change in like manner on several other word from inferred that be not altogether a fair above board with a wished to believe felt half disposed to seize early opportunity to mention matter to mr austin then on other hand reflected that monsieur le breton must hardly have possible reason for attempting to deceive in way so for moment matter passed out of mind at length visitor bowed down over side throwing one last lingering look round deck a did so in five minute be once more on board own ship hoisting up boat filled main topsail with dip of ensign by way of good bye resumed course thank heaven have got rid of fellow at last exclaimed captain vernon with laugh when brig be once more fairly under weigh have pumped dry such inquisitive individual think never in life encountered before fancy have succeeded in persuading that will do good by hanging about coast hereabouts want frenchman to help with work gave so very discouraging account of state of thing here that expect will take trip northward after looking into river continued running off land for remainder of day whole of following night up to noon next day with breeze sent along under topsail only at rate of about six knot hour on following day at six bell in forenoon watch be look out aloft reported something took to be floating wreckage about three point on port bow mr smellie second lieutenant at once went aloft to foretopmast crosstrees to have look at through telescope single glance sufficed to acquaint with fact that object be about six mile distant be raft with people upon who be making such signal a be in power to make with object of attracting attention upon receipt of news on deck captain vernon at once ordered ship course to be altered to direction of raft gun being fired ensign run up to gaff end at same time be trifle past noon when daphne rounded to about hundred yard to windward of raft sent away boat to pick up upon be wretched make shift structure composed of spar two half burned hen coop few piece of charred bulwark planking be so small that there be scarcely room on for fourteen person sustained be most fortunate circumstance for that weather happened to be fine at time for have there be great amount of sea running crazy concern must not have be kept together for hour concluded from appearance of affair that castaway have be burned out of ship so have not in manner supposed a closed with raft be seen that several shark be cruising longingly round round occasionally charging at evidently in hope of being able to drag off of occupant so pertinacious be ravenous fish that boat crew have to fairly fight way through even to beat off with oar stretcher when have got alongside however poor wretch be rescued without accident in quarter of hour from time of despatching boat be once more swinging at davit with rescued men most of whom be suffering more le severely from burn safely below in charge of doctor assistant later on when injury have be attended to craving of hunger thirst satisfied have eaten drunk during previous forty two hour captain vernon sent for skipper of rescued crew to learn from account of mishap story a related to by during second dog watch be to following effect name be richards ship hailed from liverpool be called juliet be barque of three hundred fifty ton register oak built copper fastened throughout be only five year old fifty four day ago to day cleared from liverpool for saint paul de loando with cargo of manchester birmingham good sailing same day with afternoon tide went well with until day before last when just before eight bell in afternoon watch one of hand who have gone aloft to stow main topgallant sail reported sail dead to leeward of under heavy press of canvas have be to saint paul twice before know pretty well character of coast moreover on first trip be boarded plundered by rascally spaniard so thought must just step up aloft take look at stranger through glass at once well sir did so conclusion came to be that though be blowing very fresh must give ship stitch of canvas must show to strange sail be brig of about three hundred ton thereabouts with very taunt spar tremendous spread of canvas hull painted dead black down to copper have be scoured until fairly shone again did at like appearance of newly discovered neighbour craft have wicked look about from truck down press of sail be carrying seemed to bode good so a juliet happened to be pretty smart vessel under canvas in splendid sailing trim thought must do what must to keep stranger at arm length when watch be called few minute afterwards got topgallant sail royal flying jib main topgallant royal mizen topmast staysail on old barkie again began to smoke through can tell that done set stranger by compass for first hour so thought be holding own by sunset must see great deal too plainly for own comfort that brig be weathering fore reaching upon still be long way off have night be dark must have tried to dodge fellow that unfortunately be use sun be sooner set than moon rose of course must see even more plainly than must see at seven o'clock tacked then felt pretty sure meant mischief when at little before eight bell tacked again time directly in wake have further doubt about at time be about eight mile astern of at midnight ranged up on weather quarter slapped broadside of seven pound shot right into without word of warning ordered to at once heave to owner have unfortunately sent to sea with only dozen musket on board not ounce of powder shot so what must hing of course heave to a be bid accordingly backed main topsail without moment delay brig then did same lowered boat five minute later dashed alongside threw in upon deck crew of seventeen a bloodthirsty looking ruffian a one need ever wish to see be hand fore aft at once bound neck heel huddled together aft on monkey poop with two of pirate mounting guard over then rest of gang coolly set to work ransacked ship fellow in command of party man about five foot six inch in height square built with deeply bronzed feature black hair beard made first business to hunt for manifest having ascertained from that have amongst cargo several bolt of canvas large quantity of new rope four case of watch jewellery dozen case of bead first ordered in broken english to inform where article be stowed then have hatch stripped off cargo roused on deck until must get at when bead rope canvas other matter that took fancy to amounting to six boat load have be transferred to brig informed that must point out to spot where have concealed money knew to be on board now so happened that have money on board owner be dreadfully suspicious people will not intrust anybody with shilling more than can help many good fifty pound note have missed way into pocket through over cautiousness be here there well told fellow have money on board whereupon whipped out watch told out loud so that hand must hear that must give five minute in to make up mind whether must hand over cash not if decided not to do so must at end of time set fire to ship leave to burn in be just exactly what did actually set fire to ship said of course cast adrift first gave at least chance to save life will tell what did sir replied merchant skipper when five minute have expired called for lantern when have got went round examined man lashing with own eye hand so a to make sure that be secure to satisfaction then ordered dozen bale of cotton good to be cut open strewed about cabin poured oil turpentine tar over did same down in forecastle then capsized cask of tar can of turpentine over most inflammable good must put hand upon down in main hatchway have bottom of boat knocked out took away oar then set fire to ship forward aft in midships after wished warm journey into next world went deliberately down side into boat brig stood by until be fairly in flame fore aft then filled away on starboard tack under canvas must show to leaving there to perish miserably how did manage to effect escape after inquired well sir skipper replied ship a may imagine with cargo such a have on board burned like torch in le than five minute after pirate have shoved off from side flame be darting up through companion hatchway fore scuttle in quarter of hour be ablaze luckily for ship left to herself have paid off before wind flame be therefore blown for'ard deck upon be lying soon became so hot a to be quite unbearable be literally beginning to roast alive be in momentary expectation that deck must fall in drop helplessly into raging furnace below at last driven to desperation by torture of mind body from be suffering managed to roll over on other side there within inch of mouth be man hand lashed like own firmly behind back ankle drawn close up to idea seized to try gnaw through lashing so free when of course must soon be able to cast adrift in return shouted to what intended to do then set to work with teeth upon bond gnawing away for dear life when teeth first came into contact with firm hard rope thought must never be able to do at least not in time to save man never know what can do until try in earnest a did then actually succeeded in few minute too in eating way through one turn of lashing man then strained tugged until managed to free after be work of few minute only to liberate rest of then hastily collected together such material a must first lay hand on with constructed raft off took be terribly crazy affair have time to make better one of course a ship be by time mass of fire fore aft be impossible for to secure atom of provision of kind single drop of water what story of fiendish cruelty ejaculated when richards have finished story by by suddenly added moved by impulse must neither analyse account for of what nationality be leader of pirate do think be frenchman yes sir believe be although addressed men in spanish answered richards in surprise why do ask sir have ever fallen in with such man a have described to be well ye be not to knowledge replied hesitatingly fact be that richards description of pirate leader have somehow brought vividly before mind eye personality of monsieur le breton first lieutenant of french gun brig vestale be doubtless prompted to put absurd question to companion a to nationality of man who have so inhumanly treated not must be understood seriously for single instant associated monsieur le breton vestale with diabolical act of piracy to account of have just listened have at time very great love of respect for french be true even most bigoted of englishman must think have hesitated to hint at possibility of french man of war being perpetrator of such deed mere idea bare suggestion of such suspicion be so absurd that laughed at for folly in allowing to obtrude even in most intangible form for single moment on mind yet such be perversity of human intellect must not in spite of quite get rid of extravagant idea monsieur le breton be in inexplicable way cognisant of outrage must forbear sketching for richards benefit a accurate word portrait a must of french lieutenant suppose on account of same perversity felt surprise whatever when assured that have faithfully described to arch pirate who have left crew to perish in flame indeed in then contradictory state of mind must have be disappointed have said otherwise man conduct stealthy searching scrutiny of ship endeavour a regarded to mislead with broken english excessive curiosity a hinted at by captain vernon have struck a peculiar to say least of on occasion of visit to daphne have suspected then that be not altogether exactly what pretended to be now richards identification of from description seemed to confirm in great measure instinctive suspicion unreasonable extravagant absurd a admitted to be first impulse be very strong one be to take mr austin into confidence to unfold to suspicion circumstance have given rise to frankly admitting at same time apparent enormity then to put question to whether in opinion there be slightest possibility of suspicion being well founded so strongly so unaccountably be urged to do have actually set out to find first lieutenant when reflection common sense came to aid asked what be thing be about to do answer to question be that with self sufficiency stupendous conceit father have especially cautioned to guard against be arrogating to myself possession of superhuman sagacity upon flimsy foundation of wild extravagant fancy backed by mere chance resemblance after might prove to be resemblance at if richards must once be confronted with monsieur le breton be about to insinuate charge of most atrocious character against officer holding responsible honourable position man who doubtless be soul of honour rectitude moment reflection sufficed to convince of utter impossibility of same man being in command of pirate brig one day officer of french man o ' war next might just a reasonably have suspected vestale herself of piracy well knew must be carrying suspicion to uttermost extremity of idiotic absurdity have in short so finally decided discovered mare nest upon strength of have be upon very verge of proclaiming hopeless idiot making perpetual laughing stock of whole ship congratulated most heartily upon having paused in time resolved very determinedly must not further dwell upon subject allow to be again lured into entertaining such superlatively ridiculous notion yet only four day later be harassed by temporary recurrence of suspicion be with utmost difficulty combated succeeded be true in so far maintaining self control a to keep silent tongue continued persistently to haunt until steady whither away dick lad be out of course altogether luffing into wind eye instead of working steadily to windward tack tack taking incident of story a come to incident revived very singular suspicion be a follows upon learning full detail of richards story captain vernon have come to conclusion that brig destroyed juliet be vessel devoted to combined pursuit of piracy slave trading that be in probability one of three vessel reported by fawn a daily expected to arrive on coast from cuba that be more than likely destination be congo therefore determined to make best of way back to river in sanguine hope of effecting capture after intended to run down to saint paul de loando to land crew of juliet richards having expressed desire to be taken there if possible be on fourth day after have picked up juliet crew be working way back toward mouth of congo making short tack across track of vessel running notorious middle passage when look out aloft reported sail about three point on weather bow running down toward under perfect cloud of canvas be at once conjectured that might be richards late free easy acquaintance outward bound with cargo of slave on board daphne be accordingly kept away couple of point to intercept hand being ordered to hold in readiness to jump aloft make sail on instant that stranger gave slightest sign of intention to avoid at same time mr armitage third lieutenant proceeded aloft to main topmast crosstrees with telescope to maintain vigilant watch upon motion of approaching vessel hand be of course in instant on qui vive momentary expectation being that stranger must shorten sail haul upon wind endeavour to evade minute after minute passed without slightest indication of such intention very shortly royal rose into view above horizon from deck then followed topgallant sail then topsail course next finally hull of ship appeared upon horizon with studding sail alow aloft on side running down dead before wind evidently going through water at tremendous pace available telescope in ship be now brought to bear upon craft presently fore royal fore topgallant sail be observed to collapse yard slid down mast sail be clewed up not furled next instant french tricolour fluttered out from fore royal mast head only position from whence must be made visible to simultaneously with appearance conviction came to in approaching vessel be about to recognise recent acquaintance vestale ensign be already bent on to peak halyard be promptly run up in response whereupon french ensign disappeared to be instantly replaced by string of signal signal book be at once produced answering pennant run half mast up then began to read off following signal have sighted pennant be then mast headed to show that understood flag disappeared on board frenchman batch be run up being interpreted meant brig also be acknowledged signalling be continued until whole message be completed thus same tonnage a hull painted black steering west north west final string of flag then disappeared vestale answering pennant directly afterwards showed just above topgallant yard indicating that have completed signal awaited reply entire signal then freely interpreted ran thus have sighted brig of same tonnage size a ourselves with hull painted black steering west north west course answered in turn inquired whether vestale have seen heard of such craft french gun brig be by time crossing bow distant about mile reply be accordingly made from gaff end fore topgallant sail royal being at same time sheeted home mast headed be to following effect yes brig in question sailed from congo yesterday six hour before arrival with three hundred slave on board by time that message have be communicated by slow tedious process then in vogue two vessel be too far apart to render further conversation possible in little more than hour after final hauling down of last signal vestale main royal sank beneath verge of western horizon be once more alone chapter six in congo once more have not yet however stated what be in connection with encounter with vestale served to fan fantastic suspicion into flame anew may add too at same time mould into more definite shape than have ever before taken be richards peculiar conduct remark have manifested quite extraordinary amount of interest in rencontre with vestale from moment of being first reported from mast head evidently sharing hope belief at first entertained that strange sail must turn out to be brig have served so scurvy trick few day before be easy to understand excitement exhibited so long a remained matter of conjecture when conjecture proved to be unfounded fully expected excitement if not interest must wane did not however borrowed telescope a soon a brig became fully visible from deck placing at open port kept tube of instrument levelled at until topsail disappeared below horizon again remained close beside during whole time excitement perplexity be so palpable must not refrain from questioning a to cause will tell mr hawkesley replied see that craft there well must almost stake soul that pirate brig be built on same stock two craft be same size to ton will swear be same model same rig to nicety be true be only able to closely inspect other craft at night time be by brilliant moonlight be able to note detail of build rig equipment almost a plainly a now can that of brig before two be sister ship carry same number of gun ay even to long gun see there on french brig forecastle mast in ship have same rake yard same spread running gear be rove led in exactly same manner only difference can distinguish between two ship be that yonder brig have broad white ribbon round small figure head painted white whilst pirate craft be painted black down to copper carried large black figure head representing negress with gaudy scarf wrapped about waist um remarked lend glass moment will thanks vestale be at moment just about to cross fore foot be therefore about a near to a must be at focused telescope fine powerful instrument upon must clearly see weather stain yellowish red mark of rust in wake of chain plate upon broad white ribbon stretched along side evidently that band of white paint have be exposed to sun storm for many long day then have look at figure head be half length model of female figure beautifully carved le than life size with one arm drooping gracefully downwards other right outstretched with gilded lamp in right hand too be weather stained gilding tarnished by long exposure pertinacious half formed suspicion richards ' word have stirred into new life be refuted yet a have said must not shake off try a must argue with a must that be utterly ridiculous unreasonable look here mr richards said if really be a positive upon matter a say wish must speak to captain vernon about might doubt must help very materially in effecting capture of pirate brig have seen vestale twice have have so good opportunity to note peculiarity of structure equipment that will now know again a far off a can see if therefore must ever happen to fall in with brig exact counterpart of vestale in respect except a to matter of figure head painting of hull must think may take for granted that brig will undoubtedly be pirate destroyed juliet may depend upon good sir that be that identical craft that vestale be now seeking ye e very likely quite possible replied hesitatingly evidently still labouring under feeling of perplexity have noticed then straightening up passing hand across forehead a though to clear away mental cobweb there added will go speak to captain vernon about at once away accordingly walked to carry out resolve stood on a be going until eight bell in afternoon watch that day when ship be hove round on larboard tack course shaped for saint paul de loando skipper having come to conclusion that brig referred to in vestale signal be undoubtedly craft have be on way back to congo to look for that a according to gun brig statement be no longer there be now free to proceed direct to saint paul to land burnt out crew a soon a possible entered bay upon shore of town be built about be on second day after last meeting with vestale anchoring in ten fathom lowered boat in mr richards crew be landed captain vernon going on shore with skipper remained on shore until pm when came off be easy to see that be deeply preoccupied boat be at once hoisted in messenger passed anchor hove up away went again crowding sail for congo a soon a ship be clear of loando reef fairly at sea once more captain vernon summoned first second lieutenant to cabin where three remained closeted with for time indeed two officer dined with whatever matter might be mr austin mr smellie let fall word a to nature though be evident from manner that be deemed of considerable import when turned in night felt very greatly dissatisfied with outrageous suspicion upon have dwelt so much in last few page seemed to be gathering new strength day in spite of utmost endeavour to dissipate that too without occurrence of anything fresh to confirm accordingly took severely to task subjected to rigid self examination looking matter square in face conclusion to came be first that have allowed to be deluded into belief that vestale herself be craft have committed act of piracy of poor richards crew be victim second have be unmitigated idiot for suffering to be so deluded on going thoroughly over whole question be forced to admit to myself that there be not particle of evidence incriminating french gun brig save what have manufactured out of own too vivid imagination clearly foresaw that unless must get rid of at event conquer hallucination must be doing saying something must get into serious scrape having at last thus settled question a thought to own satisfaction rolled over in hammock went to sleep breeze held fresh during whole of night daphne made such good progress that by eight o'clock on following morning found once more abreast of padron point at entrance to congo sail be now shortened ship hove to men sent to breakfast officer also being requested to get theirs at same time at hand be turned up main topsail filled under topsail jib spanker with leadsman in fore chain on side sloop proceeded boldly to enter river under pilotage of master who stationed for purpose on fore topsail yard be most unusual almost un heard of proceeding at time river never having be up to period properly surveyed so came to conclusion that there be something to fore trifle out of common conclusion be very fully verified little later on be just low water a came abreast of shark point passed at distance of about mile found plenty of water everywhere stretching across river mouth daphne finally entered banana creek anchored in six fathom close to smart looking little barque of unquestionable american nationality sail be furled yard squared rope coiled down deck cleared up then first cutter be piped away mr smellie at same time receiving summons to skipper cabin conference between captain second lieutenant be short one when latter again appeared on deck beckoned to instructed to don dirk a be to accompany on visit to barque just a be about to go down over side captain vernon appeared on deck addressing second luff said do mr smellie keep caution in mind provoke man remember that if be american of have very little doubt can not touch even if have hold full of slave so be a civil to a can please get information can out of ay ay sir will do best to stroke fur right way never fear answered smellie laughingly away went couple of minute later shot alongside barque smellie clambered up side ladder to deck where be received by lanky cadaverous looking individual arrayed in by mean spotless suit of white nankin topped by very dilapidated broad brimmed panama straw hat mornin ' gentleman observed individual in response to salutation powerful hot ai very returned smellie in most amicable manner pointing to awning spread fore aft see know how to make yourselves comfortable ship observe be called pensacola of new orleans have come on board to go through formality of looking at paper have objection presume nary objection stranger look at 'em welcome be reply guess will have to trouble to come below though with led way down companion ladder followed eventually bringing up on comfortably cushioned locker of fine spacious airy cabin very nicely fitted up seating opposite skipper struck hand bell stood on cabin table in response to summons black steward clad like master in dingy white made appearance from neighbouring pantry host thereupon formed right hand into shape of cup raised to mouth at same time exhibiting three finger of left hand steward nodding grinning comprehension of mute order withdrew to reappear next moment with case bottle of rum three glass water monkey porous earthen jar full of what proved on pouring out to be very doubtful looking liquid help yourselves gentleman said host pushing rum bottle water monkey towards ai got wine aboard to offer liquor be real old jamaica water be genuine mississippi make first grade mixture perhaps prefer to take liquor straight always do forthwith practically illustrated process of taking liquor straight by half filling tumbler with neat rum swallowed at single gulp then rose retired to state room in search of paper leaving to sip five water grog meanwhile paper be produced examined found to be perfectly correct after smellie set to task of pumping new acquaintance without much result though certainly managed to obtain one bit of valuable information from whether there be slaver in rivulet will just leave to find out stranger remarked in answer to question of smellie be here about own business be here about yourn ca interfere with wo interfere with mind tellin ' that if 'd be here five day ago 'd have have chance of nabbin ' black venus smartest slaver guess be ever visited section of sublunary sphere indeed exclaimed smellie eagerly what sort of craft be what be like be brig pricked up ear at so too must see did smellie of about three hundred ton register long low in water mount fourteen gun seven of side long pounder on forecastle have very tall stick with rake aft tremendous spread of caliker be fastest craft in creation ship look a if must travel 'low ai carcumstance to black venus how be painted asked smellie be black doe sometimes sport white riband aha thought look a though suspicion be at last shared by somebody else richards communication to skipper have surely borne fruit wall replied yankee with knowing twinkle in eye when sailed from here be black right down to copper ai much to go by guess skipper know trick two think then might alter appearance a soon a got outside insinuated smellie might might be cautious reply um observed smellie then a if inspired with sudden suspicion asked have seen men o ' war in here lately must see by knowing look in yankee friend eye that read poor smellie like book wall replied come to speak of there be brig in here few day ago looked like man o ' war be flyin ' french colour when flew at called vestale ah ejaculated smellie did of people board bet be somewhat ambiguous answer not that reply be at ambiguous in be peculiar emphasis with word be spoken peculiar expression of man countenance a uttered constituted ambiguity word simply implied that pensacola have be boarded look spoke volume volume be written in unknown tongue so far a at least be concerned what be vestale like be smellie next question just a like black venus a two pea in pod be reply given with evident quiet amusement how be painted persisted smellie ah there now stranger have puzzled be unexpected answer why did not say saw queried smellie sharply guess not did say anything of sort be ashore when people boarded be mate that told about mate can see exclaimed smellie eagerly yes reckon be reply be ashore now have only to pull about five mile up creek calculate will find somewhere thanks answered smellie be afraid ca spare time for can tell of two brig vestale black venus sailed first from river wall stranger 'd like to help must really must with hand wandering thoughtfully over forehead really ca for life of remember just now of 'em be fellow be lying must see so must smellie must not of course tell so accordingly thanked for information rose to go with uncomfortable feeling that have received certain information part of be probably true whilst part be undoubtedly false that be wholly without mean of distinguishing one from other returned to daphne with information such a be smellie at once made report to skipper consultation followed in first lieutenant took part at end of hour three officer reappeared on deck captain gig be piped away being suspicious a have already remarked that something unusual be brewing remained on deck during progress of conference so a to be at hand in event of service being required pensacola happening to be most prominent object in landscape naturally came in for large share of attention during progress of discussion above referred to be flying colour when anchored in such close proximity to circumstance attributed to fact that be to appearance only vessel in river be therefore not much surprised when short time after visit to observed skipper go aft run up american ensign to gaff end be little surprised when followed up by hoisting small red swallow tailed flag to main royal mast head asked what must be meaning of move on part did not take very long to arrive at conclusion that be undoubtedly meant a signal of sort to somebody other be scarcely likely to do thing for gratification of mere whim if be signal what did mean to whom be made there be of course possibility that be prearranged signal to absent mate taken in conjunction with fact that be exhibited almost immediately after visit to ship coupled with other fact of obvious attempt to keep in dark with respect to certain matter be greatly disposed to regard rather a warning signal to vessel vessel concealed in one other of numerous creek knew to exist in immediate vicinity accordingly on reappearance of second lieutenant on deck stepped up to directed attention to suspicious looking red flag mentioned surmise a to meaning thank mr hawkesley said have doubt be signal of kind what mean have possible method of ascertaining moreover suit purpose just now to take notice of by way be anything of shot pretty fair replied can generally bring down bird upon wing if be not very long shot then put pistol in belt provide with fowling piece will lend one be in readiness to go with in gig be bound upon sporting expedition needed second invitation hurried away at once to make necessary preparation albeit there be something in mr smellie manner led to think that sport be perhaps after mere pretext that actual object of cruise be something much more serious few minute sufficed to complete preparation when again stepped on deck gun in hand captain vernon mr smellie be standing near gangway rather ostentatiously engaged in full view of american skipper in examining gun lock snapping off cap so on whilst steward be in act of passing down over side with strict injunction to in boat to be careful in handling of capacious basket of provision with snow white cloth protruding out over side precious basket being at length safely deposited in gig stern sheet followed down side second lieutenant came next skipper bringing up rear hoisted lug sail sea breeze blowing strongly up river shoved off motion being intently scrutinised by yankee skipper a long a must make out have scarcely gone quarter of mile before noble crane came sailing across course with head tucked in between shoulder long stilt like leg projecting astern of slowly flapping wing almost touching water at stroke there be chance for hawkesley exclaimed genial second luff let drive at be fish that come to net so long a be within range of yankee telescope fire at everything see raised gun pulled trigger down dropped crane into water with broken wing very neatly done exclaimed skipper approvingly pick up bird thomson to coxswain unfortunate bird be duly picked up hauled into boat though not without inflicting rather severe wound with long sharp beak on hand of man who grasped continued course on reaching mouth of creek hauled sharp round projecting point shaped course up across toward opposite side of stream steering for low densely wooded spit jutted out into river eight mile distant tide be rising be in favour in hour from time of emerging from creek into main stream have reached destination boat shot into water way about cable length in width sail be lowered mast unstepped men taking to oar proceeded to paddle boat gently up creek proceeded up creek distance of about two mile when coming suddenly upon small branch tributary well suited a place of concealment for boat be headed into after proceeding along narrow canal for distance of perhaps one hundred yard hauled alongside bank secured chapter seven mr smellie make little survey giving gig crew strict injunction not to leave boat for moment upon consideration to hold in readiness to shove off on instant of rejoining must precipitate retreat prove necessary captain vernon mr smellie stepped ashore with request must accompany channel canal in gig be now lying be about fifty foot wide with depth of water of about eight foot at point to have reached bank be composed of soft black foetid mud in semi liquid state so in order to land be necessary for to make way a best must for distance of two hundred foot over root of mangrove tree thickly bordered stream before be enabled to place foot on solid ground beyond belt of mangrove soil be densely covered with heterogeneous jumble of parasitic creeper of description spoken of in africa by generic denomination of bush thickly interspersed with tree many of be of large size path there be none not even faintest trace of footprint in dry sandy soil to show humanity have ever passed over ground before may be that ours be first human footstep have ever pressed soil in particular spot at event looked very much like have not travelled one hundred foot before became fully impressed with necessity for carefully marking route if have slightest desire to find way back again task be intrusted to accomplished by cutting twig half through then bending downwards until long light strip of inner wood be exposed did at distance of about yard apart along route whilst skipper smellie went ahead forced passage for party through thick undergrowth general direction of route be about south south west a nearly a skipper must hit off with aid of pocket compass took more than two hour to accomplish journey of a many mile through thick tangled undergrowth brought out close to water edge again saw before canal about cable length across skipper said be certain be continuation of one have entered in gig about mile distant on opposite side of canal must be seen top of hill have noticed on occasion of first exploration of river here a at point of landing bank of canal consisted of black slimy foetid mud out of grew belt of mangrove curious twisted root straggling in thick complicated mass of net work over slime beneath sun be shining brilliantly down through richly variegated foliage on opposite bank of stream lighting up surface of thick turbid water a rolled sluggishly past where stood just on inner edge of mangrove swamp everything be enshrouded in sombre green twilight absolute silence prevailed round be positively oppressive in intensity breathless perspiring exhausted with unwonted exertion flung upon ground for moment rest during skipper smellie sought solace refreshment in cigar a for not having at time contracted habit of smoking be contented to sit still gaze with admiring eye upon weird beauty of surroundings for perhaps quarter of hour companion gave up to silent enjoyment of cigar at end of time skipper turning to smellie said think must be creek to have be directed there be so many of inlet creek canal on side of river on other side also for matter that one can not be at certain about must have explored place thoroughly in gig so have saved labour of scrambling through bush for fact that if be right slave craft happen to be lurking here a yankee friend suspicious conduct lead to believe may be case there must be great risk of stumbling upon unawares so giving alarm even if escaped that mischance have doubt that keep sentinel posted here there on look out must hardly hope that boat must escape being sighted by one other of if there be craft hereabout may rest assured that be fully aware of presence of daphne in river be in hope that ruse of openly starting a upon sporting expedition have thrown dust in eye for once that may be able to steal near enough to get sight of without exciting suspicion must be worth trouble if amid do so responded smellie half like blind groping about in bush to say nothing of tremendously hard work involves there be very good chance seems to of losing when attempt to make way back then again be quite uncertain how much further may have to go in order to complete search satisfactorily do not think must be good plan for one of to shin up tree take look round before go further there be fine tall tree here close at hand from higher branch of one ought to be able to get pretty extensive view very capital idea assented skipper will act upon at once there now pointing to perfect forest giant only few yard distant be tree admirably suited to purpose come mr hawkesley be youngest ought therefore to be most active of trio give specimen of tree climbing power just shin up aloft a high a can go take good look round let know if can see anything worth looking at ay ay sir responded with somewhat blank look at tall straight smooth stem to pointed where be ratline ratline impudent young monkey responded skipper with laugh why active young fellow like ought to make nothing of going up spar like when reached tree became evident that task of climbing be not likely to prove so easy a skipper have imagined for bole be fully fifteen foot in circumference with not branch protuberance of description for first sixty foot second lieutenant however be equal to occasion soon showed how thing might be done whipping out knife quickly cut long length of monkey rope creeper twisting tough pliant stem into grummet round trunk of tree bade pas bight over shoulder then showed how with aid might work gradually upward accordingly acting under direction placed within bight tucking well up under arm pit slid grummet up trunk a high a must go then bearing back upon so that supported whole weight worked body upwards by pressing against tree trunk with knee by mean rose about two foot from ground then pressing against tree firmly with foot gave grummet quick jerk upward again worked up trunk with knee a before in way got along very well after awkward slip two in knee suffered somewhat breech still more soon acquired knack of thing speedily reached lowermost branch after rest of ascent be of course easy on reaching topmost branch found that tree have climbed be indeed a skipper have aptly described forest giant be by far most lofty tree in neighbourhood from commanding position have fine uninterrupted prospect of many mile extent round except to southward where chain of hill before mentioned shut in view away to northward eastward in direction happened to be facing when at length paused to look around must catch glimpse of river over between intervening tree top for distance of quite twenty mile from what saw came to conclusion that in direction river must widen out considerably be thickly studded with island among thought probable might be found many snug lurking place for slave craft on extreme verge of horizon also distinctly made out small group of hill conjectured to be situate on northern right bank of river from hill way round northerly to about north north west country be flat pretty well covered with bush although at distance of from two to four mile inland must detect here there large open patch of grass land bearing about north north west from point of observation be chain of hill stretched along sea coast outside river mouth extended beyond horizon to left of again about north west from lay banana creek entrance about eleven mile distant over intervening tree top on boolambemba island must so clear be atmosphere just then distinctly make out royal mast head of daphne american barque must even occasionally detect gleam of sloop pennant a waved idly in sluggish breeze still further to left there lay river mouth with ripple marked junction between fresh salt water clearly visible next came shark point with open sea stretching mile after mile away beyond until gleaming surface became lost in ruddy afternoon haze on inner side of point must trace without much difficulty course of various creek have explored in boat on occasion of first visit looking below allowed eye to travel along course of stream canal flowed past almost under foot following along saw that forked at point about three mile to westward turned suddenly northward at point about three mile further on branch stream eventually joining river forming with two island of about five three mile in length respectively larger of two being that have so laboriously crossed that same afternoon view lay spread out below around be beautiful a dream must have formed fascinating study for painter art instinct may have be awakened within upon first glance round be quickly put to flight by scene presented at point only three mile away at distance channel stream below forked a have already said at point of divergence of two branch water way broadened out until became quite mile wide forming a snug little harbour a one need wish to see in harbour perfectly concealed from prying eye might happen to pas up down river lay brig brigantine schooner three a rakish looking craft a must well be met with appearance alone be almost sufficient to condemn huge barracoon standing in cleared space close at hand crowd of black huddled together on adjacent bank apparently in course of shipment on board one other of craft in sight put character quite beyond question hail from below reminded that there be others who must feel interest in discovery well mr hawkesley be there anything in sight from perch aloft there worth looking at came floating up to in skipper voice yes sir indeed there be there be three craft in creek away yonder in very act of shipping negro at moment replied deuce there be ejaculated skipper do think will be easier plan of two to climb tree to make way through bush to spot will find much easier to climb tree think sir can be alongside in five minute whilst will take nearly two hour must say to make way to through bush replied very well hold on where be then will tackle tree returned skipper looking down saw second lieutenant forthwith whip out knife begin hacking away at creeper wherewith to make grummet to assist in attempt at tree climbing in few minute twain be alongside in happy forgetfulness of ruin wrought upon unmentionable in process of shinning aloft eagerly noting through telescope operation in progress on board slaver seem very busy there observed skipper with eye still peering through tube of telescope may depend on mr rascal have got wind of presence in river intend trying to slip out past to night a soon a fog settle down will be bound know inch of river must find way out blindfold doubt of sir answered second luff be not high water until two o'clock to morrow morning so suspect will not endeavour to make move until about hour after midnight will enable to go out on top of flood with strong land breeze in favour so much better returned captain vernon with sparkling eye will take care to have boat in creek in good time never know where to have fellow be a cunning a fox please note position a accurately a can mr smellie for intend to lead attack to night thank sir answered smellie delightedly planting comfortably astride branch drew out pencil paper proceeded to make very careful sketch chart of river mouth banana creek creek in slaver be lying noting bearing carefully with aid of pocket compass there sir said when have finished showing sketch to skipper will enable to find think let night be a dark a thick a may how do think look for accuracy capital answered captain vernon approvingly really have splendid eye for proportion distance mr smellie little chart might almost have be drawn to scale so correct doe look how in world do manage be custom be reply make invariable rule to devote time care enough to such sketch a to ensure being a nearly accurate a possible have devised few rule upon always work result be generally very near approximation to absolute accuracy sun be getting low have not better be moving sir by mean if be sure have information need be reply must not miss way in confounded jungle to night for anything must completely upset arrangement to say nothing of possibility of affording meal to of hungry carnivora probably lurk in depth of said jungle thought held peace dutifully assisted superior officer to effect descent be decidedly easier to go up than to go down accomplished descent without accident after long wearisome tramp back through bush found once more on board gig just a last ray of sun be gilding tree top tide have now turned be therefore again in favour in hour from time of emerging upon main stream reached sloop just a first faint mist wreath began to gather upon bosom of river be exceedingly anxious to be allowed to take part in forthcoming expedition have be eagerly watching way across river for opportunity to ask necessary permission captain vernon have be so earnestly engaged in discussing with detail arrangement for projected attack have be unable to do so on reaching ship however opportunity came a went up over side skipper turned said by way mr smellie hope also mr hawkesley will give pleasure of company to dinner evening smellie duly bowed acceptance of invitation be about to follow suit when idea struck said will be most happy sir if acceptance of kind invitation will not interfere with taking part in to night boat expedition have be watching for opportunity to ask permission hope will not refuse oh be be laughed skipper thought seemed confoundedly fidgety in boat well scarcely know what to say about will be anything child play can assure still be tall strong there suppose must say yes now run away shift damaged rigging a quickly a possible dinner will be on table in ten minute murmured thanks forthwith dived below to bend fresh pair of pantaloon have on being in so dilapidated condition what with tree climbing battle with thorn briar of bush a to be in fact scarcely decent conversation at dinner table night be of very animated character a referred entirely to projected attack upon slaver will not inflict portion of upon reader mr austin first lieutenant be at first very much disappointed when found be not to lead boat expedition brightened up bit when skipper pointed out to that in probability slaver must slip cable endeavour to make escape from river on finding attacked by boat in case cream of fun must fall to share of left on board sloop mr smellie who be at time abstemious man contented with couple of glass of wine after dinner moment that conversation took general turn rose from table excusing upon plea that have several matter to attend to in connection with expedition a rose caught eye beckoned to follow did after duly making bow to company when reached deck fog be so thick that be a much a must do to see length of ship just a expected remarked companion how be to find creek in such weather a mr hawkesley be sure know sir replied looking round in bewilderment suppose expedition will have to be postponed until clear bit not if can prevent said with energy although added little doubtfully certainly be very thick with slightest deviation from course must be irretrievably lost whereaway do suppose creek to be oh somewhere in direction said pointing over starboard quarter be wrong remarked companion looking into binnacle tide be slackening whilst land breeze be freshening so that ship have swung with head to eastward direction in pointed lead straight out to sea now if want to learn good useful lesson one may prove of utmost value to in after life come below with to master between will show how to find creek in fog thank said will be very glad to learn why even know compass bearing said smellie will soon find out with descended to master cabin where found owner in shirt sleeve with pipe in mouth poring over chart of coast on be shown mouth of river only inland course being shown by two dotted line indicating that portion thus marked have never be properly surveyed be busily engaged a entered laying down in pencil upon chart certain correction remark with reference to ebb flow of tidal current good evening gentleman said a entered well mr smellie so be going to lead attack upon slaver to night hear yes said smellie unconsciously straightening up yes if fog doe not baffle in order that may not have come to invoke assistance mr mildmay right sir said old mildmay expected be waiting for sir be right said second lieutenant now mildmay bending over chart whereabouts be daphne there be replied master placing point of pencil carefully down on chart twisting round so a to produce black mark very good assented smellie now look here mr hawkesley be where lesson begin produced sketch chart have made that afternoon spread out on table will see from sketch proceeded that daphne bore exactly north north west from tree in be perched when made be equivalent to saying that tree bear south south east from daphne be not assented very well then continued smellie be so good mr mildmay a to draw line south south east from pencil mark represents daphne on chart master took parallel ruler did so so far so good resumed second lieutenant now sketch show that outer extremity of shark point bore from tree north west west in other word tree bear from shark point south east east lay off that bearing mildmay if please very good continued when second line have be drawn now be evident that point where two line intersect must be position of tree a check upon two bearing took third to sharp projecting point at mouth of banana creek indicating with pencil on chart point in question that point bear north west by north consequently tree bear from south east by south mark off also mildmay if please master did so three line be found to intersect other at exactly same point capital exclaimed smellie in high good humour satisfactorily establishes exact position of tree now for next step slave fleet bear north west west from tree western entrance to creek that by will advance to attack to night bear exactly north west from same point let lay down two bearing on chart thus now be evident that slave fleet entrance to creek be situate somewhere other on two line question be where will show how ascertained two very important bit of information if will step to cabin bring telescope will find hanging against bulkhead intensely interested in valuable practical lesson in surveying hurried away to do bidding speedily returned with glass small very powerful instrument have often greatly admired taking telescope from hand drew open directed attention to long series of neat little numbered line scratched on polished brass tube see scratch said very well now will explain to what be when be midshipman be good fortune to be engaged for time on certain surveying work during acquired tolerably clear insight of science after work be over done with occurred to that knowledge might be of greatest use in case similar to present now may tell by way of explanation that surveying consists broadly in measurement of angle line angle be a have already seen very easily taken by mean of pocket compass measurement of line bothered very considerably for long time of course can measure line with perfect accuracy by mean of surveyor chain wanted something if not quite so accurate a must be sufficiently correct while not occupying more than few second in operation of measurement so set to work trained to judge distance by eye alone by constant diligent practice acquired quite surprising amount of proficiency let say here must very strongly recommend young officer to practise same thing will be surprised when discover in how many unexpected way will be found useful well managed to do great deal of serviceable work even in rough ready way after time grew dissatisfied with wanted mean of measuring must be just a rapid great deal more accurate thought matter over for long time at last hit upon idea of turning telescope to account way did be have of course found that if look through telescope at object say mile away then direct instrument to object say four mile off have to alter focus of glass before can see second object distinctly be peculiarity pressed into service a mean of measuring distance first step be to secure small handy first rate telescope best must procure for money provided with commenced operation by looking through at object exact distance of from knew focused glass upon carefully then made little scratch on tube showing how far have be necessary to draw out in order to see object distinctly then marked scratch with distance of object see pointing to tube have regular scale of distance here from one hundred yard up to ten mile scratch let tell represent expenditure of vast amount of time labour be worth for instance want to ascertain distance of object direct telescope toward focus instrument carefully find can see most clearly when tube be drawn out to say distance suiting action to word then look at scale scratched on tube find that read six thousand one hundred foot be few foot over one nautical mile thus measure distance be so enabled to make really satisfactory little survey in few minute a in case of afternoon must not suppose however that be able to measure in way with absolute accuracy be not manage to get very near approximation to near enough for such purpose a present thus within distance of quarter of mile have found that can always measure within two foot of actual distance beyond up to half mile can measure within four foot of actual distance so on up to ten mile distance can measure to within four hundred foot now to return to business in hand telescope informed that slave fleet be anchored at distance of eighteen thousand three hundred foot shade over three nautical mile from tree that western entrance to creek be twenty eight thousand nine hundred foot about four three quarter nautical mile from same spot have now only to mark off two distance on two compass bearing last laid down on chart thus measuring marking off distance a spoke here have position of slaver of entrance to creek by moment use of mildmay parallel ruler thus get compass bearing of entrance from daphne there be south east by east now measure distance from one to other find to be eight mile a nearly a be possible to measure thus see rough ready survey of afternoon affords mean of ascertaining course distance from daphne to point for must otherwise have be obliged to search must not possibly have hoped to find in impenetrable fog now overspreads river thank mr smellie said highly delighted with lesson have received if will not be troubling too much think must ask to give lesson two in surveying when can spare time will be very pleased be reply never hesitate to come to for information instruction think may be able to afford will always be happy to help on in study to utmost extent of ability have not quite finished yet be now mildmay that think may perhaps be able to help see will have to pull sail a case may be across current will therefore be necessary to make allowance for set now do happen to know anything about speed of current in river not so much a must like replied master hint skipper dropped morning caused to take dinghy go away out in mid stream to spend day in fishing have have have yankee have glass turned full upon off on whole morning so be told if so daresay saw that have fairly good sport be so busy with hook line found time to ascertain that ebb stream run at rate of about four knot at half tide just abreast of flow to seaward at rate of about one knot at half flood salt water flowing into river along bottom fresh water continuing to flow outwards on surface now at what time do propose to start about half past nine to night answered smellie old mildmay referred to book by side then said ah then will have about two hour ebb to contend with last two hour of ebb tide now let see produced sheet of paper on be calculation evidently result of observation whilst sshing ran over carefully then said how long do expect will take to cross two hour if have to pull across a expect will answered second lieutenant two hour mused master two hour then will have to make allowance sir for average set to seaward of two mile hour way across four mile in very well said smellie then to counteract that must shape course for point four mile above mark entrance to creek must not mr hawkesley certainly said be quite clear then be so good a to lay course down on chart measured off distance of four mile with divider marked off above mouth of creek then applied parallel ruler found course be exactly south east said will take close past southern extremity of small island be quite right remarked smellie who have be watching if happen to sight land in passing point will be assurance so far have be steering proper course bless looking at watch be quarter after nine have idea be so late run away mr hawkesley make preparation put on worst suit of clothes throw pea jacket into boat may be glad to have when get into thick of damp fog bring pistol not dirk ship cutlas with armourer will supply will be much more serviceable for work have in hand to night hastened away reached deck again just in time to see men going down side into boat after undergoing inspection chapter eight attack slaver attacking flotilla be composed of launch under mr smellie with for aide first cutter in charge of mr armitage third lieutenant second cutter in charge of mr williams master mate force consisting of forty seaman four officer quite strong enough in captain vernon opinion to give satisfactory account of three slaver be arranged be to attack simultaneously one boat to vessel last parting instruction having be given to smellie by skipper rounded off with hearty hand shake earnest exclamation of wish success with still more hearty hand shake good bye harold old boy good luck attend from mr austin second lieutenant motioned into launch followed closely down word to shove off be given away went punctually at half past nine to minute fog be still a thick a ever so thick indeed that be a much a must do to see one end of boat from other notwithstanding care with a have have opportunity of seeing second lieutenant have worked out calculation own that seemed to quite hopeless to expect that must find place of be in search nevertheless pushed out boldly into opaque darkness boat head be at once laid in required direction coxswain steering by compass lighted binnacle containing have be previously masked with utmost care object being to take slaver by surprise oar be of course muffled strictest silence enjoined thus there be light sound to betray whereabouts slid over placid surface of river almost a noiselessly a so many mist wreath in so dense fog be necessary to adopt unusual precaution in order to prevent boat from parting company therefore proceeded in single file launch leading with first cutter attached by painter second cutter in turn attached by painter to first cutter bringing up rear cutter be ordered to regulate speed so that connecting rope between boat ahead must be just slack enough to dip into water more thus insuring that boat crew must do own fair share of work at oar once fairly away from ship side be immediately swallowed up by impenetrable mist for considerable time flotilla glided gently along without sight sound to tell whether be going right wrong without utterance of word on board either of boat with only slight muffled sound of oar in rowlock gurgle of water along boat side to tell that be moving at silence must have be oppressive for slight murmuring swirl ripple of great river chirping of countless million of insect swarmed in bush on bank of stream latter sent forth so remarkable volume of sound that when first told be created by insect alone found credulity taxed to utmost limit be not until be solemnly assured by mr austin that such be case that quite believed be not unlike whirr of machinery save that rose fell in distinct cadence occasionally a if by preconcerted arrangement on part of individual insect in district stopped altogether for few moment then indeed silence became weird oppressive uncanny making one involuntarily shuffle nearer to one neighbour glance half fearfully over one shoulder then after slight interval faint far off signal chirp chirp must be heard in instant whole insect world must burst into full chorus once more air must fairly vibrate with sound night have other voice than mingled with chirr of insect there must occasionally float off to snarling roar of forest savage barking call of deer yelping of jackal blood curdling cry of hyena grunt of hippopotamus weird cry of night bird nearer at hand sometimes apparently within yard so of boat sundry mysterious puffing blowing sudden faint splashing of water latter made for one probably many of others who heard feel particularly uncomfortable especially if happened to occur in one of brief interval of silence on shore once in particular during one of silent interval hair fairly bristled a boat be suddenly silently brought up standing by coming into violent collision with object broke water directly under bow shock being instantly followed by long moaning sigh tremendous swirl of water a creature whatever be sank again beneath surface of river men in launch be like considerably startled at circumstance one of irishman exclaimed in first paroxysm of dismay howly ropeyarns what be be shipwrecked stranded cast away be on back of say crocodile thin misther crocodile let tell yez at wanst be not good to ate be so sthrongly flavoured wid tibaccy 'd be shure to disagray wid yez absurd exclamation appealed so forcibly to men sense of ridiculous that have instant effect of steadying nerve raising hearty laugh however be a instantly checked by smellie who though must not restrain smile exclaimed sharply silence fore aft how dare cry out in ridiculous fashion flanaghan have good mind to report sir a soon a return to ship who will say how many of will live to return merciful god who spoke hoarsely cried second lieutenant well might word be uttered in sound scarcely above whisper in so low tone indeed for smellie startled ejaculation must almost have be inclined to accept a prompted by own excited imagination yet saw in instant man in boat have heard be a much startled a myself who have uttered indeed man look a horrified glance sought neighbour face asked same question nobody seemed to have recognised to be able to identify voice strangest thing about be that did not appear to have be spoken in boat at from point close at hand men have with one accord laid upon oar in first shock of new surprise before have recovered first cutter have ranged up alongside did anyone speak on board armitage asked smellie certainly not be reply did hear anyone speak on board second cutter then followed heard nothing why matter muttered second lieutenant then in low somewhat louder tone give way launch someone have be trying to play trick upon men resumed work at oar occasional scarcely heard whisper reaching ear suggesting rather than conveying such fragmentary sentence a of doomed lose number of mess etcetera etcetera showed that very unfortunate impression have be made by strange incident a proceeded second lieutenant began to consult watch at last turning to a slipped back into fob whispered quarter after tea ought now to be close to boolambemba point fog keep so dense that be afraid there be chance of sighting insect chorus have be silent for unusually long time when spoke a word left smellie lip sound burst out once more time in startling proximity to larboard hand by george there be though sure enough continued smellie by sharpness of sound must be close aboard of point how be head coxswain before man must reply there came in low murmur from men pulling port oar be stirring up mud here sir on port hand at same moment looking up became aware that darkness be deeper more intense opaque a be on port hand than anywhere else all right answered smellie be point sure enough very prettily have hit off if can only make a good shot at mouth of creek will be more than satisfied how have be steering coxswain south east sir a straight a ever must keep be right south east be course way across now be beginning to draw off from point out into mid stream there must be no more talking upon pretence whatever noise of insect will tell when be drawing in with other bank on night like one have to be guided in great measure by sound even chirp of grasshopper may be made useful mr hawkesley murmured whispered assent a in duty bound then hand relapsed into silence once more men worked steadily away at oar not exerting to great extent keeping boat moving at rate of about four knot per hour according to time reckoning fact that volume of sound proceeding from southern bank of river have overpowered that from northern bank have accomplished rather more than half of passage across stream when happening to raise head upon emerging from brown study into have fallen thought caught momentary glimpse of object looming through fog broad on port beam looked more earnestly still presently felt convinced that there be something there laying hand on second lieutenant arm to call attention whispered can see anything out there sir abreast of on port hand smellie looked eagerly in indicated direction for moment then turning to coxswain whispered starboard hard boat helm be put over bow swept round then be certain that be being watched for a launch swerved out of course object became suddenly more distinct only to vanish completely into fog next moment however course being a suddenly promptly altered a own thus proving that there be other eye at least a sharp a ours single momentary glance have be sufficient to show that object be native canoe containing three person second lieutenant be seriously disconcerted at discovery be evidently in great doubt a to whether must be more prudent to push on to turn back if occupant of canoe happened to be associated with slaver have be sent out a scout in anticipation of attack from then there must be little doubt that must be wiser to turn back since light craft like canoe must easily reach creek far enough ahead of to give alarm in case must find warm reception prepared for in so dense fog advantage must be on side of manning slave fleet on other hand rencontre might possibly have be purely accidental occupant supremely indifferent to movement of ourselves slaver alike in case must be not only mortifying in extreme possibly fatal to smellie prospect in service if allowed to be frightened out of advantage of so excellent opportunity for effecting surprise be most embarrassing problem with thus suddenly found brought face to face with brave man question must not long remain open one few second sufficed to determine on proceeding taking chance sound from shore now rapidly increased in intensity by by suddenly found that proceeded from side of boat smellie drew out watch consulted by light of boat binnacle twenty minute to twelve be now entering creek whispered to slaver knew be anchored about two mile up creek conviction suddenly smote that in half hour must in probability be engaged in fierce deadly struggle somehow up to moment have only regarded attack a remote possibility something might be not very likely to happen suppose have unconsciously be entertaining doubt a to possibility of finding creek yet there be in nothing must now avert combat more le bloodshed nothing be except exceedingly unlikely circumstance of finding bird flown did wish be afraid honestly be unable to say whether be not be inclined to acquit of charge of cowardice sensation be peculiar rather unpleasant freely admit looking back upon now in light of long year of experience be disposed to attribute entirely to nervous excitement hitherto nostril have never sniffed odour of powder burned in anger be about to undergo perfectly new experience be about to engage with fellow men in mortal combat to come face to face with within arm length of who if opportunity occurred must take life deliberately without moment hesitation in short half hour might be dying dead a disagreeable inopportune reflection flashed through mind heart throbbed violently blood rushed to head breathing became so laboured felt a though be stifling disagreeable indeed might more truthfully call painful sensation lasted in intensity perhaps a long a five minute after rapidly subsided to be succeeded by feverish longing impatience for moment of action excitement ceased breathing again became regular period of suspense that period only few minute before have seemed so short now felt a though be lengthening out to veritable eternity wanted to begin at once to know worst to get over have not much longer to wait have advanced about mile up creek when deep hoarse voice be heard shouting something from shore oar exclaimed smellie men ceased pulling what be fellow said continued second lieutenant turning to have slightest idea sounded like spanish replied hail be repeated must make nothing of mr armitage however who boasted slight knowledge of spanish informed first cutter having by time drifted up abreast of that be caution to to return at once take consequence oh be be remarked smellie well seems that be discovered so further attempt at surprise be useless cast boat adrift from other will make dash for best chance now be to board carry three craft simultaneously with rush if can give way lad boat painter be cast off crew with ringing cheer plunged oar simultaneously into water away went at racing speed through dense fog along channel have scarcely pulled half dozen stroke when report of musket rang out from bank on starboard hand at same instant line of tiny spark of fire appeared on hand through thick haze rapidly increasing in size luminosity until stood revealed a huge fire of dry brushwood be twelve in number six on bank of channel be spaced about three hundred yard apart so large be that rendered fog quite luminous seemed pretty evident that have be built lighted for express purpose of illuminating channel revealing exact whereabouts be congratulating upon circumstance that dense fog must to considerable extent defeat purpose when in instant a though have passed out through solid wall emerged from fog there lay three slave craft before moored with spring on cable boarding netting triced up gun run out evidently quite ready to receive three craft be moored athwart channel in slightly curved line with bow pointing to eastward brig being ahead schooner next brigantine sternmost of line thus moored broadside commanded whole channel in direction of advance must if required be concentrated upon one point in hurrah shouted smellie rising to foot drawing sword hurrah lad there be game give way go at will take brig armitage tackle brigantine leave williams to deal with schooner now bend back launch there be glass of grog round waiting for if be alongside first hurroo pull bhoys let shecure that grog annyhow exclaimed irrepressible flanaghan with cheer hearty laugh men stretched out plied stout ashen oar until water fairly buzzed again under launch bow almost seemed a though must lift bodily out of water a for armitage williams be evidently quite determined not to be beaten in race if must help be on foot drawn sword in right hand pistol in left body bobbing energetically forward in approved racing fashion at stroke of oar whilst voice of first one then other must be heard encouraging respective crew with such exclamation a pull now pull hard there lift now travel there draw ahead well pulled again so so on men while straining at oar with zeal energy left in wake of boat long line of swirling foamy whirlpool be within about eighty yard of slaver launch leading by good half length when voice on board brig uttered word of command same instant crash came broadside at fired simultaneously from three ship gun be well aimed shot flying close over round tearing thrashing up placid surface of water about boat sprinkling to extent for moment seemed to be passing through heavy shower yet strange to say damage be done before gun must be again loaded be alongside then ensued so far at least a launch be concerned few minute of such desperate hand to hand fighting a have never since witnessed dashed alongside brig in wake of larboard main rigging a boat side touched that of slaver man dropped oar seized cutlas sprang for main channel here however be received so warmly that be found utterly impossible to make good footing men springing up only to fall back again into boat wounded with pike thrust pistol bullet cutlas gash smellie happened to make dash for same spot being lighter of two be jostled aside by narrowly avoided tumbling overboard succeeded in gaining temporary footing on chain plate be evidently about to scramble thence upon sheer pole when saw pike thrust out at from over topgallant bulwark point struck in right shoulder passing completely through thrust upset balance down came by run into boat lad meanwhile be cutting hacking most desperately at boarding netting endeavouring to make passage way through unfortunately have emptied pistol in first rush unable to reach enemy through netting be completely at mercy in le than three minute hand be back in boat one of more le hurt nearer to getting on board than have be before beginning of attack cutter have evidently fared better for be already hauling off discomfited seeing smellie who seemed scarcely conscious of wound reluctantly gave order for to follow example promptly did poor smellie pitied for must see be deeply mortified at defeat three boat converged toward other a hauled off a soon a be within speaking distance of second lieutenant inquired of armitage williams whether have suffered much have one man killed think none of have escaped quite scot free be armitage reply whilst williams reported that two of men be seriously hurt seven others slightly wounded well said smellie be evident that can hing with unless change tactic will therefore three of attack schooner two cutter boarding one on bow whilst in launch will make feint of attacking brigantine passing however at last moment boarding schooner aft now away go boat upon be quickly swept round off dashed toward respective point of attack be still fully hundred yard distant when broadside be poured into time with very destructive effect so far a launch be concerned be struck by le than five nine pound shot two of played havoc with oar on starboard side third tore out about twelve foot of planking gunwale on same side remaining two struck boat stem close together completely demolishing bow worst of killing three men launch be now wreck sinking smellie therefore conceiving to be best chance under circumstance gave order to steer straight for schooner main chain succeeded in reaching quarry before boat sank be launch capsizing alongside a sprang from gunwale to of schooner very fortunately for two cutter have arrived nearly minute before when boarded entire crew of schooner be on forecastle fully occupied in endeavour to repel attack taking advantage of quietly rapidly slipped in on deck through open port aft then made furious charge forward attacking spaniard in rear presence on board seemed to take considerably by surprise wavered hesitated incited by burly ruffian who forced way through crowd rallied once more attacked hotly be exactly what wanted fellow by smellie order contented with acting for time being strictly on defensive giving way gradually before impetuous attack of spaniard drawing by degree away from forecastle diversion be thus effected in favour of cutter crew of be not slow to avail in le than five minute after attack of launch crew entire party have gained footing upon schooner deck even then spanish crew continued to fight desperately inflicting several very severe wound upon lad until at last thoroughly roused by such obstinacy blue jacket made determined charge that cleared deck by actually literally driving opponent overboard not that entailed much loss upon spaniard however for very nearly swam to brig brigantine where be promptly hauled on board on side smellie lost not moment in availing to fullest extent of partial victory ordered cutter to be dropped under schooner stern whilst be being done spring be veered away hauled upon until schooner be brought broadside on to former consort now antagonist done lad went to gun double shotted succeeded in delivering awfully destructive raking broadside fore aft along deck of brig brigantine frightful outcry confusion ensued on board craft assured that fire have wrought tremendous amount of execution among men crowding deck be too wise to give opportunity to repeat dose spring be promptly manned by time that schooner battery be again loaded antagonist have brought broadside to bear upon once more be double shotted broadside hurled upon foe then before lad have time to run in gun received combined fire of brig brigantine in return through sharp ringing explosion of antagonist nine pounder distinctly heard crashing of shot through schooner timber then o god will never forget piercing shriek groan of mortal agony uprose beneath foot not man of upon schooner deck be injured by terrible double broadside for spaniard resolved to sink craft have depressed muzzle of gun sent shot through schooner side just above water line on one side out through bottom on other regardless of fact that vessel hold be packed full of slave slaughter resulted among unhappy creature thus closely huddled together must leave to reader imagination be simply indescribable for moment hand of on board schooner be struck dumb motionless with horror at act of cowardice wanton barbarity then with yell of righteous fury lad turned again to gun thenceforward be loaded fired independently a rapidly a possible slaver on part be not behindhand in alacrity presently received broadside from brig closely followed by one from brigantine gun being in case aimed a before with similar murderous result with repetition of heart rending shriek of agony despair god ca bear heard smellie a dying shriek of negro below again pealed out upon startled air mr williams take dozen men below free unhappy black know whether be acting prudently not can not leave chained helplessly down there to be cut to piece by shot of spanish fiend let come on deck take chance with of at least may possibly effect escape in schooner boat by swimming to shore williams lost time in setting about perilous work of mercy few minute after disappearance down main hatchway unhappy slave began to make appearance on deck where first stared in terrified wonder about then crouched down helplessly on deck wherever might happen to find in meantime cannonade be kept briskly up on side presently spaniard began to pepper with musketry in addition bullet fired at short range flew thickly about casualty quickly increased several of unfortunate black falling victim to first discharge seeing smellie ordered schooner boat three in number to be lowered slave passed into be done lad leaving gun for few minute for purpose will be credited spaniard sooner became aware of purpose than directed fire upon boat hapless occupant so that be compelled to quickly drag unhappy black back on board schooner again to save from being ruthlessly slaughtered worst of be that though williams have succeeded in freeing many of from heavy chain with be secured together in schooner hold most of still wore heavy fetter on ankle now proceeded to knock off a fast a must afterwards pitching poor wretch overboard with scant ceremony fear to take chance of being able to reach shore during spaniard never ceased firing upon for instant so there be in midst of perfect hailstorm of round shot bullet air about thick suffocating with smoke from gun only light quick intermittent flash of cannon musketry whole atmosphere vibrating with roar rattle of fusillade shout of combatant shriek of wounded dying struggling with unhappy negro who driven almost frantic with unwonted sight sound around seemed quite unable to comprehend intention resisted to utmost well meant endeavour to pas over ship side into water in midst of tumult confusion be suddenly confronted by additional horror williams badly wounded in head by splinter staggering on deck closely followed by men with news that schooner be rapidly sinking that be impossible to free more of black glanced down hatchway merciful heaven will ever forget sight met eye in brief glimpse intelligence be only too literally true by dim light of horn lantern williams have suspended from beam must see black water welling bubbling

backwards beneath flood heart be bursting with grief indignation grief for miserable dying wretch around indignation at utter inability to prevent such wholesale human suffering there be time to lose schooner be already settling down beneath foot saw that must very soon be man for god for so passed charge on deck quickly followed be just in time to see smellie spinning schooner wheel hard over to port lashing there divining in instant that hoped by manoeuvre to sheer schooner alongside brig seized child have brought up from below dropped into one of own boat astern then stood by to make spring for brig with rest of party minute more side of two ship touched now lad follow spring for life schooner be sinking heard smellie shout away went armitage leading one party forward smellie showing way to rest of aft even a made spring schooner heeled over sank alongside be met a before by so stubborn resistance believe one of received fresh hurt more le serious before actually reached deck of brig lad be by time fully aroused boarding netting anything else must longer restrain in few second though more than one poor fellow fell back dead be in possession of brig crew in obedience to order from captain suddenly flinging down weapon tumbling headlong into boat for reason reason be soon to learn have lowered into water to surprise antagonist instead of taking refuge on board brigantine a fully expected must took to oar pulled in frantic haste up creek in dense darkness now ensued consequent upon cessation of firing be impossible to send shot after with chance of success so be allowed to go free hot pungent fume arose through grating of brig main hatchway very convincingly testified to presence of slave on board that craft also warned by recent experience on board schooner smellie resolved to warp brig in alongside bank land unfortunate creature before resuming hostility gang of men be accordingly sent forward to clear away necessary warp so on be directed to go with boat crew into one of cutter to run end of warp on boat will be remembered have be passed astern of schooner there still remained uninjured that craft having settled down in water so willow that deck be only submerged to depth of about eighteen inch in order to reach of boat however be necessary to pas along deck of sunken craft be just climbing down brig side to do so men having preceded when bulwark to be clinging suddenly burst outward brig hull be rent open by tremendous explosion enveloped for instant in sheet of blinding flame felt whirled upwards outwards for considerable distance to fall

reluctance to return to so exceedingly disagreeable be process that if must have have own way just then think must have preferred to die first sensation be that of excessive stiffness in part of body with distracting headache then a nerve more fully recovered function ensued burning fever scorched body sent blood rushing through throbbing vein like torrent of molten metal finally a made

much finer looking more athletic men than in bond round about who from weapon bore at once concluded to be captor surmise be soon afterwards proved to be correct for upon completion of meal be busily discussing when first made out approached with sufficiently significant gesture gave to understand that must rise march captive black rose to foot stolidly without apparent difficulty so far a be concerned be impossibility foot a well a hand being secured one great hulking black fellow noticing that smellie showed sign of obedience deliberately proceeded to prod here there with point of spear upon smellie delicate attention produced effect whatever evidently being dead insensible aroused in very lively feeling of indignation under influence of launched vigorous kick at unreasonable darky

allow of two men walking abreast have not much opportunity however for noting of incident of journey for owing to clumsy way in be being carried wound burst open afresh soon fainted from loss of blood when next recovered consciousness found that be afloat doubt on river though have mean of ascertaining for certain a be lying in bottom of canoe must see nothing blue sky beyond of gunwale smellie be lying beside to great joy found that be not only alive great deal better than must have thought possible after witnessing former desperate condition of course at once exchanged congratulation at other

canoe with beside poor fellow be in sad plight be severely wounded in le than four different part of body face hand be badly scorched clothing about be always very particular hung upon in tatter lastly be greatly distressed in mind at disastrous failure of expedition at fearfully heavy casualty knew have befallen attacking party at extreme probability that casualty have be very largely increased by blowing up of brig said what must to comfort ala be not much be relief to to change subject even though naturally turned at once to discussion of own problematical future craft in found

that being ranged in semicircle in front of idol have rather sinister appearance having secured prisoner to satisfaction captor left be speedily surrounded by curious crowd consisting chiefly of woman child who came stared persistently with open mouthed curiosity at captive especially at smellie greatly attracted by apparently novel sight of white skin old woman be for most part hideously ugly wrinkled bent grizzled wool plastered with grease dirt body positively encrusted with filth young woman on other hand be to say whose age seemed to range between thirteen sixteen seventeen be by mean destitute of personal attraction to do justice exhibited with most boundless liberality be possessed of plump well made figure limb be in many case very finely moulded have upright graceful carriage expression of feature be amiable gentle notwithstanding rather prominent lip few of be actually pretty one of damsel perfect little sable hebe seemed to be greatly attracted by walking round round

whether be genuine flesh blood satisfied that be so backed off to take look at thought expression of pity overspread face finally addressed be of course quite unable to understand word uttered action graceful a be be significant enough be evidently asking whether be hungry thirsty to inquiry smellie nodded prompt affirmative backed up with single word rather uttered so expressively that be certain quite understood at event tripped lightly away returning in few minute with small finely woven basket containing about two quart of fresh palm juice presented first to smellie lip then to mine need say that between emptied hostess laughed gaily a glanced at empty basket evidently pleased at success of attempt to converse with then with reassuring word two tripped away again only to return however about quarter of hour later with same basket filled time with kind of porridge though not particularly tasty be acceptable enough after long fast fair rather dark friend administered to alternately by mean of flat wooden spatula feeding process have not passed need hardly be said unobserved by time that meal be concluded quite large audience of woman have gathered round to witness performance animated jabber hearty ringing laughter of several of younger woman somewhat abashed yet pleased expression of own particular friend seemed to indicate badinage be not altogether unknown even in obscure african village everything of kind be brought abruptly to end by loud discordant blowing of horn hollow tub tub tub of number of rude drum at sound crowd around broke up at once retired little hebe casting back at more than one glance strongly indicative a seemed to of compassion fire have be kindled in front of idol fetish during feeding process above referred to now that curious crowd of woman girl who then surrounded have retired be able to see little more of what be going on horn blowing drum beating emanated from group of entirely naked savage who be marching in kind of procession round idol ceremony lasted about ten minute when negro made appearance upon scene emerging from temple if such actually be bearing in hand queer looking construction nature of be at first unable to distinguish after marching solemnly round idol three time individual seated tailor fashion before laid instrument on knee began to hammer upon with couple of stick whereupon became aware that be playing upon rude imitation of child harmonicon key of appeared to be constructed of hard wood out of managed to beat very fair specimen of barbaric music music seemed to be overture to impending entertainment for upon sound of first note inhabitant began to pour out of hut to gather in promiscuous crowd round giant tree stump upon hideous fetish be mounted when gathering be apparently complete music ceased drumming horn blowing burst out afresh crowd immediately divided into two section smaller presume more select division squatting on ground in semicircle in front of image whilst remainder of inhabitant ranged into two quadrant about thirty foot apart one on side in front of deity through open space between two quadrant appeared probable that must obtain very good if rather distant view of ceremony be evidently about to take place audience having arranged in position horn blowing ceased musician stepped inside inner circle seated to right left of fetish pause of perhaps couple of minute ensued then horn drum harmonicon suddenly burst out with loud confused fantasia man apparently doing utmost to drown noise of others louder louder blared horn drummer pounded upon long narrow drum until seemed a though at stroke drum head must inevitably be beaten in whilst harmonicon man hammered away at instrument with vigour rapidity must have be truly gratifying to friend in midst of wild hullabaloo blood curdling yell rang out upon still night air from open door of temple fetish house there bounded into inner circle most extraordinary figure clad from head to heel in monkey skin head adorned with coronet of bead feather bead necklace round neck living snake encircling waist a girdle bearing in hand red black wand about four foot long upon appearance of individual uproar suddenly ceased then maestro who presided at harmonicon struck up low accompaniment last comer burst into subdued monotonous chant pointing gesticulating from time to time with wand watched proceeding with great deal of interest be beginning to wonder what must happen next when smellie turned to quietly asked mr hawkesley do ever say prayer sir ejaculated in unutterable surprise at so impertinent question a seemed to asked whether ever said prayer ought to have said rather do ever pray there be often very great difference between two act returned quietly well ah yes be certainly sir do stammered then said smellie let recommend to pray now to pray with earnestness sincerity of be capable make peace with god if have not already done so whilst have opportunity for unless be very greatly mistaken be doom to die to night be so shocked so completely knocked off balance by unlooked for communication for moment lost power of speech tongue clave to roof of mouth must only stare at fellow prisoner in horrified incredulity poor boy said compassionately be afraid have spoken to too abruptly ought to have prepared gradually for so momentous piece of intelligence to have broken news to there what matter be plucky lad hawkesley conduct last night abundantly proved be sure that if occasion must come will stand up face death in presence of savage a

christian be to be first victim must appear farewell dear boy god bless grant happy meeting at right hand on last great day strove in vain to reply to solemnly affectionate farewell wanted to let know how inexpressibly precious to be few word of exhortation encouragement have spoken to say be only single word to cheer last moment with assurance that have not spoken in vain emotion be too great felt that in effort to speak must inevitably burst into tear so perhaps unman disgrace in eye of inhuman savage so perforce held peace watched with wildly beating heart to see how brave man must die in meantime fetish man have concluded chant in midst of breathless silence on part of audience stood looking intently round circle at group of prisoner secured to tree glanced keenly at of in turn at length pointed wand straight at smellie be action caused second lieutenant to announce to belief that be who be to be first victim of impending sacrificial ceremony keeping wand pointed directly at companion uncouth figure slowly with quite undescribable undulatory dancing motion advanced toward tree crowd hastily making way for four member of inner circle rising to foot following at touch from finger overcoming by strong effort horrible fascination loathsome wretch exercised over turned to look at companion seemed to be utterly unconscious of surroundings eye be raised to heaven lip moved from time to time be manifest that be holding most solemn momentous communion be possible for man to hold even with maker pale haggard worn with mental physical suffering crisp brown curly hair stiff matted with blood face streaked with ensanguined stain scorched clothing hanging about in blood stained rag nevertheless thought must be difficult to picture more perfect embodiment of good noble brave man slowly sinuously like serpent stealing upon prey fetish man witch doctor advanced until stood within yard of intended victim with fatal wand still pointing straight at smellie breast stood thus for full minute more seemingly striving to wring from bound helpless prisoner sign of panic at least of discomposure in vain last most solemn act of duty done smellie at length turned eye upon of enemy regarding with gaze so calmly steadfast so palpably devoid of fear that savage mortified at utter failure suddenly with exclamation unmistakably indicative of rage chagrin dropped point of wand to raise again instantly direct toward breast cool intrepidity have just witnessed be contagious in sublime admiration of soul soared far above beyond reach of so debasing feeling a fear in turn met cruel sinister gaze of crafty savage with one a calm a smellie own for perhaps full minute may have be more may have be le be difficult to estimate lapse of time under such trying circumstance fetish man did best to disconcert then baffled once more with furious threatening gesture passed on to next prisoner be reprieved for time being said smellie a gesticulating witch doctor myrmidon passed on only to become victim of more refined protracted torture at last having failed to exhibit sign of fear in first instance be spared to witness cumulative suffering of who be to precede in order that by sight of exquisite torment courage may be quelled by anticipation of own imagine from what have read of custom of people that be about to witness become participant in ceremony undertaken to avert remove great calamity ceremony involving sacrifice of many victim of whom be put to death with more refined barbarity than dealt out to victim preceding ah see there worthy victim have at last be found with to begin sacrifice looked in direction eye indicated sure enough light fatal stroke with wand be just in act of being struck upon naked breast of one of negro prisoner a blow fell loud shriek of despair rang out from lip of wretched man fetish man four assistant sprang upon prey bond be cut in moment be dragged struggling desperately shrieking with mortal fear into inner circle up to broad tree stump supported fetish idol in meantime fire have be bountifully replenished with wood now blazed up fiercely by ruddy light saw fetish man retire to interior of temple fetish house to appear immediately afterwards with rude stone hammer in one hand what looked like four five large spike nail in other stood for moment gloating over agonised countenance of victim then nodded head at signal four assistant seized prisoner despite terrible struggle rapidly placed head downwards with back against tree stump limb extended a far a must go round when fetish man proceeded with cruel deliberation to secure in position by nailing there spike taken from fetish house being used for purpose horn drum harmonicon now broke forth afresh into hideous clamour however be powerless to drown dismal shriek of victim fetish man arming with large broad bladed most murderous looking knife began to dance slowly with most extraordinary contortion of visage body round idol gradually gyration grew more rapid gesture more extravagant knife be flourished in air in increasingly threatening manner at length a weird dancer whirled rapidly round tree stump weapon be at revolution plunged ruthlessly into writhing body of hapless victim utmost care being taken noticed to avoid vital part finally when dancer have apparently danced into frenzy when gyration have become so rapid that almost made giddy to look at when contortion of body grew so extravagant that be difficult to say whether be dancing on head on heel there flashed sudden lightning like gleam of knife head of miserable victim fell to ground to be snatched up instantly with still twitching feature nailed between foot of body loud murmur of applause from spectator greeted effort of fetish man in midst of retired for few minute to interior of fetish house probably to recruit somewhat exhausted energy chapter ten fiendish ceremonial now said smellie a turned once more to will probably be again threatened on reappearance of bloodthirsty villain do hawkesley maintain bold front let see sign trace whatever of weakness discomposure in fellow thirst for blood be by time fully aroused succeeding victim will be subjected to greater refinement of torture diabolical scoundrel fiendish ingenuity will now be exercised to devise for victim increasingly atrocious protracted agony there be one only one hope for be that by persistent refusal to be terrorised by judiciously scornful demeanour may at last exasperate out of self control thus provoke into inflicting upon coup de grace at once without of preliminary torment here come again now for own sake dear lad remember act upon advice first act of wretch be to despatch four assistant into forest whence returned in short time with three long slender pole considerable quantity of creeper monkey rope with under fetish man superintendence very tolerable set of light shear be speedily constructed when finished be erected immediately over fire now immense mass of glowing smokeless cinder in front of idol entire arrangement be so unmistakably suggestive must not restrain violent shudder a occurred to that might possibly be fate to be subjected to fiery torment being ready dead silence once more fell upon assembly chief actor in inhuman ceremonial once more looked keenly around for victim a in first instance so now again be wand pointed at smellie breast once more cruel crafty bearer of advanced on tip toe with stealthy cat like tread toward approached thus until have reached to within about ten foot of tree when once more paused in front of gesticulating with wand making a though about to strike with light blow seemed to be stroke of doom keenly watching while for sign of trepidation on part of victim then whilst wretch be in very midst of fantastic genuflexion before smellie turned to with smile observed just picture to hawkesley way in that fellow must be made to jump if tom collins boatswain mate must only approach from behind now freshen way with just one touch of cat ' there be perhaps not much in picture thus suggested to abnormally excited imagination seemed so supremely ridiculous that incontinently burst into violent uncontrollable fit of hysterical laughter precise effect afterwards ascertained smellie be anxious to produce so highly exasperating fetish man that with eye fairly sparkling with rage advanced struck violent blow on mouth with filthy hand passing on immediately afterwards to seek elsewhere for victim have not far to seek miserable wretch next on left be so paralysed with fear that be deemed fit proper person to become next sacrifice almost unresistingly until resistance be too late be dragged forward into inner circle thrown flat upon stomach hand foot bound securely together behind then indeed seemed suddenly to awake to sense of horrid fate superhuman struggle for freedom ear splitting yell be simply dreadful beyond description to see hear fetish man assistant confident of reliable character of work stood back looked on quietly at miserable wretch unavailing struggle seemed to be regarded a quite part of entertainment unhappy creature be allowed to continue unmolested until ceased from exhaustion then when lay quite still panting breathless with eye starting from socket perspiration streaming from pore fetish man approached deftly bending on to fettered limb end of stout monkey rope be dragged along ground into fire thence triced in instant up to shear whence hung suspended at height of about foot immediately over glowing ember miserable sufferer bore torment a long a must will never forget awful sight distorted feature presented a drawing back head a far a must from fierce heat glared round circle seeking perchance for hand merciful enough to put out of misery after first minute of suffering stoicism abandoned writhed so violently that fetish man assistant have to steady shear in order to prevent from capsizing altogether with writhe of victim slender pole bent gave letting miserable sufferer sink down three four inch nearer fire superhuman struggle frightful contortion writhings of man ear splitting yell horrible smell of roasting flesh oh god be awful beyond attempt at description pray may never look upon ghastly sight again fiendish exhibition have probably reached most appalling phase be wondering shudderingly what form of torture must possibly exceed in cruelty when there be sudden slight movement of bond slackened fell away from tree trunk against leaned be free not moment be allowed in to get over first shock of bewilderment soft plump hand grasped mine gently drew round behind tree so rapidly that have only time to note fact apparently eye in assembly be fixed upon writhing figure suspended over fire before have fairly realised what be happening found dozen yard away from starting point gliding rapidly noiselessly through deep shadow cast by tree trunk towards outer darkness prevailed beyond range of fire light with little black hebe friend of few hour before dragging along on one side of smellie on other five minute later have left village so far behind that barbarous sound of horn drum mingled with yell of anguish from tortured victim momentarily becoming more more softened by increasing distance be sole evidence remained to of existence found hurrying along through rank grass threading maze of park like clump of lofty timber forcing passage through thickly clustering festoon of parasitic orchid under subdued light of mellow star alone with almost breathless rapidity tender hearted little deliverer hurried forward frequently exclaiming in low urgent accent zola ku zola ku so expressively uttered that have difficulty in interpreting word to mean that there be most extreme necessity for rapid movement on part accordingly hastened step to utmost limit of capacity in about ten minute from moment of liberation emerged upon long narrow strip of sandy beach with noble river sweeping grandly to seaward before here guide paused for moment apparently pondering a to what must next be best to do glancing down river saw indistinctly at about two hundred yard distance shapeless object took to be canoe drawn up on beach pointing to exclaimed to smellie be not canoe if be what be to prevent seizing one making way down river without further ado little hebe glanced in direction have indicated seemed quite to understand nature of suggestion for shook head violently exclaimed rapidly in accent of very decided dissent ve ve ve pointing at same time to smellie own untended wound at moment loud confused shouting arose in distant village strongly suggestive of discovery of flight sound apparently helped guide to decision a to next step for seizing hand afresh led straight into river until water be up to knee then turned sharply to right up stream pressing forward rapidly way freshened very decidedly by unmistakable shout of pursuit emanating from neighbourhood of village reached after about quarter of hour of arduous toil small creek forty yard wide pausing here for moment guide made with hand arm motion of swimming pointed across creek touched smellie on breast with query yenu then rapidly repeated same process with took to mean inquiry a to ability to swim creek replied yes with affirmative nod whereupon guide raising finger to express necessity for extreme caution uttering warning ngandu a next pointed to water of creek waded gently without raising ripple into deep water smellie following with few quiet stroke happily reached other side in safety to plunge forthwith into friendly shadow of forest have known then what learned afterwards that word ngandu be congoese for crocodile that be uttered a intimation to that river creek literally swarm with reptile be possible that swim short though be must not have be undertaken with quite so much composure once fairly in forest became so dark that be quite impossible for to see whither be going guide seemed to be well acquainted with route from comparatively few obstacle met with seemed to be tolerably well beaten path so crowded sail pressed along with tolerable rapidity behind slender black almost indistinguishable figure of leader pursuit too be hotly maintained a must tell by occasional shout sudden swishings of branch at great distance from in bush at length after most wearisome painful tramp of fully nine mile got fairly out of reach of sound finally at sign from deliverer flung down in midst of thick growth of fern at foot of giant tree despite increasing anguish of wound soon went to sleep awoke at daybreak to find alone guide of previous night have vanished be greatly disconcerted at for felt that must like to have done something though scarcely knew what to mark appreciation of extremely important service of preceding night besides somehow have taken notion into head that in liberating have committed unpardonable sin against former friend that when crossed creek plunged into forest with be virtually cutting adrift from own people casting in lot with in case if must succeed in making good escape finding way back to ship have little doubt about ability to make such arrangement on behalf a must cause to rejoice for remainder of life at having befriended however seemed a though having conducted to place of temporary safety have returned to village doubtless hoping to escape suspicion of having have hand in liberation be glorious morning sun be darting early beam through richly variegated foliage touching here there with gold giant trunk limb of forest tree earth around be thickly carpeted with long grass interspersed with dense fern brake here there magnificent clump of aloe long waxy leaf delicate white blossom standing out in strong relief against blaze of intense scarlet rich vivid green of neighbouring bush early morning air be cool pure refreshing a gently fanned fevered temple wafted to thousand delicate perfume bird glancing like living gem between clump of foliage be saluting other blithely a set out upon diurnal quest for food bee be already busy among gorgeous flower butterfly more lovely even than delicate blossom above poised flitted merrily about from bough to bough nature in fact be rejoicing at advent of new day ill suffering though be must not in measure take part in general joy a with heart overflowing with gratitude remembered that have escaped horror of previous night glance two about scrambled to foot intent in first instance upon immediate search for water have just settled question a to direction seemed most promising for commencement of quest when clear musical call floated toward looking in direction from whence came beheld black hebe approaching dragging small dead antelope by heel after so have not abandoned after on contrary have probably spent good part of night arranging for capture of creature be to furnish with breakfast on joining held up prize for inspection then with joyous laugh at approving remark at meaning of must of course only make roughest of guess set to work deftly to clear away lay bare space upon to start fire in task a soon a saw what wanted assisted to best of poor ability done went groping about beneath tree apparently in search of something soon returning with two piece of dry stick one of noticed have hole in quantity of dry leaf stick be next collected having arranged to satisfaction knelt down inserting pointed end of one stick in hole of other twirled rapidly between palm of hand producing by friction thus set up first slight wreath of smoke ultimately tiny flame be carefully communicated to dry leaf then gently fanned by breath into blaze in way capital fire for cooking purpose be speedily obtained in meantime smellie have produced knife have undertaken to skin cut up animal juicy steak from be soon spluttering on pointed stick before fire cooking operation being thus put in satisfactory progress little black friend borrowed knife plunged once more into forest depth to return again shortly afterwards with huge gourd full of deliciously clear cool water antelope steak be by time ready sat down to breakfast together for own part must say thoroughly enjoyed meal be sorry to observe smellie ate with little appetite drinking large quantity of water however poor fellow made complaint must tell by haggard look flushed cheek glittering eye that be quite time wound be attended to must be having down with fever in bush then heaven alone must tell when must if ever be able to rejoin daphne be not to be allowed to sink tamely into state of despondency apprehension sable lady friend proved to be like rest of sex great talker seized opportunity afforded by discussion of breakfast to plunge into animated conversation began by introducing managed in quite original fashion pausing for moment with piece of steak poised daintily on large thorn pointed to herself remarked mono then touched smellie lightly on breast added ingeya ingeya nodded gravely to signify that understood thought did upon pointed to herself once more observed mono lubembabemba being interpreted mean a take that ladyship name be lubem by something most obedient servant miss lubin by laughed very pretty musical little laugh at smellie elaborate assumption of mock gallantry bungling effort to pronounce name lubem ba bemba corrected time gallant second lieutenant managed to stumble through correctly at there be more laughter rejoicing on lady part then be called upon to repeat name having paid most praiseworthy attention whilst smellie be receiving lesson managed to do very fairly then flushed with success miss lubembabemba made further attempt at conversation pointing to herself repeating name next pointed to smellie asked ingeya meaning be so evident that smellie answered at once with elaborate bow harold smellie at service halold smellie at o serveece repeated with wide opened eye of wonder at what doubtless thought very extraordinary name burst involuntarily into laugh at really clever first attempt to reproduce second lieutenant polite speech at first looked decidedly disconcerted immediately afterwards joined heartily in laugh against said smellie wo do have got quite right harold harold halold repeated after two three attempt to put right attempt failed from evident inability to pronounce r smellie be obliged to rest content with being henceforward called halold then of course turned to with same inquiry ingeya dick said time caught name accurately then to show that clearly understood whole proceeding pointed to smellie to to herself in rotation pronouncing respective name yes commented smellie approvingly have learned lesson very well indeed dear will never be able to remember that extraordinary name of yours lubemba what be know besides will take dog watch to pronounce in full so propose that change re christen after ship eh call daphne ' know how must like that daphne halold since will have so strapping young gentleman dick must that suit daphne halold dick pointing to of in turn ladyship seemed to take proposal a tremendous compliment for face lighted up with pleasure kept on pointing round circle repeating halold dick daphne until breakfast be concluded thenceforward refused to answer to other name than daphne assuming air of most complete unconsciousness when of presumed to address a lubembabemba butterfly breakfast over thought be high time to attend to wound first requirement be water plenty of want managed with little difficulty to explain to miss daphne comprehending meaning at last intimated that stream be to be found at great distance at once set off in search of little black friend carrying along with live ember from fire by waving occasionally in air managed to keep glowing have not very far to go most fortunately for saw that smellie wound be momentarily giving increased uneasiness pain walk of about quarter of hour took to sequestered most delightful spot where be not only perfectly concealed from chance wanderer where also found small rocky basin full of deliciously cool pure water flowed into from tiny stream meandering down steep hill side in basin laved hurt until be thoroughly cleansed from dry hard coagulated blood then set about task of bandaging up daphne who by way seemed to have little idea of surgery made herself of great use to in bathing process when once understood what be required when came to bandaging found unable to help further sorrowfully confessed beaten be compelled to convert shirt only linen in possession into bandage poor daphne to evident extreme sorrow have linen to sacrifice to necessity indeed clothing at to speak of costume of congoese belle according to rendering of be petticoat of parti coloured bead fringe about twelve inch deep depending loosely from hip rest of clothing consisting entirely a mike flanaghan must have said of jewellery of wore considerable quantity may a well here enumerate ornament for information benefit of who have never enjoyed acquaintance of african beauty in first place wore circular band of metal about two inch wide round head across forehead band coronet have plain border of about inch wide inside border for about inch in width throughout length metal be cut away in very fine line forming intricate really elegant lace like pattern then wore also very large pair of circular ear ring similarly ornamented ornament being so large heavy that have actually stretched lobe so spoiled shape of what must otherwise have be very pretty pair of ear upon of plump finely shaped arm between shoulder elbow wore four five massive armlet of peculiar by mean unskilled workmanship lastly round ankle wore single anklet of similar workmanship on previous night when rather lavish display of jewellery have first attracted casual notice have imagined to be brass now seeing again in full light of day discovered to be gold almost quite pure a judged from softness to return to subject daphne first task on arrival at pool have be to kindle fire after helping a far a must to doctor wound next undertook exploration of forest in immediate neighbourhood returning in about hour time with three long thin straight shaft of kind of bamboo three small uprooted sapling article forthwith plunged into fire after hour diligent work manipulated bamboo into three very effective lance javelin sapling into three truly formidable club knotted root being charred trimmed until formed rounded head a large a one two fist put together one of of weapon presented to smellie to retaining one of for herself thus armed be ready to set out once more upon travel be high time that wandering must be conducted with something like method object be of course to rejoin ship with least possible delay before making fresh start smellie thought must be just a well to acquaint companion with desire accordingly undertook to do so very amusing scene resulted succeeded at last in making wish clearly understood achieved once more resumed march chapter eleven faithful unto death by time that be finally ready to start be about noon heat have become intensely oppressive refreshing zephyr of morning have died completely away motionless atmosphere rarefied by burning ray of sun be quiver not beast bird insect be stirring throughout whole length breadth of far stretching forest aisle grass flower leaf of tree graceful festoon of parasitic creeper be all a still a though cut out of iron stagnant air be saturated to oppressiveness with thousand mingled perfume not sound of kind broke in upon death like stillness of scene be nature silent hour hour of intensest heat short interval about noon when living thing appear to retire into most sheltered nook darkest coolest shadow one hour out of twenty four when absolute unbroken silence reign throughout african forest under daphne leadership struck off on westerly course through green shadow of forest toiled laboriously forward until dusky twilight warned of necessity for seeking resting place wherein to pas coming night be found at length in centre of wide clearing break in forest smellie at daphne expressively conveyed pantomimic suggestion forthwith set about gathering wherewithal to build fire whilst damsel undertook task of providing supper for party task be barely completed when dusky ladyship returned with three grey parrot pair of green pigeon a well a large gourd of water from eventually managed to make very satisfying supper circle of fire be then built about camping place flung down in long grass to sleep two at least of party being a can vouch thoroughly done up managed to get perhaps couple of hour of sleep then rest be completely destroyed for remainder of night by well sustained attack on part of countless tick ant other inquisitive insect persisted in perambulating body busily taking sample bite out of skin in evident effort to ascertain locality of tenderest portion of anatomy next morning discovered with greatest concern that smellie be downright ill so much so that soon became evident must be quite impossible for to prosecute journey for day at least daphne distress at unfortunate state of affair be very keen be pre eminently sensible little body seeing almost at glance what be wanted promptly diverting sympathy into practical channel at once set off in search of more suitable abiding place than one have occupied through night at length found in open glade at great distance thither promptly removed patient rapidly increasing seriousness of symptom admonishing that there be little room for delay new camping place be lovely spot being open amphitheatre of about ten acre in extent surrounded on side by forest having tiny rivulet of pure sparkling fresh water flowing through daphne of course at once took lead in arrangement necessary for what threatened to be somewhat protracted sojourn by direction be singular how rapidly be learning to make ourselves mutually understood proceeded in first instance to clear away grass a far a possible from circular space fifteen foot in diameter within few yard of bank of stream daphne meanwhile having borrowed smellie knife went off into forest from soon afterwards returned with heavy load of long tough pliant wand flinging upon ground next busied in lighting fire on partially cleared space employing to procure for necessary material when large enough bonfire have be constructed ember be red hot spread carefully over whole of space upon have be working thus effectually destroyed what grass have be unable to remove done next task be to cut wand wattle to uniform length of about twenty seven foot point at end after by driving end into soil on opposite side of cleared circle of ground soon have complete framework of hemi spherical bee hive like structure second load of wattle be however necessary to strengthen framework to daphne liking leaving poor smellie for nonce to take care of pair of set out to procure daphne led to dense brake wherein immense number of wattle be to be found leaving to cut a many a must carry proceeded further afield in quest of building material of sort have completed task be back in camp preparing load for use when daphne returned time came staggering in under tremendous load of palm leaf rightly guessed be to be used for thatch so toiled on during whole of day like preceding be intensely hot by dusk hut be so far complete a to be capable of affording shelter during succeeding night by mid day of following day be quite finished efficient shelter having thus be provided for smellie from scorching ray of sun be then in position to give undivided attention of by time stood in most urgent need ensuing fortnight be one of ceaseless anxiety to daphne poor smellie being prostrate with raging fever utterly helpless during whole of time fugitive a be in savage country be quite out of power to procure assistance medical otherwise be thrown completely upon own resource have nothing whatever to guide in inexperience daphne to surprise appeared to posse knowledge of healing art thus treatment of patient devolved solely upon what must do have drug have have access to best appointed apothecary shop must still have lacked knowledge requisite for right use of content so be obliged doubt fortunately for patient to allow nature to take course merely adopting such simple precautionary measure a must suggest to anyone possessed of average common sense provided for patient comfortable fragrant springy bed of specie of heather cleansed dressed wound a often a seemed necessary kept a cool a possible fed entirely upon fruit of mild agreeable acid flavour during fortnight smellie be undoubtedly hovering on borderland between life death for tireless tender solicitude of daphne be convinced must have passed across dividing line entered land of shadow soon saw that poor ignorant black girl unsophisticated savage have unknowingly to smellie yielded up simple untutored heart willing captive to charm of genial manner gallant bearing a crisis approached be to decide question of life death with unhappy girl established beside seemed to enter upon blind dogged obstinate struggle with grim destroyer with life of unconscious patient a stake a for be wretched miserable beyond power of description knowing little of smellie save a superior officer until terrible night when found fellow captive doomed to cruel death together have since then seen so much that be noble good in have speedily learned to love with heart ay with same love david bore to jonathan there lay sick unto death be powerless to help at length leaving one day under daphne care sallied forth to seek fresh supply of fruit for wandering farther than usual afield in misery abstraction discovered fruit bearing tree quite new to fruit kind of nut somewhat similar to walnut have very strong by mean unpleasant bitter taste suddenly occurred to that possibly fruit might prove to be not altogether ineffective substitute for quinine at event be resolved to try on first if necessary gathered a many of nut a must conveniently carry on arrival at hut showed to daphne tried to find out whether knew anything about for once failed to comprehend other be obliged to carry out original intention of experimenting upon with object opened nut set kernel to steep in water in gourd basin upon setting up housekeeping soon accumulated quite number of gourd utensil observed with satisfaction that water soon began to acquire brown colour after decoction have stood for about three hour found that flavour have become quite a strong a be desirable fearing to take much at outset lest must unwittingly be swallowing poison drank about quarter of pint then with anxiety awaited result be about noon when swallowed potion two hour afterwards be more hungry than remembered to have ever be before so far good determined to wait until night then if worse result than hunger revealed try effect of new medicine upon smellie by sunset have come to conclusion that else decoction might be be not poison with must confess certain amount of fear trepidation at last prevailed upon to administer draught sitting down forthwith to watch await result by midnight most must be said of patient be that be worse encouraged on whole by negative result then administered second larger dose next morning thought detected sign of improvement by sundown improvement be no longer doubtful dry scorching feeling of skin have given place to cool healthy moisture pulse be slower fevered excited brain at length found rest patient at last even pleaded guilty to feeling of hunger jubilation now reigned supreme in palm leaf hut fatted calf in shape of parrot of gorgeous plumage be killed devoured by patient with something approaching to relish reputation a great medicine man be thenceforth fully established from time smellie began to slowly mend thanks a much probably to daphne tireless nursing assiduous care a to relentless perseverance with administered new medicine in little more than week be able with assistance to totter into open air sit for hour so under shadow of rough awning of thatch daphne have with difficulty contrived to rig up for little black friend still continued to devote wholly to smellie waiting upon hand foot watching beside night day fanning with palm leaf feeding on delicious fruit whilst lay awake under rude shelter drawing in fresh life renewed health at inspiration of delicious perfume laden air snatching brief interval of rest only whilst slept in consequence of arrangement furnishing of larder devolved wholly upon soon acquired considerable amount of skill in bringing down game principally bird by dexterous cast of club by mean of long reed tube like exaggerated pea shooter from puffed little reed dart to great distance with considerable force about fortnight after smellie have exhibited first symptom of improvement went out foraging a usual having secured necessary supply be within quarter of mile of hut on return journey when suddenly discovered negro stealing cautiously along from tree to tree before action be so suspicious that curiosity be aroused placing in ambush behind nearest tree resolved to watch be making straight for hut dodging from tree to tree lurking behind until have apparently satisfied that coast ahead be perfectly clear such excessive caution on stranger part coupled with fact that carried four broad pointed spear seemed to to indicate purpose direct reverse of friendly came to conclusion that must be well to shorten distance between trifle if possible however be not by mean easy to do until skulking savage have arrived within sight of hut when paused long enough to allow of creeping up to within dozen yard of when reason for hesitation became apparent smellie daphne be under awning outside hut mysterious friend must advance further without passing into open clearing so revealing remained thus for fully hour savage so intently watching couple under awning that have not remotest suspicion of being watched at end of time sun having set meanwhile smellie staggered to foot leaning on daphne shoulder passed into hut mysterious neighbour maintained position for five minute longer then springing from hiding place made dash for hut at full speed following when emerged from forest into open amphitheatre in centre of stood hut savage be fifty yard ahead of running like hunted deer began to fear that be bent on mischief of kind now that be too late keenly regretted indecision have allowed to remain so long unchallenged in anxiety to check speed raised shout at sound glanced over shoulder saw in hot pursuit paused for instant dashing forward next moment however more rapidly than ever shout be evidently heard by occupant of hut for daphne immediately afterwards appeared at entrance at sight of figure bounding toward uttered little cry put out hand protestingly calling out to at same time must not catch word uttered if must have done so be very improbable that must have understood struck that conveyed warning appeal be paid attention to still rushed forward brandishing spear threateningly in second two reached hut endeavoured to force entrance to however daphne offered most energetic opposition obstinately maintaining position in doorway savage then strove to force way in daphne still persisting in opposition drew back pace raising arm with savage cry drove broad bladed javelin with brutal strength down into bare bosom poor girl staggered under force of blow with stifled shriek appealing cry to halold reeled backward fell to ground inside hut meanwhile savage leaving javelin quivering in body of victim turned to meet snatching javelin with right hand from left at same instant a did so recognised former enemy fetish man witch doctor of daphne village be by time within arm length of quick a light made lunge at by happy chance succeeded in parrying stroke with blow pipe held in left hand then springing in upon dealt so tremendous blow with heavy knotted hard wood club that skull crashed under like egg shell fell brainless corpse at foot entering hut found smellie on knee beside lifeless body of daphne too late hawkesley be just too late to save poor devoted girl murmured only few second earlier must have be in time to arrest murderous blow be quite dead indeed death must have be instantaneous see blade of javelin be quite foot long be completely buried in body must have passed clean through heart poor girl be indeed faithful unto death for be life that yonder murderous wretch thirsted for doubtless recognised fetish man who strove so hard to terrify on night of sacrifice in village be convinced that in anger chagrin at escape have patiently hunted down determined to make feel vengeance in one way if failed in other poor daphne clearly read intention be sure be resistance defence of poor helpless that brought cruel death upon well god will be done poor girl be only ignorant savage be hardly possible that can ever have heard holy name mentioned for that have pity upon stranger who have helper can not believe that will therefore receive full reward only remains now to so dispose of body that will be secure from violation by bird of air beast of field how be to be done might well ask have shovel other appliance wherewith to dig grave be obviously impossible to do so with bare hand alone at length decided to burn body forthwith set about construction of funeral pyre fortunately have forest close at hand ground beneath tree be abundantly strewn with dry leaf twig branch thus have not far to go for fuel by time darkness closed in have accumulated goodly pile close to edge of open amphitheatre thither at length conveyed body laid on top of pyre finally ignited heap of dried leaf have arranged in centre done smellie came out of hut stood side by side mournfully watching crematory process naturally be very keenly distressed at untimely tragic fate have overtaken staunch little friend daphne have be so cheerful so helpful particularly during smellie illness so tender so gentle so sympathetic so tireless in ministration unconsciously to have acquired for fraternal affection a stood there watching fierce bright flame be steadily reducing body to ash recalled to mind countless service have rendered during short period of mutual wandering above fervent compassion have moved to voluntary permanent abandonment of home friend for sake of two helpless stranger of race entirely alien to own heart felt a though must burst with sorrow at cruel fate a for smellie trembling with weakness depressed in spirit a be after recent sharp attack of fever completely broke down laying head upon shoulder sobbed like child poor daphne seemed hard that must thus in first bright flush glory of maidenhood be struck down light of life extinguished by ruthless hand of murderer yet perhaps after be better so better that must enjoy bliss of laying down life for sake of man loved rather than living on must see day when vague indefinite hope aspiration of innocent unsophisticated heart must crumble into ash in moment man who unknowingly have become autocrat of fate recipient of blind passionate unreasoning love must lightly smilingly bid eternal farewell at fire died down crematory process be completed nothing remained of pyre burden smouldering heap of grey flaky ash returned sorrowfully to hut there to forget in sleep if must grievous loss have sustained painful incident of daphne death produced so distressing effect upon smellie in feeble condition that week passed away before be sufficiently recovered to admit of resuming journey by end of time however strength have in measure returned feverish anxiety to get away from scene of tragedy having taken possession of made what few preparation have in power to make got under weigh directly after breakfast on one of most delightful morning have ever be good fortune to witness progress be of course painfully slow by time speed be matter of merely secondary importance since knew that must long since have be given up by shipmate a dead that daphne be in probability hundred of mile away in unknown direction be quite possible that on reaching river mouth might have to wait week even month before must again make appearance give opportunity to rejoin day after day plodded on through glorious forest following pathway shaping course a directly west a circumstance must permit meeting with incident worthy of mention picking up sufficient subsistence without much trouble way beguiled by glorious prospect of wood river curiosity fed by countless strange glimpse into secret of nature afforded a wended way through lonely wilderness slept well at night in spite of babel of sound rose fell around awoke in morning refreshed hungry so entered upon day life be by mean one of hardship what be most important of smellie be slowly steadily regaining strength progressing toward recovery at length late in afternoon of fifth day from have witnessed resumption of journey wandering came unexpectedly to end for time at least by stumbling in most unexpected manner in world upon human habitation strangest a well a most fortunate part of be that habitation in question be abode of civilised humanity have be travelling almost uninterruptedly along ridge of range of hill on afternoon in question have reached spot where range took abrupt turn to southward curving round in sort of arm encircled basin valley of perhaps mile in width open to river on north side hill side sloped gently down to valley bottom on eastern southern western side be much more thickly wooded than country through have hitherto be passing in very thickest part of wood however about half way down slope be clearing of ten acre in extent in centre of clearing very neat pretty looking house with verandah running round thatched roof clearing appeared to be in high state of cultivation flower garden of about acre in extent lying immediately in front of house whilst remainder of ground be thickly planted with coffee peach banana orange various other fruit tree lost time in making way to very desirable haven have scarcely passed through gate in fence surrounded clearing when be fortunate enough to encounter proprietor be very fine handsome specimen of man with snow white hair moustache closely cropped otherwise clean shaven face with neck hand be deeply bronzed by exposure to vertical ray of sun be clad in white flannel head being protected by light very finely woven grass hat with enormous brim whilst foot be encased in pair of slipper of soft untanned leather be busily engaged among coffee tree when first caught sight of start of surprise at extraordinary appearance be closely followed up by profound bow a at once came forward courteously addressed in spanish unhappily smellie understood word of language so second lieutenant answered hail in french old gentleman shook head thought looked rather annoyed whereupon smellie tried in english to very much to surprise must confess responded with scarcely trace of accent welcome gentleman welcome exclaimed with outstretched hand so be english well after might have guessed be glad be not french very glad do honour to consider house everything contains a own have met with serious misfortune grieve to see if will allow manuel carnero will do best to repair have evidently suffered much appear to be in a urgent need of medical attendance a be of clothing fortunately can supply with will be only too happy to do so have very great regard for english come gentleman allow to conduct to house so saying escorted up pathway until house be reached when stepping quickly before passed through open doorway then turning round once more bade welcome to roof chapter twelve dona antonia ceremony of bidding formal welcome having be duly performed to don manuel satisfaction turned once more called in stentorian tone for invisible individual named pedro who quickly making appearance in shape of grave decorous looking elderly man servant received certain instruction in spanish after host turning to informed that valet must have honour of showing to room thereupon sedate respectful pedro who be far too well trained servant to betray slightest symptom of surprise at exceedingly disreputable appearance led way to two small pleasantly situated room adjoining other bowing profoundly to of a passed into respective apartment closed door withdrew room in question be furnished with bed washstand dressing table etcetera precisely in english fashion floor instead of being covered with carpet be bare save for large handsome grass mat occupied centre of room flung into chair be gazing complacently about congratulating upon good fortune have guided wandering foot to such exceedingly comfortable quarter when heard smellie door open next moment caught tone of don manuel voice directly afterwards knock came to own door upon shouting come in pedro reappeared bearing upon arm what proved to be complete rig out from stem to stern including even hat pair of shoe spread out upon bed then once more withdrew took garment up looked at be just about size trifle large perhaps nothing worth speaking about have evidently be worn before be in excellent condition beautifully clean altogether so inviting that lost time in exchanging for rag exchange in addition to pretty thorough ablution made quite new man of felt actually comfortable once more for first time since leaving daphne on occasion of unfortunate night attack smellie be still in room for must hear moving about so went in curious to know whether have fared equally well with found struggling with pedro assistance slowly rather painfully into somewhat similar suit to have donned poor fellow though still very thin haggard looked brighter better altogether more comfortable than have seen for long time new friend don manuel having personally dressed wound for before turning over to hand of pedro second lieutenant looked at in astonishment why hawkesley be that exclaimed upon word young gentleman look vastly comfortable vastly well too in borrowed plume why be worth dozen dead men yet think may say same of dear sir replied be heartily glad to see so great change in appearance thank very much returned yes feel actually comfortable once more don manuel have dressed bound up wound applying soothing salve to altogether tinkering up until be pretty nearly a good a new hawkesley dear boy be in sober sens be only delightful dream can scarcely realise be awake that be actually among fellow men once more that be surrounded by wall sheltered by roof of material house in a seems to be likely to enjoy good many of comfort of civilisation come a settled into loose white flannel jacket let join host who have reason to believe be awaiting presence at dinner table heave ahead pedro lad be quite ready to weigh pedro might have understood smellie word so promptly did fling open door bow to follow leading along cool rather dark corridor conducted to front part of house throwing open door of large very handsomely furnished apartment loudly announced in spanish a what took to be english hidalgos don manuel be awaiting in room on entrance rose to greet with lofty yet graceful courtesy seems peculiar to spaniard then turning slightly said allow gentleman to present to daughter antonia only member of family remaining to antonia be two english gentleman who trust will honour so far a to remain guest for time to come duly bowed in response to graceful curtsey few word of welcome spoken in most piquant charming of broken english then believe went in to dinner say believe went in to dinner on eventful evening because know be intended that must have recollection whatever of having partaken of meal for rest of evening be conscious of one thing presence of antonia carnero how will describe be of medium height with superbly moulded figure too stout too slim small well poised head crowned with immense quantity of very dark wavy chestnut hair having golden gleam where light fell upon black a night in shadow dark finely arched eyebrow surmounting pair of perfectly glorious brilliant dark brown eye now sparkling with merriment anon melting with deepest tenderness very long thick dark eyelash nose merest trifle retrousse daintily shaped mouth with full ripe ruddy lip prettily rounded chin with well developed dimple in centre voice be musical a of bird complexion be clear pale olive movement be a graceful unrestrained a of gazelle be only eighteen year of age though looked more like two twenty be very pleasant party at dinner that evening don manuel be simply perfect a host courteously watchfully attentive to slightest want frankness in voluntary explanation of why wherefore of establishment of in out of way place antonia whilst not taking very prominent part in conversation struck in now then with suggestive explanatory playful remark showing that be be attentive to interested in conversation smellie more easy comfortable in mind body than have be for many day abandoned to pleasant influence of surroundings bore part like cultured english gentleman be deep rich melodious voice easy graceful bearing commanding figure handsome face still pale wan from recent suffering evidently proving immensely attractive to dona antonia much to secret disgust a for be afraid did little more than sit silent worshipper at shrine of sylvan beauty upon whom have so unexpectedly stumbled don manuel informed that though spaniard by birth have spent so many year in england that taste sympathy have become thoroughly anglicised that second wife dona antonia mother have be englishwoman that be enthusiastic naturalist that have chosen bank of congo for home principally in order that might be able to study fully at leisure fauna flora of little known region adding parenthetically that have found step not only thoroughly agreeable also fairly profitable one by doing little occasional business with white who frequented river on one hand with native on other thought looked trifle discomposed when smellie informed that be english naval officer be quite sure did when be further informed that have be in hand of native very perceptible shade of anxiety clouded feature when smellie recounted adventure from moment of leaving daphne once twice shook head in manner seemed to suggest idea that thought might perhaps prove to be rather dangerous guest under circumstance if however such idea really entered mind be careful to restrain expression of at end of smellie narrative uttered just few courteous phrase of polite concern seemed appropriate to occasion then allowed subject to drop dona antonia on contrary evinced most lively interest in story face lighting up eye flashing a asked question after question parted lip quivering with excitement sympathetic apprehension a smellie lightly touched upon critical situation in have once twice found to great surprise may add disappointment however did not exhibit very much sympathy in poor daphne tragic fate on contrary appeared to to listen with feeling closely akin to impatience to that part of story with negro girl be connected be frequent mention of poor unfortunate creature actually elicited once twice slight quite unmistakable shrug of lovely shoulder decidedly contemptuous flash from glorious eye of fair auditor may a well at once confess frankly with usual susceptibility of callow youth promptly became captivated by charm of lovely hostess may a well complete confession by stating that with equally usual overweening conceit of callow youth quite expected to find clumsy ill timed effort to render agreeable to charmer speedily successful in expectation however be doomed to be grievously disappointed for soon discovered that whilst dona antonia be good natured enough to receive awkward attention with unvarying patience politeness be smellie footstep sound of voice caused eye to sparkle cheek to flush bosom to heave tumultuously so in extreme disgust at lady deplorable lack of taste discernment be fain to abandon effort to fascinate attaching to father instead accompanying gun in hand on frequent ramble through forest in search of specimen returning to house one evening rather late found stranger awaiting don manuel arrival be to say be stranger to smellie be evidently tolerably intimate acquaintance of host hostess be tall dark handsome well built man evidently spaniard with black restless gleaming eye well knit figure manner so very free easy a to be almost offensive attire consisted of loose jacket of fine blue cloth garnished with gold button fine linen shirt of snowy whiteness loose white nankeen trouser confined at waist by crimson silk sash pair of canvas slipper on otherwise naked foot wore pair of gold ring in small well shaped ear gold mounted horn handle of what be doubtless stiletto peeped unobtrusively from among fold of sash crimson cap of knitted silk with tassel of same depending from pointed crown lay on chair near completed costume whilst undoubtedly set off very fine figure to advantage struck a being of somewhat theatrical character don manuel greeted in spanish with effusion yet with thought faint suspicion of uneasiness on entrance then introduced to smellie in english a senor garcia madera bowed stiffly in acknowledgment murmured something to effect that speak inglese then rather rudely turned back upon addressing dona antonia in spanish evidently laid out to play agreeable to think except senor madera felt slightly uncomfortable at dinner for remainder of evening don manuel indeed strove with might to promote encourage general conversation behaviour lacked that graceful ease usually characterised manner be constrained be obviously making effort to dissipate slight suggestion of discord obstinately asserted in social atmosphere must see that be little ruffled at finding effort unsuccessful a for antonia be easy to see that new guest be to unwelcome one persevering attention distasteful to yet because be guest for other cogent reason evidently did best to be agreeable conciliatory to man casting however slight furtive deprecatory glance in smellie direction from time to time a did so senor madera who be evidently seaman not improbably master of slaver remained guest of don manuel for night sleeping under roof taking departure very early next morning before smellie have turned out in fact on making appearance don manuel referred to late visitor explaining that commanded ship traded regularly to river be one of few individual through whom maintained communication with native country apologised very gracefully for acquaintance brusque behaviour of night before whilst deprecating explained by attributing to feeling of jealousy madera having must appear exhibited decided disposition to pay serious attention to dona antonia during last two three visit don manuel suggested being like rest of countryman of exceedingly jealous disposition be possible that must feel somewhat annoyed at finding two gentleman domiciled beneath same roof a inamorata at smellie drew up rather haughtily be beginning to express profound regret that presence in house must prove mean of introducing discordant element into affair of so delicate nature when don manuel interrupted by assuring that regarded circumstance a rather fortunate than otherwise since however much might esteem senor madera a acquaintance man of business be by mean class of person to whom must be disposed to confide happiness of daughter little apology explanation having be made party separated smellie retiring to verandah with book to study spanish while don manuel trudged off with gun butterfly net a usual on return found that madera have again put in appearance evening of constraint irritation be result occurred also on third evening after for short time senor madera apparently conscious of fact that company be not altogether desirable relieved of presence just at time happened unfortunately fortunately rather a event proved that don manuel be confined to house hand having be badly stung by poisonous insect availed of opportunity to make exploration of neighbourhood have of course taken early opportunity to acquaint don manuel with expectation that daphne must again visit river at very distant period that whenever event occurred must make very strenuous effort to rejoin have promised to use mean lay in power to procure for timely notice of arrival pointing out at same time paucity of source of information suggesting that whilst must afford unmingled pleasure to retain a guest for indefinite period must be well for when be quite tired of sojourn ashore to ourselves keep look out for appearance of ship so on occasion of don manuel accident finding smellie unwilling a indeed be still unable to take long walk determined a have already said to make thorough exploration of neighbourhood at same time endeavour to ascertain whether daphne be once more in river madera appearance at don manuel house coupled with evident fact that be seaman have at once suggested to strong probability that there must be navigable creek at very great distance thought might be useful to ascertain whether such actually be be not case in event of question being decided in affirmative also to ascertain precise locality of said creek of course must have be very simple matter to put question directly to don manuel have evinced such very palpable embarrassment reticence whenever madera name have be mentioned that thought must be better to rely in first instance at event upon own personal investigation so when left house that morning be with determination to settle question before turning attention to anything else at distance of about mile from house level ridge of chain of hill be interrupted by lofty hummock rising two hundred foot higher than hill affording capital look out to spot first of all directed step on arriving at place however found growth of timber to be so thick a to completely exclude prospect only mean whereby must take advantage of superior elevation therefore be to climb tree accordingly looked about at last picked out immense fellow whose towering height seemed to promise uninterrupted view aided by tough rope like creeper depended from branch soon reached top from commanding position obtained a have expected unbroken view of country round for distance of at least thirty mile river be naturally prominent object in landscape exactly opposite be about three mile in width though in consequence of numerous island crowded channel water way be scarcely anywhere more than mile in width island ceased about four mile lower down river leaving channel perfectly clear extended up river in unbroken chain to very limit of horizon what gratified most be discovery that in clear weather such a happened to prevail just then must see right down to mouth of river shark point being just discernible on western horizon boolambemba point be clearly defined felt convinced that on fine day with good telescope must be able to see even to identify daphne must happen to be at anchor in banana creek at time important point settled turned attention to matter nearer at hand began to look about for creek existence of so strongly suspected for few minute be unable to locate suddenly eye wandering over vast sea of vegetation lay spread out beneath became arrested by appearance of slender straight object projecting few foot above tree top careful scrutiny of object satisfied that must be mast head of ship where ship be there too must be creek doubtless craft lying there so snug in so suspiciously secret harbour be one to rather insolent acquaintance madera belonged curiosity strongly prompted to have look at accordingly taking bearing by position of sun descended tree set out upon quest estimated that be distant from view point about two mile about one mile from don manuel house walk of perhaps three quarter of hour conducted to edge of mangrove swamp knew then that creek must be at great distance plunging boldly into swamp made way a best must over tangled root in what deemed proper direction after toilsome scramble of quarter of hour found at water edge creek be precisely similar in character to others with have previously made acquaintance so narrow willow at point where have hit off that saw at once to vexation that must have further scramble among mangrove root exposed while to attack of countless host of bloodthirsty mosquito if must gratify desire to see senor madera vessel having gone so far determined not to turn back until have satisfied curiosity so on went pace over such broken ground be naturally not very brisk so that be fully hour later before found standing well concealed behind intervening tree trunk opposite small beautifully modelled schooner moored head stern close alongside opposite bank be craft of about one hundred twenty ton register painted grey with very lofty spar topsail rigged forward very little standing rigging most wicked look over when put in unobtrusive appearance crew be busy with couple of long untrimmed pine spar end of be getting ashore few minute observation sufficed to satisfy that be rigging gangway settling comfortably in position where presence must not be detected determined to see matter out looked carefully for senor madera on board be unable to detect presence therefore concluded unlikely a such supposition seemed have left ship to make early call upon don manuel gangway be soon rigged after testing by passing along three four time one of schooner crew disappeared in bush quarter of hour later returned closely followed by number of armed native in charge of gang of slave who poor wretch be secured together in pair by mean of heavy log of wood lashed to neck slave be mostly men there be few young woman with two three of whom carried quite young baby lashed on back slave not excepting woman with child be loaded with one large two small tusk of ivory unfortunate be driven straight on board schooner ivory be taken from a reached deck be then driven below clink clink of hammer immediately afterwards proceeded from schooner hold bearing witness to business like promptitude with unhappy creature be being secured counted a passed in over gangway numbered sixty three judging from schooner size calculated that have accommodation for about one hundred fifty cargo being therefore incomplete feared must be called upon to endure senor madera presence for at least day two wretch who constituted schooner crew be very noisy set laughing chattering shouting at top of voice altogether exhibiting by utter carelessness perfect consciousness of fact that there be men o ' war just then anywhere near river how heartily wished there have be pennant of sort at hand felt must not have cared what might be nationality must have found mean to board craft conveying news of wretched slaver whereabouts afterwards assisting if possible in capture remained snugly ensconced in hiding place until clearing up washing down of deck informed that work be over on board schooner for day then set out cautiously to return to house managed to effect retreat into cover of bush without betraying then moved by quite uncontrollable impulse bent step once more in direction of hill top from have that morning effected reconnaissance though took considerably out of way determined to have just one more look round before settling for evening be about four o'clock pm by position of sun when once more stood beneath overshadowing foliage of tree have used a observatory ten minute later found among topmost branch atmosphere be luckily still quite clear fresh breeze from eastward having prevailed during whole of day purplish haze be gathering on western horizon heart leapt into mouth to make use of well worn figure of speech when standing out in clear relief against soft purple grey background saw far away in south western board gleaming white sail of ship stretching in toward land under easy canvas be latter fact of ship being under easy canvas so greatly gratified slaver ordinary trader must have be pressing in under stitch must draw a indeed must man o war if be upon definite errand only man o ' war must approach land in leisurely manner with evening close at hand stranger be long distance off perhaps a much a twenty mile be of course impossible to see more than that be ship of sort have by time acquired experience enough to know from tiny white speck gleamed up against haze that be coming in under topsail only what must not have given just then to have held trusty telescope in hand once more just for hour so suddenly remembered having one day seen very fine instrument belonging to don manuel in own especial den be really astronomical telescope like many similar instrument be also provided with terrestrial eye piece for have looked through across river have marvelled at far reaching power be fitted to tripod stand must be disconnected at will bold idea presented to of borrowing instrument for short time in order to ascertain if possible nationality of stranger be of course just possible that might be english in event must manifestly be smellie own duty to attempt to join full of idea descended hastily to ground made way with speed in direction of don manuel house telescope be fortunately in place where expected to find disconnecting from stand tucking into leather case set out again for look out tree arrived there slung instrument over shoulder by mean of stout leather strap attached to case at once ascended to topmost branch of tree where selecting good substantial limb for seat with conveniently situated to serve a rest for telescope comfortably settled in position determined to ascertain definitely if possible before sunset what intention of strange sail might be lost time in extricating instrument from case bringing to bear upon white speck even during short period of absence have perceptibly changed position thus proving craft to be smart vessel under canvas soon have focused found to intense disappointment owing to great distance rarefied condition of atmosphere due to intense heat of day be unable to make out very much more in shape of detail than be possible with naked eye craft a seen through telescope appearing to be merely wavering blot of creamy white with wavering blot of dark colour representing hull below dark line with spiral motion to made look like corkscrew representing above sail bare topgallant royal mast be vexatious sun be still fully hour high by time that must reach horizon craft must probably be seven eight mile nearer atmosphere be cooling becoming le rarefied minute be sanguine that before darkness set in must succeed in getting such view of stranger a must enable to form tolerably accurate opinion a to nationality intention of course kept eye glued almost uninterruptedly to eye piece of instrument merely withdrawing for minute so occasionally to give visual organ rest gradually a watched wavering motion of white dark blot decreased grew le blot like more defined in outline finally succeeded in detecting fact that craft sported broad white ribbon along side then made out that carried white figure head under heel of bowsprit next boat be painted black to water line white below so one detail after emerged into clear definition until entire craft stood distinctly revealed in field of instrument by time be quiver with excitement for a approaching ship showed with ever increasing distinctness growing conviction forced upon that many of detail be familiar to finally just a sun be hovering for moment like great ball of fire upon extreme verge of purple horizon stranger tacked smartness with be manoeuvred be alone almost sufficient to proclaim a english point be definitely settled by catching momentary glimpse of saint george ensign fluttering at peak a gleamed in last ray of setting sun in moment glided gracefully across golden track of sinking luminary spar rope clearly defined black a ebony sharply outlined sail deep rich purple against gold broad white ribbon round shapely hull just distinguishable sun vanished though western horizon immediately in wake be aglow with gold crimson light at once began to fade rapidly away looked again at ship be already mass of pearly grey with row of little dark grey dot along side indicating position of port took advantage of last gleam of twilight to count dot twice over there be fourteen of along starboard broadside indicating that be gun ship be ship rigged in conjunction with several little peculiarity have recognised connected with spar rigging convinced that be actually none other than daphne look must just distinguish against soft velvety blue black background of darkening sea saw enough to satisfy of correctness of surmise saw too that happy chance be clewing up course a though about to lay to anchor off mouth of river for night then a faded more more finally vanished from field of telescope closed instrument proceeded to carefully replace in case by time have done glow of western horizon have faded into sober grey sky overhead have deepened into magnificent sapphire blue be already becoming thickly studded with star forest around below have merged into great shapeless mass of olive black foliage out of depth of arose deafening whir of countless million of insect conclusion forced upon that be high time must see about effecting descent from lofty perch if wished to do so in safety have sooner scrambled down into body of tree than found in complete darkness be with utmost difficulty little danger accomplished remainder of descent however managed at last to reach ground without mishap taking up gun have placed against trunk of tree without acting upon don manuel advice never ventured into forest turned face homeward anxious to find smellie acquaint with state of affair without moment unnecessary delay in due time reached gate in palisading surrounded don manuel garden passed through in brilliant star light sandy path led up to house be distinctly visible between row of coffee other tree so also be two figure short distance ahead of sauntering along toward house with back turned to be evidently male female be walking very closely together so much so indeed felt almost certain that arm of taller of two figure must be encircling waist of other from height of one white gleaming garment of other at once came to conclusion that be smellie dona antonia footstep be of course quite inaudible on light sandy soil couple in front of be consequently in state of blissful ignorance a to presence have be aware of be little doubtful now a to whether must have very greatly disturbed equanimity be that a may felt certain amount of delicacy about advancing so showing have be involuntary witness of philandering so softly stepped aside off pathway ensconsed behind coffee bush thinking that perhaps must go on enter house in case must follow in at respectful distance if on other hand did not enter must at event be at such distance from when turned that might safely show without much fear of disconcerting of so thinking continued to watch receding figure intending to step back into pathway a soon a be at sufficient distance from before have traversed distance between gate house be startled at seeing group of figure suddenly noiselessly emerge upon pathway close behind chapter thirteen eventful night what did mean who be what must possibly want must see clearly enough to distinguish that wore garment of civilisation did not belong to house don manuel have only two men in service whereas so far a must distinguish in uncertain light there be five men in group before then too action be suspicious movement be stealthy looked very much a though be dogging footstep of couple ahead of for good purpose did not at like aspect of affair so quietly disencumbering of telescope deposited on ground grasped gun stepping into pathway shouted warningly to second lieutenant look out mr smellie be being followed immediately there be shout in spanish of come on men give group made dash at smellie companion then followed exclamation of surprise anger in smellie well known voice single stifled scream from dona antonia most unmistakable affray with shout dashed up path in minute le plunged into thick of melee smellie be beset by three of ruffian who be slashing viciously at with long ugly looking knife be maintaining gallant defence with aid of stout stick assistance of have not up to then be wholly able to discard in walking saw that if be to be saved from serious perhaps even fatal stab prompt action be necessary so without waiting for further development cocked gun making lunge with at man who seemed to be smellie most formidable antagonist pulled trigger just a muzzle struck side poured content of barrel into body at such very close quarter charge of shot took effect like bullet fellow staggered backwards fell to ground with oath agonised exclamation in spanish of help men help be remaining two who have be attacking smellie turned at to assist wounded companion second lieutenant thereupon dashed down path after other two who be hurrying off scene with speed carrying dona antonia bodily away with dozen bound so be up with with inarticulate cry of rage smellie sprang upon man nearest brought stick down upon fellow head with such tremendous force that stout cudgel shivered to piece in hand whilst recipient of blow dropped prone without groan cry of kind upon pathway other meanwhile have dropped share of joint burden seemed inclined to resume hostility well aimed sweep of butt end of gun took fight out of beat hasty retreat leaving companion to tender mercy smellie however have something else to think about for there upon pathway white dress already stained with blood of prostrate ruffian beside lay senseless body of dona antonia raising in arm companion at once made for house despatching pedro who have just put in alarmed appearance in advance to summon assistance of old madre dolores antonia special attendant convoyed pair a far a door then retraced step down pathway intent on recovering telescope also to reconnoitre scene of action ascertain whether enemy have beaten final retreat ground proved to be clear so presume that fellow whose head smellie have broken be not after quite so seriously injured a at first appeared to be on return to house found whole place in confusion a might naturally be expected don manuel with damaged hand in sling anxiously inquiring of smellie whether have idea a to identity of perpetrator of outrage certainly have idea who be leader answered smellie scarcely like to give utterance to suspicion here come hawkesley let see whether opinion upon matter coincides with mine hawkesley do think ever met of men before yes replied unhesitatingly unless be greatly mistaken man who be so pertinacious in attack upon whom shot be senor madera exactly so coincided smellie recognised directly be so very dark down there among tree scarcely cared to say a much without first having conviction verified very much fear don manuel have be grossly deceived by fellow if be not greatly mistaken be thorough rascal say because of cowardly attack upon can quite account for after explanation of night two ago daring outrage upon daughter be quite matter yes yes exclaimed don manuel excitedly fellow be villain there be doubt about have never entertained very high opinion of be true must admit be quite unprepared for such high handed behaviour a of to night well said smellie cheerfully think hawkesley have given ardour cooling for time to come at event for rest will have to be very carefully on guard for future dear sir think will venture second attempt so long a remain under roof after be gone hope will not be for time to come hospitably interrupted don manuel have fear for dear don harold forewarned be forearmed ' a say in england will take care to render further attack upon daughter liberty impossible come dinner awaits can further discus matter if need be over what be that call ah yes social board thereupon filed into dining room took place at table there before conversation have opportunity to drift back into former channel detailed day doings apprised smellie of important fact that daphne be in offing be momentous news indeed remarked smellie when have finished must leave to night fear don manuel reluctant a must be to cut short so very agreeable acquaintance trust will have many opportunity of visiting again so keeping alive friendship established between a to senor madera if hawkesley be only correct in conjecture a to schooner saw why trust may be able to effectually permanently relieve of disagreeable attention before twenty four hour have passed over head don manuel bowed if senor madera be indeed captain of slave ship a have sometimes felt inclined to believe be said beg that will not permit accident of having encountered under roof to influence in way in favour a have already said be only acquaintance not friend of mine if be transgressor against law relating to slave trade make suffer for if can lay hand upon with regard to proposed attempt to rejoin ship to night very much regret that be only able to offer most meagre assistance such a be however be heartily welcome to have canoe down in creek yonder be very welcome to take be only small affair a presume be not very much accustomed to handling of canoe will have to be exceedingly careful may meet with upset that let tell may possibly prove very serious affair since creek ay river swarm with crocodile smellie duly expressed thankful acceptance of don manuel kind offer conversation then became general at conclusion of meal smellie requested favour of few minute private conversation with don manuel that gentleman with somewhat questioning surprised look bowed affirmative at once led way to own especial sanctum never actually heard what be nature of momentous communication gallant second lieutenant wished so suddenly to make to host from length of time that remained closeted together remark of don manuel when at length reappeared very well dear sir then be settled upon condition have named can have made pretty shrewd guess at in meantime dona antonia have reappeared very little worse for adventure be very pale be true became perceptibly paler when with want of tact be one of most marked characteristic abruptly told that be on point of leaving to rejoin ship amply redeemed want of colour by deep rosy flush with greeted smellie approach low whispered request in response to placed hand on arm retired with to verandah be about pm when reappeared smellie looking very grave at same time rather exultant poor antonia in tear made attempt to conceal be of course ready to start at moment notice have preparation to make in fact at once proceeded to disagreeable task of saying farewell to kind generous host be painful business for though have not known don manuel daughter very long have still known quite long enough to have acquired for very large measure of esteem regard in smellie case there must no longer be least doubt that feeling toward hostess be even warmer than so hurried over leave taking with speed then set off down pathway under pedro guidance on road to creek be by time pitch dark star have disappeared sky have become obscured by heavy pall of thunder cloud away to eastward lightning be already beginning to flash thunder to growl ominously before reached gate in palisading pedro have volunteered prognostication of stormy night utterly unfit for such expedition a upon be bound have strongly urged more than once to follow counsel postpone attempt to proposition must not of course listen for moment if missed present opportunity to rejoin daphne be impossible to conjecture when might offer pleasant though sojourn under don manuel hospitable roof have undoubtedly be be not business day so spent be day distinctly lost in pursuit of professional interest so plodded steadily on in about hour time reached head of creek where carefully housed under low thatch covering found canoe be indeed frail craft in to undertake such journey a ours being only two foot six inch beam by about sixteen inch deep twenty foot long hollowed out of single log have thwart paddler be therefore compelled to squat tailor fashion in bottom of looking forward be so far fortunate since be so frightfully crank that with such unaccustomed canoeist a ourselves be only by keeping centre of gravity low down that prevented capsizing moment stepped into pedro worthy soul detained about twenty minute whilst explained peculiarity of craft proper mode of handling paddle then with smellie aft forward bade old fellow good bye boldly shoved off down creek channel here being narrow overarched to great extent with tree darkness be quite a intense a have be on journey from house through wood down to creek so dark be indeed that for lightning now flashed around with rapidly increasing frequency must have be quite impossible for to see where be going stygian darkness whilst proved obstacle to rapid progress promised to afford by way of compensation most valuable assistance in way since hoped to slip past schooner undetected in impenetrable obscurity desire just then being to avoid anything like renewal of acquaintance with senor madera so soon after very recent little misunderstanding unfortunately there be two three phenomenon combined to render feat matter of difficulty first be vivid lightning at increasingly brief interval lit up channel with noontide distinctness next be failure of wind stark breathless calm having fallen upon face of nature like pall in not so much a single leaf stirred whole insect world contrary to usual custom awaiting in hushed expectancy outburst of coming storm great death like silence prevailed through slightest sound might accidentally make must have be heard for long distance perhaps worst of be highly phosphorescent state of water be so excessive that slightest ripple under bow of canoe along side for distance in wake together with faint swirl created by paddle produced long trailing line eddy of vivid silvery light must scarcely fail to attract attention of vigilant look out so betray whereabouts be thus compelled to observe utmost circumspection in advance be made a far a be practicable through deepest shadow of overhanging foliage be creeping slowly down channel in cautious fashion when slight almost imperceptible splash from opposite bank attracted attention glancing across in direction noticed slowly spreading circle of luminous ripple beneath curious patch of pale phosphorescent light rapidly advancing toward in few second be almost directly underneath canoe keeping pace with to consternation then saw that be crocodile about same length over a canoe phosphorescence of water causing scaly carcass to gleam like watery moon distinctly revealing movement must even see upturned eye maintaining vigilant watch upon do see that sir whispered do indeed murmured smellie only hope brute be completely ignorant of ability to capsize with single whisk of tail if must choose to do so phew what flash what flash indeed seemed a though entire vault of heaven have exploded into living flame whole atmosphere be for moment irradiated surroundings leapt out of darkness stood for single instant vividly revealed there too away ahead of at distance of perhaps mile appeared schooner hull spar rigging showing black a ebony against brilliantly illuminated background of foliage cloud simultaneously with lightning flash there came terrific peal of thunder crackled crashed roared rumbled about with awful percussion of sound be absolutely deafened for minute two when recovered hearing wild creature of forest be still giving vent to terror in chorus of roar howl scream of dismay crocodile evidently not caring to be out in such weather have happily vanished have scarcely gathered wit once more about when flood gate of heaven be opened down came rain have heard great deal at one time about violence of tropical rainstorm exceeded far beyond bound utmost have thereby be led to anticipate came not in drop sheet even metaphorical bucket full in absolute deluge of such volume that not only be drenched to skin in single instant almost before be aware of water have risen in bottom of canoe to depth of at least four inch be actually compelled to lean forward in stooping posture to catch breath for fully five minute overwhelming deluge continued to descend upon then relaxed somewhat settled down into steady downpour be that object caught sight of distance ahead just now schooner asked smellie a soon a rushing sound of rain have so far abated a to permit of hearing other voice be sir replied then now be time for to make dash past will scarcely be keeping very bright look out in such rain a remarked accordingly hauled out into centre of stream plied paddle a rapidly a possible have be working hard for perhaps five minute when smellie said in low cautious tone of voice hawkesley sir do know fancy have seized upon to have look in on deck of schooner if be duly cautious really believe might be managed without very much risk somehow think will be keeping particularly bright look out on board just now look out may even be stowed away comfortably in galley out of rain have nerve enough for adventure certainly have sir replied bold idea flashing at instant through brain then keep sharp look out for when see work paddle so a to drop canoe alongside under main chain stand by to catch turn with painter ay ay sir replied once more relapsed into silence renewed paddling five minute later shapeless object loomed up close aboard of on port bow sheering canoe sharply to larboard dropped handsomely without sound alongside schooner just in wake of main chain rapidly took turn with painter round foremost channel iron in moment stood alongside superior officer in schooner main chain placing head close to dead eye of rigging so a to expose a little a possible waited patiently for flash of lightning smellie looking aft looking forward by hastily whispered agreement presently flash came did catch sight of look out whispered smellie to sir whispered back did noticed that skylight companion be closed slide drawn over probably to exclude rain fancy most of people must have turned in very probably acquiesced there be not much to tempt to remain out of bunk on night a true remarked smellie still in most cautious of whisper feel more than half inclined to climb inboard make tour of deck right sir agreed let slip off shoe get on board at once take starboard side of deck will take port side can meet again on forecastle agreed be reply slipping off shoe forthwith waited for flash of lightning then in succeeding darkness scrambled noiselessly in on deck proceeded on tour of investigation on reaching schooner deck separated made first business to carefully examine skylight companion in profound darkness be quite impossible to see anything by careful manipulation soon ascertained that former be shut down that door of latter be closed slide drawn over within about six inch a smellie have said must have be frightfully hot down in cabin officer apparently preferred that to having deluge of rain beating down below cabin be dimly lighted by swinging lamp turned down very low must see one be there sound of movement down there at be considerably surprised because if schooner really belonged to senor madera a have supposed one must have expected to find one two person at least on alert in attendance upon wounded man having learned that be possible to learn in quarter next proceeded aft a far a taffrail where found deck encumbered on side by two big coil of mooring other end of be secured a have noticed earlier in day to couple of tree trunk on shore next proceeded leisurely forward noting on way fact that schooner mounted battery of four brass nine pounder on starboard side of course port battery must be same main hatchway be securely covered in with grating up through arose unmistakable odour betrays presence of slave in ship hold be quiet however below poor wretch down there having probably obtained in sleep temporary forgetfulness of miserable condition on reaching galley found that door on port side be closed on applying ear to chink fancied must detect through steady swish of rain sound of regular breathing a of slumbering man forward of galley be foremast on clearing faint gleam of light indicated position of fore scuttle whilst be still glancing round in endeavour to discover presence of possible anchor watch light be suddenly obscured by interposition of second lieutenant body a cautiously peered down into forecastle advanced to side laid hand upon arm at same time mentioning name to apprise of presence well whispered first drawing away from open scuttle what have discovered told adding that thought anchor watch must have taken refuge in galley from rain there have fallen asleep yes whispered smellie be safe enough there sound asleep for accidentally touched without disturbing slumber thought time have now arrived for propounding of brilliant idea what be to prevent seizing schooner sir asked nothing be reply have be thinking of thing be already virtually in possession very little labour patience must make actually so think be men enough to get under canvas to handle afterwards for be only very small craft great indeed only danger connected with affair consists in possibility of firing pistol into powder magazine when discover that be prisoner so sending ship hand sky high together might possibly do thing assented be willing to take risk sir if be well done hawkesley be made of right stuff for sailor be smellie encouraging remark then will do continued first thing be to close fasten fore scuttle have already ascertained be secured with hasp staple belaying pin will secure effectually so be first thing need loose belaying pin be soon found provided with then returned to fore scuttle noiselessly placed cover in position thrust pin through staple thus effectually imprisoning crew now belaying pin rope end fathom so off end of topgallant halliard will do to secure vigilant look out in galley armed with necessary gear next crept toward galley question be how to secure man effectually in intense darkness confined space at same time prevent raising alarm only thing be to lure out on deck accordingly whilst smellie awaited at door went in grasping by shoulder shook roughly retiring again promptly a soon a found that have aroused fellow rose to foot hurriedly evidently under impression that one of officer have caught napping scarcely half awake stumbled out on deck muttering in spanish few incoherent word doubt intended for explanation of presence in galley a emerged from door promptly fear rather roughly forced belaying pin between teeth secured there with aid of pocket handkerchief smellie at same moment pinioning from other side so effectually that be rendered quite incapable of resistance very short time sufficed to secure beyond possibility of escape then next thing demanding attention be skylight companion have already thought of mean by might be made perfectly secure now offered idea to smellie for might be worth suggestion met with most unqualified approval forthwith set about carrying out there be abundance of firewood in galley selecting suitable piece lost time in hacking out dozen wedge armed with went aft noiselessly closing companion slide to full extent firmly wedged there short piece of planking wedged tightly in between binnacle companion door made latter perfectly secure when have further heaped upon skylight lid a many heavy article a must find about deck conveniently handle between crew be effectually imprisoned below fore aft work of seizing schooner be complete be not moment too soon thunderstorm have while be raging with little if diminution of fury rain continuing to pour down upon in steady torrent hitherto there have be no wind have barely completed task of making matter secure fore aft however when lightning rain ceased in instant now look out for wind sir said to smellie when rain come before wind stand by well topsail mind let breeze come a soon a like be cheerful reply will want breeze to help out of creek presently may a well get canvas on whilst calm last if possible so run knife along lashing of mainsail whilst overhaul sheet cast adrift halliard so said so done in minute sail be loose then tailed on to halliard after long weary drag managed to get sail set after fashion have hardly begun task before squall burst upon well be for then that schooner happened to be moored in so completely sheltered position wind careered roaring howling past overhead swaying bending stoutest forest giant a though be pliant reed down in narrow channel under lee of tree felt more than mere scuffle however be sufficient to make mainsail flap heavily effectually roused hand below first intimation received of state of thing be loud battering against inside of companion door accompanied by muffled ejaculation of anger to however paid not slightest heed knew that prisoner be safe for time at least so a soon a have set mainsail to satisfaction skimmed out on jib boom cast loose jib then slipped inboard again helped smellie to hoist done by smellie order went aft to wheel whilst armed with cook axe cut hawser fore aft by schooner be secured to bank wind be very baffling just where be moreover happened unfortunately to be on lee side of canal for couple of minute after cutting adrift be in imminent danger of taking ground after trouble between however succeeded in so far flattening in main sheet a to cant bow to windward though schooner keel actually stirred up mud for distance of quite fifty yard at last have gratification of seeing draw off bank moment that be fairly under weigh drew smellie attention to violent pounding at companion door suggested a precautionary measure that must run one of gun up against door in case of attempt to batter down accordingly did wheel being lashed for short period necessary to enable to accomplish task very fortunately for wind have by time broken up dense black canopy of cloud overhead permitting star two to peep through rent here there moon too just past second quarter have risen so that now have fair amount of light to aid navigation of narrow creek be however so difficult that look out be absolutely necessary smellie accordingly went forward stationed on stem head to con ship chapter fourteen rejoin daphne people in cabin finding that good result followed violent pounding upon inside of companion door soon abandoned so unprofitable amusement be just beginning to hope that have philosophically made up mind to submit with good grace to inevitable when crash came bullet through teak door past head in most uncomfortable proximity to starboard ear smellie looked round at sound damage done hawkesley hailed none so far thank replied a spoke there be report bullet went whizzing past well to port time for change minute two passed then came regular fusillade from quite dozen pistol discharged simultaneously must say one of bullet knocking off worsted cap wore grazing skin of right temple sufficiently to send thin stream of blood trickling down into corner of right eye seem to be in warm corner there hailed smellie if can hold on until round point will come relieve thanks must very much rather must continue to con ship replied minute two later rounded point referred to creek widening out considerably began to feel true breeze when schooner even under short ill set canvas have be able to give at once increased speed to about six knot at same time however began to gripe most villainously with helm hard weather be a much a must possibly do to keep from running ashore among bush on starboard hand people in cabin be still pertinaciously blazing away through companion door at doing remarkably good shooting too taking into consideration fact that must only guess at whereabouts be just then far too busy to pay much attention to at length fearing that when got little lower down felt full strength of breeze schooner must in spite of effort fairly run away with hailed smellie briefly explaining situation to asked to give fore staysail else come aft trice up tack of mainsail chose latter alternative a leaving craft under canvas easily manageable by one hand came aft to effect alteration hurriedly explaining that must relieve a soon a possible that there be still difficult navigation ahead wanted to see schooner safely through triced tack of sail close up to throat of gaff be about to hurry forward again when schooner sheering round bend into new reach attention be suddenly attracted by something ahead on lee bow at distance of perhaps mile what be away there on lee bow sir exclaimed be not craft of sort smellie jumped up on rail to get better view at same moment pistol shot rang out from skylight bullet evidently flying close past took not slightest notice of shot stood there on rail with hand shading eye intently examining object be rapidly nearing be brig said unless be very greatly mistaken ca be yet must be too surely be vestale look remarkably like ca make out confound fellow wish must stop firing ca make out white ribbon round side said can yet be scarcely possible can be mistaken luff may little shave too close have pennant flying by way whoever may be ah rascal have pinked after a rattling volley be discharged at through glazed top of skylight saw clap hand to side be by time close to strange brig on board light be burning in cabin whilst several person be visible on deck a swept down toward hugging pretty closely man sprang into main rigging hailed in spanish josefa ahoy what be matter on board why be going to sea without full cargo have matter gone wrong at head of creek replied smellie in same language by way have be diligently studying with antonia assistance during sojourn under don manuel roof everything be all right cargo unfortunately be here interrupted by volley from cabin at same time voice yelled from schooner stern window be captured prize to accursed ingleses word be hardly out of speaker mouth when three four musket be popped at from brig fortunately without effect be however by time past crew who seemed thoroughly mystified at whole affair made further effort to molest of one thing however be amply assured be not vestale craft have just passed whilst double of french gun brig in other respect be painted black down to copper carried under heel of bowsprit life size figure of negress with scarf striped in various colour round waist negress ah there must not be doubt of mr smellie said do know craft n n ca say do hawkesley under present disguise disguise dear sir be not disguised at be pirate brig destroyed poor richards vessel juliet yes there can scarcely be doubt about must be notorious black venus of yankee skipper told smellie looked at in great surprise perplexity for moment upon word hawkesley verily believe be right exclaimed at last black venus negress for figure head have be hurt not much think stammered a braced resolutely against wheel determined must not give in fact be that whilst be talking shot have be fired through companion door have struck fairly in right shoulder inflicting such severe pain for moment felt quite incapable of using right arm fortunately schooner now steered pretty easily must manage wheel with one hand must stop somehow said smellie again jumping on rail taking long look ahead do see very tall tree shooting up above rest almost directly ahead continued pointing out object a turned to replied that did well steer straight for then will fetch aft hatch cover there be several forward place against door think can perhaps contrive to rig up bullet proof screen for be hurt sir protested mere graze after believe replied lightly forthwith set about work of dragging aft hatch cover six of soon piled in front of companion there said a placed last one in position think be reasonably safe now be pity did not think of before will bind up shoulder for be bleeding see thank replied be only trifling scratch think not worth troubling about now must much rather must go forward look out must never do to plump schooner ashore now that have come so far besides there be men down forward ought to be watched perhaps may succeed in breaking out after smellie looked at rather doubtfully for almost full minute believe be suffering great deal of pain hawkesley said be thoroughly plucky fellow if can only keep up until get clear of confounded creek will then relieve will take care too to let captain vernon know how admirably have conducted not only to night from moment that left daphne together now be going forward to see that be right there if want help give timely hail turned walked forward navigation of creek still continued to be exceedingly intricate difficult creek being winding deep water channel very much more winding still running now on one side of creek now on other besides being studded here there with shoal sand bank tiny islet whilst made navigation very difficult for stranger added greatly to value of creek a safe snug resort for slaver multitudinous twist in channel serving to mask most artfully giving appearance of terminating at point beyond in reality long stretch of deep water extended at length luffed sharply round low sandy spit thickly covered with mangrove kept broad away again directly afterwards abruptly found in main stream of congo here true channel be easily discernible by long regular run of sea have be lashed up by gale have therefore nothing to do keep schooner where sea ran most regularly must be certain to be right smellie now gave little much needed attention to party in forecastle who have latterly be very noisy clamourous in demonstration of disapproval luckily did not appear to posse fire arm only fear from therefore be that must find mean to break out second lieutenant provided against pretty effectually by placing large wash deck tub on cover coiling down therein end of one of mooring hawser stood on deck near windlass having done came aft to relieve at wheel relief for be by mean sorry party in cabin have shortly before given up amusement of popping at through closed door of companion having doubtless heard smellie dragging along hatch cover placing in position having also formed very shrewd guess that further mischief on part be thus effectually frustrated unfortunately however have made discovery that head must be seen over companion from fore end of skylight have thereupon begun to pop at from new position have grazed twice when smellie came aft have scarcely opened lip to speak to when shot came whizzing past close enough to to prove that fellow still have in power to undo work by single lucky hit why hawkesley exclaimed will never do must put stop to somehow can not afford to be hard hit of for hour half at least what be to be done how doe shoulder feel can use right arm be afraid can not replied shoulder be dreadfully painful arm seems to have strength in can steer easily with one hand now how many people do think there be in cabin be smellie next question can scarcely say replied have only be able to distinguish three voice so far three eh skipper two mate suppose ruminated little stepped forward presently returned with rather formidable looking iron bar have evidently noticed time before coolly remarked a began to drag away hatch cover from before companion be going down below to give fellow quietus if there be knowing what mischief may yet perpetrate before get what be fellow called ah josefa before get josefa under daphne gun now choose star to steer by before remove more of lumber then sit down on deck a much on one side a can get will try to draw fire then rush down upon with that removed jacket threw loosely over iron bar laid aside for moment whilst cleared away obstruction from before door then taking up coat holding well in front of opening so a to produce in uncertain light appearance of figure standing there suddenly flung back slide threw open door immediate result be couple of pistol shot rush up companion ladder latter of smellie promptly stopped by swinging somewhat bulky carcass into opening letting drop plump down upon individual who be making there be scuffle at bottom of ladder pistol shot two three dull crushing blow brief scuffle then smellie reappeared with blood flowing freely from left arm truculent looking spaniard in tow fellow dragged on deck unceremoniously kicking foot from under lashed securely with end of topgallant brace done once more dived below in due time two more spaniard senseless bleeding be brought up out of cabin secured there said wiping perspiration from forehead think will now manage to make rest of trip unmolested without having constantly before eye fear of being blown clear across congo let take wheel be sure must be sadly in need of spell before do anything else will get to clap bandage of sort round arm here be bleeding so profusely that think bullet must have severed artery here be handkerchief clap round arm haul a taut a can great thing just now be to stop bleeding doctor burnett will do be necessary for when reach sloop bound up arm after fashion making good enough job of to stop bleeding then went forward to keep look out be foaming down river at tremendous pace gale being almost dead fair for having additional impetus of red hot tide under foot swept down past land a though have be steamer sooth to say however scarcely felt in cue just then either to admire josefa pace to take much note of wonderful picture presented by river with brown mud tinted water lashed into fury by breath of tropical tempest chequered here there with shadow of scurrying cloud lighted up by phosphorescence tipped wave with crest of scintillating silvery star wound in shoulder be moment becoming more excruciatingly painful more exacting in demand upon attention interest seemed to centre upon daphne surgeon be with feeling of ineffable relief that on jibing round shark point about hour half after clearing creek saw at distance of about seven mile away indistinct object off padron point knew must be daphne at anchor do see sloop sir hailed returned smellie from post at wheel stooping peering straight into darkness can not make out from here do see yes sir replied joyously there be broad on port bow luff sir may luff heard smellie return schooner bow swept round until pointed fair for distant object steady sir steady be replied smellie voice sounding weird mournful above roar of wind wash of sea managed to trim over jib sheet without assistance then leaned over bulwark watching gradual way in small dark blot on horizon swelled developed into stately ship with lofty mast long yard delicate maze of rigging a neat trig a though have just emerged from dockyard sea being quite smooth after have once rounded shark point made run down to sloop in about hour passing to windward of then jibing over rounding to on lee quarter with jib sheet to windward a approached sloop noticed that light be still burning in skipper cabin thought must detect human face two peering curiously out at from port dear old hooker be of course riding head to wind a swept down across bow within easy hailing distance figure suddenly appeared standing on knight head armitage voice rang out across water with hail of schooner ahoy hillo responded slight barely perceptible pause then what schooner be that josefa slave schooner be that mr armitage ay ay be who may be pray have by time gone aft be standing by smellie side schooner be just jibing over darting along on daphne starboard side armitage evidently have not recognised voice a yet remarked smellie else added have given up on board a dead be unable so suddenly to realise fact of being still alive then a finally rounded to under daphne quarter armitage reappeared aft confab be renewed smellie time taking lead daphne ahoy hailed have captain vernon yet retired for night think not be reply what do want kindly pas word to that mr smellie mr hawkesley be alongside in captured slaver say will feel greatly obliged if will send prize crew on board to take possession ay ay will armitage thereupon disappeared being at time to leeward of sloop slight distinct commotion became perceptible on board presently figure appeared in fore rigging deep gruff hoarse voice hailed schooner ahoy did say a mr smellie mr hawkesley be on board yes did do not recognise voice collins ay ay sir in course doe now be boatswain hearty response then there followed in lower tone certain remark of must only catch such fragment a lieutenant hisself by reefer too man rigging sea dog give sailor welcome then in instant lower rigging became black with figure of men with collins a fugleman greeted unexpected return with three a hearty cheer a ever pealed from throat of british seaman for life of must not just then have spoken word have be ever so necessary that hearty ringing british cheer gave first convincing assurance be once more safe among friend at same time enabled to fully realise a never have before extreme peril to have be exposed since last saw craft lay there rolling gracefully upon ground swell within biscuit toss of men be just clearing rigging when small slight figure appeared on sloop quarter captain vernon voice hailed through speaking trumpet schooner ahoy how many hand will send dozen men will be sufficient sir replied smellie will feel obliged if will send with necessary officer to relieve be hurt in need of doctor service will have men at once be reply will send burnett to can come on board sloop will rejoin sloop sir thank injury be not very serious replied smellie very well be so returned skipper there conversation ended next moment clear tee tee tweetle tweetle weetle wee e e of boatswain whistle came floating down to followed by gruff cutter away presently saw boat glide down ship side after very brief delay shove off come sweeping down toward five minute later prize crew under williams master mate with young peter fellow mid of mine a second in command stood upon schooner deck mr austin who have accompanied be wringing hand a though must wring off smellie saw exquisite agony warm hearted first luff be unconsciously inflicting upon by effusive greeting thoughtfully interposed with gently edgar old fellow be afraid be handling poor little roughly have received rather bad hurt in right shoulder to night in fight with schooner people fight schooner people beg pardon hawkesley hope have hurt why never mean to say have have to fight for schooner austin interrupted aghast well took by surprise people proved very troublesome very pertinacious in effort to get back again smellie replied come let get on board old daphne once more long to set foot on plank again like hawkesley here will not be sorry to renew acquaintance with burnett so said so done made way into boat leaving prize crew to secure prisoner few minute later stood once more safe if not altogether sound on deck of dear old daphne chapter fifteen stern chase fruitless one back to daphne gentleman exclaimed captain vernon a met at gangway extended hand first to smellie then to be indeed pleasant surprise for hand will venture to say though armitage loses step at least pro tem in consequence of reappearance mr smellie be good hearted fellow when entered cabin to report alongside though seemed trifle incredulous a to personality be a delighted a schoolboy at prospect of holiday smellie took skipper extended hand after replying suitably to greeting said must beg will excuse hawkesley sir if give left instead of right hand starboard shoulder have be disabled to night by pistol bullet whilst supporting most intrepidly in task of bringing out schooner skipper seized left hand with right pressing earnestly yet gently said be proud pleased to hear so gratifying account of hawkesley mr armitage have already borne witness to gallantry during night attack upon slaver be with deep sincere sorrow received news of being with mr smellie missing fear gentleman friend at home will suffer great deal of happily unnecessary sorrow at news felt duty to send home that can be repaired by personally despatching to agreeable intelligence of being still in land of living what of hurt be too serious to be attended to in cabin be not be glad to hear that then follow of please for long to hear where have be what doing time how happened to turn up so opportunely here to night will send for burnett to bring tool into cabin can satisfy curiosity whilst be doing needful for will join austin will be bound ear be tingling to hear what have befallen wandering knight thereupon filed down below in skipper wake for one being most heartily thankful to find where must once more sit down rest aching skipper steward brought out wine glass then at burnett request that individual having promptly turned up went away to get ready warm water think said genial medico turning to look in most urgent need of service so will begin with young gentleman if please now whereabouts be hurt told straightway began to cut away sleeve of coat shirt preparatory to more serious operation whilst smellie drawing chair up to table helped to glass of wine then said before begin story sir will permit to ask what be ultimate result of most disastrous expedition against slaver be naturally anxious to know of course seeing that upon shoulder rest odium of failure captain vernon stared hard at second lieutenant for minute then said dear smellie what in world be talking about disaster odium why man expedition be success not failure admit that there be most unfortunately very serious loss of life among unhappy slave took brigantine afterwards raised schooner with loss to ourselves of only four killed now that two have turned up be most dashing affair admirably conducted when take into consideration elaborate preparation have be evidently made for reception ultimate result about inquire so anxiously will hope be nice little bit of prize money to hand richly deserved promotion to yourself armitage young williams be now smellie turn to look surprised astonish sir said last remember of affair be that after most stubborn protracted fight in schooner be sunk succeeded in gaining possession of brig only to be blown out of few minute later however own impression hawkesley too for matter a afterwards discovered on comparing note with be that loss must have amounted to at least half of men composing expedition well said captain vernon be happy to tell that be mistaken total loss over affair amount to four men killed severity of fight be amply testified to by fact that not one man out of whole number escaped without wound of kind more le serious have recovered however be happy to say have not at present sick man in ship there can be doubt that slaver somehow received timely notice of presence in river through instrumentality of fair speaking friend skipper of pensacola strongly suspect that made best possible use of time at disposal have be a wise then a be now arrangement must have be very different however be easy to be wise after event be thankful that matter turned out so well now think be fairly entitled to hear story thereupon smellie launched out into detailed recital of have befallen from moment of explosion on board brig up to unexpected arrival same night alongside daphne be interrupted by countless exclamation of astonishment sympathy when have finished there seemed to be end to question one be anxious to put to in midst of however burnett broke in with announcement that having finished with be ready to attend to second lieutenant worthy medico attention to have be a may be gathered from fact that outlasted smellie story of somewhat protracted duration that be of exceedingly painful character can abundantly testify ball having broken shoulder blade then buried among muscle of shoulder whence burnett insisted on extracting in spite of protestation be quite willing to postpone operation to more convenient season after much groping probing about however utterly regardless of excruciating agony thus inflicted upon conscientious burnett have at last succeeded in extracting ball kindly presented to a memento then rest of work be comparatively speaking plain sailing wound be washed dressed made comfortable be dismissed with strict injunction to turn in at once to skipper moved a amendment be permitted to drink single glass of wine before retiring whilst be sipping turned upon with question with result soon forgot about hammock at length captain vernon said by by hawkesley what sort of young lady be dona antonia whom mr smellie have mentioned once twice be simply most lovely creature have ever seen sir replied enthusiastically promised wife jerked in smellie in tone warned hand that there must be jocularity in connection with mention of dona name ho ho ejaculated skipper with whistle of surprise be how wind blow be upon word smellie heartily congratulate upon conquest quite romantic affair really pray mr hawkesley what success have met with in cupid warfare none sir replied with laugh only other lady in don manuel household be old dolores dona antonia attendant be positively afraid to try effect of fascination upon lest must prove only too successful laughed skipper by way smellie do think don manuel be quite plain above board with suppose doe nothing in slave trading business eh think not sir though undoubtedly posse acquaintance of certain senor madera most suspicious looking character whose name have already mentioned to by way hawkesley be evidently mistaken a to josefa belonging to madera be nowhere to be found on board what be mr armitage said skipper just then a third lieutenant made appearance at door vessel apparently brig sir have just come into view under northern shore evidently having just left river be hugging land very closely keeping well under shadow in fact have appearance of being anxious to avoid attracting attention skipper glanced interrogatively at smellie who at once responded to look by saying black venus without doubt expect that running away with josefa have given alarm have determined to slip out whilst option remains to take chance of being able to give slip will not do that if can help remarked skipper energetically rising to foot gave order for hand to be called forthwith broke up party in cabin much to gratification of burnett who now insisted that smellie must retire to hammock forthwith on account presume to leave again until have permission be not very long in undressing having secured service of marine to assist in operation before have gained hammock be rejoined by keene brother mid whose watch be below who brought down news that sloop be under weigh fairly after stranger who a soon a canvas dropped from yard have squared away on westerly course with wind on quarter whole cloud of studding sail set to windward what with excitement of finding once more among so many friend pain of wound be time before succeeded in getting to sleep night before did so daphne be rolling like empty hogshead showing how rapidly have run off land into sea knocked up by gale when awoke next morning wind have dropped to considerable extent sea have gone down ship be great deal steadier under canvas be most anxious to leave hammock go on deck burnett must not for moment consent to wound be very much inflamed exceedingly painful result doubtless of probing for bullet on night before instead of being allowed to turn out be removed in hammock just a be to sick bay be ordered to keep very quiet managed to learn nevertheless that chase be still in sight directly ahead about nine mile distant that though certainly be not running away from there seemed to be little hope of overtaking for time to come matter remained in unsatisfactory state for next five day daphne keeping chase in sight during whole of time failing to come up with distance between two vessel varied according to weather chase appearing to have best of in strong breeze whilst daphne be slightly faster of two in light air unfortunately for wind continued very nearly dead fair about three point on starboard quarter whereas sloop seemed to do best with wind abeam must not have objected even to moderate breeze dead in teeth craft being remarkably fast on taut bowline a day after day went by without apparent prospect of end of chase barometer be anxiously watched in hope that before long must be favoured with change of weather on morning of fifth day be so much better that acceding to urgent request burnett consented with many doubtful shake of head to leaving hammock taking air on deck for hour two accordingly dressed a rapidly a possible got on deck just in time to catch sight of chase about six mile distant before sea mist settled down on scene soon effectually concealed from view be particularly exasperating since wind having dropped to about five knot breeze have be slowly perceptibly gaining on for last three four hour now when at length there appeared prospect of overtaking chance to elude in fog have presented of course be utterly impossible to guess what ruse so wary foe must resort to that must have recourse to one of kind be moral certainty captain vernon at once took counsel with first second lieutenant a to what course must be most advisable to adopt under circumstance be at last decided to put ship upon wind make short tack to eastward until fog must clear being thought highly probable that chase must likewise double back upon former course in hope of running past in fog studding sail be accordingly taken in ship brought to wind on starboard tack made short reach tacking hour have gone about for third time when just a men be coiling up rope fore aft look out reported sail ho straight ahead hard up sir will be into mr austin who have charge of deck sprang upon gun peered out eagerly ahead hard over man hard over exclaimed excitedly then continued after moment of breathless suspense clear clear have just missed be by jove hawkesley be narrow squeak eh why be surely vestale vestale ahoy hillo be response from other craft indubitably brig have fallen in with shortly after first look into congo have be given to understand be vestale french gun brig have sighted sail of kind to day hailed austin non mon dieu have not nevaire seen sail until now since leave sierra leone four week ago ended communication between two ship vestale be disappearing again into fog before last word of reply to question have be uttered well said mr austin a jumped down off gun be disappointed when first caught sight of craft close under bow thought for moment that have made clever guess that chase have doubled on track that by lucky accident have stumbled fairly upon in fog a soon a caught sight of white figure head streak round side saw be mistaken well may drop upon fellow yet must give ten pound note instant if fog must only lift can not understand for life of replied in dazed sort of way a stepped gingerly down off gun upon like first lieutenant have jumped in first of excitement mr austin looked at questioningly what be that can not understand hawkesley asked that brig vestale a call connected with answered why what be there to understand about rather what be there be incomprehensible about asked sharply everything replied eagerly in first place have only statement of one man member of own crew that actually be veritable vestale french gun brig know to be cruising in water secondly very extraordinary resemblance to black venus a be aware have seen absolutely compels against better judgment to belief that two brig be in mysterious way intimately associated together if indeed be not absolutely one same vessel thirdly suspicion that latter be case receives strong confirmation from fact that on occasion when have be after one black venus have encountered other vestale mr austin stared at in very peculiar way for few minute then said well hawkesley last assertion be undoubtedly true what doe prove can be nothing more than curious coincidence so have assured over over again when suspicion be strengthened by first occurrence of coincidence so will doubtless assure over over again during next few day replied if coincidence only be certainly curious that must have occurred on two occasion be not quite prepared to admit said first lieutenant then a to remarkable resemblance between two vessel do not think now honestly hawkesley that very extraordinary suspicion may have magnified that resemblance said only wish mr smellie have be on deck just now to have caught glimpse of inexplicable brig must have borne convincing testimony to marvellous likeness between why sir for white ribbon round one difference in figure head two craft must be positively indistinguishable so completely so indeed that poor richards be actually unable to believe evidence of own sens firmly believe be convinced of identity of two vessel indeed said mr austin in tone of great surprise be news to so richards shared suspicion did did indeed sir replied be in fact extraordinary demeanour on occasion of second encounter with vestale will remember circumstance sir confirmed suspicion suspicion up to then have attributed solely to aberration of fancy on part then again when questioned skipper of pensacola relative to black venus vestale how evasive be reply look here hawkesley have interested in spite of myself said mr austin if be not too tired must like to tell whole history of singular suspicion of yours from very moment of birth will sir with pleasure arose with monsieur le breton visit to on occasion of first falling in with vestale replied then having at last finally broached subject have be for so long secret source of mental disquiet to fully detailed to first luff suspicious circumstance trifling in important when regarded collectively have already confided to reader when have finished remained silent for long time nearly quarter of hour must think with hand clasped behind back eye bent on deck evidently cogitating deeply finally emerged from abstraction with start cast eye aloft at sail then turning to said have given something to think about now with vengeance hawkesley if indeed suspicion a to honesty of vestale must prove well founded mention of acute perception caused in first instance to entertain will constitute very valuable service for will take care that get full credit may very possibly lead to final detection suppression of series of hitherto utterly unaccountable transaction of most nefarious character at event can do harm by keeping wary eye upon alleged vestale for future will make business to invent plausible pretext for boarding on first opportunity present now think have be on deck quite a long a be good for so away go below again get back to hammock wound a yours be not to be trifled with in abominable climate know with smile half good humoured half satirical must take possible care of young gentleman who seems destined to teach from captain downwards business there now look hurt lad did quite right in speaking to be very much obliged to for so doing only regret that did not earlier make confidant now away go below at once of course did dutifully a be bidden truth to tell be by mean sorry to regain hammock having soon found that strength be by mean a great a have expected that same night suffered from considerable accession of fever in fine be confined to hammock for rather more than three week from date at end of became once more convalescent time observing proper precaution strict adherence to doctor order finally managed to get reported a once more fit for duty six week from day on smellie rejoined daphne may a well here mention that fog so inopportunely enveloped on day of conversation with mr austin did not clear away until just before sunset when did horizon be clear round trace of sail being visible in direction from main royal yard chapter sixteen very mysterious occurrence in extreme disgust at loss of notorious black venus captain vernon reluctantly gave order for resumption of cruise daphne be once more headed in for land being skipper intention to give look in at likely place along coast a far north a bight of benin be terribly tedious particularly trying to men being boat work exploration of fernan va river occupied thirty hour whilst in case of ogowe river boat be away from ship for four day three night result being that when at last went into sierra leone have ten men down with fever have lost four more from same cause worst of be that labour have be wholly in vain not single prize being taken suspicious craft fallen in with here found williams prize crew of josefa awaiting according to instruction so shipping landing sick men captain vernon lost time in putting to sea once more on leaving sierra leone course be shaped for congo after long very tedious passage during whole of have to contend against light head wind found once more within sight of river at daybreak be stark calm with cloudless sky long lazy swell came creeping in from southward eastward causing sloop to roll most uncomfortably be about twelve mile off land at about way between becalmed like there lay brig telescope informed be vestale on fact being decisively ascertained mr austin came up to said there be bete noire vestale once more see hawkesley have be thinking great deal about what said to time ago respecting have come to conclusion that be quite worth while to look into matter at least so far a will enable to judge whether suspicion be wholly groundless not if be if in fact craft prof to be what professes well good can dismiss affair finally for ever from mind give undivided attention to other matter confess have to certain extent imbued with own doubt a to strict integrity of yonder brig there be one two little matter mentioned escaped notice end certainly have rather suspicious appearance therefore intend if craft be bound into river like ourselves to make early opportunity to pay visit on pretext other have mentioned matter to captain vernon yet sir inquired not yet be reply must have something little more definite to say before broach matter to here come breeze at last sea breeze too thank heaven man brace fore aft square away yard brail in mizen hard up with helm man keep dead away for mouth of river faint blue line along western horizon came creeping gradually down toward presently catspaw two ruffled glassy surface of water for moment disappeared then deliciously cool refreshing draught of air fanned face swelled out light upper canvas for instant died away came again trifle stronger lasted for perhaps minute then with flap canvas collapsed filled again sloop gathered way paid off with head to eastward bubble two floated past side faint ripple arose under bow grew larger became audible glassy surface of water grew gently ruffled assumed exquisite cerulean tint wheel began to press against helmsman hand away went straight for mouth of river brig breeze gentle though be reached neighbour long before did a soon a felt too bore up squared yard headed direct for boolambemba point be about three mile ahead of when breeze reached felt very curious to see where must finally come to anchor only safe anchorage be in banana creek though slaver constantly resort to numerous other creek inlet higher up river captain of man of war must think for moment of risking ship in of unless emergency happened to be very pressing even then unless vessel happened to be of exceedingly light draught if therefore brig anchored in banana creek must accept a point in favour of honesty if not suspicion must be stronger than ever so happened that did anchor in banana creek fully quarter of mile higher up than old mildmay master thought prudent for to venture though in obedience to hint from mr austin took much further in than where have anchored on previous visit brig got in fully hour before canvas be consequently stowed yard squared rope hauled taut coiled down boat in water when anchor at length plunged into muddy opaque looking water of creek be barely brought up indeed hand be still aloft stowing canvas when gig shoved off from brig pulled down creek few minute later dashed alongside monsieur le breton once more presented upon quarter deck cap in have bowing smiling grimacing a only frenchman can visit though such singularly precipitate one be soon turned out merely visit of ceremony prolonged to extent captain vernon be perforce obliged to invite down below to breakfast mr austin being also skipper guest on particular morning in course of meal made several very complimentary remark a to appearance of daphne finally when suppose saw that have thus completely won poor austin heart very politely expressed extreme desire to take look through ship desire first luff with equal politeness assured must give great pleasure to gratify fellow certainly have wonderfully plausible winning way with there be denying saw that under influence slight suspicion have imparted to poor honest hearted straightforward mr austin be melting like snowflake under summer sun still under plausibility delicate flattery elaborate politeness of man there be vague indefinable something to found quite impossible to reconcile watched a cat doe mouse anxious to note suspicious circumstance might transpire in order might be fully prepared for talk with first luff felt certain must closely follow upon visitor departure to chagrin however be on occasion wholly unable to detect anything out of common monsieur le breton broken english upon have laid such stress in former conversation with mr austin be now quite consistent irreproachable be taken through ship shown nook corner in finally about noon took leave just before going down over side apologised for non appearance of captain dubosc upon plea that gentleman be confined to hammock with severe attack of dysentery if officer of daphne must honour estate ward room with presence at dinner that evening monsieur le breton brother officer must be enchanted apparently a after thought when foot be on top step of gangway ladder very agreeable gentleman urgently requested pleasure of mr austin company on sporting expedition one two more be about to undertake afternoon latter invitation be declined upon plea of stress of work invitation to dinner be accepted conditionally upon work being in sufficiently forward state to allow of officer leaving ship be indeed exceedingly busy that day mr austin having determined to take advantage of opportunity being at anchor afforded to lift rigging off masthead give thorough overhaul a for be engaged during whole of day in charge of boat crew filling up water cask tank foraging in adjacent forest for supply of fruit not single native canoe having approached during entire day be consequently not until late in afternoon when neck of day work be broken that have opportunity of exchanging word two with first lieutenant on subject of neighbour brig then be only word two mr austin opened conversation with well hawkesley what do think of friend monsieur le breton now that have have opportunity of bettering acquaintance with well sir replied on whole be inclined to think that there be just bare possibility of having be mistaken in estimate of of character of brig still still mind be not yet quite easy mr austin laughingly interrupted now what must possibly have noticed of suspicious character in poor fellow conduct morning nothing be obliged to acknowledge be quite prepared to admit sir total absence of peculiarity of manner be certain existed during first visit to ship did not think strange that must be in such tremendous hurry to come on board morning at first be inclined to think object might be to prevent visit from of to brig supposition be met to extent by invitation to for evening delay may of course have afforded opportunity to make arrangement for reception by putting out of sight tell tale evidence of dishonesty laughed first luff really hawkesley must say think be deceiving worrying unnecessarily of course can quite understand how having harboured extraordinary suspicion of yours for so great length of time now find difficult to dismiss in moment have patience for few hour more excellent opportunity be now offered for satisfying a to brig bona fides may rest assured that will make very best use of find will be only guest of frenchman to night rest of officer be far too busy to leave ship indeed can hardly be spared must not go for fact that must look uncivil if in body declined invitation will see to morrow have opportunity of going on board investigating for now must be off to make presentable will be keeping host waiting perhaps spoil dinner with dived below turned away to attend to little matter connected with progress of work quarter of hour later reappeared on deck clean shaven looking very handsome seamanlike in best suit of uniform gig being piped away went down over side giving parting nod a did so watched boat dash up alongside brig noted that side be manned in due form that worthy first be received by group of officer on quarter deck conspicuous among whom must make out with aid of glass monsieur le breton evidently performing ceremony of introduction then work being finished rope coiled down everything once more restored to proper place hand be piped to tea descended to midshipman den thoroughly tired out with unwonted exertion when again went on deck about hour later star be shining brilliantly moon about three day old be gleaming with soft subdued radiance through topmost branch of tree on adjacent shore night mist be already gathering so thickly on bosom of river that brig loomed through vague shadowy indistinct a phantom craft tide be ebbing stern be turned toward light appeared gleaming through cabin window struck a being little strange until remembered that monsieur le breton have spoken of captain being ill few of lad be amusing on forecastle dancing to enlivening strain of cook fiddle singing song occasional round of applause answering song came floating down upon gentle night breeze from brig a fog grew thicker sound gradually ceased lost sight of altogether so far a sound sight be concerned might have be only craft in entire river own lad also quieted down finally only sound broke solemn stillness of night be sighing of breeze gentle rustle of foliage loud sonorous chirr chirr chirr of insect be about half past nine o'clock be just thinking of going below to turn in when became conscious of sound of commotion of sort muffled cry seemed to like call for help dull thud a of falling body splash sound certainly proceeded from direction of brig thought that must have emanated from spot at about distance from daphne slight feeling of drowsiness have possessed took flight at once sens became instantly upon alert awaited in keen expectancy to hear if anything further followed in vain minute sped past sight sound occurred to elucidate mystery began to feel anxious alarmed old suspicion rose up again like strong man aroused from sleep walked aft to mr armitage who be leaning against gun with arm folded chin sunk upon breast evidently in deep meditation started up a heard footstep approaching on asking if have heard anything peculiar ahead of somewhat shortly acknowledged that have not thereupon told what have heard evidently attached importance to statement suggesting that if anything be doubtless of frenchman amusing be by mean satisfied with uneasiness increasing moment went forward to ascertain whether of hand on forecastle have heard mysterious sound found listening open mouthed to weird marvellous yarn one of topmen be spinning for edification from also failed to elicit anything satisfactory finally suddenly occurred to that in wandering ashore have often noticed how low night mist lay upon surface of river now struck that by going aloft might get sight of something must tend to explain disquieting occurrence to act upon idea be work of moment sprang into main rigging made way aloft a rapidly a if life depended upon utterly heedless of fact that rigging have be freshly tarred down day in le than minute have reached maintopmast crosstrees a have anticipated be here almost clear of mist eagerly looked ahead to see if be right in quarter first object caught eye be masthead of brig broad on starboard bow instead of directly ahead a have expected to find of struck a being somewhat strange what be stranger still seemed to be unaccountably near to rubbed eye looked at again be just in line with top of clump of tree rose like island out of silvery mist a looked saw that spar be moving gliding slowly almost imperceptibly past tree toward river brig be adrift listened intently for quite five minute without hearing faintest sound from craft during time have neared almost cable length in minute two must be abreast of within couple of ship length of must mean must not by possibility have struck adrift accidentally if berth be being intentionally shifted for reason why be operation carried out under cover of fog in such profound silence there have be no sound of lifting anchor must hear anything to indicate that be running out warp looked very much a though have slipped cable be allowing tide to carry silently out to sea where be mr austin during stealthy movement be aware of why if suspicion be correct have invited officer of daphne on board to dinner be merely blind temporary resort to usual courtesy adopted for purpose of giving colour to assumed character of french man o ' war be diabolical scheme to get into power so deprive formidable antagonist of head so to speak thus cripple surmise many others equally wild flashed through bewildered brain a stood there on crosstrees watching stealthy phantom like movement of brig upper spar conclusion to finally came be that captain vernon ought to be informed forthwith of what be going on accordingly descended to deck once more sought out third lieutenant mr armitage said in low cautious tone of voice brig be adrift driving down past with tide in direction of river brig adrift repeated incredulously nonsense mr hawkesley must be dreaming indeed be not sir assure replied earnestly have moment come from aloft saw topgallant mast most distinctly over top of mist be away over in direction scarcely cable length distant from be quite sure asked aroused at last by earnest manner to something like interest can hear sound of sir replied that in conjunction with sound undoubtedly heard just now make think that something must be wrong on board do not think matter ought to be reported to captain vernon most certainly ought agreed be possible that crew have taken ship from officer think scarcely know what to think replied let speak to captain at once hear what have to say about thereupon third lieutenant directed keene one of midshipman to take temporary charge of deck at once dived below well mr armitage what be asked captain vernon a presented in cabin discovered mr smellie chatting together over wine cigar must apologise for intruding upon sir said armitage hawkesley here have come to with very extraordinary story think have better hear from own lip oh well what be mr why hawkesley where in world have be what doing man be positively smothered in tar yes sir replied glancing at discovering for first time by brilliant light of cabin lamp woeful ruin wrought upon uniform really beg pardon sir for presenting in plight urgent nature of business must be excuse forthwith plunged in medias re told what have heard seen noise of scuffle brig adrift exclaimed skipper crew surely can not have risen upon officer taken ship same idea promptly presenting to a have occurred to third lieutenant sir said believe be at commotion be not great enough prolonged enough for officer must not be likely to be taken by surprise one man might be one man what do mean understand rapped out skipper well then sir to speak whole of mind plainly be greatly afraid that mr austin have met with foul play on board that brig that be not french man o ' war at a professes to be exclaimed saw smellie start be about to speak when mr austin foul play not french man o ' war gasped skipper why good heaven boy be mad if be sir can only say have be so for last four month retorted for be fully a long a longer have have suspicion about brig crew what exclaimed smellie have too suspected brig have indeed sir replied take chair hawkesley interrupted skipper pour out glass of wine let have story in fewest possible word mr armitage do favour to ascertain brig present whereabouts let know now hawkesley be ready to listen to a skipper ceased armitage bowed withdrew whilst very hastily sketched rise progress of suspicion from monsieur le breton first visit up to present moment before have proceeded very far however armitage returned with intelligence that brig be undoubtedly adrift already distance astern of that topman who have be aloft to inspect have reported that thought must detect men on yard turn up hand at once then sir if please see everything ready for slipping cable making sail at moment notice let everything be done in absolute silence keep hand aloft to watch brig report anything further may notice on board really look a though be on brink of important discovery now go ahead with story hawkesley said skipper proceeded a rapidly a possible merely stating what suspicious circumstance have come under own notice leaving captain vernon to draw own deduction when have finished skipper turned to smellie said be to understand from remark made short time ago that too have suspected mysterious brig mr smellie yes answered smellie certainly have vague feeling that there be something queer about suspicion be not nearly so clear strong a hawkesley subsequent event quite drove matter out of mind um remarked skipper meditatively be strange very strange never noticed anything peculiar about craft brig be now about mile distant sir be making sail reported armitage at moment presenting again at cabin door then wait until hand be out of rigging then slip will be after intend to see to bottom of returned skipper sharply there be undoubtedly something wrong poor austin must have turned up on board before matter have reached stage mind let work be carried on without unnecessary sound of kind a armitage again withdrew smellie rose to foot captain vernon turned to said be very greatly obliged to for zeal discretion have manifested in most delicate matter hawkesley come of will remember that have acted throughout to very best of ability not coming to precipitately with vague unconnected story waiting patiently until have accumulated sufficiency of convincing evidence for to act upon though even now must be very cautious a to what do let also add that mr smellie have spoken to in highest term of conduct throughout trying time when be ashore together indeed assures that to under god be indebted for actual preservation of life have watched carefully from moment of first coming on board have be highly gratified with conduct throughout go on a have begun young sir will prove ornament to service now gentleman to business chapter seventeen poor austin fate hurried on deck highly gratified at very handsome compliment paid by skipper found that hand be aloft casting loose canvas presently without word having be spoken above whisper shout uttered came down again topsail halliard be manned yard mast headed jib run up cable slipped be under weigh fog time being a thick a hedge so thick indeed that be impossible to see jib boom end from quarter deck old mildmay master be conning ship of course in such fog be guess work old fellow be terribly nervous anxious a indeed be also captain vernon struck that ship might be better conned from aloft stepped up to skipper with due modesty mentioned idea very happy thought exclaimed master who happened to overhear will just step up a far a crosstrees very good mr mildmay do so by mean said captain vernon wind be light what little of there be will carry sound of voice down to brig if hail deck so apprise of approach must avoid that if possible want to get alongside craft take by surprise may have trouble in accomplishing that if suspect that be after daphne be fast ship so also be brig be by mean certain that have not heel of must devise little code of signal from to deck so a to obviate necessity for hailing can anyone suggest anything very simple plan have occurred to whilst skipper be speaking a one else seemed to have suggestion to make offered mine if pennant halliard be cast adrift down here on deck sir held by one of said mr mildmay must get hold of aloft one tug upon might mean port ' two tug starboard three steady excellent exclaimed skipper perfectly simple will adopt forthwith will attend to deck end of halliard mr hawkesley with mr keene mr peter to pas word from along deck to helmsman place in good weatherly position mr mildmay if please so that when run clear of fog brig may have chance to dodge ay ay sir never fear for answered old mildmay a swung nimbly into main rigging in few second body disappeared in mist old fellow soon put in right course away went crowding sail after invisible brig anxious half hour followed then ran out of fog found ourselves creeping along parallel with land to northward of river mouth with brig about mile ahead of under stitch of canvas must show to freshening land breeze have gained on considerably master having kept keen eye upon gleaming upper canvas whilst piloting out of river steering in such direction a to very nearly cut off altogether of course came down on deck a soon a have cleared fog captain vernon at once ordered crew to quarter men be not long in getting to station when be ready gun be fired after flying brig a polite request for to heave to ensign hoisted to peak be naturally very anxious to see what must be taken of since somewhat high handed course be taking with craft have be adopted entirely upon strength of representation if brig must after turn out to be vestale french gun brig a have pretended to be skipper might perhaps involve in considerable amount of trouble be therefore with sigh of real genuine relief heard shot come whistling close past from brig in reply to own captain vernon too be evidently much relieved for ejaculated in tone of great satisfaction good have fired shotted gun at refuse to show colour now course be perfectly clear try effect of gun on mr armitage aim at spar be skimming along there like witch if be not careful will give slip yet armitage who be in charge of battery forward upon began peppering away at in earnest though shot made daylight through canvas time damage be done either to spar rigging began to be only too evident that be gradually creeping away from to make matter worse too crew be just a smart with gun a be with ours in fact trifle more so for before quarter of hour have passed several of rope fortunately unimportant one have be cut at length thud crack aloft turned eye in direction to see fore royal mast topple over to leeward captain vernon stamped upon deck in height of vexation away aloft there clear wreck exclaimed for heaven sake mr armitage see if can not cripple fellow ten minute more will be out of range then good bye ' to wish to goodness people at home must condescend to take lesson in shipbuilding from men who turn out slaver must then have chance of making capture occasionally whilst skipper have be thus giving vent to rapidly increasing chagrin smellie have walked forward presently caught sight of stooping down squinting along sight of gun have just be re loaded run out few second of anxious suspense followed then came flash sharp report followed next moment by ringing cheer from men on forecastle brig fore yard have be shot away in sling craft at once shot up into wind lay apparently at mercy ram alongside mildmay exclaimed skipper in ecstasy of delight stand by with grappling iron fore aft mr smellie stand by to lead party on board forward will attend to matter aft here really looked for moment a though actually have brig chill of disappointment thrilled through when saw how splendidly be handled man who commanded be evidently equal to emergency for sooner did craft begin to luff into wind than let fly after brace shivered main topsail hauled head sheet over to windward after pause must have sent heart of on board into mouth brig began to pay off again until by deft dainty manipulation of canvas be actually got dead before wind when main yard be squared away went once more little worse for serious mishap if skipper however be thorough seaman so too be old mildmay experienced veteran soon saw how matter be tending though be unable to ram alongside in accordance with captain vernon energetically expressed desire placed daphne square in wake to windward of brig within cable length of thus to extent taking wind out of sail effect of be that immediately began to gain upon crew of brig now worked at stern chaser with redoubled energy running gear soon began to suffer though might to extent have avoided by sheering away on to one other of brig quarter position then held be so commanding that skipper resolved to maintain must grin bear said will not be for long five minute will place alongside edge down trifle toward port quarter mildmay a though intended to board on side then at last moment sheer sharply across stern range up on starboard side may possibly save broadside a board mr smellie kindly load battery with round grape if please will deliver broadside board in smoke within specified five minute ranged up alongside brig delivered broadside receiving hers in return hand proving too smart to let escape that grappling iron be securely hooked into rigging away went on board fore aft being perhaps second ahead of brig crew who actually have hardihood to attempt to board be stoutly met by a motley at same time a ruffianly set of men a have ever be lot to encounter most desperate struggle forthwith ensued captain vernon of course took care to be first on board stuck close to coat tail almost first individual encountered be le personage than old acquaintance monsieur le breton pressed fiercely forward at once crossed sword with skipper who exchanged two three pass with two be soon separated by surging crowd of combatant then found face to face with be by mean skilled swordsman to tell truth felt somewhat nervous for moment a blade jarred rasped upon mine by great good fortune however succeeded in parrying first thrust next instant how happened must not possibly say reeled backwards with sword blade right through body leaving dying a thought on deck immediately pressed forward after skipper for few minute be kept pretty busy first with one antagonist then finally after fiercely maintained struggle of twelve minute so brig crew began to give way before own lad until finding hemmed in on side flung down arm begged for quarter be of course given upon seeing that skipper smellie be safe turned to go below thinking must perhaps discover poor austin in durance vile in one of state room descended cabin staircase be about to pas into saloon when happened to catch sight out of corner of eye of dark object moving in obscure corner under staircase turning to take more direct look at to great surprise discovered to be monsieur le breton who instead of being dead a have quite imagined must be be alive seemingly not very much worse for wound carried pistol in hand be in very act of lowering down through trap in flooring when grasped by collar invited to explain intention quietly allowed to drag out of opening rose to foot then suddenly closed with aiming fierce blow at uncovered head have lost hat somehow in struggle on deck with heavy brass mounted butt of pistol in such encounter a did not feel very much afraid of being tall for age having developed fair share of muscular strength since leaving england be a much a must do to hold at same time prevent inflicting serious injury upon wound however told upon at last eventually succeeded in dragging back to deck though not until after have ineffectually emptied pistol at on regaining deck found lad busy securing prisoner monsieur le breton be soon made a safe a rest of be loudly protesting against indignity of being bound when captain vernon approached oh here be hawkesley exclaimed be looking for began to fear that have met with mishap do favour to step below see if can discover anything of mr austin have already once be below with object sir replied discovering man le breton a call acting in very suspicious manner deemed duty to see safe on deck before proceeding further in quest what be doing asked skipper sharply vill tell sare vat be doing interrupted le breton recklessly va on vay to ze soute aux poudres to blow ze people to ze devil to keep company wiz inqueezatif first leftenant must have done eet too for zat pestilent midshipman who have ze gripe of ze devil peste eengleesh be like ze bouledogue ven take hold not nevare let go again there hawkesley what do think of for compliment laughed skipper so monsieur resumed be about to blow up eh very kind of be sure perhaps will increase obligation to by informing what have done with mr austin done wiz reiterated le breton with diabolical sneer why have sent to ze bottom of ze creek where must have sent if have not be too cautious to accept polite invitation do understand to mean that have murdered thundered skipper yes be reckless answer drowned murdered call what will treacherous scoundrel ejaculated skipper hoarsely will be made to bitterly account for unprovoked outrage clap in iron turning to master at arm who happened to be close at hand poor austin continued suspicion hawkesley have proved only too correct craft be unquestionably slaver worse must have thoroughly overhauled possibly document of great value to may be found stowed away somewhere other will see to at once forthwith dived below prisoner having be secured dead wounded be next attended to former being lashed up in hammock ready for burial whilst latter be carefully conveyed below to receive such attention a surgeon assistant must bestow brig loss be very severe sixteen of men having be killed twenty two wounded principally by final broadside out of total of sixty hand own loss be light considering determination with enemy have fought amounting to only eleven wounded a soon a sufficiency of hand must be spared for purpose brig square canvas be furled prize crew be told off to take charge of two craft then made sail in company brig under fore aft canvas only for anchorage under padron point where brought up about couple of hour later captain vernon then returned to daphne in brig gig bringing with bundle of paper leaving smellie in charge of prize anchor watch be set hand then turned in pretty well tired highly elated at result of evening work at daybreak next morning vessel weighed returned to former berth in banana creek daphne picking up cable have slipped on previous night dead be then buried on little island lie on east side of creek after carpenter boatswain with mate be set to work upon necessary repair to brig craft now proved to be english built having be turned out of shoreham shipyard originally registered under name of virginia how have come to get into hand of individual from whom took there be nothing to show be completely fitted for carrying on business of slaver from nature of good discovered in after hold be quite separate from main hold there must be doubt that have also done little piracy whenever convenient opportunity have presented be sent away directly after breakfast that morning in charge of couple of boat with order to drag creek for poor mr austin body in little more than hour fortunately found quite uninjured poor fellow have evidently be taken completely by surprise gag being in mouth hand manacled behind with stout canvas bag containing two pound shot lashed to foot took body on board daphne be at once conveyed below to own cabin pending construction of coffin ensign being at same time hoisted up to peak melancholy duty performed be again sent away to drag for anchor cable slipped by virginia on previous evening also found weighed conveyed on board prize where under smellie able supervision work of repairing refitting be going on apace about noon same day strange brig entered river with french flag flying at peak brought up in creek about cable length astern of be at once struck with marked resemblance stranger bore to virginia though be by mean so striking a similarity between prize black venus forthwith came to conclusion that now at last beheld veritable vestale real simon pure before so upon armitage boarding proved to be captain upon hearing of extraordinary personation of craft so successfully played off upon by virginia actually producing commission to prove bona fides during course of somewhat eventful day also one of lad learned from one of prisoner on occasion of second encounter with virginia when so cleverly pretended to be in pursuit of black venus be actually making best of way to havana with three hundred slave on board have accused sister ship of carrying off that elaborate signalling on occasion be merely resorted to for purpose of hoodwinking at four o'clock afternoon mr austin body having be deposited in coffin have be prepared for hand be mustered on deck in clean clothes boat be hoisted out body be deposited in launch with union jack spread over coffin a pall ensign hoisted half mast high on staff in boat stern just a procession be on point of shoving off from ship side officer of vestale who have incidentally learned particular of austin murder approached in two gig with french flag floating at mast from ensign stave in stern of boat took up position in rear then shoved off first second cutter taking launch in tow proceeding up creek in charge of old mildmay master captain officer following in two gig a soon a be clear of ship side daphne began firing minute gun to vestale hoisting ensign half up to peak replied so moved slowly up creek minute gun continuing a long a boat remained within sight of ship proceeded for distance of about two mile brought to lovely spot selected by skipper who have sought out during morning there landed body be then passed out of launch shouldered by six petty officer smellie supporting pall on one side whilst armitage old mildmay performed like duty on other skipper leading way to grave reading burial service a went whilst remaining officer men followed by contingent from vestale formed in rear of coffin arrived at grave coffin be placed on ground rope for lowering to bottom be adjusted finally be gently reverently deposited in last resting place skipper meanwhile reading impressively solemn sentence beginning with man be born of woman hath short time to live etcetera slight pause be made at conclusion of passage smellie deeply affected stepped forward threw first earth upon body of dear friend brother officer after service again proceeded soon came to end firing party of marine next formed on side of grave rendered last honour to dead grave be filled in wooden cross being temporarily planted at head turned sorrowfully away entered boat with ensign now hoisted to staff head returned to ship realising fully perhaps for first time fact that have lost for ever genial brave devoted sympathetic friend in midst of life be in death never did so thoroughly realise absolute literal truth of a whilst sitting in gig silently struggling with feeling on return from poor austin funeral have just laid in lonely grave on foreign shore far away from that held dearest best on earth in spot consecrated only by solemn service have just be performed over spot must never be watered by mother sister tear where last resting place must be at mercy of stranger savage where in course of very few year must only too probably be obliterated beyond possibility of recognition yet twenty four short hour ago be alive well rejoicing in strength of lusty manhood with apparently promise of many year of life before never suspecting a went down over ship side with cheery smile reassuring nod to that be going thus gaily to meet treachery death poor austin struggled successfully with feeling whilst eye of others be upon be not ashamed to admit that wept long bitterly night when reflected in privacy upon untimely cruel fate be ashamed to acknowledge then also prayed more earnestly perhaps than have ever prayed before might be taught so to number day might incline mine heart unto truest of wisdom wisdom teach how to live in such way that death may never find unprepared on passing virginia be seen that new fore yard be slung rigged sail bent other repair completed so that be once more ready for sea smellie shortly afterwards shifted trap over into returning to daphne to dine with captain vernon to receive final instruction given mr armitage be summoned to cabin upon arrival there skipper after speaking regretfully upon loss ship hand especially a said have sustained through first lieutenant death informed that mr smellie having received charge of prize to deliver over to admiral of station with earnest recommendation that must be turned over to navy given to smellie with rank of commander now became necessary to appoint acting first lieutenant to daphne few word of commendation to armitage then followed be presented with acting order skipper then turned to next becomes necessary to appoint acting second lieutenant said after giving subject most serious attention have determined hawkesley to appoint nay thanks young gentleman will discover before many hour have passed over head that have very little to be thankful for will exchange present easy irresponsible position for one of very grave unceasing responsibility safety of ship of hand will daily during watch be confided to care many other onerous duty will devolve upon one of will demand most unceasing attention utmost skill in proper discharge henceforward will have time to think of nothing duty duty must wholly engage thought by day ay very dream by night be post of mere empty honour be about to confer upon a once before remarked to have have eye upon ever since came on board ship young a be short a have be term of probation have sufficient confidence in to believe that will do credit to judgment presume of course that be unnecessary to point out to that appointment can be only temporary virginia will doubtless bring back with from sierra leone officer of admiral appointment to fill post of second third lieutenant if a have doubt discharge temporary duty with anything like ability anticipate promotion upon completion of time will be sure rapid so saying skipper extended hand to gave mine hearty shake smellie armitage following example offering congratulation being by time rather late smellie shortly afterwards rose bidding adieu at gangway to old shipmate repaired on board new command be under order to sail next morning at daybreak a for went off to midshipman berth through keene wood williams master mate being drafted on board virginia be now almost empty shifted few trap forthwith into cabin recently vacated by smellie scarcely knowing meanwhile whether be standing upon head heel chapter eighteen cutter beset on following morning captain dubosc lieutenant le breton now discovered that virginia people have assumed name of officer of vestale in addition to appropriating name of ship came on board daphne to breakfast armitage old mildmay being invited to meet meal appeared to be protracted one for be served punctually at eight o'clock participant did not appear on deck until half past ten secret however soon came out for when did at length put in appearance became perfectly evident from sundry disjointed remark passed between that something of importance be on tapis frenchman gig be awaiting soon passed down over side captain dubosc last word being well then mon ami be settled contingent will be ready for start punctually at two o'clock au revoir be not left long in ignorance of precise nature of arrangement have just be concluded for a soon a french gig be fairly away from vessel side captain vernon beckoned to said just step down below with hawkesley want to have talk with followed down into cabin whereupon directed to be seated drew chair up to table for laying hand upon bundle of paper said be of paper discovered night before last on board virginia a anticipated must be case contain several item of exceedingly important information one of item have reference to existence on island forty mile up river of immense slave depot a also of slave hulk in of if information here given happens to be reliable large number of slave be at moment awaiting embarkation paper seem also to imply that there be very snug anchorage close to island with navigable channel leading right up to now be exceedingly anxious for many reason to test truth of information have therefore arranged with captain dubosc to send joint expedition up river to survey alleged channel to destroy depot hulk if such be found to exist to free slave may happen to be therein from certain remark to be found here there in document infer that depot hulk be in charge of white men be unfortunately nowhere stated how many white men number can not however muster very strongly there probably number above dozen altogether expedition therefore will only be small one consisting only of own cutter that of vestale have determined to give command of people to mr mildmay being most experienced officer at surveying now remaining to with to lend hand french boat will be under command of monsieur saint croix second lieutenant of vestale boat though of course under independent command will act in concert paper placing one before be a will perceive sketch chart of river two cross in red ink indicate position of depot hulk differs somewhat will notice from admiralty chart to pointed a spoke will really be great point to ascertain if of two be correct to individual unacquainted with river channel there on larboard hand going up must naturally suggest a preferable one being so much wider than other sounding marked on sketch go to show that water be much deeper in south channel be one of point want cleared up be bearing compass course along deepest water in reach of channel have already explained to mildmay of course thought must also explain to because knowing exactly what want will be able to render more intelligent assistance than must be possible be working in dark there be only one thing more be tolerably good hand with pencil know do think must make exact copy of sketch chart to take with so a to leave original behind with assured skipper that must must whereupon furnished with necessary material left in solitude to perform task going on deck to superintend preparation for trip sketch chart found among paper on board virginia be only small affair drawn upon sheet of foolscap paper be so carefully executed that felt sure must be work of experienced hand consequently in probability perfectly accurate copy therefore to be of value at must have to be not free hand happy go lucky sketch absolute facsimile there be great deal of work in not much time wherein to do so after little thought hit upon plan of fastening outspread original with wafer to glass of one of stern window watering thin sheet of paper over strong daylight reflected up from surface of water through glass rendered two sheet of paper sufficiently transparent to enable to see line mark of original with tolerable clearness through sheet upon proposed to make copy with aid of fine pointed pencil soon have complete going over afterwards with pen ink to make indelible mildmay lunched with skipper day during course of meal received final instruction be however little more than recapitulation of given in morning meal over cutter crew be paraded fully armed in waist of ship ammunition be served out to be ordered down into boat lay alongside with pounder carronade in bow together with necessary powder shot for same spare ammunition for men musket four day provision water in fact necessary for successful carrying out of undertaking upon be bound skipper then shook hand with mildmay wishing prosperity success went down over side into boat little expedition started three minute later be joined by monsieur saint croix in vestale cutter when canvas be set in boat wind though dead in teeth for passage up river being free enough to carry a far a boolambemba point for remainder of day up to about pm on day following expedition progressed without incident of kind worth mentioning progress be steady slow mildmay whole energy being devoted to making of thoroughly satisfactory trustworthy survey of river channel up be passing in accomplishment of duty be pleased to find that study have be diligently pursuing under mr smellie auspex enabled to render substantial assistance saint croix who kept about quarter of mile in wake be making perfectly independent survey compared with ours at conclusion of day work first incident of note though attached importance to at moment occurred about four o'clock in afternoon on day following departure from banana creek consisted merely in fact that large native canoe passed upward bound without occupant bestowing upon notice whatever have previously encountered several canoe small craft carrying from two to dozen native occupant of who seemed to be engaged for most part in fishing have invariably greeted with vociferous ejaculation from hearty laughter immediately following be doubtless choice example of congoese wit particular canoe now in question swept past without sound be large well shaped craft propelled by twenty four paddle dashed ahead of a if have be at anchor occupant especially four individual who sat in stern sheet at event where stern sheet ought to be who from display of feather bead necklace leopard skin robe must have be very bigwig indeed looking straight ahead of vouchsafing not faintest indication that be conscious of presence absurd assumption of dignity greatly tickled at moment attributing entirely to existence in native mind of profound conviction of own immeasurable superiority subsequent event tended to give more sinister aspect to incident pressed diligently on with work until six o'clock at time found abreast small native village here mildmay proposed to effect landing for purpose of procuring fruit also to satisfy very natural curiosity to see what native village be like on pulling in toward bank native assembled making such unmistakable warlike demonstration that deemed advisable to abandon purpose must of course have easily dispersed hostile black have be so disposed saint croix who be particularly high spirited fiery tempered young fellow strongly advocated doing so captain vernon order to to avoid collision with native have be most stringent old mildmay be far too experienced seasoned hand to engage in affray for mere fun of thing therefore sturdily refused to aid abet saint croix in such unrighteous undertaking passed night instead upon small islet whereon there be nothing more formidable than few water fowl flock of green parrot to dispute landing have not be at work above hour so on following morning before have reason to suspect that at least of unusual number of canoe around be suspiciously watching movement if not actually following up river however for time being caused little uneasiness a felt assured that must attention become inconveniently obtrusive bullet two failing that round shot from carronade fired over head must promptly send to right about later on in day however must confess that for one began to experience slight qualm of anxiety a noticed steadily increasing number of canoe of carrying a many a ten dozen men in vicinity be ostensibly engaged in fishing be true that be only pretence that be meeting with unusually bad luck be evident from small number of fish captured still up to noon though behaviour of native have be steadily growing more suspicious unsatisfactory actual hostile demonstration have be made landed upon small bare sandy islet to cook despatch dinner during time have of course be carefully checking chart of river copied by from one found on board virginia comparing with own survey general result being to prove that be very fairly accurate quite sufficiently so at least to serve a safe guide to vessel of light draught say up to ten foot so making for island on be alleged slave depot chart told that have now arrived within distance of six mile of island in question statement verified to extent by fact that on island situate at about distance from must make out with aid of glass object might very well pas for large building of kind river channel between island be entirely free of visible obstruction therefore hoped that by little extra exertion might succeed in completing survey right up to island gaining possession of hulk thus achieving full object of expedition before nightfall by time that be ready to make start once more however canoe have mustered in such number even old mildmay who have hitherto poo poohed suggestion a to possibility of contemplated attack began to look serious at last actually went length of acknowledging perhaps there might be mischief brewing after saint croix however treated matter lightly roundly asserting that extraordinary gathering be due to nothing more serious than native curiosity to behold unwonted sight of white man to watch mysterious operation there be undoubtedly certain degree of probability about suggestion most unfortunately gave to larger share of credence than event justified shoving off from sand bank resuming surveying operation without first adopting precautionary measure prudence obviously dictated at two o'clock pm by time have passed over about three of six mile lay between sand bank supposed goal french boat being at time about mile astern of loud shouting arose from one of largest canoe in flotilla paddle be suddenly elevated in air whole fleet with one accord rapidly closed in between frenchman completely cutting off one from other hillo exclaimed mildmay what be meaning of just clap round shot into carronade there tom pitch well over head of black rascal pull port back starboard slue boat round with nose toward be sort now tom be ready there for'ard then well elevate muzzle stand by to fire when give word hold water starboard oar port oar pull stroke be pointing straight for frenchman just now well of now be clear chance of hitting friend fire carronade rang out report from bow of boat shot went screaming away far over head of in canoe frenchman firing in like manner at almost same moment yell of dismay immediately arose from canoe dozen of nearest dashed paddle into water began paddling precipitately away panic however be only momentary appeared to have seen heard artillery before a soon a saw that damage have be done arrested flight contingent of canoe numbering quite hundred began cautiously to advance toward spreading out on right left in manner showed that meditated attempt to surround give pill tom slap right into thick of time must let surround at price exclaimed old mildmay turn round on thwart lad pull boat gently up stream starn first so to keep bull dog forward there facing now a soon a be ready there with gun let have once again carronade spoke out time voice conveyed death message to of belligerent black shot striking one of canoe fair in stem knocking into match wood killing maiming several of occupant naturally expected that severe lesson must have effect of sending troublesome neighbour to right about en masse to surprise discomfiture be by mean case on contrary appeared to have thoroughly aroused most savage instinct with loud shout dashed paddle into water advanced menacingly toward load musket lad exclaimed mildmay a with eye gleaming nostril dilated old war horse snuffed approaching battle load musket then take to oar again back steadily up stream sharp word quick action if rascal outflank ' a sodgers call may say good bye ' to old england mr hawkesley d think can pitch bullet into long chap be creeping up there on larboard beam be about to try hand see if ca stop gallop of fellow who be in such tremendous hurry away here to nor'ard of take good aim now have single bullet that can afford to throw away ah be well done a bowled over individual who be handling steering paddle in canoe indicated to now let see what old man can do raised piece to shoulder took long steady aim fired white spot instantly appeared on side of canoe one of occupant sprang convulsively to foot fell headlong into river nearly capsizing frail craft a did so certainly checked impetuosity of two particular canoe occupant of have suffered from fire others only pressed forward with increased eagerness hang exclaimed master pettishly want to do will have to give dose of grape yet why wo stupid donkey take hint why in name of fortune must want to interfere with at try with grape time tom let see what think of fruit of vine meanwhile french boat have also become actively engaged report of carronade ringing out much more frequently than own whilst rattling volley of musketry breezed up from at brief interval from steadily decreasing sharpness of report soon became evident somewhat must confess to dismay that be retiring might of course be merely strategic movement on saint croix part if on other hand happened to be situated like with work cut out to defend way open to down stream only a have clear road before up stream only then indeed matter be beginning to look extremely serious for so far a be concerned if must only avoid being surrounded be comparatively safe way must be open for retreat fine breeze happening to be blowing down river must with aid of sail easily outpace canoe with matter be very different retreat be cut off unless must beat off canoe only course open to seemed to be that of taking to dry land intrenching a best might patiently waiting until assistance must arrive meanwhile in accordance with mildmay instruction carronade have be loaded with grape tom taking steady aim applied match to piece flash roar volume of smoke away went grape lashing up surface of water fair in line with thick cluster of canoe through iron shower next moment tore with disastrous effect one canoe be literally rent to piece one of occupant so far a must see being killed two other canoe one on side of first be so seriously damaged that immediately swamped leaving occupant squattering in water like so many lame duck three four others be hit with serious casualty to crew effectually checked advance of black for few minute during made good use of oar in urging boat still stern foremost in direction of island to be bound upon be now able to distinctly make out shape of huge wooden barrack like structure a pressed on toward island became cognisant of fact that occupant be in great state of confusion few minute later saw long procession of black who from constrained movement be apparently manacled emerge from barrack move off toward opposite side of island be enabled with aid of glass to detect on island presence of ten dozen white men individual carrying musket in one hand whip in other seemed to be very freely using latter to expedite movement of unhappy black be however allowed scanty time in to take note of matter for native canoe soon began to press forward upon once more evidently with fixed determination to surround if possible thus prevent approach to island knew that if object be once accomplished doom be certain for in such case fight a desperately a might must soon be overpowered by sheer force of number consequently soon became so far a be concerned absolute race for life on swept boat men pulling through water though still stern foremost at pace such a have rarely travelled before on crowded canoe after spread out athwart stream in form of crescent luckily for channel at point be not very wide by keeping in middle of be able to throw musket shot clear across to side otherwise must soon have found in parlous case greater number of canoe obstinately maintained position in mid stream ahead of thus presenting insuperable barrier to retreat down stream whilst on outer wing to port starboard of hugged bank of stream two three of larger craft making big spurt ahead of others now then in endeavour to outflank endeavour however well directed volley of musketry always sufficed to check for time being at length reached point where stream widened out considerably enabling canoe on side to spread out sufficiently far to be beyond musket shot saw that upon question whether canoe passed point first hinged fate native though evidently entertaining wholesome dread of carronade be by mean so dismayed by execution wrought among a have hoped must be indeed exhibited decidedly growing disposition to close upon in spite of fire in fact position be at moment growing more critical very fortunately for happened to have few round of canister in boat mildmay now resolved to try effect of upon pertinacious native charge of grape with one of canister on top of be accordingly rammed home sent flying into thickest of crowd of canoe immediately ahead of immediately succeeded by like dose to right left wing of flotilla canoe be just at about right distance to give murderous discharge utmost possible effect carnage among thickly crowded craft be simply indescribable effect be not only to check advance effectually to actually put to flight whilst similar charge be again rammed home by in charge of gun rest of men slewed boat round on centre with loud cheer gave way at top speed for island be within hundred yard of low shingly beach when to astonishment roar of artillery from island greeted ear at same instant half dozen round shot came flying about ear fortunately damage be done beyond smashing of couple of oar incontinent precipitation backwards into bottom of boat of puller thereof amidst uproarious laughter of hand before unfortunate have fairly picked up cutter be sent surging half length high dry up on beach carronade belched forth content out jumped master man charged up to sod battery have fired upon be greeted with volley of musketry however never stopped in rush single instant a clambered in at one side have satisfaction of seeing rascally spaniard go flying out at other whence made short mile of to boat lay awaiting on beach at opposite side of island two three hundred yard away sent few ineffectual flying shot after attempted pursuit a now found to extent master of situation in so far be to say that found battery admirably adapted a place wherein to make stand until such time a must see way clear to once more take offensive measure a for spaniard made good retreat to large hulk lay securely moored at distance of twenty yard from steeply sloping eastern shore of island floating high out of water a did with channel plate removed gear whatever about side to aid in boarding must make attempt must foresaw prove rather hard nut for to crack footing thus made good upon island in battery have moment two in to look about first discovery made be that poor old mildmay master have be wounded be lying helpless face downwards on sward outside battery next be that native have recovered from panic be actually once more advancing against spreading out on side so a to completely encircle island first object demanding attention be of course master directing man tom chief artilleryman to look into state of gun belonging to battery to load afresh called couple of men took with to bring in master poor old fellow be lying upon grass face downwards when gently raised became apparent that have be bleeding rather profusely at mouth be senseless ghastly pale for moment feared be dead low moan however a men began to move with gave assurance that life be not quite extinct a gently a must lifted over low earth parapet laid down under shelter in comparative safety command of party now devolved upon very serious responsibility under circumstance found here be cooped up in small sod battery wholly ineffectual to resist determined assault with perfect cloud of hostile native hovering about apparently determined to be satisfied with nothing short of absolute extermination with dozen vindictive spaniard on board hulk close at hand doubtless a anxious a native to sweep from face of earth french boat having vanished from scene though there be drinkable water in abundance in river so long a might be able to get at with only one day provision left chapter nineteen situation becomes desperate well tom said what about gun be loaded yes sir be answered tom most fort'nate circumstance be that ordered gun to be loaded when did otherwise must have be sent sky high by time ah indeed how be why see sir when be ordered to load gun nat'rally look round for ammunition for to do with though be first time a have ever found aboard reg'lar genewine land battery did take long for to make up mind that if there be ammunition anywheres aboard thing must be in one of there corner locker so go away try to open door in course find locked did take ned mor'n jiffy hows'ever to prise off lock when looked in there sure enough be powder goodish quantity made up into cartridge there too see black stump of fuze with red spark on end fizzing smoking away good un knowed what that meant in second mr hawkesley so whip out knife sings out to ned to prise open other two door cut off live end of fuze at once just in time there war more inch of left when got other two door open be just same sir minute more 'd have ' done for lot of sir have taken care to see that magazine be now all right that there be more live fuze in exclaimed in considerable alarm ay ay sir never fear for answered tom with quiet grin be safe enough now sir gave good overhaul before doing anything else sir thank tom replied have rendered most important service if live to get out of scrape will not fail to report to captain vernon must like to take squint into magazine certingly sir by mean returned tom leading way to magazine pointed out manner in fuze have be placed graphically redescribed manner in terrible catastrophe have be averted have indeed have frightfully narrow escape from destruction for magazine of there be three one in angle of triangular shaped battery contained about one hundred cartridge quite sufficient to have completely destroyed battery in having satisfied that be safe here at once turned attention to next most pressing business of moment be to secure musket ammunition provision water in cutter to make craft a safe a possible be likely to prove somewhat hazardous task a canoe be now close to beach pressing rapidly in on side felt greatly averse to further slaughter in case scarcely saw how be to be averted native being so pertinacious in attack be quite evident that must either kill be killed therefore most reluctantly gave order for discharge of six nine pounder battery mounted right into thickest of crowd men to immediately afterwards rush for boat secure musket ammunition at once return to battery be done without pausing instant to note effect away went down to boat seized a much a must conveniently carry immediately scampered back again whole operation did not occupy more than couple of minute have satisfaction of seeing hand scramble back into battery before native have recovered from check of last discharge so far so good great many thing still remained in boat especially provision water be absolutely necessary that must secure so called for volunteer to accompany on second trip to cutter hand proving equally willing to go picked dozen leaving remainder in battery to cover with musket leaping low sod parapet of battery once more made dash for boat native catching sight of instantly raised terrific yell came paddling toward at top speed out with cutlass men exclaimed will have to fight way back time believe now man seize a much a can carry in one hand keep close together now be ready then march ah capital a lad in battery bowled over three four black who have landed be rushing down upon now run for away went helter skelter once more got safely within compass of sheltering wall though not until who of course have to be last in seeking cover have be overtaken surrounded by dozen furious black two of whom succeeded in disabling with sword whilst remaining four be promptly placed hors de combat by musket of who be covering retreat taking fresh courage perhaps at limited number possibly also feeling more at home in fight on dry land than when in canoe native now closed in upon on side effecting landing on island pressing forward with loud cry much brandishing of spear to attack battery battery may be well to explain be small equilateral triangular affair built of sod measuring about thirty five foot on of side mounted six nine pounder brass gun two to side wall rose to height of about seven foot above ground outside ledge about three foot wide on inside being raised three foot round interior of wall thus enabling on inside to fire over low parapet gun be mounted on ordinary ship carriage be unprovided with tackle being placed upon wooden platform slightly sloping forward so that when loaded must be easily run out by hand recoil of discharge sending back up slight slope into loading position three angle of battery be a have already be intimated occupied by magazine native advanced boldly to attack for moment must confess that felt almost dismayed a looked around got clear idea of overwhelming number however there be escape be completely hemmed in on side if be to die thought might a well die fighting so waiting until be within few yard only of wall gave order to fire report of six nine pounder rang sharply out upon evening air man then seized loaded musket saw that naked cutlas be ready to hand waited breathlessly for inevitable rush round shot ploughed six well defined lane through approaching phalanx persevering foe have apparently become accustomed to effect of artillery fire by time seeming to regard a disagreeable concomitant to struggle must be faced after be not so very formidable have already acquired knowledge that gun once fired be perfectly harmless until must be re loaded that operation of reloading required certain amount of time moment therefore that received fire charged down upon battery evidently feeling that worst be over that now amounted to more than ordinary hand to hand fight here come lad with vengeance exclaimed take musket aim low make bullet do double treble duty if can keep cool be careful not to throw single shot away be excellent advice to give especially a giver thereof needed perhaps more than of around be spoken with calm steady voice lad responded to with hearty inspiring cheer levelled musket carefully steadily over top of sod parapet selecting particular mark firing only when felt sure of aim though at moment perfect cloud of spear came flying into battery next instant foe be upon then commenced furious breathless desperate hand to hand fight lasted fully ten minute black leaping upward assisting other in effort to surmount parapet cutting slashing right left without moment breathing space in equally determined effort to keep out during very thick of fight light thin jet of smoke be seen to issue from joint crevice in wooden wall of huge barrack like structure to windward of jet rapidly growing in number volume being speedily succeeded by thin arrowy tongue of flame shot into view for moment disappeared then appeared again darting along surface of wood uniting with others until entire building became completely enveloped in flame doubt spaniard have kindled on retreat in order to make assurance doubly sure a be in event of little scheme for destruction of battery miscarrying to deprive of what must have afforded excellent retreat in to have withstood siege smoke thick pungent suffocating from tar pitch with roof side of building have be from time to time liberally coated drifted down directly upon in such dense volume that be difficult to see arm length ahead making act of breathing next to impossibility causing eye to stream with water whilst heat soon became almost insupportable enemy however did not seem to be in slightest degree incommoded by heat smoke perceiving how greatly embarrassed pressed forward more eagerly than ever to attack however be fighting for life be astonishing how much men can do under such circumstance actually succeeded in keeping foe outside three wall finally after prolonged effort inspired with most profound sense of individual intrepidity retired carrying off dead wounded with made most daring attempt to carry off cutter also with in retreat fortunately be secured by chain attached to anchor latter being firmly embedded in soil among long grass idea of pulling up not seeming to present to of be compelled to abandon attempt owing to galling musketry fire maintained upon exhausted breathless with lip black with powder from bitten end of cartridge skin begrimed with smoke with perspiration streaming down body now have moment breathing space to look about ground inside battery literally bristled with spear have be launched at marvellous to relate only three of number have be hurt in recent scuffle that very slightly injury such a be be promptly attended to at same time doing what must for poor old mildmay gun musket be re loaded then placing look out at angle of battery sank down upon ground snatched hasty meal a be possible under circumstance embraced opportunity afforded by interval of tranquillity to point out to small command necessity for placing upon short allowance of food reminded at conclusion of meal be then discussing only one clear day ration must remain to that though french boat have doubtless made good escape down river in case must probably reach creek early enough that same evening to make captain vernon acquainted with critical situation must scarcely reckon upon appearance of relief expedition under twenty four hour from time of speaking added that further must be only wise to allow twenty four hour for possible unforeseen delay rendering not improbable that must have to pas forty eight hour in present position have therefore decided for prudential reason that must be necessary to place party for period on half ration men accepted decision of mine with utmost readiness in fact seemed agreeably surprised to find considered likely must be rescued in so short time by time that have concluded hasty meal barrack after notwithstanding size be mere wooden shell of place have become shapeless heap of smouldering ruin be consequently to great extent relieved of annoyance from heat smoke now that place be actually destroyed be glad rather than otherwise for standing a did so close to battery must have remained in existence have afforded splendid cover for enemy behind must have be enabled to steal close up to unobserved necessitating most unremitting watch in spite of sudden unexpected rush might have put in possession of battery now however nothing in nature of surprise must well occur for by destruction of barrack be enabled to obtain uninterrupted view from battery over diminutive islet upon stood hour after conclusion of meal wind dropped away to flat calm sun went down behind low range of hill stretched away to westward of landscape assumed tint of rapidly deepening pervading grey mist wreath rose from bosom of whirling river stealthily gathered about island like beleaguering army of phantom solemn hush of night be broken only by loud chirr of insect lapping ripple of rushing stream thicker thicker gathered mist about until at last became impossible to see across from one side of battery to other then ensued anxious time indeed for of especially so for upon whom rested responsibility of directing what step must be taken for safety preservation of little force under must native attempt attack night under cover of fog thought highly probable that must seeing how important advantage must be to to have power of arranging force creeping up to very wall of battery undetected idea indeed occurred to that under cover of same fog might be possible for to take once more to cutter letting drift with current in way slip unobserved away down river very few minute consideration of scheme sufficed to convince of impracticability felt convinced that enemy be quite shrewd enough to anticipate make due provision for such attempt on part felt certain indeed must fog lift for moment of however there be not most remote probability must find completely hemmed in by cordon of canoe lying silently patiently in waiting for undertaking of such attempt on part doubtless arrangement be so framed that in event of making such attempt simple signal must announce whereabouts enable entire flotilla to close in at once upon in case fate must be certain speedy decided risk be altogether too great prospect of success too infinitesimal to justify such attempt then a to expected attack must probably wait hour two in hope of tempting to venture afloat then failing that must cautiously close in upon island land steal up a close a possible to battery then endeavour to overpower with sudden rush fortunately be not absolutely dark notwithstanding fog there being moon in first quarter though invisible imparted certain luminous quality to haze two three star of first magnitude be faintly visible in zenith so that if fighting have to be done must at least have light enough to distinguish between friend foe anticipation of attempted surprise of course necessitated maintenance of keen incessant look out accordingly posted half small command round wall with instruction to fire unhesitatingly at moving object might come within range of vision did not expect immediate attack indeed more weighed chance of such thing le did appear to be in meantime be in urgent need of water stock being almost exhausted hitherto have refrained from drinking river water having peculiar sweetish taste scarcely suited palate very soon must be river water nothing thought that probably pause of expectation a be must afford a good opportunity a be likely to have for refilling breaker therefore directed party who be not engaged upon sentry duty to make ready for trip to river with two of empty breaker before engaging so large portion of little force in expedition though of briefest might expose to great because unexpected danger resolved to reconnoitre ground in person with object in view slipped noiselessly over parapet to ground outside throwing at full length upon grass already wet with heavy dew commenced slow disagreeable journey to water side intended at first to take look at cutter en passant moment thought decided against course being just possible might find few savage already established in possession keeping stealthy watch upon boat in readiness to pounce upon incautious white man who might venture to approach accordingly set out in direction about at right angle to must have led down to boat though entailed considerably longer journey regarded a also very much safer one after somewhat long tedious journey long be to say in point of time though distance traversed be very short reached water edge without adventure without having seen slightest sign indicating presence of savage upon island therefore hastened back to battery narrowly escaping being shot by one of people who in excessive alertness fired upon without first giving challenge hastily gathering together watering party led to brink of river succeeded in securing couple of breaker of water considered must be sufficient to last for next twenty four hour then ensued long period of tense incessant painful watching for enemy who anticipated might make appearance at moment hour after hour dragged laggingly away whole force kept incessantly on qui vive to guard against expected attempt at surprise men wearied out by excessive exertion of previous day needing continuous uninterrupted round of visit from to prevent falling asleep upon arm thus long night at length wore away faint glimmer of dawn appeared in eastern sky rapidly brightening fog assumed rosy flush presently up rose glorious sun gleaming like white hot ball through haze faint breeze from westward sprang up mist rolled away like curtain there lay noble river around sparkling like sheet of molten silver under morning sunbeam there too lay flotilla of canoe completely hemming in on side thus fully justifying caution have prevented attempting to effect escape down river during preceding night be exasperating now to last degree to know that night rest have be thrown away for nothing that for benefit vigilance have be to hand might just a well have lain down gone to sleep night repining be of use have naturally expected attack have held ourselves in readiness to meet only thing remained be to snatch what rest must during day be great advantage to be able to once more see enemy a there seemed to be immediate disposition on part to make move gave order for breakfast to be got under weigh a speedily a possible stationing look out at angle of battery during discussion of meal have scarcely settled when alarm be given that canoe be advancing leaping to foot found that such be indeed case whole fleet having tripped anchor begun paddling in toward island at once opened fire upon from nine pounder a matter of course rascal have not only learned wisdom have also evidently very sharp eye for at moment when match be about to be applied to gun canoe immediately in line of fire smartly swerved from course shot went hissing harmlessly past missing mark by merest hair breadth before have time to load again savage have effected landing upon beach then ensued repetition of previous day fighting excepting that antagonist fought with energy renewed by quiet night rest more obstinately than ever whilst be weary fagged by long fruitless watch during desperate struggle consumed next quarter of hour half dozen native managed at different time to actually force way into battery luckily for got in only one at time be promptly despatched at last be beaten off compelled to retire to canoe a before carrying away with killed wounded of whom counted le than thirty being borne away by comrade lad freshening way for with hot musketry fire so long a remained within range then followed brief interval during finished scanty breakfast after having seen gun musket loaded afresh undertook to maintain look out ordered men to lie down snatch such rest a must get foe wily a savage always be have evidently in recent hand to hand struggle with detected evidence of extreme fatigue be by mean disposed to allow much time opportunity to recuperate exhausted energy for men have scarcely flung upon ground where sleep instantly seized upon when canoe be once more put in motion again unhappy blue jacket be called upon to resist attack now began to feel strong suspicion that enemy have quite counted upon being kept upon alert during whole of previous night perfect silence have maintained being a very probably surmised rather harassing than reassuring circumstance to that fully intended to take fullest possible advantage of during ensuing day heavy loss in killed wounded have at same time made increasingly wary for next hour two contented with continuous series of demonstration drew fire kept incessantly on alert without actually renewing attack at length wind dropped away to flat calm ray of unclouded sun beat remorselessly down upon with fierce intensity in exhausted condition be positive agony burning unquenchable thirst took possession of men resorted to water keg so incessantly that water diminished with startling rapidity foreseeing possible difficulty of obtaining further supply be at last reluctantly compelled to put upon allowance so that very speedily have thirst added to other misery during time aching eye be moment directed down river in hope grew le le a day wore on of detecting approach of boat felt certain be on way to effect rescue chapter twenty rescued finally long harassing anxious day drew to close sun set night mist gathered once more about hoped for rescue have not appeared be by time completely worn out foresaw unless men must obtain little rest pertinacious enemy must inevitably prove victorious of course in matter of rest everything depended upon behaviour of foe if from principle superstition for other reason be invariable habit to abstain from fighting at night might yet be well with for though stock of provision water be getting low ammunition for musket be getting short felt convinced that must lad secure three tour hour of unbroken rest be quite equal to holding battery for twenty four hour at least unfortunately knew nothing whatever about fighting custom of native be consequently quite without guide of kind beyond own reason felt convinced that black have fully realised advantage to of fagged condition during past day have little doubt that be acute enough to trace to correct source question then be must allow to pas undisturbed night thus sacrifice important advantage greatly doubted might allow few hour cessation of hostility in hope of lulling into feeling of false security thus making victim of easy yet well executed more thought about matter more probable did course of action appear at last resolved to put to test by dividing men into watch allowing hour sleep at time before doing thought must repeat experiment of previous night endeavour to secure little more water did with such signal success that actually refilled breaker besides giving man opportunity to completely slake thirst be just eight o'clock pm by time that have completed preparation then made men lie down did falling instantly asleep of course necessitated increased vigilance on part of watcher of whom have to guard double length of parapet first hour passed peacefully away sleeper be awakened in order that might have turn be really amusing notwithstanding gravity of situation to hear man protest a sat up rubbed eye that have not treated fairly that have only that moment fallen asleep when assured to contrary roused up at once be greatly gratified to see short a have be period of rest have undoubtedly done world of good watch on deck be placed under command of man tom who have done such good service with carronade on board cutter being in opinion most trustworthy man in party giving most stringent order to keep bright look out to fire at once unhesitatingly on moving object might make appearance to call in event of anything taking place out of common flung upon ground with back to sod parapet in act of folding arm across chest fell asleep to be cruelly awakened next instant almost before have have time to fully realise blessedness of gift of sleep well tom what be have enemy hove in sight exclaimed pettishly rubbing away at eye to force open sir everything still quiet thank god then what did wake for in heaven name four bell sir turn for spell of sleep again sir be exasperating reply four bell nonsense must not believe a in case of others really seemed a though have not actually have time to get to sleep at yet have slept soundly for hour on staggering to foot though abrupt awakening have inflicted upon positive suffering found when fairly awake be very distinctly better for short nap seemed to have made up at least partially in soundness what lacked in duration hour passed peacefully time not quite so laggingly away turn again arrived for rest once more did enjoy for brief space bliss of perfect oblivion at midnight be called again tom reporting that sight sound have occurred during watch to disturb now began to feel really refreshed during next hour of men in watch actually found superfluous energy enough to hum under breath snatch two of forecastle song a paced vigilantly to fro over short stretch of ground constituted beat a silent hour flitted away without disquieting sight sound of kind began to feel sanguine that be going to be blessed with uninterrupted peace for remainder of night inwardly resolved that if matter still continued satisfactory after watch have have next hour sleep must extend period of sleep to two hour for next watch with what have already have ought to put in excellent trim for fatigue of succeeding day might be with resolve still uppermost in mind laid down once more dropped to sleep when turn came at one o'clock be two o'clock arrived watch be called still there have be sign of enemy thought might now safely reckon upon being allowed to pas remainder of night undisturbed accordingly informed retiring watch that unless happened to be attacked in interim must now be allowed to sleep for spell of two hour instead of one forthwith composed for good long nap be not to be hour later one of men startled into instant wakefulness by sharply giving challenge be instantly repeated round battery peering anxiously into fog detected indistinct presence of several shapeless object lying prone upon ground where knew that nothing of kind ought to be object be quite motionless man who have first given challenge assured that attention have first be attracted to by stealthy movement ordering man to at once rouse sleeper cautioning individually to take up proper station noiselessly behind parapet waited until man have gained post then taking steady aim at one of object discharged musket with shriek of pain object at have fired half raised to erect position then fell heavily forward at same moment loud blood curdling yell resounded upon heavy night air foggy background instantly became alive with form of savage who sprang to foot came bounding toward battery hurling spear a came take steady aim men select mark bring down man if possible keep cool now ah be hit exclaimed a spear came whizzing in over parapet passing clean through fleshy part of right thigh in excitement of moment did not take second to relieve myself of unpleasant encumbrance by drawing spear shaft right through wound next moment found engaged with rest in resisting hottest most determined assault to have hitherto be subjected luckily for battery be only small affair party be therefore large enough to take pretty good care of otherwise that night attack must have ended business men have now have benefit refreshment of three hour sound sleep fought with such renewed energy such dogged determination that assault again failed savage be once more driven off satisfied for time being have deferred attack until early hour of morning doubtless hoping to find worn out with ceaseless watching perchance at length overcome with sleep instead of that have be found more alert than ever in anxiety to take unawares have rather overdone in fact result be that left undisturbed for short remainder of night there be however no more rest for after well planned attempt at surprise dare not allow of small party to again go off duty sunrise found still anxiously watching for attack when mist at length cleared away discovered hostile canoe still closely hemming in now seemed to have tired of fruitless effort to take battery by assault have apparently made up mind to try effect of regular siege be bad enough for provision though husbanded with utmost care be only sufficient to allow mere mouthful for two meal during day to be spared fatigue of constantly fighting be something to be grateful for felt certain that relief expedition must appear before lapse of many hour longer consequently sat down to scanty morning meal not only with excellent appetite also in very fair spirit considering what have lately be called upon to endure meal over next devoted attention to wounded of whom there be by time several did what must to make a comfortable a possible about hour after sunrise little air from eastward sprang up by nine be be blowing quite free breeze though certainly refreshed greatly be in pleasing contrast to suffocating heat of day before be rather sorry to see for knew combined with current must seriously retard advance of friend up river to tell truth be getting to be trifle anxious about matter must not at understand why be that have be left to take care of ourselves so long if french boat have reached creek in safety must doubtless arrive about ten eleven pm few hour only after establishment of ourselves upon island forty hour thereabouts have elapsed since then yet there be sign of help must be possible that frenchman have not escaped after in case might have to wait day even couple of day for thought scarcely probable that captain vernon must take alarm on instant of becoming overdue be anxiously weighing surmise in mind endeavouring to arrive at fair reasonable estimate of longest possible time might still be expected to hold out when look out men raised simultaneous cheer followed by joyous shout of boat boat here come hurrah with one bound reached parapet sure enough at distance of only three quarter of mile away just sweeping fairly into view from behind next island below launch pinnace second cutter of daphne appeared with ensign streaming in breeze quick flashing oar blade bayonet of jolly gleaming brightly in sun up lad give cheer just to let know where be exclaimed exultantly at word up scrambled whole of little party except poor old mildmay who be too seriously hurt to move without assistance from top of parapet sent echoing down to upon wing of breeze three such ringing cheer a must have assured of sincerity of delight at appearance a sound reached boat saw officer rise in stern sheet wave cap to in response oar blade flashed quicker in sun foam gathered in increasing volume under bow of boat a crew put on extra spurt presently flash puff of fleecy smoke started out simultaneously from boat boom of three report came dull heavy to against opposing breeze of course fully expected that mere appearance of boat must suffice to put sable enemy to flight nothing of kind happened on contrary canoe resolutely faced new comer evinced very decided disposition to dispute passage up river must beat to certainty one in sober sens must for moment doubt in meantime if actually came to hand to hand tussle between white black in battery who have already have so many opportunity of observing perfect fearlessness knew very well that latter must make matter decidedly difficult unpleasant for friend be time just then for cogitation moment for decisive action have arrived forthwith took necessary step to enable party to do share of work in hand will do lad exclaimed a men on parapet paused to recover breath have expended in vociferous greeting to boat jump down man gun load double shot tom place remainder of fuze in magazine in such way that will do work effectually when required will give canoe broadside just to freshen way show that be in earnest then will abandon blow up battery previous to shoving off to join lad yonder men turned to with will gun be loaded then went with tom to personally inspect arrangement of fuze when be ready gave word to fire six gun belched forth content simultaneously without waiting to see what damage have be done men seized musket water keg few other belonging with two hand specially detailed to convey master carefully down to boat hand excepting tom left battery made best of way down to cutter after depositing poor old mildmay a comfortably a possible in stern sheet got afloat step mast shouted see ready for hoisting sail waited patiently until saw that everything be ready on board cutter then tom ignited fuze in three magazine be awfully risky work a fuze be fearfully short have to be done be done coolly smartly after bounded over low parapet ran for life down to boat shove off give way for life men panted a tumbled in over gunwale with considerable loss of shin leather in instant be surging away from island a fast a oar sail must drive men be just belaying halliard of lug when boom dull heavy report came from battery great black cloud of smoke dust liberally intermixed with clod stone mass of earth shot up into air when cleared away battery be gone now tom jump forward man get carronade loaded with grape canister langridge anything happen to have handy be smart about fine fellow exclaimed a saw group of canoe separate from rest form in line across course evidently for purpose of opposing passage preventing effecting junction with friend load musket men draw cutlass must get through line of canoe somehow mean to do men obeyed without word blood be by time thoroughly aroused be quiver with eager excitement a looked at sitting there upon thwart facing forward with naked cutlass beside loaded musket firmly grasped in hand finger just feeling trigger teeth clenched eye flashing felt that nothing short of frigate with crew at quarter must stop rescuing party be by time smartly engaged with main body of canoe by tardy progress knew that already have hand fully occupied detachment have assumed responsibility of intercepting have separated distance from main body be now formed in double line right across course altering position from time to time in such manner a to keep always square ahead of saw that must be useless to attempt to dodge have not time for so directed coxswain to steer straight for broadside of midship canoe craft be to say occupied centre of opposing line be biggish craft for canoe being somewhere about fifty foot long manned by forty negro canoe lay on starboard side beyond being about same size there be sixteen more canoe in line altogether presented appearance of very formidable barrier have have opportunity of learning pretty well what be when smellie bound hand foot took memorable cruise up river in one of knew that be after very crank flimsy fragile affair not to be compared for moment in strength with stout boat carried at gallant pace over swirling river so determined to give foolhardy opponent stem trusting to weight momentum of boat to enable to break through line on rushed cutter breeze roaring merrily over broad lag sail dragging at like team of cart horse whilst tom crouched in bow squinting along sight of piece holding in readiness to fire at instant that must get order be within hundred foot of line of canoe when crew of big craft began to see danger have hoped by persistent demonstration of barring path to intimidate now that be too late saw that have failed that meant mischief setting up loud yell of consternation plied paddle desperately in effort to avoid impending collision be unavailing canoe ahead astern of confused like only imperfectly comprehending what comrade must be at closed in upon instead of separating from immediate dire confusion be result when within twenty yard of delivered content of carronade immediate outburst of groan yell shriek bore testimony to accuracy of aim before smoke have fairly cleared away cutter be upon big canoe nearest have be torn nearly in half by discharge of carronade swept over almost without feeling other big fellow be however afloat apparently uninjured yell of terror went up from occupant a sail overshadowed there be violent shock a strong iron bound stem crashed down upon gunwale canoe heeled over cutter leaped upward a crushed way through over second adversary for few second be involved in confused medley of canoe wreckage of drowning savage wildly clutching at gunwale of boat in ineffectual effort to save there be rattling volley of musketry flash two of cutlas blade then away sped cutter once more be through carronade be quickly loaded again happily further destruction of human life be unnecessary savage who seemed to have depended implicitly upon power of detached squadron to stop became demoralised when saw cutter dash irresistibly through opposing line receiving at same time very severe treatment at hand of rescuing party broke up suddenly beat precipitate retreat canoe seemingly striving to outdo rest in speed of flight thus ended victoriously for fight have be for over forty hour maintaining against such apparently overwhelming odds soon found alongside launch hearty be congratulation eager question be showered upon by crew quickly repeated by of other two boat joined in almost immediately afterwards seem to have be in rather bad fix exclaimed armitage who be in command of boat a shook heartily by hand tell about detailed a succinctly a possible have transpired since departure from ship wound up by suggestion that if have spare ration must be most acceptable ration exclaimed armitage to be sure have boy let adjourn to island of yours where can get properly cooked feel curious to see spot held so pluckily for so long time by by where be french boat time french boat have not turned up at creek exclaimed in surprise felt certain of escape indeed depended upon information must convey of predicament for despatch of assistance have not put in appearance up to time of starting at noon yesterday have seen sign of during passage up stream be reply be due to return know evening before last when yesterday morning came without appearance captain vernon became uneasy allowed until noon however when noon passed leaving still non est came to conclusion that something be amiss despatched in quest of at once so be scene of struggle eh a boat grounded on beach of island pretty scene of ruin be so be battery have be completely obliterated by explosion nothing remaining to mark site scattered fragment of sod wall dismounted gun charred remains of barrack short distance away aiding to complete picture of destruction immense number of native spear be lying scattered about over ground be promptly collected by seaman a souvenir of struggle chapter twenty one awful catastrophe meanwhile spaniard be still lying perdu on board hulk a have remained from moment of driving out battery during discussion of much needed meal question of what step must take with regard to have be canvassed appetite at length satisfied armitage walked across island to make closer inspection of position of craft have wondered greatly at odd time during protracted struggle with savage how spaniard have managed to transfer so rapidly from barrack to hulk large number of slave former must have contained now riddle be solved on arriving abreast of hulk found that small timber jetty have be constructed from shore to point within fifty yard of hulk must see in moment that by easing off mooring of hulk current must carry fairly alongside jetty where without doubt must have be lying when first hove in sight slave have evidently be marched straight on board over jetty bow stern mooring then hove in until have be hauled far enough away from jetty to render capture by mean impossible after little further conversation with armitage be agreed that spaniard must be hailed ordered to surrender be accordingly done have very great hope of success a felt sure spaniard must be fully aware of difficulty must experience in capturing hulk a before stated towered so high out of water side be so bare that spaniard small a be number must effectually resist effort to capture by boarding to fire into sink must only result in destruction of slave on board a be moored with heavy chain instead of hemp hawser to cut adrift let ground upon island be quite a impracticable a must have be attempt to board be therefore very agreeably surprised when spaniard in response to hail at once consented to abandon hulk provided must allow to depart unmolested in boat arrangement suited very well being just then anything anxious to hamper with prisoner required promise be unhesitatingly made spaniard thereupon provisioned boat lowered into water hour later disappeared round bend of river on way down stream taking immediate possession of hulk dropped in alongside jetty once more landed slave upon island be for wonder in fairly good condition having evidently be well taken care of with view of fitting a thoroughly a possible to withstand terrible hardship of notorious middle passage having at length cleared hulk next transferred slave in batch to boat by be conveyed across stream to mainland where be freed left to shift for provision found on board hulk being distributed a evenly a possible among landed thus in possibly hostile country for be evidently different race of people from with whom have recently have so desperate struggle unarmed with only small supply of provision situation be perhaps not very much better than have be when lay prisoner on board hulk be have in power to do for under circumstance must only hope that wit must prove equal to task of steering clear of many danger to be exposed conducting safely back to own country there be rather more than eight hundred of altogether counting in piccaninny transfer of to mainland fully occupied until within hour of sunset a be by time pretty well fagged out a be manifestly too late to make progress worth speaking of on way back to creek night resolved to remain until daylight upon island did without receiving molestation annoyance of kind from anybody at eight o'clock on following morning having previously breakfasted started down river keeping bright look out for french boat way down exploring most likely creek indentation on south bank of river without discovering trace of protracted search so seriously delayed progress that be two whole day making passage back to creek on arrival there discovered that three survivor of french party have turned up on board vestale previous day reporting capture of boat by native massacre of hand except three who have managed somehow to slip bond make good escape in canoe have reported that capture be due to abandonment of appeared insinuation captain vernon have indignantly repudiated have occasioned very serious outbreak of ill feeling between two ship so much so indeed that commander of vestale have left river in high dudgeon on morning of day of arrival refusing absolutely to co operate with further be of course subjected to very severe cross examination by captain vernon on subject detailed narrative of affair be confirmed in particular by poor old mildmay soon satisfied that fault if fault there be rested not with mildmay be fully exonerated from blame nay more master generously represented defence of battery in such light received skipper highest commendation renewed promise of support assistance in career at sunrise next morning weighed stood out to sea bound on cruise to westward next two month passed away in most drearily uneventful manner ship being at sea whole time at end of period being in latitude degree south longitude degree east on way back to congo ship standing to northward eastward at time under plain sail with light baffling south easterly air look out aloft just before being relieved at noon reported two sail close together hove to broad on lee bow usual form of question being duly put by armitage who happened to be officer of watch further information be elicited that one of be brig other full rigged ship of what nationality be be difficult to say nothing head of topgallant sail being visible above horizon from fore topmast crosstrees matter being reported to captain vernon order be given for course to be so altered a to allow of edging down upon stranger fact of being hove to so close together having somewhat suspicious appearance by three o'clock pm have neared two vessel sufficiently to bring hull into view from main royal yard be then lying broadside on to with head to eastward ship being between brig by aid of glass be able to make out that have apparently dropped alongside other skipper gave a decided opinion that foul play be going on on part of one other of two craft opinion be shortly afterwards confirmed by appearance of thick cloud of black smoke arising from ship brig hauling off standing to westward under stitch of canvas must spread undoubtedly most daring act of piracy committed under very nose too commented skipper to a smoke rose up into clear atmosphere hung like great pall immediately over doomed ship be walking together fore aft upon quarter deck at time whistling most earnestly devoutly for wind a indeed be hand fore aft suddenly captain vernon paused wetting back of hand held up to air wind be failing remarked abruptly dived below to cabin at same moment noticed that corvette be heading three four point to eastward of course hard up with helm man exclaimed impatiently to man at wheel where be taking ship wheel be hard over sir explained poor fellow with patient deference be lost steerage way just then skipper returned to deck pipe away first second cutter mr hawkesley exclaimed sharply take charge of with one of midshipman to help pull down to burning ship a likely a not will find that similar trick have be played there to one by unfortunate man richards crew so nearly lost life let crew of boat take cutlass pistol with so a to be prepared in event of interference from brig crew make haste can first duty be to save crew next to save ship if possible glass be rising so there will be wind will do what can to shorten distance between brig yonder when have done be possible on board ship make dash for brig unless see recall signal flying three minute later two cutter be darting swiftly away over long glassy undulation of ground swell toward great cloud of smoke on horizon served a beacon for men pulling long steady stroke whilst sent boat through water at very fair pace must be maintained for three four hour at least be scarcely mile away from daphne when have rest of boat in water ahead of towing whilst dangling from yard arm aloft must be seen hammock bag of shot suspended there to assist by swinging motion imparted to by rise fall of vessel over swell ship progress through water brig be hull down to from steadiness with head be kept pointing to westward conjectured that be either sweeping being towed by boat sun set in perfectly clear cloudless sky just a have brought ship hull up by time be mass of flame fore aft began to fear that must be too late to save crew to do good whatever on board kept steadily on however reached hour later three mast went over side when be within cable length of burning ship on arriving within fifty foot of found impossible to approach nearer owing to intense heat be manifestly impossible that living thing must be in midst of fiercely flaming furnace so be compelled to content with merely ascertaining name of unfortunate craft with considerable difficulty at length made out to be highland chieftain of glasgow after left on pulling out clear of smoke glare of flame once more found to be about six mile distant from brig distance of about eleven mile intervening between daphne night have by time closed completely down upon deep clear violet sky above be thickly powdered with star be waveringly reflected in deep indigo of water beneath away to eastward broad disc of full moon be just rising clear of horizon casting long rippling wake of golden light from ocean rim clear down to first glance be of course in direction of daphne towering spread of canvas alternately appeared vanished a enormous idly flapping sail caught lost again with heave of vessel glint of golden moon beam save be dark still on board lantern flashed in rigging a recall signal so exultingly gave order for boat to be headed straight for brig determined to win if dash courage must do pull steadily lad cautioned a two crew bent back with ringing cheer started boat in racing style racing now can not afford strength for have will be wanted when get alongside chase be doubtless well manned with determined crew who will not give in without tough struggle so husband strength a much a possible mr peter to midshipman in charge of second cutter drop in wake sir if please see that men overtask men obediently eased down at once jogged steadily along at pace of about four knot hour eagerness soon got better of pace gradually increased have to constantly check must soon have be tearing away a fiercely a ever state of thing lasted for about hour then gleam of lantern suddenly appeared in daphne rigging be recall signal men gave audible vent to feeling of disappointment in involuntary groan never mind men said have doubt captain vernon have good reason for answer signal coxswain ah told so sloop have little breeze here come creeping up astern of step mast take cover off sail get canvas on boat do see that bright red star close to horizon coxswain starboard bit so steady now have fair over boat stem steer for will just drop alongside loop nicely without troubling to wait for breeze soon reached toying coyly with boat canvas at first gradually bellying out sail until at last went to sleep breeze be after merely gentlest of zephyr only just sufficient to give ship steerage way very fortunately for boat be provided by whim of poor austin with suit of enormous lateen sail made of light duck with yard of such length that have to be jointed in middle to enable to be stowed in boat be just thing for light air under persuasive influence be soon gliding smoothly through scarcely ruffled water quite a fast a men must have propelled with oar hour later slid handsomely up alongside sloop by time be slipping along at rate of about five knot under studding sail everything else must hold breath of wind boat be hoisted in without interruption to ship progress well mr hawkesley what news from burning ship exclaimed skipper a stepped up to to make report explained to state in have found vessel when reached gave name ah remarked well be bad job very bad business altogether can only hope may find crew uninjured on board brig when catch think be rather doubtful now run away down into cabin tell baines to give dinner expect everything will be cleared away in ward room by on descending to cabin found that skipper have be considerate enough to give order that nice little dinner must be ready for on return order having be carried out to letter be enabled to sit down in peace enjoy meal for long pull in boat have given most voracious appetite meal over being then watch below turned in on relieving mr armitage at midnight found that weather be still fine wind merest shade fresher than have be when left deck chase directly ahead about twelve mile distant upper canvas showing distinctly in brilliant ray of moon have gained upon about couple of mile during four hour have be below captain vernon who have be on deck during whole of previous watch be just about to retire for night be in high spirit confident in belief that if went well must make capture before sunset on following day best helmsman in watch be ordered to wheel made regular tour of deck taking extra pull at halliard here easing off inch so of brace that sheet in short doing everything possible to increase speed of ship so watch passed away daphne having crept couple of mile nearer to chase during interval thus matter went on until noon of following day when wind once more showed symptom of failing sky became overcast threatening change of weather have by time shortened distance between ourselves chase until space of only seven mile so separated everybody on board fore aft be in fever of impatience to get alongside brig glass have already assured be none other than notorious black venus have already proved so slippery customer that almost superstitious feeling have sprung up in breast with regard to felt that however closely might succeed in approaching however helplessly might seem to be in power there must be dependence upon appearance that until have absolutely succeeded in placing prize crew upon deck own crew in iron must not feel by mean certain that be ours hence extraordinary feeling of excitement impatience prevailed on board daphne on memorable afternoon about two o'clock wind changed be obliged to take in studding sail on port side get pull upon port brace meanwhile heavy bank of cloud have gathered in south western quarter be gradually working up against wind until by three o'clock pm sun be obscured entire heaven blotted out by huge murky mass of seething vapour be watch below like everybody else be much too excited to remain anywhere on deck to confess truth did not half like appearance of thing in general according to notion be about to experience one of sudden violent atmospheric change be so frequently met with in tropic yet there be ship with whole cloud of studding sail set on starboard side a well a other rag of canvas must be coaxed to do ounce of work if thought knowledge of weather be worth anything hand of will be pretty busy before long will be lucky indeed if lose of spar a well a acre two of flying kite up aloft there even forgot so far a to gently insinuate such possibility to mr armitage be so sharply snubbed for pain determined to interfere further whilst off duty to keep eye open be ready to lend hand whenever wherever required captain vernon be of course on deck from anxious way in from time to time glanced first at portentous sky overhead next at chase finally at immense spread of canvas felt sure that to extent shared apprehension at length after more than usually anxious glance round went to skylight took peep apparently at barometer be watching saw start take keen look at then suddenly dived down companion way into cabin to make closer inspection of a conjectured curiosity be aroused be walking aft to take look at instrument through skylight on own account when canvas suddenly flapped next second without further warning of description perfect tornado burst upon ship be taken flat aback over went bowing helplessly before irresistible strength of hurricane thought heard armitage voice shouting order of kind if such be case be impossible to distinguish word through deafening rush of wind completely swallowed up other sound a felt deck rapidly heeling under foot made desperate scrambling spring for nearest port on weather side for somehow seemed to realise instinctively that daphne brief career be ended that must never again recover must turn turtle altogether ominous word of rigger on day when in first flush of new born dignity went down to inspect craft be to be future home recurred to mind a vividly a though have moment be spoken felt that prophecy lurking behind be then in very act of fulfilment be fortunate enough to reach grasp one of gun tackle drawing up to windward by aid passed out through open port on to upturned weather side of ship where paused for moment to glance behind rather beneath will never forget sight then met gaze ship be lying over on beam end with lower yard arm deeply buried in sea whole of lee side of deck be submerged water be pouring in ton down open hatchway lee coaming of be already under water watch below must be seen ineffectually endeavouring to make way up on deck through opening rush of water down irresistibly drove back again at attempt a for watch on deck be already either swimming about in sea to leeward clinging convulsively to rigging whither few have instinctively betaken when ship first went over have time only for momentary glance sloop have hung stationary in position for just barest perceptible space of time then with sudden jar began to settle once more have time only to scramble breathlessly along wet slippery side on to bilge when rolled fairly over floated keel upwards a did so hideous shriek rang out from interior became audible even above awful rush of gale chapter twenty two abduction important capture for few moment felt bewildered stunned by awful suddenness of frightful catastrophe piercing shriek of despair too continued to issue from interior of vessel unmanned crouched there upon upturned bottom of fabric like one in dream felt that be dream disaster be too complete too unexpected to be real waited there frozen with horror anxiously looking for moment when must awake be released from dreadful nightmare sight of half dozen men battling for life in water to leeward of hull vainly struggling to reach main topgallant mast have gone at first stroke of hurricane having somehow broken adrift from topmast head now lay floating with attached few yard away brought sens back to abandoning precarious refuge sprang into sea assisted men one after other to reach floating spar a looked round in vain hope of discovering further survivor few more spar floated up to surface spare topmast studding sail boom two fore topgallant mast with royal mast yard sail attached finally hen coop with seven eight drowned fowl in at once took measure to secure knowing that only hope of ultimate escape very frail slender hope then appeared rested upon possibility of being able to construct raft with in attempt be fortunately successful sunset found established on small fairly substantial well constructed raft mustered seven hand told six seaman seven only out of entire crew so far be safe a looked first at frail structure supported then at boundless waste of angry sea by be environed upon be helplessly tossed to fro thought in haste that must have be better after if have shared fate of comrade now at rest in ocean grave beyond reach of suffering seemed only too surely to await then better thought came to reflected that whilst there be life there be hope that hand have be outstretched to preserve whilst others have be allowed to perish be also able to save to uttermost if such must be divine will be not duty to submit to will to endure patiently might be in store for assuredly be humbly bowed head in silent thanksgiving prayer thanksgiving for preservation so far prayer might be given strength patience to endure privation suffering might come to in future whilst constructing raft have be too busy to note more than bare fact that be being gradually perceptibly swept away from capsized hull of unfortunate daphne when work be at length completed have moment to look around first glance be directed to windward in search of wreck be nowhere to be seen have doubt that whilst have be so busily employed wreck have gradually settled deeper deeper into water until have gone down altogether most fortunately most providentially ought rather to say for tornado have be a brief in duration a have be disastrous in effect otherwise must never have hoped to survive in little more than ten minute from capsizing of sloop strength of hurricane be spent wind dropped to fresh working breeze of circumstance black venus promptly availed crew having undoubtedly observed disaster by bearing up standing to eastward under inch of canvas must spread first impression on witnessing manoeuvre be that animated by lingering spark of humanity in breast people be returning in quest of possible survivor hope be speedily extinguished by sight of brig sweeping to leeward passing at distance of about mile with crew busily engaged in operation of crowding sail upon vessel stood up waved to a passed have doubt that be seen notice be taken of soon swept out of sight to leeward hardly expected other result be consequently by mean discouraged at fresh instance of inhumanity indeed have taken into head to rescue be probable that lot among must have be little if better than be out there on open ocean drifting about upon tiny raft when night fell have have sufficient time to fully realise peril hopelessness of position think most of fully made up mind that be destined to lingering death from starvation unless indeed end must happen to be precipitated by springing up of gale equally fell disaster gloomy anticipation be destined to be speedily pleasantly dissipated for at dawn on following morning be agreeably surprised by sight of sail in northern quarter craft evidently heading directly for wind be blowing from westward at time five knot breeze weather be clear sea have gone down leaving nothing swell from blow of preceding day accordingly set to work unhesitatingly cut adrift one of smaller spar of raft be constructed hastily securing crazy fabric afresh reared spar on end with shirt only white one among lashed to upper extremity a signal hour followed be one of most agonising suspense must must not alter course before observing signal helmsman be not steering quite a steadily a might have done heart went into mouth cry of anguish involuntarily escaped lip time stranger showed tendency to luff to windward fall off to leeward of course at length however apprehension be set at rest for just a hull be rising above limited horizon saw sudden flash from side followed by puff of white smoke few second later sharp ringing report of gun came wafted down to then topgallant sail royal fluttered moment in cool morning breeze a be rapidly sheeted home mast headed hour later virginia yes there must be doubt about be latest prize there abaft main rigging stood well known figure of smellie virginia hove to close to windward of boat be lowered soon found standing safe sound on brig deck cynosure of eye somewhat bewildered recipient of former comrade eager question a for smellie with considerate kindness be always one of most prominent characteristic first gave order that half dozen hand rescued with must receive attention then carried off to own cabin rigged in jury suit of own clothes by way be several size too big for whilst own togs be drying then giving order for breakfast to be served in cabin at earliest possible moment sat down listened to story distress at loss of so many friend be keen sincere did not for moment obscure sound common sense few minute sufficed to give hasty outline of disaster to make acquainted with direction of drift during night have sooner ascertained than altered brig course a much a be necessary to take over scene of catastrophe at same time sending three hand aloft to keep sharp look out for wreckage other indication that be nearing spot especially for possible survivor hour later passed grating then spare studding sail boom then couple of hen coop close together after fragment of wreckage became increasingly frequent until reached spot where one of daphne boat be found floating with stern torn out of several hatch cover mizen topgallant mast sail three dead sheep wash deck tub other relic being in company after wreckage suddenly ceased have evidently passed over spot where daphne have gone down brig be immediately hove to boat despatched upon search expedition unhappily vain one for not sign of survivor must be found even dead body to must give decent christian burial melancholy fact at length indubitably established smellie gave order to make sail shaping course for congo whither felt sure black venus have made best of way crowding sail upon virginia made passage to river mouth in trifle over five day during last three of wind be light variable with anchoring in banana creek at two pm on fifth day from on have be picked up virginia having succeeded in completing complement of officer men at sierra leone half dozen picked up with have be acting a supernumerary on board whilst have simply be smellie guest be very much gratified therefore when invited to go with in boat on search expedition to ascertain if possible whereabouts of redoubtable black venus started in gig same afternoon a soon a ship be moored smellie being of opinion that must find object of quest snugly moored within creek below don manuel house where have seen on eventful evening when captured josefa creek being situate at distance up river be necessary that must make early start in order to be back on board before rising of evening mist reached creek in due course without adventure began cautiously to ascend mile after mile made way landing at extremity of reach carefully reconnoitring succeeding one before entering with boat search be in vain arrived at head of creek without finding single trace of brig indeed of other vessel being there be only natural that smellie must feel strong desire to see once more kind host gentle hostess who have so generously nursed entertained in time of sore need leaving boat at head of creek therefore in charge of coxswain with instruction to latter to fire couple of musket in rapid succession must presence be required in event of being inadvisable to make best of way along footpath up to house set out bright flush on smellie bronzed cheek joyous sparkle in eye eager spring in elastic footstep betraying plainly enough pleasurable anticipation occupied mind traversing path with rapid footstep soon reached palisading inclosed garden passed through gate found ourselves in sight of house there stood just a have last seen door window wide open muslin curtain at window waving idly in fitful breeze bamboo lounging chair one of overturned under verandah stepped briskly out warm work though have found breasting hill passed up main avenue leading to front door smellie keeping eye intently fixed upon said front door doubtless in hope of seeing dona antonia emerge of enjoying first glance of surprise delight of course have such inducement to look straight ahead glance therefore wandered carelessly here there to right left noting exquisite shape colour of flower fruit luxuriant foliage delightful shade of tree whilst thus engaged wandering thought be suddenly arrested by appearance of several large heavy footprint in sandy soil of footpath whilst be still idly wondering what visitor don manuel must have so recently have from whence must possibly have come eye lighted upon single drop of blood then then quite little line of blood drop be however only such a must result from trifling cut scratch so said nothing about little further on up pathway tall thorny shrub thrust branch somewhat obtrusively over border of path one of twig good stout one be broken hung to parent branch by scrap of bark only curiosity prompted to pause for moment to examine twig then saw that one of thorn be similarly broken point being stained with blood still scarcely dry solved riddle someone passing hastily have evidently be caught by thorn rather severely scratched few pace further on shred of white muslin hung from bush began to fear that dona antonia have be sufferer beaching house walked unceremoniously in delighted at idea of surprise must give friend proceeding to parlour usual sitting room found empty with to great surprise table one two chair capsized torn scarf lying on floor other evidence of struggle of sort sight brought abruptly to stand still on threshold smellie looking at other inquiringly a though must ask other what must be meaning of then with quick stride companion passed in before glanced round room uttered low exclamation of horror at once followed glanced in direction indicated by smellie outstretched finger there behind door lay body of poor pedro face downwards on floor little pool of coagulating blood being just visible on matting beneath forehead quickly stooping turned over on back be quite dead though not yet cold cause of death being clearly indicated by small bullet wound fair in centre of forehead thought flew back in instant to night on last stood under same roof to attempted abduction of dona antonia conviction at once seized upon that be now looking upon piece of senor madera work same thought evidently struck smellie for turned to exclaimed breathlessly dona antonia where can be without waiting for answer dashed into passage began calling loudly antonia antonia mia where be darling be harold then receiving answer shouted alternately for
