since ' to throw off spanish yoke be great admirer of england english institution english form of government despite imperfection considered to be most admirable form of government in existence be predilection for thing english that have induced to send son carlos over to england nine year prior to date of opening of story to be educated at dulwich first of in preparatory school afterwards in

father establishment year ago however singleton senior have died leaving only son without near relation in world jack mother having died during infancy since then jack a dominant partner in firm have be allowed to do pretty much a pleased not that took unwise advantage of freedom very far from clearly realised that father being dead there be now more stringent necessity than ever for to become master of detail of business far from taking thing easy have be working so hard that of late health have shown sign of giving way at moment when make acquaintance be in london for purpose of consulting specialist during progress of luncheon there have be a be to be expected brisk crossfire of question answer between two young men in course of montijo have learned among other thing that friend jack have be ordered by specialist to leave business very severely alone for time to come if possible to treat to at least six month complete change of air scene occupation fortunately so happens said jack that position in firm will enable to do very well since murdock other partner be have be since father death actual manager of business a have be with for nearly thirty year know that there be to know about need assistance from also have at last completed submarine have be pet project for almost a long a can remember now that need be opportunity to try indeed for oxley strict injunction to to cut business altogether must certainly spend holiday in putting boat to complete series of very much more thorough exhaustive test than have thus far be possible a be really be at almost complete loss how to spend six month holiday do mean to say that have plan demanded montijo a friend rose from table to leave restaurant none of most vague hazy description possible answered singleton oxley order be change of scene work life in open air be therefore endeavouring to weigh respective merit of cruise in old tub lalage big game shooting somewhere in central africa of seems to appeal to very strongly cutter be old slow while a for shooting project really seem to have necessary energy for such undertaking in present state of health look here jack observed montijo eagerly a slid hand within friend arm pair wheeled westward toward hyde park believe have very scheme to suit will expound to presently when get into park can talk freely without risk of being overheard meanwhile what be that be saying just now about submarine remember of course that be always thinking talking about submarine while be at dulwich also that once made model tested in pond dived so effectually that unless subsequently recovered must be at bottom of pond still ay answered jack with laugh remember ill fated model never recovered nevertheless served purpose for mishap gave first really useful idea in connection with design of submarine boat at last have completed working model thus far have answered exceedingly well be only small affair know five foot in diameter by twenty five foot long be big enough to accommodate two men even three at pinch have be a deep a ten fathom in have doubt must descend to twice depth while have underwater speed of twenty knot can maintain for five hour by jove be splendid very much better than anything that anyone else have done thus far exclaimed montijo admiringly ought to make fortune with boat of sort be pining for opportunity to subject to thoroughly practical test well scheme will explain in full when get into park will enable to do be so commented jack then that alone must very strongly predispose in favour of why make secret of old chap be of character that passer by catching few word of must be likely to hand over to nearest policeman a couple of conspirator well be scarcely so bad a answered montijo laughing be of such nature must prefer not to speak of if mind until be somewhere in park where can converse freely without fear of being overheard see pater be pretty well known to not too well liked by spanish authority in cuba be by mean certain that may not think quite worth while to have watched over here therefore yes of course understand returned jack therefore for present mum word eh montijo nodded two lad strode along conversing upon various topic until reached hyde park corner swung in through park gate so on to grass ah now at last can speak freely remarked montijo with sigh of relief first of singleton continued must understand that what be about to say will be spoken in strictest confidence whether must agree to proposal not must ask to pledge honour a gentleman that will not repeat single word of what say to anyone anyone mind without first obtaining consent that of pater right carlos boy answered singleton cheerily promise vow that ask there be nobody on face of earth of ours who can keep secret better than can a ought to know by time yes do know perfectly well agreed montijo well continued fact be that pater have at last begun to interest ourselves actively in cuban politics cuban a perhaps know have be trying ever since ' to induce spaniard to govern mildly justly thus far effort have be fruitless be still being ground down tyrannised over until life of many of have become burden property liberty life of cuban be safe to day unless be well known to be supporter of spanish government after more than quarter of century of patient ineffectual effort therefore have be determined to take up arm strike blow for liberty never rest until cuba be free from hated spanish yoke be in connection with movement that pater be now in england be now nearly year since senor marti man who above others have be conspicuous in effort on behalf of cuba got hold of pater succeeded in convincing that be duty of cuban to do utmost to free country from grasp of tyrant one of first fruit of be giving of order by pater through friend for construction of fast steam yacht to be used a may be required in service of country primarily for purpose of smuggling arm ammunition necessary of kind into island now by singular coincidence friend agent of pater chose firm a must build yacht now having be advised that be ready for delivery what exclaimed singleton surely mean to say that number be boat yes answered montijo quietly be number by be at present known believe then carlos dear boy accept most hearty congratulation exclaimed singleton naval constructor have let go fairly outdone over craft be difficult task that gave to do when asked for boat of not le than three hundred ton on eight foot draught of water with sea speed of twenty two knot have done result be that have in number prettiest little boat that ever swam why man have already done twenty four knot over measured mile on full draught of water in fairly heavy sea be very sweetest sea boat that be possible to imagine of course must not have done have not boldly adopted new fashioned turbine principle for engine work to perfection even when be running at full speed one can scarcely feel tremor in be delighted to receive so excellent account of answered montijo so will pater be when tell rather when tell for singleton want to promise that will dine with to night make pater acquaintance be very dearest old chap that ever met own father of course excepted will be enchanted to make acquaintance already know well enough by name to speak of a jack ' will do so with pleasure answered singleton heartily have other engagement after one have be to theatre concert night for week a have one begin to wish for change while wish to flatter carlos boy if father be anything like be jolly good sort will be glad to know have run somewhat off track have understood that have sort of proposal to make yes answered montijo have let see what be talking about oh yes yacht well now that be built be in something of difficulty concerning difficulty did not suggest to of until quite recently that difficulty be difficulty of ownership have be built for service of cuba somebody must be acknowledged owner if be admitted to be property of pater of marti in fact of cuban will at once become object of suspicion to spanish government movement will be so jealously watched that will become difficult almost to verge of impossibility for to render of service for be specially intended see that jack certainly answered singleton be obvious to meanest intellect a somebody once remarked how do propose to get over difficulty there be only one way that pater can see out of answered montijo be to get somebody who be not likely to incur spanish suspicion to accept nominal ownership of yacht under pretence of using simply for own pleasure phew whistled singleton may be right for other fellow how will be for for scheme to work satisfactorily must not only find man who will throw heart soul into cause also one whose honesty be proof against temptation to appropriate to yacht will cost not far short of forty thousand pound for must remember that unless yacht paper be absolutely in order apparent ownership unimpeachable will be no good at must be so far at least a documentary evidence go indisputable property of supposititious man of whom have be speaking that being case there will be nothing own inherent honesty to prevent from taking absolute possession of doing exactly a plea with even to selling must be so minded now where be going to find man whom can trust to extent know be sure answered montijo at least did until met jack if be willing to be man oh nonsense dear fellow interrupted jack wo do at know why not asked montijo be because care to interfere in cuban affair thought that perhaps a be obliged to take longish holiday with change of scene interest outdoor life so on must rather enjoy excitement enjoy echoed singleton dear fellow enjoy ' be not word must simply revel in more because sympathy be wholly with cuban while rather firm have old grudge against spaniard who once played very dirty trick of however need say nothing just now be not that be well what be demanded montijo seeing that jack paused hesitatingly so near a can put answered jack be father doe know from adam only know a much a learned of during time that be together at dulwich how then can possibly tell must behave on square with how can tell that after having be put into legal possession of yacht must not order father ashore forbid to ever set foot upon deck again montijo laughed joyously never mind how know jack answered do know be enough if be not sufficiently convincing argument for here be will admit that in order to avoid difficulty have pointed out must trust somebody must very well now say that there be man in world whom must so implicitly trust a therefore ask a very great favour to come into affair with will just nicely fill up six month holiday for whole affair will be over in six month le give jolly exciting time a may never again meet with during rest of life now what do say to say that pater must be consulted before matter be allowed to go further answered jack can mention to between now to night if like if idea be agreeable to can discus after dinner reminds that have not yet mentioned place hour of meeting be staying at cecil dine at seven sharp answered montijo go yet old chap unless be boring be do remember once punching head at dulwich for trifling misdemeanour asked jack laughingly a linked arm in of montijo very well then if talk like will compel to do again do know carlos scheme of yours be rapidly exercising subtle singularly powerful fascination over even if father must hesitate to entrust boat to feel very like asking to let take hand in game just for fun of thing what splendid opportunity must afford for testing power of submarine oh by jove think must go one way two young men wandered about park for nearly hour longer discussing matter eagerly even going so far a to make certain tentative plan then separated went respective way with understanding that be to meet again at cecil jack be putting up at morley hotel in trafalgar square nearest way back to be of course down piccadilly a passed out through park gate suddenly bethought of certain purchase that wished to make at army navy store accordingly crossed road entered green park with intention of passing through saint james park so into victoria street by way of queen anne gate side street leading therefrom have got about halfway across green park when became aware of quick footstep approaching from behind next moment be overtaken accosted by rather handsome man irreproachably attired in frock coat glossy top hat other garment to match stranger be evidently foreigner perhaps spaniard jack thought although spoke english with scarcely trace of accent raising hat said pardon sir may venture to enquire whether gentleman from whom parted few minute ago happens to be named montijo certainly answered jack there can be possible objection to making such enquiry somewhat peculiar though be whether answer not must depend upon reason may assign for asking question be not usual here in england for total stranger to ask such personal question a yours without being prepared to explain why be asked precisely assented stranger suavely reason for asking be that be particularly anxious to see senor montijo on very important business of strictly private nature must friend happen to be gentleman in question be about to ask if must have very great goodness to oblige with present address see said jack what caused to think that friend might possibly be individual be so anxious to meet simply strong general resemblance nothing more answered stranger then dear sir said jack since saw friend for otherwise must not have observed strong general resemblance to person whom be so anxious to meet will permit to suggest obviously proper thing for to have done be to accost when opportunity presented to instead of following before answer question be afraid must ask to favour with card a guarantee of bona fides know certainly answered stranger unhesitatingly a felt in breast pocket of coat for card case search however proved ineffectual at least card case be produced presently with air of great vexation exclaimed ala sir regret to say that appear to have lost mislaid card case for certainly have not with name however be mackintosh with just slightest perceptible hesitation mackintosh exclaimed jack with enthusiasm surely not one of mackintosh of inveraray certainly dear sir answered stranger effusively have doubt heard of know to be eminently respectable never heard of before answered jack with chuckle good morning mr mackintosh with somewhat ironical bow left stranger gaping with astonishment now what be meaning of doe mr mackintosh of inveraray want with carlos wonder mused young man a strode off across park considered matter carefully for few minute presently snapped finger a felt that have solved puzzle believe be in least anxious to obtain montijo address mused otherwise must have followed carlos not suspect that have be quietly dogging carlos with view to discovering what friend father make here in england having seen carlos together for hour to day be desirous of obtaining opportunity to become acquainted with feature general appearance must wonder if follows up try to discover where live yes there beggar be obviously following very well have objection on contrary task of dodging will add new zest to life will give good run for money therewith jack who have thus far be sauntering very quietly along suddenly stepped out at smartest pace be greatly amused to observe anxiety stranger evinced to keep up with out through gate by corner of stafford house ground strode jack across mall through gate into saint james park along path leading to bridge where stopped ostensibly to watch child feeding duck really to see what stranger must do then on again moment that latter also stopped on past drinking fountain through gate across birdcage walk so into queen anne gate little way along york street then to left through into victoria street across road into main entrance of army navy store a ran up step glanced over shoulder saw pursuer frantically striving to dodge between 'bus hansom cab still to keep eye on jack who passed in through heavy swing door through grocery department sharp round to right through accountant office into perfumery department so out into victoria street again making sure a passed out that have baffled pursuer turning to left jack then walked little way down street towards station until saw camden town 'bus coming up when quietly crossed road boarded 'bus ten minute later stepped off again a pulled up at stopping place at corner of trafalgar square jack now looked carefully round once more to make quite sure that have thrown mr mackintosh off scent satisfied that individual in question be nowhere in sight entered hotel chapter two lieutenant milsom rn evening be fine distance not far from morley to cecil jack therefore did not trouble to take cab slipping on light dust coat over evening dress set out to walk down strand on way to dine with friend a went thought be dwelling upon incident of afternoon encounter with mysterious mr mackintosh of inveraray decided that must let carlos father know that someone appeared to be taking rather marked interest in movement walk of ten minute duration sufficed to take to destination a turned in at arcade give access to hotel from strand whom must see mysterious stranger apparently intently studying steamship advertisement displayed in one of window of arcade in reality keeping sharp eye upon hotel entrance ah thought jack watching be all right will see if ca give bit of scare friend so thinking young giant walked straight up to stranger gripping firmly by arm exclaimed hillo mackintosh waiting for mr montijo eh be where be stopping because if so may a well go in together see if be at home sight of reminds that rather want to see come along old chap therewith jack still retaining grip upon stranger arm swung round made a though must drag along to hotel carrajo how dare sir exclaimed stranger vainly striving to wrench free from jack grasp release sir release instantly young cub will call policeman what exclaimed jack in affected surprise wish to see friend montijo very well run along then take notice of what say mr mackintosh if find hanging about here again will call policeman give in charge a suspicious character now be off with let see again swinging round jack thrust away with such force that be with difficulty man avoided falling headlong into carriage way then calmly passing into hotel singleton enquired for senor montijo be ushered to gentleman private suite of room by obsequious waiter found father son waiting for in very pretty little drawing room carlos having duly introduced friend three stood chatting together upon various current topic of day until dinner be announced when filed into small dining room adjoining here also conversation be of strictly general character so long at least a waiter be about at length latter withdrew two young men at senor montijo request drew up chair closer to don hermoso montijo be man in very prime of life being in forty third year fortune having be kind to from first while sickness of description have carefully avoided looked even younger than year be tall powerful strikingly handsome man of very dark complexion with black hair beard moustache dark eye sparkled with good humour vivacity movement gesture be characterised by stately dignity of true old spanish hidalgo have spoken little during dinner english being far from perfect moreover although have paid most elaborately courteous attention to what jack said thought have seemed to be far away now however turned to guest said with air of apology senor singleton must pray to pardon if have silent be during meal of dinner have not much of english a have doubtless noticed have spanish jack laughed a replied in language what have senor owe entirely to carlos here may perhaps have told that two used to amuse ourselves by teaching other respective tongue be afraid be rather dull scholar if spanish be only half a good a carlos english will be more than satisfied be afraid be unable to judge quality of carlos english answered don hermoso beg to assure senor that spanish be excellent far better indeed than spoken by many of own countryman if be not too tedious to senor must beg to do favour of speaking spanish for remainder of evening a find exceedingly difficult to make quite clearly understood in english jack having expressed perfect readiness to fall in with suggestion don hermoso continued carlos have be telling what passed between to day senor singleton although be naturally somewhat disinclined to give unqualified assent to suggestion before have seen permit to say that now having seen watched conversed with nothing will give greater pleasure than to endorse proposal unless be to hear that agree to to be perfectly candid don hermoso feel very strongly inclined to do so answered jack before can possibly give assent to carlos proposal must permit to clearly indicate risk to involved in know absolutely nothing of senor beyond what have learned from son be in highest degree essential that must clearly understand that what carlos suggested to afternoon involves in risk of losing yacht for carrying into effect of proposal must make vessel positively own to do a pleased with if must choose to retain possession of neither anybody else must prevent very clearly understand that dear young friend answered don hermoso be perfectly willing to take risk for several reason in first place if be kind of individual to do what have just suggested for instant believe that must have warned that proposal involved in risk of losing yacht in next place although a say know little nothing about son carlos know pretty intimately can rely upon judgment of finally believe that englishman in position must must be guilty of such infamous conduct a have suggested fact be that will certainly be obliged to trust somebody for if be once known that yacht belonged to must be so strictly watched that must do little nothing with must naturally trust rather than stranger of course answered jack be only natural can quite understand nevertheless will not give answer at present must have sufficient time to think matter over at leisure perhaps while doing so may hit upon alternative scheme will suit better meanwhile let tell of little adventure have afternoon just after have parted from carlos continuation evening will perhaps interest for be greatly mistaken if doe not concern even more than doe therewith jack proceeded to give humorous relation of two encounter with foreign looking gentleman claiming to be one of mackintosh of inveraray when at length finished father son looked at other with glance of alarm simultaneously exclaimed now who can possibly be description of man doe not in least degree suggest particular individual to continued don hermoso that of course be not surprising for man must have singularly striking personality to allow of being identified from verbal description only let be who may be quite disposed to agree with that object in accosting afternoon be to enable to familiarise with personal appearance while fact that caught watching hotel evening must seem to indicate that presence in london be known that visit be regarded with certain amount of suspicion only strengthens conviction that aid dear senor singleton will be of greatest value to if can succeed in persuading to give don hermoso manner be such a to leave room for doubt in mind of singleton a to sincerity of cuban while latter son be easily able to see that proposal strongly appealed to adventurous spirit of young englishman be therefore not surprising that ere parted that evening singleton have definitely agreed to become for time being apparent owner of new steam yacht to take part in gun running adventure also agreeing to take along with working model of submarine three be of opinion might be found exceedingly useful while service upon be about to engage must afford jack opportunity to put craft to test of actual work important point having be arranged be further agreed that since two montijos be evidently under spanish surveillance must advertise connection with yacht a little a possible leaving matter of final trial of vessel payment of last instalment of cost transfer to jack ownership entirely in hand of agent who have thus far managed business for taking holiday on continent meanwhile joining vessel only at last moment prior to departure for cuba be further arranged that ordering shipment of arm ammunition supply destined for use of insurgent must also be left absolutely in hand of agent jack conjointly by mean montijos must effectually avoid embroilment with spanish authority while be hoped that by occupying attention of authority that attention must be completely diverted from jack yacht settlement of detail of others incidental to kept three conspirator busy until nearly midnight when jack rose to go having already arranged to leave hotel by side entrance in order to baffle eminently respectable mr mackintosh must individual happen to be still on watch a happened be for upon leaving hotel jack sauntered along embankment a far a waterloo bridge then made way up into lancaster place there took cab in drove up strand where saw man evidently on guard strolling slowly to fro in front of main entrance to cecil now jack although yacht owner be not member of yacht club cutter lalage being such out of date craft so seldom in use that have not thus far thought worth while to very intimately identify with what be englishman pastime par excellence a thought over event of evening while smoking final pipe before turning in night occurred to that if be to successfully pose a owner of fine new steam yacht be imperative that must become member of smart club a happened to have two three intimate friend who belonged to royal thames decided upon attempting to procure election into somewhat exclusive club accordingly next morning addressed letter to friend requesting to undertake matter of election with result may here be mentioned that about three week later received communication from secretary of club intimating enrolment requesting payment of entrance fee first subscription matter having be attended to jack next addressed letter to senor montijo agent making appointment with for afternoon then went out to interview tailor outfitter for purpose of procuring suitable outfit then occurred to that for especial work new yacht be required to do must need first rate crew man of whom must be absolutely to be depended upon under circumstance eight ten hand comprising crew of lalage be well known to having indeed belonged to cutter for year while be still property of jack father must doubtless serve a nucleus of new ship crew of course must go little way towards manning of steam yacht of three hundred forty ton measurement while perkins satisfactory a have proved in capacity of skipper of cutter must never do a commander of new ship though might perhaps make very good chief officer having arrived at point in meditation jack suddenly bethought of lieutenant philip milsom rn retired who must make perfectly ideal skipper for new craft must probably be glad enough to get to sea again for few month supplement scanty income by drawing handsome pay captain of first class modern steam yacht can command whereupon young man turned into next telegraph office that came to dispatched wire to milsom briefly informing that have heard of berth thought must suit requesting to call at morley hotel on following day at lunch time jack received letter from carlos montijo announcing departure of father for paris en route for switzerland containing itinerary list of date for singleton guidance in event of finding necessary to communicate with jack have finished luncheon be taking cup of coffee with cigarette in smoke room when waiter entered bearing card owner of be enquiring for mr singleton card bore name of james m nisbett jack knew that senor montijo agent have arrived accordingly directed waiter to show mr nisbett up into private sitting room mr nisbett be one of agent whose business be generally brought to by foreign colonial client transaction consisted of obtaining for forwarding to client anything everything that might chance to require whether happened to be pocket knife bridal trousseau several hundred mile of railway needle anchor being keen man of business be only necessary to mention to kind of article required be at once prepared to say where article might be best obtained also being tremendously busy man be wont to get straight to business without circumlocution did so in present instance by producing letter have that morning received from don hermoso montijo detailing arrangement arrived at on previous night between jack authorising nisbett to act upon jack instruction precisely a though instruction emanated directly from don hermoso letter very effectually cleared ground jack at once began to detail to nisbett full particular of arm ammunition store article generally be intended to put on board yacht for conveyance to cuba after arrangement be made for final trial of yacht prior to acceptance by nisbett on behalf of client subsequent transference to jack ownership be perfectly clear to jack that last arrangement be distinctly unpalatable to nisbett who thought saw in deep laid scheme for theft of yacht from actual owner when jack explained reason have actuated montijos in making proposal further cheerfully offered to consent to alternative scheme must achieve same result man at once gave in frankly admitting that arrangement already come to be best must be suggested remained with jack two full hour carefully discussing with point affecting success of expedition when at length retired be fully primed with information necessary to enable to satisfactorily perform share of task following morning brought jack visitor of very different equally thorough type in person of lieutenant philip milsom rn who sent in card while young man be still dawdling over rather late breakfast bring gentleman in here ordered jack minute later waiter re appeared conducting dapper looking clean shaven man of medium height attired in suit of blue serge double breasted jacket of wore buttoned tight to body individual spotted jack instantly pushing waiter on one side bustled up with outstretched hand to table at young man be sitting exclaiming in brisk cheery voice hillo jack hearty what cheer gad what big lump of chap have become since saw last how long ago ay must be more than two year nevertheless must have known anywhere from striking likeness to poor father well how be lad eh not very much matter with must say yet know look trifle chalky about gill clothes seem to hang rather more loosely than must what have be doing with eh oh nothing very dreadful laughed jack only overworking trifle so be told sit down there be good fellow have breakfasted by way breakfasted very nearly three hour ago boy be answer if want to join see be still busy at be bashful say so straight out will not refuse for journey up have given fresh appetite be right said jack now will have coffee tea can take choice of ham egg steak chop fish thanks said milsom will take coffee steak rather underdone while steak be getting ready will amuse with one of roll pat of butter if mind got telegram by way of course must be here what be job boy eh suppose be something that gentleman may undertake must have thought of eh of course said jack be to say think so must judge for whether post be such a must care to accept fact be that a told just now have be overworking specialist whom have come down here to consult tell that must take long holiday in open air have therefore decided to go on yachting cruise to west indie probably want to take command of ship for be brand new three hundred forty ton steam yacht of eight hundred indicated horse power guaranteed sea speed be twenty two knot milsom pursed up lip gave vent to prolonged whistle a jack enunciated particular then feature relaxed into broad smile a extended right hand across table to jack exclaiming be man a came along in train morning be cogitating what be smallest amount of pay must take for job whatever might be by piper jack mere pleasure of commanding such craft must be payment enough for be quite willing to take on free gratis for nothing if say so pay said jack will be at rate of thirty pound sterling per calendar month with uniform keep of course thrown in good enough exclaimed milsom enthusiastically may take upon term accept command of what be name be so new said jack that have not yet be given name at present be known simply a number lowering voice have not yet told everything have better wait until have heard have to say before definitely decide meanwhile here come steak fresh coffee so have better get breakfast when have finished will go up to private room right ho acquiesced milsom who forthwith turned attention to second breakfast saying very little more until intimated that have finished be now quite ready to resume discussion of matter have brought up to town accordingly jack conducted friend up to private sitting room waved into chair took one ah exclaimed milsom in tone conveyed complete satisfaction with thing in general be right suppose by way chap may smoke here may of course said jack smoke away a hard a please old man have cigar thanks answered navy man good honest stick tobacco smoked out of well seasoned brier be good enough for unless one can get hold of real genuine havana know be scarcely to be have in day same think may perhaps manage to get hold of one two where be going said jack be to say if be still willing to take on job after have heard what be bound to tell ah exclaimed milsom something in background eh well ca be very terrible fancy jack must not be mixed up in however heave ahead lad let hear worst without further parley well said jack fact be that yachting trip be blind be in reality neither more le than gun running expedition in aid of cuban revolutionary yacht be really not mine belongs to certain very wealthy cuban gentleman who being like most cuban utterly sick of spanish misgovernment of island have thrown in lot with patriot have have craft specially built for service recognising that to declare ownership of must at once arouse suspicion of spaniard attract tremendous amount of unwelcome attention to have persuaded to assume apparent ownership of vessel to undertake trip to west indie in ostensibly for health actually to run into island consignment of arm ammunition otherwise to assist patriot in possible way see observed milsom thoughtfully mean of course must really be in service of cuban gentleman instead of in yours make very important difference jack for see will have to look to instead of to for pay smuggling contraband of war be very different matter from navigating gentleman private yacht be work for will expect to be well paid then be to understand that regard thirty pound per month a insufficient demanded jack not at dear boy answered milsom quickly misunderstand be quite content with pay a service be one can see with eye will involve good deal of risk want to be quite certain of getting now be friend to be absolutely depended upon in respect see if insurrection must fail a probably will friend may be killed imprisoned property confiscated then may whistle for money think not said jack for friend have left management of everything in hand will see that be right be very glad that have raised point for have enabled to see that proper thing will be to deposit sufficient sum in english bank to cover pay of hand for period of well say twelve month what do say to say answered milsom that will be quite proper thing to do will smooth away very serious difficulty jack boy have occurred to that will be running good many quite unnecessary risk by mixing up in affair for must remember that may be compelled to fight before be done while if be captured may mean year of imprisonment in spanish penal settlement will be joke can assure lad ah answered jack to be quite frank have not thought of last contingency mention in for penny in for pound will take risk trust to usual good luck to keep out of spanish prison fact be phil that be fairly aching for bit of adventure simply must have very well said milsom grimly think have hit upon most excellent scheme for getting advice to jack be to leave whole thing severely alone whether do not be in so please give order mind jack take from from nobody else very well said jack may be necessary for to modify resolution later on let pas at present at event will receive instruction from regard a owner of vessel now first thing to be done be to secure good crew a have told precisely kind of work will have to be done will look to to provide right sort of officer men suppose will have to give hint that will be required to do something more than mere everyday yachting work must arrange pay accordingly while doing must be careful not to let out true secret will not remain such for very long need not trouble to provide engine room staff think can manage part of business see answered milsom wish to engage merely officer seaman steward very well how many gun will carry gun echoed jack by jove have not thought of will need gun certainly will if be to be a useful a ought to be answered milsom um said jack that complicates matter bit doe be afraid that must refer point to senor actual owner what sort of armament must recommend for such craft phil oh not very heavy one answered milsom probably four pounder of latest pattern couple of maxim must be sufficient jack made note of particular for reference to senor montijo then said now be there anything else that can think of phil nothing except outfit of small arm rifle revolver cutlass know for crew answered milsom if anything else must occur to will write mention very well pray do so said jack now think be for present pick first class thoroughly reliable crew phil give week in to look for by time expect boat will be ready to receive then can bring north with will ship in proper orthodox style now good bye good luck to in search chapter three sy thetis rtyc next day be spent by jack at mr nisbett invitation in visiting in company of gentleman establishment of certain manufacturer of firearm where very carefully inspected tested several weapon submitted to for approval finally selecting six shot magazine rifle be not only most excellent weapon in other respect one especially commending to on account of simplicity of mechanism believed must prove to be very strong point in favour when put into hand of such comparatively unintelligent person a strongly suspected rank file of cuban insurgent must prove to be also decided upon exceedingly useful pattern of sword bayonet to go with rifle also six shot revolver of especially efficient character there then gave order through mr nisbett for a large number of weapon together with ammunition for same a believed yacht must conveniently stow away done returned to hotel reaching just in good time for dinner devoted evening to concoction of letter to senor montijo at lucerne reporting that have thus far done also referring to don important question of yacht armament somewhat laboriously transcribing said letter into cipher jack business in london be now done on following morning therefore took train back to newcastle called upon mr murdock partner in evening explaining arrangement have made to pay visit to cuba including rather singular proposal of senor montijo to have consented a to apparent ownership of new yacht listened patiently unconvinced to murdock argument against what canny northumbrian unhesitatingly denounced a utterly hare brained next two day devoted to task of putting affair in order lest anything serious must happen to during progress of adventure on third day nisbett presented with consulting naval architect to witness final trial of yacht before accepting on behalf of senor montijo from builder trial be of most searching exhaustive character lasting over full week at end of came coal consumption test consisting of non stop run northward at full speed through pentland firth round cape wrath then southward outside hebrides past west coast of ireland thence from mizen head across to land end up english channel north sea to starting point run down past west coast of ireland part of way up channel be accomplished in face of stiff south westerly gale through very heavy sea in little craft behaved magnificently entire trial from first to last being of most thoroughly satisfactory character evoking unmeasured admiration of naval architect under whose strict supervision be performed jack be on board throughout trial a representative of builder experience of behaviour of boat be such a to fill with enthusiasm delight at prospect of coming trip contract be certified a having be faithfully satisfactorily completed final instalment of contract price be paid nisbett on behalf of senor montijo took over vessel from builder at once transferring ownership of to jack meanwhile letter have arrived from senor montijo authorising arming of ship in accordance with milsom suggestion thetis a have be named be once more laid alongside wharf to receive certain extra fitting be required to admit of prompt mounting of artillery when occasion must seem to so require in meantime jack have written to milsom extending time allowed latter in to pick up suitable crew at same time suggesting that perkins rest of crew of lalage must be afforded opportunity to join thetis must care to do so subject of course to milsom approval of by time that extra fitting be in place little ship drydocked repainted outside navy man have come north with retinue hand be duly shipped jack having with assistance of superintendent of fitting shop meanwhile selected first rate engine room staff stokehold crew completing of arrangement carried time on to last week of july on th day of month thetis steamed down tyne on way to cowes jack having decided to give a much vraisemblance a possible to apparent ownership of vessel to pretence that be yachting for health sake by putting in month of august in solent during order for arm ammunition etcetera must be in process of execution although jack be not racing man lalage being of altogether too ancient type to pose a racer be by mean unknown in yachting world found host of acquaintance ready willing to welcome appearance in cowes road especially coming a did in fine handsome little ship a thetis for first fortnight of racing new steamer with burgee blue ensign be quite conspicuous object a with large party of friend male female on board followed racer up down sparkling water of solent jack be precisely of light hearted joyous temperament can find unalloyed pleasure amid such surroundings threw heart soul into daily gaiety with abandon be sufficient one must have thought to have utterly destroyed possible suspicion a to existence of ulterior motif yet happening to be ashore one afternoon with party of friend be startled a walked down high street at cowes to see coming toward man whom believed have met somewhere before individual did not appear to be taking very particular notice of anything just at moment seeming indeed to be sunk deep in thought when be about ten yard from jack party suddenly looked up found young man eye fixed enquiringly upon for instant stopped dead expression of mingled annoyance fear flashed into eye then turned quickly sprang a if affrighted into door of shop opposite have paused in instant jack remembered be mr mackintosh of inveraray now what in name of fortune be that chap doing down here wondered singleton be accident coincidence only have discovered something come down here to watch doings of yacht be very difficult question to answer for one meet sort of people at cowes during august yet that fellow doe not look a though knew enough about yacht to have be attracted here by racing be evidently desirous of avoiding recognition by why did bolt into shop a did be prepared to swear that did not want to buy anything have not remotest intention of entering place until saw of course may have be because of scare gave that night at cecil on other hand may have be because did not wish to know that be anywhere near anyhow doe not matter for doings down here have be absolutely innocent such a to disarm even suspicion of suspicious spanish spy in case can not very well follow wherever go perhaps before month be out suspicion if have will be laid at rest since be just now doing absolutely nothing to foster strengthen will come to conclusion that there be need to watch be very glad that idea occurred to of never running boat at higher speed than fourteen knot while have be down here there be nothing to be gained by giving away real speed who know little harmless deception in matter may one day stand in good stead thenceforward whenever jack have occasion to go ashore always kept particularly smart lookout for mr mackintosh saw no more during remainder of stay in solent yet few day later incident occurred although unmarked by pronounced significance rather tended to impress upon jack conviction that somebody be evincing certain amount of interest in speed qualification of thetis although be quite possible that might have be mistaken incident took form of somewhat sudden proposal to get up race for steam yacht round island for cup of value of fifty guinea such proposal be little remarkable from fact that steam yacht racing be form of sport be very rarely indulged in by englishman at least in english water yet everything must necessarily have beginning there be especial reason why steam yacht racing must not be one of thing particularly a idea appeared to be received with enthusiasm by certain owner of such craft when matter be first mentioned to singleton be suggested that must enter thetis for race evinced disposition to regard proposal with coldness a have already arrived at conclusion that might be unwise to reveal boat actual capability attitude be so strongly denounced a unsportsmanlike found subjected to such urgent solicitation not to say pressure that quickly grew suspicious mentioned matter to milsom milsom in turn after considering matter for little suggested that chief engineer of boat must be consulted with result that be ultimately decided to enter thetis for race macintyre undertaking while yacht must present to onlooker appearance of being pushed to utmost plenty of steam blowing off so on speed must not be permitted to exceed fifteen knot only be allowed to reach at brief interval during race with understanding jack agreed to enter race duly came off in splendid weather be pronounced to be brilliant success thetis coming in third losing race by only eight second on time allowance nobody be perhaps better pleased at result than jack for new boat made brave show apparently struggled gamely throughout race to win prize white feather showing from first to last on top of waste pipe thin continuous film of light brown smoke issuing from funnel from start to finish if anyone happened to have taken trouble to get up race with express object of ascertaining best speed of thetis knew now be fourteen knot rising to nearly fifteen for few minute occasionally when condition be especially favourable with approach of end of month yacht began to thin out more more perceptibly day racer going westward cruiser following steam yacht hanging on to accompany channel match to weymouth thetis be one of jack allowed to be pretty generally understood that after weymouth regatta be over intended to run north for month so visiting baltic perhaps proceeding a far east a cronstadt yachtsman be among most capricious of men of never know from one moment to what really intend to do thus be after not very surprising that when thetis arrived off mouth of tyne jack singleton must suddenly give order for nose to be turned shoreward that hour two later must glide gently up alongside make fast to private wharf of singleton murdock company what be surprising be that when be seen approaching fifty of singleton murdock company most trusty hand received sudden notice that be required for night job at dawn next morning thetis drew full foot more water than have done when ran alongside wharf twelve hour earlier although in interim have not taken ounce of coal into bunker so happened that mr murdock be absent on important business when thetis arrived alongside wharf did not return to newcastle until nearly midnight when of course made best of way to own house be at work betimes next morning knowing that yacht be expected took wharf on way to office with object of ascertaining whether have arrived sight of lying alongside in bravery of white enamel paint gilt moulding polished brasswork caused to heave great sigh of relief joyously hurried forward to greet jack whom saw standing on wharf engaged in earnest conversation with yard foreman good morning singleton morning price exclaimed a approached two well jack continued so arrived up to time eh by look of boat must say that have got stuff on board be that so ah that be right be precious glad to hear can tell for to have case accumulating here day after day have be source of great anxiety to sorry remarked jack cheerfully why must worry old chap everything be securely packed in air tight zinc lined case so that there be really very serious cause for anxiety fear even of explosion thing must not possibly happen except by downright deliberate act of evil disposed individual think precisely interrupted murdock be just what be worrying at least be one of thing be worrying not on account of own people mind believe to be loyal trustworthy to man can not help thinking that hint of expedition must have leaked out for have never have so many stranger about place since have be in business a have have during last fortnight while case have be arriving have simply be overwhelmed with business enquiry of description enquiry a to facility for execution of repair enquiry a to quickest time in must build deliver new ship enquiry respecting new engine machinery of conceivable kind not one of will probably come to anything thing troubled most be that one of people wanted to be shown over place from end to end in order that might judge for a explained whether work be sufficiently extensive up to date to enable to execute particular kind of work that wanted done mother son of gravitated sooner later to spot where precious case of yours be stacked seemed profoundly interested in while one chap who be undoubtedly foreigner have impudence to insinuate that mark address on case indicating that be sugar machinery for mauritius be bogus sent to rightabout pretty quickly can tell why what dickens be laughing at man be laughing matter give word for jack have burst into fit of hearty laughter at murdock righteous indignation of course not old chap answered jack manfully struggling to suppress mirth awfully annoying must have be be sure well be that answered murdock indignantly be not be worst only day before yesterday have man poking about here who said be from admiralty wanted nothing in particular for moment said be simply making tour of principal shipyard of country with view of ascertaining be facility of for execution of admiralty work too be vastly interested in precious case of yours so much so indeed must not have be at surprised if have asked to have whole lot of opened oh yes of course know must not have gone to such length a without assigning good sufficient reason tell jack that be playing dangerous game will not be party to repetition of pretty mess must be in if british government be to discover that be aiding abetting insurgent in arm against authority of friendly power why must mean nothing short of ruin absolute ruin to yes be quite right old chap must agreed jack soberly if senor montijo want to ship more stuff after must not be through yard be aboard out of sight now leave for um mauritius will say afternoon so there be need for to worry further about well to be perfectly candid with jack said murdock will not be at sorry to see thetis safely away from on way down river for will not be quite comfortable easy in mind until do will have to be very careful what be about boy there be smoke without fire fuss prying about of have be telling mean something may depend must not very greatly surprise if discover that be being followed watched must take chance of laughed jack not that be very greatly afraid fact be murdock that be constitutionally nervous man have worried into perfect state of scare over business never mind anxiety will soon be over now for here come coal if be not mistaken promise that will be off moment that have taken last sack on board will run into office say good bye before go church clock be just striking two when jack having duly fulfilled promise to say good bye to partner to exchange final word two with thetis cast off from wharf backed out into stream swinging round swept away down river at modest rate of fourteen knot that being most economical speed pace at in order to make coal last out have be decided that must cross atlantic sat very deep in water deck fore aft be packed with coal in sack so closely stowed that there be only narrow gangway left between from foot of ladder abaft deck house to companion similar gangway from fore end of bridge deck to forecastle if be necessary for men to pas to other part of ship such a to ensign staff for instance have to climb over sack be particularly well equipped with boat too there be steam pinnace whaler in chock on starboard side of deck house balanced by lifeboat cutter on other carried le than four fine wholesome boat at davit aft nicely covered over with canvas to protect from sun also in one case to screen from too curious eye jack submarine be snugly stowed away in largest quarter boat craft having have thwart removed to make room for submarine twenty six hour later namely at four o'clock on following afternoon thetis anchored off boulogne steam pinnace be lowered jack accompanied by four seaman proceeded into harbour landing at step near railway station from thence be very short walk to hotel to be bound in few minute be at destination enquiring for monsieur robinson yes be informed monsieur robeenson be in be expecting monsieur singleton possibly monsieur might be gentleman in question jack confessed that be being piloted upstairs be presently shown into room where found don hermoso montijo son carlos obviously waiting for a entered sprang to foot advanced toward with outstretched hand ah senor singleton exclaimed don hermoso punctual to minute rather glancing at watch few minute before time duly received wire in paris morning came on forthwith be delighted to learn that everything have gone so smoothly do understand that be now ready to sail for cuba certainly don hermoso answered jack can be under way in hour from if like whenever please be for to say when must like to start then in case may a well be off at once said don hermoso for first fortnight three week of tour through switzerland be undoubtedly object of great deal of interested attention latterly have not be so acutely conscious of being followed watched everything that did be so perfectly open frank that think person who have under surveillance must have become convinced that suspicion of be groundless consequently relaxed attention believe that managed to get away from paris morning without being followed if be case have of course managed to throw watcher off scent for moment at least will doubt be wise to get away from here before be picked up again hope that senor have not be subjected to annoyance of kind said jack laughingly have not beyond meeting at cowes with man who called mackintosh of informed in one of letter have have little cause to believe have become object of suspicion to spanish government be true that race for steam yacht be got up little while before left solent under circumstance suggested to that attempt be being made to ascertain best speed of thetis attempt might have existed only in imagination if be otherwise plan be defeated so harm be done partner have be good deal worried recently by incursion of number of inquisitive stranger who have obtruded upon invaded work with what considers very inadequate excuse fixed impression be that whisper be somehow allowed to get abroad that arm ammunition store be to be shipped from yard for use of cuban insurgent that inquisitive stranger be neither more le than emissary of spanish government sent down to investigate into truth of matter one appear to have betrayed quite remarkable amount of interest in case one individual at least seems to have pretty broadly hinted doubt a to genuineness of marking on also own government appears to have received hint of what be doing to have sent man down to investigate be afraid therefore that despite precaution have not wholly succeeded in avoiding suspicion if such must be case will be pity for will certainly mean trouble for later on stronger reason why must start without further delay said don hermoso carlos oblige by ringing bell bell be rung bill asked for paid various servant generously tipped little party set out montijos luggage have be left in hall of hotel there be nothing therefore for four seaman to seize shoulder carry down to pinnace occupied few minute quarter of hour later party have gained deck of yacht pinnace be once more reposing in chock on bridge deck get anchor up mr milsom if please said jack allowing eye to stray shoreward a milsom repeated order to mate a looked became aware of something in nature of commotion disturbance at end of pier entering chart house brought forth pair of splendid binoculars with to investigate upon applying glass to eye saw that there be little crowd of perhaps fifty people gathered on pier end eagerly listening to man who be talking gesticulating with great vehemence a pointed excitedly toward yacht man appeared to be particularly addressing two gendarme who be among crowd everybody be clustering close round listening apparently in state of greatest excitement to what have to say while occasionally one in crowd must face seaward shake fist savagely at yacht come here moment carlos called jack want to look through glass at mob gathered yonder on pier end especially at excited individual in midst tell whether remember having ever seen before young montijo took glass from jack looked intently through for full minute then turned to singleton saying why yes of course do be chap that pater be constantly meeting wherever went while be in switzerland met so repeatedly that at length must not avoid conviction that be dogging footstep on board steamer in train even when out driving be continually same did not seem able to get away from never took slightest notice of that only made suspect more because in case of other people after have encountered few time many of bowed to even entered into conversation with although fellow stopped at same hotel a used generally contrived to sit at same table with never allowed to show by so much a momentary glance that have ever seen before oh yes a again applied glass to eye be same man must swear to among thousand what be after now upon word look very much a though intended to follow on board here see there be two men bringing boat along toward step at end of pier yes by jove be what mean to do be bringing gendarme with now what mischief can possibly be up to pater have done nothing let have look interrupted jack almost snatching binoculars out of friend hand putting up to eye ay said be right carlos undoubtedly there go down step with policeman at heel yes now get into boat seat yes be pointing out yacht to boatman now be shoving off heading way mr milsom broke off suddenly what be best news with regard to anchor of ours forecastle there shouted milsom how be coming on with anchor cable almost up down sir answered perkins chief mate who be standing by knight head hanging on by forestay a leaned over to watch cable will break out in about couple of minute will take boat ten minute at least to get alongside even if keep up present pace remarked jack will get move on ship phil a soon a anchor be out of ground very much like look of gendarme in boat do answered milsom quartermaster tend wheel surely can not do anything exclaimed carlos what must do well said jack have heard before now of people being arrested upon false charge for purpose of obtaining possession getting sight of private paper with object of detaining until became too late for to accomplish certain undertaking until other more serious charge must be trumped up against necessary witness found coached to procure conviction must be rather bad thing for cuba for instance if at particular juncture in affair father be clapped in prison kept there for couple of year well yes suppose must agreed carlos anchor aweigh sir reported perkins at moment a steam windlass after slowing down until nearly stopped suddenly started to clank at racing speed very good answered milsom up with a fast a please then with casual glance at approaching boat be by time within about quarter of mile of yacht laid hand upon engine room telegraph signalled quarter speed ahead chapter four circumventing enemy whither away now mr singleton down channel suppose enquired milsom when yacht began to forge ahead think not said jack in view of fact that there be somebody in boat who appears to be willing to adopt very energetic measure to get hold of senor montijo yacht will perhaps be wise step for to run few mile up channel instead of down until get out of sight of inquisitive eye may possibly be watching so please shape course up through strait for hour two say two hour then can seize favourable opportunity to turn round run down channel hugging english shore fairly close question reminds that time have arrived when ought to decide for what port be to make in order that may work out great circle course what think don hermoso continued in spanish have definite idea a to precise spot must be best for to make for really senor be detail have not yet seriously considered answered don hermoso idea be to get into communication with junta a soon a reach other side learn from what spot must be most suitable at to make attempt to land consignment what think captain milsom where have junta of yours established asked milsom also taking up conversation in spanish of have serviceable knowledge must be possible to get cable message into hand from side without risk of being intercepted by spaniard oh yes quite easily answered don hermoso have established headquarters in new york must cable to in cipher if necessary then said milsom if may be permitted must suggest that since be now running up channel must be good plan for to land at dover cable to junta information that have actually started that have reason to suspect that have not altogether escaped suspicion of spanish authority consequently yacht may be watched for perhaps followed when arrive in cuban water that must therefore be very great convenience if when get across must find communication awaiting say at key west giving latest information upon situation generally advice a to most desirable spot at to attempt landing of cargo most excellent suggestion exclaimed don hermoso come gentleman let enter chart house draft message at once after will transcribe into cipher in readiness to dispatch upon arrival at dover with exercise of considerable thought ingenuity concise rendering of point suggested by milsom be at length drafted upon arrival of yacht off dover don hermoso singleton went ashore in steam pinnace dispatched message to new york after yacht bow be turned southward again until have rounded beachy head when milsom set course at west by south for lizard from headland intended to take final departure be just nine o'clock in evening when thetis rounded beachy head at noon next day be abreast of lizard two mile distant from splendid departure exclaimed milsom enthusiastically when have taken careful bearing of headland now know ship position at noon to day almost to foot be anxious to make really good departure for have worked out very elaborate complete system of great circle course from lizard to north west end of little bahama bank be spot must be hit off very accurately if one must avoid disaster thence will run down florida strait to key west course intend to steer being shortest possible distance to spot must not run mile farther than be necessary jack for macintyre tell that will take time to make coal last out a happened there be cause for apprehension a to coal lasting out for when thetis be two day out from lizard fell in with fresh easterly wind enabled to use sail to such great advantage that saved full day in run across steaming in through east channel dropping anchor in four fathom of water within mile of town of key west few minute before six o'clock in evening of eleventh day out from lizard there be several american men o ' war of various description ranging from battleship to torpedo boat lying at anchor in roadstead a well a two cruiser three gunboat torpedo boat flying spanish flag singleton noticed with mingled concern amusement a little thetis swept past spanish vessel at close quarter with blue burgee ensign of royal thames gaily fluttering from masthead ensign staff yacht be object of keenest interest to officer who be promenading navigating bridge boat from custom house with health officer of port in came off to yacht almost a soon a anchor be down a thetis have clean bill of health there be difficulty about getting pratique party might have landed forthwith have so pleased deemed wise however to exercise certain measure of restraint by abstaining from landing until next morning although port authority be perfectly polite singleton thought be only case of guilty conscience that custom house officer betrayed even more than ordinary yankee curiosity a to reason have prompted jack to select west indian water a spot in to pursue quest of renewed health there seemed to be very marked disposition on part of man to indulge in hint innuendo suggesting that be perfectly aware of existence of certain something under rose until singleton at length put stop to by asking point blank what be at be hinting when at length went down side to return to shore left subordinate on board yacht montijos be very wroth at act of custom authority rather wished jack to resent a act of discourtesy on part of american government milsom promptly interposed explaining matter while jack laughed heartily declaring that there be not slightest need to worry since have nothing in shape of contraband otherwise that wished to land at key west saloon party breakfasted at nine o'clock next morning embarking in steam pinnace about ten went ashore ostensibly to enquire at post office for letter to view quaint little town really to visit agent of cuban junta who be established there upon whom however don hermoso did not call until nearly two o'clock in afternoon at hour street be practically deserted first visit of party be to post office where a have expected don hermoso found awaiting long letter written in cipher from junta at new york cordially thanking for generous assistance informing that arrangement have be made for trusty party to await arrival of yacht in laguna de cortes at south west end of cuba where everything be to be landed where also pilot must be found waiting to take yacht into lagoon letter ended up by giving password must be evidence of bona fides of pilot of party who have be told off to receive contraband soon became apparent to jack that party be attracting very considerable amount of attention from certain individual who appeared to be following about town persistently apparently with very little pretence at concealment be therefore arranged that when moment arrived for visit to be paid to agent of junta don hermoso must pay alone carlos jack meanwhile doing best to decoy persistent spy in other direction effort be of avail for soon became clear that separate spy have be told off to watch member of party when separated therefore jack found that while one man remained to watch second followed don hermoso third with equal tenacity followed carlos finally when later on in afternoon jack set off to walk down to wharf in order to go back aboard yacht suddenly found accosted by swarthy unkempt individual picturesquely attired in rag yet whose manner be somehow out of keeping with appearance pardon senor exclaimed fellow in spanish with air of mystery a took off sombrero with flourish have supreme honour of addressing noble englishman who owns beautiful yacht came in yesterday if refer to english yacht thetis said jack yes be owner of mil gracias senor for condescension answered man senor continued have very great favour to beg of have be said that senor be about to visit cuba be so mention of cuba instantly put jack on guard at once suspected that be face to face with spanish spy felt curious to know what fellow be driving at yet be careful to conceal fact that suspicion have be aroused therefore answered with air of carelessness indeed be curious for be not aware have thus far mentioned intention to anyone ashore here a to visiting cuba well be not at certain that will do so for from what have gathered to day be led to understand that country be in very disturbed condition that be scarcely safe for stranger to go there at present have not yet mentioned favour that wish to ask have anything to do with supposed intention to visit cuba assuredly have senor most intimately answered other senor speaker assumed yet more furtive mysterious manner be cuban patriot be destitute a appearance doubtless testifies be most anxious to return to country take up arm against oppressor english enjoying liberty be reputed to be in sympathy with cuban in endeavour to throw off hated yoke of foreign oppressor have ventured to hope that senor must be magnanimous enough to give passage across to havana in beautiful yacht think said jack with air of hauteur that have altogether mistaken character of vessel be not passenger ship private yacht in be taking cruise for benefit of health be not custom to give passage to total stranger especially when by so doing must run risk of embroiling with spanish authority with whom have quarrel no senor must pardon seeming churlishness in refusing so apparently trivial favour decline to associate in way with quarrel between country spain have honour to bid good day ah pardon senor just one moment persisted man noble senor disclaims intention to associate with quarrel between cuba spain yet two well known cuban patriot be guest on board yacht must almost appear that yacht be attracting quite unusual amount of attention here laughed jack gentleman of whom speak be personal friend of mine younger of indeed went to same school a myself in england must be sufficient to account for intimacy with doe not follow because happen to be friend of mine be to give free passage to cuba to anyone who chooses to ask be to do so must probably have to carry across inhabitant of key west senor must beg to be excused bowing profoundly to ragged interlocutor for with language jack always found falling into stately mannerism of spaniard young man passed on wondering whether have indeed be guilty of ungracious act to genuine cuban patriot whether man whom have just left be spanish spy put question to don hermoso night over dinner table while relating to companion incident of afternoon don laughed heartily at jack qualm of conscience never trouble for moment on score dear jack said man be without doubt spanish spy have be genuine cuban patriot a represented to be must have known that must only have be necessary to present to local agent of junta with proof of identity when must easily have obtained passage across to cuba incident be only one more proof if such be needed that party yacht have somehow incurred very gravest suspicion of spaniard that be being most jealously watched fear that carlos be chiefly responsible for indeed agent here did not scruple to say that carlos committed very great tactical blunder in coming out here in yacht asserts that ought to have come out in ordinary way by mail steamer that in case little suspicion must have attached to yacht certain news transmitted from europe coupled with fact of presence on board have convinced authority that yacht be in water for purpose of running cargo of contraband into island of course have spy a spaniard have theirs one of most trusty investigator reported to day while be with agent that be undoubtedly intention of spanish authority that torpedo boat will accompany thetis so long a remains in cuban water phew that sound awkward remarked milsom doe anybody know what speed be nobody did appeared whereupon milsom undertook to ascertain whether custom house officer possessed knowledge if so to extract from accordingly when little later saloon party adjourned to deck for enjoyment of post prandial cigar skipper sauntered away forward up on top of deck house where perkins officer be sitting yarning together joined sat chatting with for nearly hour then upon pretext that have forgotten to speak to mr singleton about arrangement for coaling ship rose joined trio who be sitting aft near stern grating well said jack have be able to learn anything phil yes answered milsom have learned be not very comforting that torpedo boat appears be practically new craft have sea speed of twenty five knot be one knot better than best so how be going to dodge be more than at present know three gunboat need not trouble about for two masted craft be only capable of sixteen knot while three masted boat destructor can do about seventeen at pinch though be said to have be at one time capable of twenty two half need trouble about cruiser for faster of lepanto be only capable of twenty half knot when be clean be told that at present be dreadfully foul still appears to that torpedo boat be apart from rest more than will be able to manage remarked don hermoso if persists in dogging heel will not have ghost of chance of landing cargo anywhere said jack will not dog heel don hermoso trouble be where submarine come in be going to score if be not mistaken macintyre will be able to doctor that torpedo boat so that will not trouble will just go down in submarine remove nut secures propeller to shaft when begin to move propeller will drop off before can be replaced will have cargo ashore be in position to laugh at how will manage jack in presence of ship demanded milsom must not possibly do what suggest without being seen besides there be custom house officer to be reckoned with really believe that man be to be trusted with secret will have to do job at night time night before leave here for cuba said jack a to custom house officer must trust that will sleep too soundly to hear anything leave to said don hermoso be bit of chemist in way will concoct liquid few drop of in grog last thing at night will cause to sleep soundly night awake none worse in morning will get over one difficulty said jack have just thought of plan will get over that of getting submarine into water unobserved strike that can do be necessary without using submarine at torpedo boat be a may observe lying quite close to shore so close indeed that there can not be much more than two foot of water under keel consequently macintyre have only to don special diving dress a think have explained to need air pipe anything of sort go down over side of yacht make way to prey under water with little management must even do trick in broad daylight nobody be wiser excellent exclaimed milsom enthusiastically will have lighter alongside to coal to morrow before come along will hang tarpaulin round ship to keep paint clean then while everybody be busy coaling macintyre can watch opportunity slip over side through ash port gad wo fellow be wrathy when propeller part company will doubt suspect can not possibly prove anything on following morning immediately after breakfast milsom went ashore made arrangement for immediate coaling of yacht while be absent jack macintyre chief engineer got out diving dress thoroughly overhauled charged air cylinder with densely compressed air collected such tool a expected to require for job by time that have be done milsom be back aboard yacht having made arrangement including one be of considerable assistance to jack macintyre consisted of arrangement to take yacht directly alongside coal hulk instead of coaling from lighter advantage to conspirator arose from fact that particular hulk from thetis be to coal lay within short hundred yard of spot where spanish torpedo boat rode at anchor then number of tarpaulin be got up on deck hung over ship side fore aft covering hull from bulwark rail right down to surface of water to protect white paint from defilement by flying coal dust having be done yacht be taken alongside coal hulk process of coaling vessel at once began under joint supervision of milsom second engineer skipper being especially particular in arranging of fender between hull of two craft so fastidiously careful be indeed in matter that finally caused two boom to be rigged out one forward one aft to bear yacht off from side of hulk with result that there be clear space of fully two foot between side of two craft to facilitate a much a possible process of coaling milsom caused broad gangway nearly six foot wide to be rigged between two vessel so that porter might pas to fro freely without obstructing other singularly enough gangway happened to be rigged exactly over ash port be thus quite effectually concealed from view of even most prying eye there undoubtedly be several pair of eye very curiously intently watching everything be happening aboard english yacht not least intent among being of custom house officer who planted upon bridge of thetis fully determined that nothing great small must be passed from yacht to coal hulk without full knowledge consent thus thanks to exceeding care with milsom have made disposition jack who with two montijos be supposed to be down below macintyre fully equipped in diving dress with tool slung to belt have not slightest difficulty in leaving yacht unobserved descending to bottom of harbour by way of diving ladder water being willow tolerably clear sun high enough in heaven to throw strong light down into two adventurer be able to see well enough to be able to pas from yacht to torpedo boat without other guide than of unaided eyesight within ten minute pair found beneath bottom of quarry keel of be a jack have anticipated within about three foot of ground boat found be driven by single propeller protected by skeleton frame forming boat keel sternpost to climb into frame occupied macintyre le than minute helped a be by jack macintyre first act be to subject propeller nut to very careful examination after fixed big spanner in position threw whole weight upon assisted by jack who be pulling at rope attached to extreme end of spanner handle nut however be rusted on so effectually a to be immovable so macintyre climbed down by mean of slate piece of chalk consulted jack a to what be best to be done to overcome difficulty looking up studying structure of boat stern intently jack saw that by steadying by rudder chain must climb up stand upon arm of spanner when by bracing shoulder against boat overhanging stern must bring whole of united strength to bear thus possibly start nut by mean of diagram few word chalked upon slate macintyre be soon made to comprehend what jack meant then climbed up with considerable difficulty arranged in required position then bracing shoulder against vessel two men thrust with might with result that nut suddenly started spanner fell off dropping to bottom of harbour leaving two operator hanging by rudder chain drop from thence to sand however be not above six foot mere trifle in water so let go recovered spanner got to work again once started nut gave very little further difficulty ten minute later be off safely buried out of sight in sand propeller however still remained on shaft might quite possibly continue to remain there for time even must boat get under way moment that stopped engine after once getting under way if must happen to attempt to go astern propeller must at once slip off be lost three quarter of hour from moment of leaving yacht jack macintyre be safely on board again with task accomplished much to satisfaction of party be well on toward lunch time ere yacht bunker be full be able to haul off from coal hulk greater part of afternoon be occupied by crew in washing down deck paint work cleaning up generally polishing brasswork restoring little vessel to normal state of immaculate neatness during jack two montijos took final run ashore for have be decided that failing occurrence of anything to cause alteration of plan must leave for cuba on following day attempt be made to preserve secrecy a to yacht movement on other hand be preparation for departure ostentatiously displayed soon after eight o'clock in morning thin film of smoke be seen to issue from vessel funnel gradually increasing in density became quite apparent to who chose to interest in matter that thetis be getting up steam in readiness to take departure that intended to leave almost immediately be further indicated by arrival alongside of boat containing fresh water other boat containing fresh meat vegetable fruit supply generally there be sign of hurry on board vessel everything be done openly leisurely a be way of people who be taking pleasure be not until nearly five o'clock in afternoon that boat be hoisted to davit thin jet of steam spouting from bow of vessel proclaimed that crew be getting anchor when at length perkins chief mate standing in bow of vessel vociferously announced that anchor be aweigh there be sign of haste anxiety in slow leisurely movement of yacht a swept round in wide circle from spot where have lain at anchor headed seaward by way of west channel dipping ensign to men o ' war in roadstead a went while crew catted fished anchor on appearance above surface then not until then did thetis quicken until be running at speed of about fourteen knot yacht have be under way about hour when jack who with two montijos milsom be on top of deck house diligently watching roadstead have just left exclaimed here come spanish torpedo boat be seen coming along astern with dense cloud of black smoke pouring from funnel water playing like fountain about sharp stem a swept after thetis at full speed milsom looked at long earnestly through binoculars then turned to jack with frown wrinkling brow said by look of boat pace at be coming through water appears to young man that something have gone very seriously wrong with little job that undertook to do yesterday be quite sure that removed nut absolutely certain answered jack cheerfully then how do account for fact that have not yet dropped propeller demanded milsom easily enough answered jack got under way like ourselves by steaming ahead sweeping round in wide circle so long a engine continue to turn ahead propeller will probably retain position on shaft kept there by pressure of water on blade moment that eas down will probably drop off if not then certainly will at instant when engine be stopped be alarmed phil have only to cause to stop engine will see what will happen then said milsom a laid hand upon bridge telegraph signalled full speed ahead will entice bit farther out to sea before do anything more if run out of sight of anchorage before breaking down will get nice little start will probably not be interfered with for rest of trip ah there be edge of bank ahead of a line of demarcation between pale greenish blue water over reef deep blue water beyond became visible let go off to due south to quartermaster at wheel will try to persuade that be bound for havana stern chase be long chase especially when one craft have five six mile start of other pursuing craft have only single knot perhaps not quite so much a advantage in speed be consequently not until brief dusk be deepening into darkness great mellow star be leaping into view in rapidly deepening azure of sky that thetis being by time about midway between key west havana milsom rang down to engine room for half speed allowed torpedo boat to range up abreast of yacht did at distance of about quarter of mile without making attempt to speak to interfere with english vessel merely slowing down to regulate pace to of yacht then milsom spoke down through voice tube ordering engine to be first stopped then to go slowly at gradually increasing speed astern by mean quite expected to induce commander of torpedo boat to stop result be everything must have be desired for a soon a spaniard realised that be running ahead of yacht in most unaccountable way stopped engine waited patiently for other vessel to overtake propeller doubtless slipping off tail shaft going to bottom at instant of stopping of engine while torpedo boat deprived of drag of propeller continued to forge strongly ahead under impetus of own momentum thetis be even more rapidly widening distance between herself torpedo boat by going full speed astern until when two craft be separated by three mile of heaving water perplexed astounded spanish lieutenant still ignorant of what have happened made up mind to go back to see what english ship be about ordering helm to be put hard over rang down to engine room for full speed ahead then furious racing of engine a steam be admitted into cylinder revealed ghastly truth that have lost propeller be absolutely helpless with nearest land fully forty mile away rushed from bridge down into tiny engine room to consult with explosively reprimand engineer for permitting mishap to occur at length when vexation have worked off returned to deck gave order for signal of distress to be made by mean of rocket to english yacht by time thetis have vanished in darkness did re appear although unfortunate lieutenant expended entire stock of rocket in vain attempt to attract attention chapter five spanish majesty gunboat tiburon meanwhile saloon party on board thetis having comfortably bestowed in capacious basket chair under awning on top of deck house when yacht got under way watched with mingled interest amusement strenuous pursuit of own vessel by spanish torpedo boat when at length milsom gave order for yacht engine to be first stopped then sent astern with one accord rose to foot brought glass to bear upon torpedo boat intent upon seeing what must next happen for although darkness have by time fallen night be beautifully fine clear mellow lustre of innumerable star shed soft light upon scene enabled watcher with aid of powerful night glass to perceive with very tolerable distinctness might happen within so short distance a quarter of mile even twice a far presently jack spoke have stopped think said at event can no longer distinguish phosphorescent wake made by propeller if be case will have more trouble from of course must have be easy enough for to have made pursuit impossible by removing propeller when be working at yesterday thought occurred to that have done so removal might have be discovered in case be quite possible that suspicion even though of very vague doubtful character might have fastened upon with result at future time when may be vitally important for to repeat trick such precaution might be taken a must render repetition impossible a be craft have be under steam for couple of hour during to appearance nothing be wrong with think therefore anyone be in least likely to connect with mishap agreed milsom thing be most excellently done jack must not possibly have be better managed mishap will wear aspect of ordinary accident of sea have longer head upon than can boast lad must never have thought a far ahead a did think be far enough away from that boat now to allow of resuming voyage signalled to engine room first to stop then to go full speed ahead port helm quartermaster said to helmsman until head due north then give very small touch of starboard helm just enough to enable to make wide circle round that torpedo boat out yonder until head work round to south west by west when can steady at course explained to companion ought to run within sight of light on jutias about three bell in middle watch when do suppose will reach destination captain asked don laguna de cortes oh about breakfast time to morrow morning if keep boat running at full speed meet with interruption on way answered milsom hillo exclaimed jack see that rocket phil look a though might have be sent up by torpedo boat will be somewhere out in direction wo ay there thereabout answered milsom glancing into compass bowl to get bearing of rocket mean that have just discovered loss of propeller be in trouble about hope that crew of boat be in danger exclaimed don hermoso anxiously have wish that must come to harm need to worry about senor answered weather be fine boat doubt sound enough worst be likely to happen to be that will have to stay where be until something come along tow into havana at moment dinner gong sounded little party retired below when jack went up on deck next morning a ship bell be striking eight saw that yacht be running along with head to eastward within about mile of low land dotted with tree stretched ahead astern of for several mile on port hand terminating at extremity in low headland inland at distance of about twenty five mile rose long range of hill low mountain appeared to rise to height of something between two thousand three thousand foot good morning jack cheerily exclaimed skipper a singleton ran up ladder on to top of deck house glorious morning be be going to be roasting hot little later on sun have sting already in spite of piping easterly breeze yes agreed jack if be hot here what must be ashore where be now skipper pretty close to destination be thankful to say answered milsom point astern be cape corrientes point ahead be mangle point four mile beyond be cape france where will run in upon bank shoal extends eastward for something like one hundred sixty mile to end of jardinillos hill inland there be called organ mountain though to mind name be much too grandiloquent for such insignificant elevation hope that pilot chap who be to take into lagoon will be keeping bright lookout for have just be having squint at chart tell jack that half like idea of taking little beauty in over precious bank where must be easiest thing in world to rip bottom out of on unsuspected upstanding coral snag mean to go dead slow while that be on that bank can tell although happen to know greater part of a well a know own back garden be perhaps because know so well that like so little ah a yacht swung round point have be approaching opened out for about four mile farther on there be cape france there be bank showing up plainly enough that be where colour of water change from dark blue to almost white now be time for to hoist signal by pilot be to identify perkins have goodness to bend on y run up to fore truck if please minute later don hermoso carlos made appearance on top of deck house just a y rectangular flag composed of red yellow diagonal stripe went soaring up to fore mast head good morning jack good morning captain said don hermoso be that red yellow flag prearranged signal agreed upon for identification by pilot people on shore be senor answered milsom there be cape france on port bow doubt recognise if pilot be keeping proper lookout ought to spot immediately upon rounding point doubt will captain returned don hermoso so that be cape france recognise senor for have never before passed at sea be sierra de los organos yonder sierra del rosario farther on to right recognise of course yes surely just to right of isolated peak can see what must certainly be town of pinar del rio be not far from home now carlos if go well with to day ought to night to sleep in own casa see dear little isolda once more child will rejoice to have with again yes said carlos will not only rejoice to see again to know that be once more on spot to look after in last letter to received at key west mentioned that don sebastian alvaros have be most persistent visitor to house ever since left cuba have doubt of man did not mention matter to when received letter a did not wish to make feel uneasy now that may hope to be at home to night think only right that must know ah remarked don hermoso will see that don sebastian visit be discouraged henceforth be true that know nothing against indeed be spoken of a very promising officer still like carlos altogether trust be not precisely desirable acquaintance will endeavour to make understand that be not wanted at hacienda at moment thetis passed cape france opened out into bay of cortes there be destination gentleman said milsom pointing to projecting bluff eight nine mile up coast that bluff be piedras point beyond be laguna de cortes pirate lagoon a people call here be at edge of bank from point onward intend to proceed very cautiously indeed so saying laid hand upon handle of engine room telegraph rang down for half speed calling down voice tube moment later for engine to be run dead slow a yacht slowed up passed from dark blue of deep water to pale whitish blue of willow water cover immense coral reef known locally a bank mr perkins shouted milsom must have man a lookout at foremast head if please have better bend boatswain chair on to gaff topsail halyard send up in a will require to stay there until be safely at anchor when have done that rouse cable on deck see everything ready for letting go jack can spare eye for nothing ship just now so oblige will by taking glass say whether can see anything in shape of boat coming toward with flag flying between while may just look carefully along coast to see if can spot guarda costa hovering about want to be caught napping in act of landing stuff jack took glass out of case swept whole of visible coast for time without result there be nothing under sail steam to be seen in direction at length however when yacht have arrived within about two mile of piedras point small pirogue under sail suddenly shot out from behind point heading to southward close hauled carried sprit mainsail jib at top end of sprit there fluttered diminutive replica of red yellow flag be flying from fore truck of yacht ah exclaimed jack a brought glass to bear upon boat here come pilot phil at last be flying right signal so suppose may take for granted that coast be clear yes see answered milsom keep away couple of point quartermaster give boat chance to fetch be coming alongside masthead there keep very bright lookout man for sunken rock there be plenty of to be found here if be looked for ay ay sir answered man have passed few already did say anything because be headin ' so a to hit ten minute later pirogue be close at hand milsom rang down signal to stop pirogue be very quaint looking craft of about twenty foot in length by five foot beam formed out of solid log of wood have be roughly trimmed with axe to form bottom portion of with couple of plank above to form top side although trade wind be blowing quite fresh queer looking craft carried ballast properly so called to prevent from capsizing couple of negro stood on weather gunwale holding on to rope attached to masthead leaning back almost horizontally out over water third negro attired in picturesquely dirty shirt trouser rolled up above knee with most shockingly dilapidated straw hat on head steered little craft by mean of broad bladed paddle laid out over lee quarter primitive however a craft be in appearance came through water at most astonishing rate presently shot up alongside under lee of yacht two negro who acted a ballast smartly recovering springing inboard a did so rope end be thrown down into picturesque individual who have be steering nimbly climbed up side of yacht stepped on deck where be met by don hermoso buenos dia senor exclaimed fellow doffing ragged head covering with flourish grace of grandee cuba be ready be password be to prove bona fides of man also be ready answered don hermoso be coast clear quite clear senor answered man who by way be turtle fisher inhabiting hut on one of small cay stretched across entrance of lagoon yacht be approaching gunboat have be cruising about bay of late steamed away yesterday morning after communicating with shore have seen nothing of since then have better proceed forthwith get work over whilst opportunity be favourable remarked don hermoso what be name by by pedro senor pedro velasquez answered man good said don hermoso follow up to bridge pedro be pilot captain continued introducing negro to milsom who looked at quizzically responded to bow by somewhat curtly bidding good morning say that coast be clear so may a well proceed forthwith how do steer pedro keep offing of mile to allow of room for turning to get straight run in for present may head for white building on hillside yonder answered pedro being clear to milsom latter touched telegraph yacht proceeded with pirogue astern in tow presently three small cay detached from mainland revealing fine spacious expanse of land locked water behind when little later thetis have brought largest cay fair abeam pilot waved hand helm be put hard starboard vessel bow be pointed straight for channel between northernmost cay mainland must enter channel very slowly senor cautioned pedro for navigation of be rather awkward doubt whether vessel of size have ever before be taken into lagoon with engine going dead slow occasionally stopping altogether to deaden way yacht crept cautiously along until having passed critical danger spot slid into lagoon be now seen to be sheet of water four mile long by about two mile broad trending due north south with creek in north west corner toward bow of vessel be turned speed being quickened up to about eight knot ten minute later pilot gave word to be ready to anchor engine be stopped then sent astern minute afterwards yacht having be brought to standstill anchor be let go voyager found riding in fine snug harbour absolutely safe in weather perfectly screened from view of anything everything might chance to pas outside sooner be anchor down than creek abreast yacht be moored began to swarm with boat of shape size came hurrying out to receive transfer to shore case of arm ammunition dynamite lead supply of kind lay snugly stowed away beneath floor of ship saloon while entire strength of yacht crew be employed upon task of breaking out package conveying on deck boat crew be coloured men mostly negro in leading boat there came mulatto bearing letter from rabi then leader of insurgent to don hermoso authorising bearer one jose seguin to receive contraband be now passed down into boat with possible speed a rumour have reached place that strong body of spanish troop be in neighbourhood might make appearance at moment did not turn up however by two o'clock in afternoon scrap of incriminating material be out of yacht on way to headquarters of insurgent somewhere up in organ mountain scrap be to say except four pound quick firers two maxim with store of ammunition constituted armament of yacht weapon have not thus far be mounted having be deemed inadvisable to make so unusual display a of armed yacht in harbour of key west lest undue attention must be attracted to vessel inconvenient question asked now by milsom advice got weapon up mounted so that in event of vessel being searched by spanish authority there must be nothing in nature of concealed weapon on board to afford excuse for making of trouble thus by end of afternoon watch yacht be again spruce clean a new pin made very brave show with brand new silver bright gun grinning threateningly out over rail two maxim ready for action on top of deck house appearance said a plainly a word touch who dare yet armament be not boisterously aggressive considering that presumptive owner have set out from england with very settled programme possibility ere returned might be moved to visit spot where despite rapid spread of civilisation might be still right hurry confusion incidental to landing of yacht cargo of contraband have be so great that such orderly meal a usual luncheon have be out of question everybody have eaten drunk a worked snatching mouthful gulp when must little saloon party be consequently now gathered on top of deck house getting early afternoon tea while anchor be being hove up by mean of steam windlass prior to vessel proceeding to sea again don hermoso have be congratulating everybody else upon ease complete success with yacht primary mission have be accomplished have also expressed very nicely a to magnitude of obligation to jack milsom for invaluable assistance have rendered without don declared adventure must never have be brought to successful issue now dear jack continued have two further favour to ask first be that will have goodness to land carlos a soon a may be at calonna be about twenty two mile to eastward of in order that may take train thence to pinar del rio in time perhaps to reach home to night second be that will favour with company for a long time a may be disposed to stay then having landed captain milsom can take yacht round to havana when if island prof to be sufficiently quiet to allow of vessel being left in perkins charge will feel happy if also with bow to milsom will honour poor house with presence for time until indeed yacht be again required for service jack accepted invitation promptly unhesitatingly carlos be old chum indeed almost like brother while a for don hermoso jack have seen enough of during voyage out to have contracted for feeling of highest regard esteem knew that invitation be a earnest cordial a word must make conversation have be engaged in from time to time on board yacht have caused to become profoundly interested in cuba filled with intense desire to see island if possible be eye witness of struggle for liberty milsom on other hand while perhaps a keen a jack to see that there be to be seen be above before thing else sailor acceptance of don hermoso invitation therefore be qualified by sundry condition one of have reference to question of safety of yacht by time that conversation have reached point anchor be trip milsom went to engine room telegraph while quartermaster climbed up to bridge stationed at wheel velasquez be no longer on board milsom having informed that must now dispense with service for be one of lieutenant philip milsom characteristic that when have once witnessed navigation of particular passage must at time thereafter perform same feat of navigation therefore now took sole charge of yacht skilfully navigated out of lagoon into open sea setting course for calonna after again calmly seated at table asked for cup of tea yacht running at about eleven knot have accomplished little more than distance between lagoon calonna when smoke be seen ahead few minute later steamer be made out coming toward there be nothing alarming in of course for small coasting steamer be constantly plying between various port along coast of cuba be not long ere became apparent from rig of approaching craft be that of three masted schooner that be government vessel probably gunboat milsom made secret of relief at fact that everything of compromising nature have be safely got out of thetis doubt might have existed a to character of stranger be soon dispelled for when arrived within about mile of thetis hoisted spanish naval ensign at mizen peak slowing down rounded to athwart yacht course at same time hoisting international signal heave to be sending boat what be proper thing to do phil demanded jack when milsom read out interpretation of signal have no right to stop have certainly not answered milsom if suspect of intention to smuggle may follow watch of course to stop in high handed fashion be coming rather too strong know that be english yacht for there be ensign burgee to bear witness to fact nevertheless since have happily got rid of everything of compromising nature may a well heave to allow to board when jack in character a owner may make a much fuss a please more better threaten to report also to complain to government of insult outrage to have subjected in short bluff for that be worth right said jack will when further remark be cut short by flash of gun jet of smoke spouting from bow of gunboat next instant twenty four pound round shot came ricochetting toward yacht missing by only about dozen yard confound fellow impudence exclaimed milsom a dashed at bridge telegraph signalled to stop engine must rightly serve if be to return fire perhaps wisest plan most dignified will be to stop let come aboard give hot for firing upon british flag make sit up only wish must jabber spanish a fluently a do 'd scare out of skin a yacht with way that have on gradually drifted down toward gunboat be seen that latter be preparing to lower boat presently gig manned by six oarsman coxswain be hauled up to gangway down ladder of officer in lieutenant uniform presently descended stepping into boat then pushed off headed toward thetis meanwhile milsom having said few hasty word to perkins yacht gangway have be thrown open accommodation ladder lowered when presently spanish boat dashed alongside hooked on jack milsom be standing just inside gangway waiting to receive officer be rather good looking man somewhere about thirty year of age a sprang up ladder in on deck touched peak of uniform cap by way of salute milsom saw eyebrow go up a eye fell upon two quick firers graced yacht after deck good afternoon gentleman said in almost perfect english what ship be leave to jack whispered milsom upon discovering welcome fact that must make understood without waiting for jack consent stepped forward answered be english yacht thetis of royal thames yacht club a may see by looking at ensign what ship be that sir doe captain of mean by firing upon that ship senor be spanish majesty gunboat tiburon sent out especially to look for vessel answered officer government have received positive intelligence from reliable source that have on board large consignment of arm ammunition destined for use of cuban insurgent instruction be to seize vessel take into havana fired upon because be somewhat slow in obeying summons to stop oh said milsom so be how matter stand be do suppose sir great britain will allow flag to be fired on without having something to say about great britain will scarcely be willing to protect vessel under shelter of flag be engaged in succouring who be rebelling against rule of friendly nation remarked officer in case be prepared to take consequence of act know so called yacht to be smuggler of contraband of war intend to seize what if be to tell that have not ounce of contraband of war on board enquired milsom captain must simply not believe senor answered spaniard will therefore be pleased to regard vessel a prize yourselves a prisoner stepped quickly to gangway called to armed crew of boat to come out of a did so milsom put whistle to lip blew short shrill blast there instantly followed rush of bare foot along deck a spaniard passed in through yacht gangway found confronted with thirty stalwart british seaman with drawn cutlass in hand revolver in belt caramba what doe mean senor demanded spanish lieutenant starting back in dismay at unexpected denouement mean just senor teniente answered milsom intend to stand nonsense of description go back to ship tell captain that since somebody seems to have sent out on fool errand owner here senor don john singleton will purely a act of courtesy mind permit to search ship from stem to stern from keel to truck in order that may thoroughly satisfy yourselves that have contraband whether of war otherwise on board there will be seizure of ship understand that act must be outrage to flag a may see be ready willing to resist also will please tell captain that demand ample apology for high handed behaviour in daring to fire upon carrajo senor be very big word ought to be perfectly certain of before use be offensive sir spanish officer allows one to use such word to with impunity exclaimed spaniard sir retorted behaviour of captain in firing upon yacht be offensive will find that can not treat englishman in fashion with impunity there be right wrong way of doing thing captain have chosen wrong way will therefore be made to suffer for will see senor englishman will see returned spaniard then be to understand that refuse to surrender ship yes sir answered milsom be precisely what wish to understand wish to understand further that if dare to attempt force will treat a pirate sink despite flag see have mean power to carry out threat waving hand first towards gun then towards men very well senor answered spaniard livid with rage at being thus hectored before own men will tell captain what say will be for to decide how will deal with if rested with must blow ship out of water will remember face senor may be that day will meet on shore expect to be in havana to morrow next day senor teniente will afford greatest pleasure to meet there answered milsom good afternoon forget to tell captain that if chooses to come on board in friendly way owner here will be very pleased to see to show over ship can look into nook cranny of if will afford satisfaction to do so spanish lieutenant bowed without speaking signed to men to go back into boat followed down side five minute later jack milsom saw gesticulating violently on gunboat quarter deck a related to commander of craft version of recent interview chapter six commander don luis y albuquerque say phil seemed to have knife into spaniard said jack a milsom stood watching gunboat appeared to take delight in rubbing fur wrong way yes agreed milsom meditatively be afraid did be afraid too went just little farther than there be strict need for then beggar put back up to start with by firing at have contented with pitching shot across fore foot must not have minded so much fired to hit if must then lieutenant must need come swaggering aboard here putting on side threatening actually threatening with arrest imprisonment goodness know what else only wish must try to take must teach that pay to be civil to englishman well what dickens be laughing at for jack have burst into hearty peal of laughter oh phil phil jack exclaimed when at length have regained control of be a good a pantomime idea of of men complaining of other fellow having threatened put on side why man alive be just a exasperating a must possibly be to poor chap a to threatening why be simply breathing out threatenings slaughter will have to keep weather eye lifting hearty when get round to havana for fellow will look out for force into fight a sure a egg be egg right answered milsom will not disappoint if want fighting will have a much a can take after jack have doubt be right be bit trying ' a poor mother used to say then see be bluffing ' doing virtuous indignation business that know for be necessary to persuade gentleman that be absolutely virtuous innocent must never do to allow to entertain slightest shred of suspicion of vessel otherwise must be continually watching ah a expected here come skipper to have talk with also to have look round expect that after what lieutenant have told be feeling bit uncomfortable must be civil to smooth down for after there be nothing to be gained by making enemy without good sufficient cause perhaps in character of owner of ship have better tackle fellow then will have opportunity to witness skill a diplomatist accordingly when captain of gunboat entered yacht gangway be jack who received milsom simply standing by a sort of supporter new arrival be man apparently few year older than lieutenant very distinguished looking for commander of mere gunboat with considerably more polished affable manner than man who have preceded raised cap at jack salutation said in english good afternoon gentleman be given to understand by lieutenant that most unfortunate mistake appears to have in inexplicable manner arisen in connection with vessel have come on board for purpose of putting matter right if possible be most welcome senor capitan answered jack cordially will be very pleased to render assistance in power more so since be very anxious to see a much a possible of beautiful island may perhaps remain here for time indeed may say that one reason for visit to cuba be have have idea of investing in tobacco plantation here indeed senor observed spaniard information pointed to very different reason for visit a lieutenant have already informed have be led to believe that presence of yacht in cuban water be due to sympathy on part with insurgent determination to assist by smuggling munition of war into country for use a lieutenant have also informed tiburon have be sent out specially for purpose of seizing vessel yes said jack suavely lieutenant mentioned that fact in somewhat emphatic language so emphatic indeed that if may be permitted to say so be almost offensive captain felt bound to adopt somewhat vigorous speech in expressing disapproval not only of behaviour also of of government be not usual senor a must know for englishman visiting foreign country in own yacht to have vessel seized upon strength of mere rumour must allow to say that in acting a have done consider government have not only be precipitate have also behaved in such manner a will evoke very strong protest from own british government senor be not wont to have flag fired upon without exacting ample reparation be quite clear that spanish officer be beginning to feel exceedingly uncomfortable be silent for several second appeared to be reviewing situation at length said senor must not blame government for indiscretion of one of officer personally be responsible for act of firing upon ship now acknowledge to have be quite unjustifiable act for beg to tender most sincere profound apology although must be allowed to say that fired under impression that intended to disregard summons to heave to be afraid senor said jack that explanation doe not go very far toward mending matter for contention be that have right to stop on high sea will allow to pas will accept apology for have wish whatever to make matter unpleasant for personally for government on contrary be anxious to establish most amicable relation possible between spanish authority during stay in island therefore having made protest will say no more about a there appears to have be suspicion with regard to character of yacht must insist that someone on behalf will examine vessel at once that through government may be completely satisfied that such suspicion be absolutely groundless senor said spaniard overwhelm with generous consideration if will kindly permit must like a well for justification a for own to look over vessel in order may be in position to absolutely assure superior that suspicion be without foundation to prevent possibility of future misunderstanding must like lieutenant to be present at inspection if will be so very good a to permit by mean answered jack cordially pray send boat for lieutenant other officer whom must like to be present more better for senor must understand that wish inspection of yacht to be thorough exhaustive spaniard bowed stepping to gangway called down to coxswain instructing to proceed to gunboat request lieutenant fernandez to come on board english yacht forthwith then during short interval between dispatch return of boat spanish commander chatted affably with jack milsom upon indifferent subject incidentally introducing a commander luis y albuquerque lieutenant fernandez be in much more subdued mood when returned than have be upon departure from thetis probably have done hard thinking in interim have come to recognise possibility that trouble might be looming ahead of at event manner be courtesy politeness a again stepped in through gangway senor fernandez said don luis be very much afraid that from what don juan singleton have told there have be most serious mistake somewhere that have thus be betrayed into unwittingly inflicting most unprovoked affront upon english gentleman senor singleton have however with bow to jack be good enough to accept explanation apology therefore venture to hope that may now consider incident a closed senor singleton insists quite justifiably think that will satisfy a to falsity of statement that be carrying munition of war have therefore sent for to accompany on tour of inspection through yacht must make so thorough that there will be possibility of aspersion being hereafter cast upon integrity of don juan vessel now senor to jack be ready to accompany very well said jack where must like to begin forward aft perhaps may a well begin forward work way aft answered spanish commander right acquiesced jack captain milsom be so good a to give instruction for two three men to attend below with lantern meanwhile gentleman perhaps will give boat overhaul will have canvas cover stripped off oh senor protested don luis there be not slightest necessity for to go to such extreme length a for assuming for moment that actually have contraband on board must not be in least likely to carry stowed in boat now offer of jack be piece of bluff for boat be only place that did not wish spaniard to examine since in one of be stowed submarine sight of knew must be likely to give rise to renewed suspicion a have seen bluff worked to perfection possibly in consequence of slight none le perceptible tone of sarcasm in jack made offer with feeling of carefully suppressed relief jack accordingly led spaniard forward to forecastle down into party descended where found three men one of whom be carpenter awaiting with lighted lantern forecastle be soon examined then hatch of forepeak be lifted that darksome storehouse very carefully explored there be passage from forepeak into hold a collision bulkhead ran from keelson right up to deck jack having pointed out fact party emerged on deck descended into officer quarter proceeding from thence down into main hold where found nothing iron ballast water tank one of jack insisted must be opened looked into thence proceeded to engine room stokehold where found much to admire in scrupulous cleanliness unusual form of machinery sign trace of anything in nature of contraband then entered main saloon examined sleeping cabin finishing up with steward storeroom sail room powder magazine jack be quite prepared to be questioned about last be have answer ready be usual senor singleton for english yacht to go a heavily armed a vessel be suavely enquired don luis not when cruising in home water answered jack when intention be to cruise foreign a phrase especially if cruise be to be round world be usually considered prudent to provide vessel with armament sufficiently powerful to protect from attack of pirate malay chinese so on in fact aggressor of description for instance continued maliciously if have not happened to have be armed to day just consider senor how unpleasant must have be predicament at moment don luis frowned pardon senor said hope be not labouring under misapprehension that be because of ship being armed have refrained from arresting suggestion be injurious senor freedom be due entirely to fact accepted assurance offered to lieutenant fernandez be willing to believe that unfortunate mistake have somehow arisen trust will also believe that have mistake resulted in unpleasant consequence to yourself government must have hastened to make most ample reparation on instant of discovering that wrong have be done a will now if insist pray say more interrupted jack have not slightest desire to place either personally government in embarrassing position if therefore be fully satisfied that information respecting yacht be wrong be quite willing to regard incident a closed to say nothing further about in proof of friendly disposition permit to say that will afford very great pleasure if lieutenant will give pleasure of company at dinner to night don luis very courteously declined jack polite invitation upon plea that felt to be imperative duty to return forthwith to havana to report to authority there full true circumstance of case in order that jack might be subjected to further annoyance from unfortunate blunder have somehow be made doubt true explanation of refusal be to be found in fact that exceedingly sensitive pride be hurt by jack innuendo by fact that have be placed in false somewhat ridiculous position be bad enough to be made to appear ridiculous in eye of one own people to be humiliated before one of arrogant overbearing englishman caramba two spaniard therefore took most ceremonious leave of jack milsom descended to boat pulled back to own ship immediately started engine steamed away to westward dipping colour in salute a went while thetis resumed course to eastward in direction of calonna off arrived about hour later delay occasioned by incident of yacht encounter with gunboat have be just sufficient to prevent arrival of thetis until after last train of day have left calonna for pinar del rio don hermoso therefore decided to remain on board yacht night to leave in time to take first train on following morning naturally enough chief topic of conversation at dinner table night be encounter with gunboat clever manner in spaniard have be bluffed don hermoso maintaining that be entirely due to jack skill in gentle art that suspicion have appeared to enter head of spaniard that contraband have already be got rid of matter be very freely discussed be finally decided that on whole be very fortunate circumstance not only that encounter have taken place that have occurred where when did for ignorance of spanish authority a to speed of yacht must naturally preclude suspicion that vessel have already spent hour in discharging cargo while very complete thorough search to yacht have be subjected be of course conclusive so far a non existence of contraband on board at moment be concerned only point upon jack have uneasiness be fact of yacht being so formidably armed have given what regarded a very clever ingenious explanation of circumstance hoped must prove completely satisfactory be nevertheless not wholly free from doubt on matter on following morning two montijos jack be astir betimes in order to catch early train to pinar del rio nine o'clock found ashore on platform waiting for train to emerge from siding into have be shunted calonna be not at time important place be cuban railway system remarkable for efficiency nothing need therefore be said about save after jolting through exceedingly beautiful country grew more beautiful with mile of progress upon gradually rising gradient traveller be safely landed in city of pinar del rio distance of fifteen mile from calonna in trifle over hour here senor montijo private carriage somewhat cumbersome four wheeled affair fitted with leather awning curtain to protect occupant from sun rain drawn by four horse off leader being ridden by postilion while wheeler be driven from box be awaiting having be sent in from house on preceding day luggage having be securely strapped on to platform attached to rear of coach don hermoso signed to jack to enter vehicle placed by jack side be followed by carlos when affair got under way with tremendous amount of shouting whip cracking went rolling rumbling jolting down narrow street so out into country there be drive of about sixteen mile farther inland toward organ mountain before ere must arrive at hacienda montijo although road be abominable heat intense jack declared that have never so thoroughly enjoyed drive in life for country be somewhat rugged scenery therefore very lovely road being bordered on side by field of tobacco sugar here there patch of cool green indian corn divided from road by low hedge be just then perfect blaze of multi coloured flower of various description be fairly busy scene too for tobacco be ripe field be alive with labourer of colour from full blooded negro to pure spaniard gathering crop at length when have be travelling for about couple of hour when despite charm of everything that saw around jack began to grow conscious of fact that be aching in joint from rolling jolting of carriage vehicle turned off main road into lane access to be gained through pair of massive timber gate hung upon pier of ancient moss grown masonry don hermoso announced that be now upon own demesne here at once jack became conscious of very great change in appearance of everything for not only be road upon be travelling smooth well kept field on hand instead of being half choked with weed a have be case with most of that have passed be scrupulously clean while labourer instead of being picturesque scarecrow be decently clad worked a men do who be content happy man of be clearly on lookout for carriage have word of respectful greeting for returning master while what be perhaps stranger still don hermoso seemed to intimately know man woman child on place though there be hundred of at length bend in road brought house in sight at distance of about mile jack saw before perched on shoulder of low eminence long white bungalow like structure with high thatched roof gallery veranda running along whole length of front apparently along side also building be of one storey only although veranda be so broad a to cast whole of front into deep shadow seemed to jack that front be pierced by at least dozen door window a jack looked two female figure clad in white suddenly made appearance in centre of gallery so beautifully clear be atmosphere even at distance must be distinctly seen that be waving pocket handkerchief to occupant of coach carlos also saw frantically waved panama by way of reply shouting a did so hurrah padre hurrah jack look there be madre isolda out on gallery waving to will bet that have be watching bend of road through opera glass for last hour more doubtless answered don hermoso laughing happily a too leaned out of coach to wave greeting since did not arrive last night a arranged have naturally expected to turn up early morning winding hither thither along hillside in order to secure even easy gradient road presently left tobacco field passed between broad space of lawn luxuriantly clad with guinea grass having large parterre of flower scattered about here there while in other place be picturesquely broken up by clump of feathery bamboo gigantic wild cotton other tree at length with final dash grand flourish carriage drew up in front of broad flight of stone step led up scarped flower strewn face of mound upon house be built one of two female figure came rushing down step bareheaded despite almost vertical sun flung into outstretched arm of don hermoso while other followed in somewhat more stately dignified manner then when don hermoso have released first figure from embrace turned hat in hand to meet second senorita isolda treated brother carlos to like greeting after turned with sunny smile eye flashing welcome to jack isolda exclaimed carlos performing ceremony of introduction a will of course have guessed be old friend chum jack singleton to whom be so deeply indebted for very valuable assistance that have rendered in great undertaking be best friend comrade that ever lived therefore give cordial welcome for sake dear give thousand welcome senor jack exclaimed impulsively a offered hand thousand thanks for that have done for father carlos be delighted that have be able to come to for seem to know quite well carlos have talked so often about of what used to do together in old day at dulwich feel quite impossible to regard a stranger for perhaps first time in life jack singleton found at loss for word a rule have plenty to say for now found suddenly dumb have heard friend carlos speak of sister isolda with patronising brotherly affection a good child nice little thing not bad sort so on seemed to remember that only day two ago carlos have casually mentioned that sister be just sixteen year of age have therefore pictured girl to a hoyden in transition stage of frock be short long betwixt between girl with hair flying loose about shoulder in short girl now unprepared found grasping hand of glorious creature of absolutely dazzling loveliness with face form manner of irresistibly fascinating woman who despite sixteen year of age looked a though might be quite twenty stammered out few halting stumbling word of thanks for kindly welcome of feeling time that must have liked to kick for stupid gaucherie then turned to receive greeting of senora montijo lady be simply older edition of lovely daughter with more composed stately manner welcome to jack be cordiality presently turned made way into house entered by way of wide doorway furnished with two leaf now thrown wide open upper panel of be fitted with venetian lattice for admission of air exclusion of too ardent beam of sun doorway gave entrance to large marble paved hall extending entire depth of house from front to back a be to be seen from fact that door opposite that by party have just entered stood wide open through must be seen broad veranda running along back of house beyond must be caught glimpse of what appeared to be kind of courtyard with more lawn flower bed handsome fountain in centre hall be adorned with beautiful flowering plant in large tub furnished with abundant supply of settee luxuriously cushioned basket chair seemed to be used a kind of lounging place for be eminently adapted since two open door caused constant draught of comparatively cool air through apartment there be few good picture on wall a well a gun rack well fitted with sporting gun rifle hatstand in addition to legitimate use formed convenient support for sundry riding whip pair of spur two passage leading to right left out of hall gave access a jack subsequently discovered to room located at extremity of building now jack old chap said carlos linking arm in of friend after moment murmured conversation with mother let take to room will be glad to have wash brush up after dusty journey by time that be ready second breakfast will be served so saying conducted singleton out through rear door of hall into back veranda a jack now saw ran not only along entire rear face of main building also along face of two wing projected therefrom at right angle one at end of house wing appeared provided sleeping accommodation bathroom lavatory so on of establishment beyond again be kitchen other domestic office coach house stable with lawn fountain flower bed between building being shaded not only by broad veranda also by row of orange lemon lime peach tree fragrance from imparted indescribably refreshing character to air turning to left a emerged from hall carlos conducted friend along left wing until reached last door one young cuban threw open ushering friend into neatly furnished clean bedroom in jack overland trunk have already be deposited madre have put in here jack carlos explained because room face east will therefore be cool when turn in at night while tree in front shield from morning sun also be next to men bathroom therefore will be handy for bath night morning now there be water soap towel if require anything else shout for antonio will bring want breakfast will be ready in quarter of hour chapter seven don sebastian alvaros threatens trouble second breakfast in west indie be equivalent of luncheon in england except that former be perhaps more elaborate meal of two when therefore jack escorted by carlos entered fine airy dining room at once became evident that be about to sit down to very substantial repast for be not at sorry a long journey have given most excellent appetite moreover have by time recovered equilibrium have be so seriously disturbed by first sight of senorita isolda have again found use of tongue be therefore very gay happy quintette arranged around well furnished table jack be of course by time on almost a intimate term with don hermoso a be with carlos presently discovered that lady be disposed to treat rather a old friend than a new acquaintance told that visit to cuba promised to be one of most pleasant experience of life meal over don hermoso excused a there be naturally many matter demanding earliest attention after long absence from home while senora have household affair to attend to carlos therefore took task of entertaining jack upon with sister a chief assistant proposed ride a there be many charming spot in neighbourhood that wished friend to see horse be accordingly ordered three young people despising usual afternoon siesta set off taking path led upward through wild most picturesque ravine down mountain stream brawled foamed murmurous tumult of water mingling musically with sough of wind in multitudinous tree clothed hillside imparting most welcome sensation of coolness to atmosphere rode at foot pace first because be in hurry secondly because path be narrow rough there being room only for two rider abreast carlos therefore led way with jack dona isolda following close at horse tail have not be ten minute under way when arrived at spot marvellous natural beauty of caused jack to exclaim aloud in astonishment for upon rounding bend in path found in little amphitheatre about five hundred yard across tree clad side of rose precipitously to great height on hand be gorgeous with great clustering bloom of imaginable hue from purest white through shade of colour to deep rich purple looked almost black where seen in shadow while air almost motionless down in hollow be heavy with mingling of thousand exquisite perfume floor of amphitheatre consisted of great basin of rock partly filled with fine white sand brought down from upland during countless generation by flow of stream basin being brimful of crystal clear water came pouring plashing into from above over series of miniature cataract lowest of about twelve foot high impinged upon small ledge of rock projected into basin for space of about yard said carlos be swimming bath to often come for dip in early morning be absolutely private being own property nobody ever pass here what think of jack be not perfect jack pronounced magnificent there then undertook to join carlos in dip on following other morning during stay water be about twenty foot deep place be consequently perfect for swimming in by side of road at spot where there happened to be few square yard of level ground surface have be cleared of luxuriant undergrowth small bathing house containing two dressing room one for sex have be erected here bathing dress be kept necessary change of costume made having spent little time in admiring glorious bathing pool party moved onward again following ever rising path at length after most delightful ride of about five mile through continuous succession of scene of surpassing beauty emerged upon open tableland from most extensive glorious view of mile upon mile of southern slope of island be to be obtained with sea shining in soft opalescent tint beyond isla de pinos with three curiously shaped mountain lying on horizon white sail of few coasting craft gleamed pearl like here there just discernible at distance jack searched watery expanse for sign of thetis have vanished doubtless be on other side of cape san antonio by time therefore well on way round to havana being thus reminded of existence of yacht jack be suddenly inspired with brilliant idea promptly communicated to carlos look here carlos old chap exclaimed if yacht be not likely to be required for other service just at present why must not take cruise in round island over to jamaica from whence might even go on to of other island be sure that trip must do mother sister vast amount of good have ever be out of cuba senorita never answered dona isolda be born here le lucky than carlos be also educated here so that know nothing about great outside world save have read of in book havana be conception of great handsome city so may guess how ignorant be how intensely must enjoy seeing other place do think carlos mio senor singleton suggestion be possible of realisation may be answered carlos little doubtfully everything will of course depend upon what news may come from junta know that padre have placed vessel unreservedly at disposal rather unwisely think will be very much surprised if make fullest possible use of of course if be not likely to be required for month two think must be admirable plan for to go for cruise in must tend to avert suspicion from too for be pretty certain that will not be wise to leave lying idle in havana in other of harbour will mention matter to padre at first favourable opportunity be sure must do mamma vast amount of good remarked senorita isolda might also have effect of putting stop to visit of senor alvaros who be fast becoming unendurable nuisance indeed in what way demanded carlos sharply why answered senorita isolda be never free from ride over here three four time week make a much at home a though place belonged to although have never received slightest encouragement from mamma from then bore with unwelcome attention ah ejaculated carlos through clenched teeth somehow feared a much fellow must be choked off by mean question be how to do without giving offence see continued turning to jack cuban be in exceedingly awkward position be obliged to walk most circumspectly be compelled to submit to many thing be utterly distasteful to for if did not must at once be suspected of harbouring design inimical to government once regarded with suspicion liberty property ay even life must be imperilled confoundedly unpleasant state of thing in truth said jack surely doe not extend so far that dare not give man hint that visit to house be distasteful indeed doe though answered carlos suppose for example that father be to hint to fellow alvaros that be not wanted here that visit must cease probability be that man who may mention be captain of regiment of infantry must at once proceed to hint to superior that be not right with when there be knowing what dreadful thing might happen fact be that pride of fellow be so intense so sensitive be withal so destitute of principle that if man dare to offend one of at once make spaniard in island enemy how must be if be to pick quarrel with suggested jack must not dare to interfere with be by mean so sure of answered carlos must hing to openly of course open honest daylight method be not regarded here with very much respect just at present might perhaps mysteriously disappear oh must never do for to attempt to interfere jack on contrary must most studiously refrain from anything everything must be in least likely to breed ill blood between spaniard because who know may need help ere long that must only effectively give by maintaining good relation with government representative conversing thus at length turned horse head slowly took way back toward house by time that reached jack found upon term of almost a complete intimacy with senorita isolda a be on with brother for despite intense pride seems to be so strongly marked characteristic of who have spanish blood in vein senorita isolda be most charmingly ingenuous unsophisticated girl frank open a day furthermore have be so long accustomed to hear jack spoken of admiringly by carlos that have insensibly acquired strong predisposition in favour finally quite contrary to rule when at length met in flesh instantly decided that stalwart handsome young englishman be that carlos have represented to be very much more upon reaching house found to disgust that captain alvaros have again turned up ostensibly for purpose of bidding don hermoso carlos welcome back to cuba hearing from account of holiday wandering in europe jack found spanish soldier to be man of about thirty two year of age tall swarthy by mean ill looking such physical advantage a possessed be heavily discounted by pair of piercing black sinister looking eye distinctly arrogant overbearing manner man evidently thought well of took trouble to conceal fact greeted jack appearance in senorita isolda company with something very nearly approaching scowl coldly acknowledged senora montijo formal introduction of young man with air of careless hauteur be eloquent of disapproval of young man presence in house further emphasised by thereafter contemptuously ignoring jack for time carlos flushed with angry annoyance a beheld treatment of friend for apologised a soon a pair be alone together jack sunny temperament be not so easily ruffled simply laughed saying let that worry old chap doe hurt in least care brass button whether man like dislike care for friendship enmity be not of quarrelsome disposition a know must attempt to be actively disagreeable to force quarrel upon have doubt that will know how to take care of when party again met at dinner table there be indication senor alvaros have made up mind to treat jack a person much too insignificant to be worthy of least notice soon found that must either abandon line of policy be left out in cold for montijos one persisted in including jack in conversation very quietly unobtrusively none le firmly contrived to make senor alvaros understand that young englishman be already regarded a one of seeing changed tactic artfully endeavoured to entrap jack into expression of opinion upon politics of island young man be not to be so easily caught laughingly disclaimed knowledge of interest in political question of kind pointed out that in case acquaintance with cuba be altogether too recent to have enabled to form even most elementary opinion on question at same time mentioning a general axiom that englishman be usually regarded a cherishing weakness in favour of good government maintenance of law order later on in evening when party adjourned to drawing room soldier again found endeavour to pose a persona grata quietly ignored must fain have monopolised society of dona isolda for remainder of evening attempted to carry off with to remote corner of room carlos must have none of sister have good voice have be taught to use to best advantage wanted friend jack to hear sing of old fashioned andalusian folksong did with cheerfulness alacrity promptly recognising carlos ' intention eagerly seconding then carlos proclaimed that jack be singer accomplished pianist insisted that friend must sing play to when senor alvaros privately confided to senorita isolda opinion that english music be simply barbarous englishman utterly unendurable young lady unhesitatingly declared that entirely disagreed with altogether senor alvaros spent distinctly unpleasant evening for circumstance blamed young englishman a rode back to quarter night cursed english nation freely jack in particular for whom decided there be room in cuba worst of be that not word have be said not thing have be done to must openly take slightest exception how be pestilent young cub of englishman to be got rid of be question worried alvaros during greater part of night whole of next day first impulse of spaniard be to deprive montijo family of alvaros ' countenance society until alarmed at loss must dismiss cause of upon further reflection came to conclusion that might be unwise to adopt so very drastic step for two very good sufficient reason first of be that being impecunious have fully made up mind to marry dona isolda thus acquire substantial interest in montijo property estate be therefore unwilling to do anything might possibly jeopardise position have worked so hard to gain a friend of family while second reason be that be by mean sure that abstention must be regarded by montijos a matter of very great moment then be most unfortunate that jack be not only englishman young man doubtless of position substance must not be owner of so costly plaything a steam yacht have be anything englishman american must have be comparatively easy to have have arrested upon charge of complicity with insurgent nation have most awkward inconvenient habit of looking after people whenever one of chanced to get into trouble government always insisted upon instituting most exhaustive enquiry into matter be wont to make understood with almost brutal distinctness of manner that must not tolerate anything bore slightest suspicion of irregularity have heard whispered that authority have received hint from spy on other side to look out for yacht be suspected of having on board contraband for use of insurgent argued that vessel in question must scarcely be craft owned by young man for simple reason that there appeared to be nothing of surreptitious secret nature in movement in of yacht a understood be must very shortly be in havana harbour no more thought about more profoundly be convinced that must be impossible to bring about jack removal by attempt to involve in political unrest of islander other mean must be tried wondered whether perchance might be possible to frighten young man into early departure from casa montijo island be not very easy matter to frighten englishman knew particular one impressed alvaros a being especially unpromising in respect still there be harm in trying accordingly when upon next day one spaniard again rode over to call upon montijos made opportunity to take jack on one side for moment ask whether have yet fixed date for departure from island date for departure echoed jack certainly not senor on contrary be intention to make quite long stay here see cuba from end to end be even possible that may decide to purchase property on island try luck a tobacco planter fervently trust not senor for own sake said alvaros permit to offer little friendly advice cut short visit leave cuba at once advise a friend to do so indeed said jack why pray of course have good reason for offering advice senor alvaros yes answered alvaros have be cuba be in most unsettled state at present be seething with rebellion stranger be regarded with utmost suspicion by government nothing must be easier than for to find involved in one of numerous conspiracy know to be brewing once involved must find exceedingly difficult if not absolutely impossible to extricate therefore take advice go forthwith be good advice for tell plainly that be not wanted here thanks answered jack coolly be very much obliged to senor alvaros for friendly feeling have prompted to give what suppose wish to understand a warning ' must tell candidly that believe be taking very exaggerated view of danger if danger there be greatly doubt danger danger will still carry out original plan if danger must come well daresay will be quite able to take care of so be good spaniard have feared that must not be of much use to attempt to frighten englishman so have proved well there be other way must be tried after alvaros have left that night family have separated jack accompanied carlos into room of latter related what have passed between spanish officer asking carlos for opinion upon subject will tell jack just exactly what think answered carlos after considering matter for few minute must know captain alvaros made acquaintance about year ago at ball given in havana by capitan general of island after that contrived to meet one more of on frequent occasion finally requested padre permission to visit none of particularly liked be not altogether wise policy to offend spaniard especially if happens to be official in time so padre rather reluctantly gave consent alvaros accordingly called here occasionally while have be away however appears that man have somehow contrived to get posted at pinar del rio a be aware be not very far from here learn since then call have be so frequent a to have become thorough nuisance now from what sister tell have suspicion that alvaros be anxious to contract matrimonial alliance with family may tell at once jack will not be permitted to do belief be that fellow simply can not endure to see man in isolda society be why want to go of course wo be very glad indeed that made that quite clear to be evidently trying to scare off what apparently chooses to consider preserve if knew a well a do jack must understand that need good deal more than vague hint of captain of spanish infantry to frighten now advice to be to take notice of beggar if try on again well just repeat what said to night perhaps will be better not to mention matter at event just yet to padre in fact anyone else right old chap answered jack may trust look here carlos hope that presence in house be not going to involve of in trouble difficulty of sort with government if thought that there be least likelihood of dear chap there be interrupted carlos be one of oldest most influential family in cuba spaniard know perfectly well that to meddle with must be to make very serious mistake so allow idea of kind to worry in least will stay on here just a long a like longer stay better will be pleased besides there be going to be rising here before long then will have opportunity to witness several very interesting thing two day later captain alvaros again presented time instead of entering house in usual free easy manner enquired for don hermoso upon learning that gentleman be in office sent in formal request for private interview be at once admitted found don hermoso seated at large writing table be strewed with account book paper don accorded visitor courteous if somewhat stiff welcome having requested to be seated enquired in what way must be of service for formal visit have somehow suggested to don idea captain alvaros desired to borrow money from visit a from don hermoso can have one object think will have difficulty in guessing what that object be replied alvaros with somewhat embarrassed laugh pardon senor answered don hermoso credit with much larger measure of perspicacity than can lay claim to to be perfectly frank with can not conceive why must desire private interview with unless how will put unless find in position of temporary pecuniary embarrassment in case must have thought that senor montijo exclaimed alvaros starting to foot indignantly do wish to insult certainly not senor answered don hermoso blandly pray be seated dismiss from mind at once such unworthy suspicion why must desire to insult if be mistaken in guess a to object of visit must not be best for to state business with explicitly will senor answered alvaros to be explicit brief then have called upon morning for purpose of demanding hand of daughter senorita isolda in marriage to demand hand of daughter in marriage gasped don hermoso in amazement certainly senor montijo retorted alvaros haughtily surely there be nothing so very extraordinary in making such demand be there nothing very extraordinary certainly returned don hermoso who have quickly recovered grip upon something most entirely unexpected assure do family too much honour senor alvaros presume have reason for supposing suit will be acceptable to daughter have never have reason to suppose otherwise senor answered alvaros even be senorita to entertain foolish objection imagine that entertained presume must make difference in decision if doe not actually entertain sentiment of love for at moment have not shadow of doubt a to ability to inspire sentiment a soon a be married young lady will raise objection presume if be given to understand that marriage must be in conformity with wish imagine be quite unnecessary for to point out to how very greatly to advantage that of whole family marriage must be advantage did say senor retorted don hermoso pardon be afraid that be unusually dull to day be compelled to confess that for moment scarcely see in respect alliance must be advantage to if must not be troubling too much must kindly explain surely senor montijo ought not to be very difficult for to see how highly advantageous must be for yours to be allied in marriage to officer of distinction if may be permitted to say so in spanish army exclaimed alvaros in tone of haughty surprise be scion of one of best family of spain while if will pardon for reminding of fact be merely cuban in troublous day cuban be entirely free from suspicion enough senor interrupted don hermoso indignantly appear to despise a merely cuban either forget be ignorant of fact that father be born in spain there be few spanish name stand higher than of montijo have made mistake senor in presuming to claim superiority for yourself over family decline honour of alliance have proposed trust under circumstance will see propriety of discontinuing visit to house for nearly full minute alvaros glared at don hermoso a though must scarcely believe that have heard aright must scarcely credit fact that rascally cuban a mentally termed montijo have have unparalleled unspeakable audacity to spurn ay spurn be correct word alliance with don sebastian alvaros captain in army of majesty king of spain be unthinkable be insult must only be wiped out by blood yet must be exceedingly awkward to quarrel with people for if did must put end at once for ever to possibility of marriage with daughter simply must marry by hook by crook honour demanded for have already boasted freely among fellow officer of conquest of fairest maid in cuba credit also demanded for have made same boast to money lender in havana have raised considerable sum of money on strength of swallowing rage therefore made attempt to retrace that false step by exclaiming pardon don hermoso have be most unfortunate in choice of word believe have entirely mistaken meaning what really intended to convey be in brief minute of silence don hermoso have read man real character in face have instantly come to conclusion that must rather see daughter lying dead than in power of ruffian therefore cut short officer protestation by assuring that word admitted of misinterpretation that therefore must persist in refusal very well then exclaimed alvaros if prefer to have for enemy instead of friend ally be so senor montijo will not disappoint beware have insulted be man who never forgets forgives insult springing to foot dashed braided cap on to head strode clanking jingling to door so took departure without further word of farewell chapter eight senor alvaros get to work for fully quarter of hour after departure of alvaros don hermoso sat plunged in deep somewhat anxious reverie scarcely knew whether be more pleased annoyed at what have just happened for on one hand be at last rid of distinctly uncongenial acquaintance have be almost thrust upon in first instance have proved ever more uncongenial unwelcome with lapse of time while on other hand fully recognised that have made for vindictive implacable enemy who although not very formidable dangerous just then might at moment become so for although senor montijo be one of most important influential person in island be cuban a such be well aware that thanks to corruption be then rampant among spanish official of government there must be hope of justice for if be brought into collision with of official of whom of course alvaros be one word of cuban however important position might be be of absolutely weight whatever don hermoso be fully aware that must be very difficult matter for alvaros to absolutely ruin if chose yet even ruin must be preferable to seeing beloved daughter wife slave of such man a alvaros have proved to be for rest must come to be war to knife between well must take chance with rest of cuban trust to coming revolution to enable to hold own reverie be interrupted by arrival of milsom who having taken thetis into havana harbour snugly berthed there further made possible provision for safety have turned over to capable care of perkins chief mate have now come on by train a far a pinar del rio from thence by don hermoso carriage to pay promised visit to hacienda montijo be full of glee at unconcealed uneasiness with spanish official regarded presence of yacht in harbour evident belief that despite strict search of vessel by commander lieutenant of tiburon carried hidden away in cleverly contrived place of concealment contraband of have be informed by spy on other side of atlantic have put on board le than four custom house officer empleados de la a call to see that nothing be surreptitiously landed from ship exclaimed with boisterous enjoyment four boat now guard around night oh be great people spaniard then went on to relate how few hour after arrival boat have come alongside from tiburon be also lying in harbour bearing challenge for from lieutenant silvio fernandez lieutenant who demanded satisfaction from for insulting behaviour on occasion of yacht being stopped by gunboat how have accepted challenge to fight being challenged party have chosen fist a weapon wherewith duel be to be fought made merry over lieutenant indignation when have declined to accept sword pistol a substitute for fist of course concluded fight did not come off although remained in havana forty eight hour longer than originally intended in order to give senor fernandez chance during dinner night don hermoso related to family guest particular of interview have occurred between alvaros in afternoon if have even for moment entertained slightest doubt a to wisdom of step have taken in declining alvaros ' proposal dismissing from house be finally dissipated when senorita isolda expressed in quite unmistakable term relief gratification next few day sped very pleasantly for young people at rate who passed time in shooting in taking long ride about surrounding country senorita isolda frequently found contrasting genial hearty friendliness chivalrous courtesy of brother english friend with stiff haughty overbearing manner overweening conceit of spanish officer who seemed to think that such attention a chose to pay ought to be regarded a vast condescension on part be about week after dismissal of alvaros by don hermoso at end of long fatiguing day shooting ending up with very pleasant musical evening party in casa montijo retired somewhat late to several room jack singleton weary with much tramping under scorching sun lost time in disrobing flinging with pyjama suit a only covering upon bed where almost instantly sank into sound dreamless sleep have probably be asleep for at least three hour although seemed to only a many minute when suddenly started broad awake with disagreeable feeling that be no longer alone rather to put more exactly that someone have that instant stealthily entered room by way of window a be customary in cuba have be left wide open for admission of possible breath of air for moment lay perfectly still listening intently peering while into darkness encompassed be perfectly still however save for faint rustle in night breeze of mosquito curtain surrounded bed musical tinkling of water of fountain outside while darkness be so intense that be only with utmost difficulty must dimly discern opening of window will be remembered looked out upon patio kind of courtyard suddenly room be faintly illumined for moment by flicker of summer lightning jack felt almost positive that during fraction of second caught glimpse of something by open window have certainly not be there when retired for night something suggested crouching human figure stretching out hand jack cautiously noiselessly parted mosquito curtain with object of getting clear view when next flash must come a come knew must come did minute two later disclosing to young man astonished gaze form on hand knee about halfway between window bed a before glimmer of lightning be momentary brief a be sufficed jack to see that individual whoever might be held long murderous looking knife in right hand inference be obvious that be there for good purpose jack have learned among other thing to act promptly with decision sooner be again in darkness than with single bound be on foot on floor where instantly came into violent collision with stranger who be at precise moment in very act of rising from knee brief a have be flicker of lightning have enabled jack to measure distance to note exact spot occupied by unknown moment therefore that came into contact with intruder left hand fell unerringly upon right wrist of other seized in so vice like grip that arm became immovable while with right grasped man by throat thrust violently backward at same instant twining right leg round leg of antagonist with result that crashed to ground jack being uppermost antagonist be immensely powerful man lithe sinewy a leopard struggled furiously to free hitting out savagely with free left hand landing one two very nasty blow on jack face until latter with one knee on prostrate foe chest managed to get other upon left forearm thus pin to ground meanwhile jack grip upon throat of man be by mean to be shaken off struggle of stranger be rapidly growing weaker a breath be remorselessly choked out of when milsom carlos of whom have be awaked by commotion dashed into room bearing light loudly demanding to know what be matter will be shot if know answered jack daresay chap can tell got in through window a lightning showed to be stranger also noticed that carried rather formidable looking knife occurred to that might be wise to make prisoner of get to tell who be what want now friend will trouble for knife man surrendered weapon with sullen scowl thanks said jack now may stand up man rose to foot revealing to gaze of three friend tall sinewy form attired in picturesquely tattered garb of muleteer wagoner fellow be low class spaniard of singularly vicious disreputable appearance a glared vindictively at captor looked capable of anything murder included for moment appeared inclined to make desperate bid for liberty a jack have slipped between open window while milsom with cocked revolver in hand stood with back against closed door of apartment thought better of simply enquired well what be going to do with will depend to extent upon answer may see fit to give to question answered carlos first of who be what errand brought here name senor montijo be panza antonio panza present occupation be that of carrier of good suppose may a well confess at once that business here be to murder english senor friend to murder repeated jack why pray what harm have ever done that must desire to murder none senor answered man must appear that have harmed somebody else must not have be hired to slit throat so exclaimed carlos be explanation be suspected a much pray who be coward who hired to do dirty work for ah pardon senor be just what may not tell answered panza be paid handsomely to undertake piece of work be part of bargain must fail be to keep employer secret be permissible to ask how much be paid demanded jack certainly senor answered fellow be paid fifty doubloon to kill if must to hold tongue about fifty doubloon trifle over fifty pound sterling exclaimed jack in comic disgust be that life be worth to employer told that be utmost must afford to give senor be quite enough to tempt why be to work life at trade a carrier must never hope to save fifty doubloon nay fourth part of sum be not so very long ago that risked life constantly a contrabandista for profit of one fifth of amount well antonio said carlos according to own showing have very elastic conscience appear to have made pretty completely subservient to own interest now suppose know what will happen to if hand over to authority yes senor answered ruffian will probably be sentenced to six month imprisonment with hard labour sentence will be commuted to one month if behave a will of course six month hard labour exclaimed carlos incredulously be strangely mistaken friend be far more likely to get ten year penal servitude in africa attempted murder be crime be usually punished very severely usually yes assented prisoner be when one attempt to murder spaniard muchacho however be english nobody in cuba be just now likely to trouble very much over attempted murder of englishman besides have received definite promise that if caught will be very leniently treated oh have have exclaimed carlos in tone seemed to indicate that be beginning to see daylight seems to point to fact that employer be man possessing considerable amount of influence with authority fancy must have entirely forgotten british consul at havana doe do imagine for moment that gentleman will permit tampering with justice where one of countryman be concerned make mistake about friend so surely a be brought to trial so surely may rely upon receiving maximum amount of punishment for crime santa maria gasped panza have forgotten that suspected a much answered carlos now if senor singleton here must chance to be disposed to be merciful to extent of permitting to go free must be willing in return to swear upon crucifix see wear round neck that will make further attempt upon life also to disclose name of employer must be no good senor said panza employer warned that must attempt to betray must simply deny word might say who must take word of suspected contrabandista against of well spaniard of high position be true that judge might shrewdly suspect that there be considerable amount of truth in story must be very careful to conceal such suspicion assure thus appears that employer have taken utmost care to shield behind leave to bear brunt of may befall exclaimed carlos have not replied to question yet asked whether in event of senor singleton permitting to go free unpunished must swear never again to lift hand against also to disclose name of employer a matter of fact know already must of course be more satisfactory to have explicit statement from if know man a say senor will also know that will not be of slightest use to charge with complicity in answered panza possibly not agreed carlos must enable to give senor alvaros hint that machination be known that henceforth will be on guard against very well senor agreed must be assassin have named man who employed be therefore evident that know great deal more about affair whatever may be than suspect so be useless for to attempt to keep secret from senor alvaros be indeed man who employed be not going to be such fool a to go back tell have failed insisted upon receiving payment in advance there be therefore need for to see again will consequently leave pinar del rio resume former occupation of contrabandista with senor alvaros fifty doubloon can see way to earn very comfortable living a smuggler if senor must at time require service in capacity other for matter will be pleased to do utmost to afford complete satisfaction very well will remember said carlos laughing heartily at man cool impudence have not yet taken oath know must do that before can release without word of objection spaniard took small bronze crucifix in hand bowed head reverently a pressed to lip then holding aloft before exclaimed swear upon emblem of redemption by hope of salvation will never again attempt to take life of young englishman if will be so generous a to allow to go free unpunished for what have already done right will do be free to go now a soon a please open door milsom let pas said jack mil gracias y buenas noches senor exclaimed panza a strode toward door one word before go caballeros beware of senor alvaros for bear love for of passed into night darkness well exclaimed milsom have met with queer folk in time that chap break record for cool impudence spanish be not strong point if understood aright after calmly acknowledging that have be hired to murder friend jack here with equal calmness informs that if must at time want similar job done will be pleased to undertake will do best to afford complete satisfaction murder of most barbarous description undertaken executed with promptitude dispatch ' eh by jove be interesting country carlos laughed rather bitterly yes be be responded have come to under spanish rule that fellow knew perfectly well that in accepting alvaros commission be incurring absolutely risk beyond such small personal danger a be involved in attack upon sleeping man be not much a rule incident go to show what vindictive unscrupulous scoundrel fellow alvaros be must tell padre about to morrow for be evident that man mean mischief must be on guard worst of be that can take overt step in matter for a friend panza hinted if be to go to authority with statement of what have occurred lodge complaint against alvaros must only be laughed at spanish government protects own people pretty effectually cuban foreigner have to take care of a best can nevertheless said milsom must advise jack to put matter into hand of consul at havana who be not at sort of fellow to stand nonsense must doubtless communicate promptly with capitan general informing of what have happened giving very clearly to understand that will be held responsible if after receiving such information anything be allowed to happen to jack yes assented carlos might be good plan perhaps must suggest that decide upon nothing until have have talk with padre to morrow let hear first what think of affair meanwhile jack think need not apprehend further molestation to night certainly none from panza after swearing oath will not again raise hand against to make assurance doubly sure will rouse pedro instruct to mount guard under veranda for remainder of night to turn loose two bloodhound then woe betide stranger who attempt to approach house on following morning after first breakfast carlos jack followed don hermoso into office where former informed father of incident of preceding night of milsom suggestion that matter must be placed in hand of english consul to be dealt with a official might deem fit don hermoso be of course a might be expected most indignant at outrage be at first very strongly disposed to make personal matter of by lodging formal complaint with capitan general against alvaros after listening to that son jack have to say finally allowed to be dissuaded from taking so decisive step especially a fully shared doubt a to effectiveness cordially approved of milsom suggestion that affair must be laid before english consul final result of talk be that jack carlos forthwith rode into pinar del rio from thence took train to havana where arrived rather late in afternoon yet still early enough to catch consul ere left office for day official gave two young men cordial welcome listened to jack story with utmost attention mouth setting ever more firmly frown upon brow lowering ever more darkly a story proceeded when at length be finished said have heard of man alvaros before never good of yet believe stand well with capitan general of course will not allow to influence one of duty here be to protect british subject intend to do be rather unfortunate mr singleton that must have chosen particular period for visit to cuba for may tell if happen to know already that foreigner of kind particularly american english be looked upon with scant favour by spaniard just now a latter suspect of favouring aspiration of cuban toward independence that reminds that spaniard somehow got hold of notion that be bringing out cargo of contraband of war for cuban insurgent suppose there be truth in story be there jack have be expecting such question a sooner later be fully prepared for have made up mind that to tell consul whole truth of matter must only be to place official in extremely embarrassing position so answered with laugh took good care to test truth of story for by sending out torpedo boat to accompany from key west see that did not land anything of kind something went wrong with apparently broke down left to make assurance doubly sure also sent out gunboat quite unlawfully in opinion stopped on high sea informed that be prisoner then jack went on to relate in full detail occurrence of afternoon how milsom have refused to surrender yacht have threatened to sink gunboat if force be attempted how jack have subsequently insisted upon yacht being searched how nothing have be found to intense disappointment chagrin of spanish officer from whom have exacted ample apology consul brow cleared laughed heartily a jack described in graphic language entire incident from beginning to end when story be ended be pleased to express somewhat qualified approval of englishman behaviour a matter of fact said whole affair be in highest degree irregular on one hand spaniard have business to stop on high sea whatever suspicion may have be in so doing exceeded right laid open to rebuff gave on other hand although blame altogether for somewhat high handed action in offering resistance to attempted seizure of vessel must have be more politic on part to have submitted then placed whole affair in hand must have seen to that harm befell must also have exacted from government ample apology adequate compensation for outrage however be past done with have doubt will be quite able to follow when point out to that incident be in quite sufficient to render somewhat unpopular personage with spanish official to cause to regard with scarcely veiled disapproval avowed intention to prolong visit to island tell candidly that must be quite prepared to have stay in cuba rendered a unpleasant a can possibly be made ought to advise to make stay a brief a possible if choose to remain will do utmost to protect can guarantee freedom from official interference so long a abstain from meddling with politics of course can not insure against private malignity such a of fellow alvaros utmost can promise be must anything untoward happen to will exact ample reparation will make business to call upon capitan general to morrow will not only lay whole case before will also insist upon taking step to mark disapproval of captain alvaros peculiar method of venting personal spite now since can not possibly get back to senor montijo place to night think perhaps can not do better than come home with can put up quite easily thus be accordingly arranged after dinner genial host took two young men out showed something of town of havana be very interesting to jack although le so to carlos who be of course tolerably familiar with place also took opportunity to pay flying visit to thetis found moored just off custom house still with four custom officer on board other precaution mentioned by milsom have be relaxed for be gradually being borne in upon mind of spanish official that there be nothing about ship about behaviour of people to justify suspicion everything be found quite right on board perkins took care to keep everybody on alert strict anchor watch be maintained night to guard against possible attempt to maliciously damage ship appeared that before leaving milsom have taken care to have bunker filled to utmost capacity while chief engineer after having have boiler thoroughly cleaned have caused to be filled with fresh water in readiness to get up steam at moment notice on following morning consul called upon capitan general taking two lad with lodged formal none le vigorous complaint respecting outrage have be offered to british subject jack to wit by one of officer capitan general who be fine stately white haired man listened with most courteous attention to what two englishman have to say then with equal courtesy proceeded to pooh pooh whole story insisting upon exceeding unlikelihood of officer of captain alvaros standing in spanish service stooping to so degrading cowardly step a of hiring assassin to remove almost total stranger from path dwelt very strongly upon sterling worth of senor alvaros character very high esteem in gentleman be held by who enjoyed privilege of acquaintance mildly reproached englishman for being so credulous a to believe unsupported story of such unmitigated ruffian a panza have appeared to be fact that character of spanish officer gentleman must be so easily smirched be dwelt upon by at length more in sorrow than in anger did not omit to draw especial attention of visitor to important fact that even according to own showing there be sufficient motive to induce senor alvaros to engage in such very reprehensible undertaking be intensely amusing to jack scarcely le so to carlos to observe sympathetic courtesy with english consul listened to rigmarole from manner one might have believed to have be absolutely convincing until remarked in turn well dear general after have be said one fact remains be that senor singleton life have be attempted by man whom never saw before who must therefore have have personal animus against obvious inference therefore be that be hired by someone to make attempt asserts that man who hired be senor alvaros therefore notwithstanding that have said if anything further of untoward nature must happen to senor singleton warn that very grave suspicion will attach to senor alvaros will be compelled to insist upon most stringent enquiry being made into matter must therefore suggest if will pardon for taking so great liberty senor alvaros must be made aware of circumstance of case that hint must be given of extreme necessity for utmost circumspection on part now general must offer most sincere apology for having occupied so much of valuable time tender warmest thanks for great patience courtesy with have listened to what have have to say good morning chapter nine urgent appeal for help two young men reached casa montijo afternoon in just nice time to partake of afternoon tea function have promptly be adopted by senora montijo daughter upon return of don hermoso carlos from england a very latest most up to date institution absolutely indispensable in household having slightest pretension to be considered a belonging to polite society related in extenso result of visit to havana at one be surprised since everything have happened precisely a have be expected be agreed that after very strong representation made by english consul jack need have very little apprehension of further annoyance from alvaros then singleton mentioned impromptu visit to yacht expressed to milsom great satisfaction at state in have found vessel crew in turn led to further discussion of jack proposal that entire family must indulge in cruise instead of allowing craft to remain idle in harbour fouling bottom with weed impairing efficiency of crew now appeared that original suggestion have very powerfully appealed to imagination of lady who have kept pretty persistently before don hermoso until worthy man finding nothing very convincing to advance against have be gradually brought into frame of mind needed very little further persuasion to induce to give willing assent accordingly before evening be over matter have be gone into in earnest arrangement completed for start in about week time with result that milsom set out for havana immediately after first breakfast on following morning for purpose of making preparation week passed arrangement of family have so far advanced that heavy baggage dispatched in advance be actually on way to havana for shipment on board yacht be to be followed by family jack on following day when toward end of afternoon horseman dashed up to door of house clothing thick with dust horse reeking with sweat demanded instant audience with senor montijo on business of utmost importance demand be enforced by utterance of password secured prompt admission don hermoso being at moment engaged in office where be completing with overseer final arrangement to be observed in absence ten minute later don hermoso sent servant in search of jack carlos who with dona isolda have gone for stroll up ravine when two young men having be found entered don hermoso sanctum discovered in close conference with aforesaid dust stained stranger who proved to be cuban half breed named jorge carnero man don hermoso explained be bearer of letter from senor marti leader of revolutionary movement in cuba calling upon don hermoso to assist in serious difficulty have most unexpectedly arisen appeared according to marti letter that junta established in new york have with assistance of certain rich sympathetic american collected enormous quantity of arm ammunition store of description have shipped on board willow draught steamer named james b potter with intention of having landed in mulata bay fourteen mile to westward of bahia honda everything have gone admirably with arrangement up to certain point steamer have succeeded in getting to sea without being stopped pilot be on board who be perfectly acquainted with dangerous coast where landing be to be effected possible contingency in connection with landing prompt conveyance inland of munition have be provided for when at very last moment have be discovered that spanish authority be perfectly aware of whole scheme have laid plan for torpedo boat to pounce upon ship at very moment when two day later steamer must appear off coast enter bay at landing of munition be to be effected messenger jorge carnero whose absolute fidelity to cause of free cuba marti guaranteed be man who have discovered spaniard knowledge of expedition arrangement for quashing at psychological moment have be sent on to montijo a bearer of marti letter asking for help in order that might personally give don hermoso information possible marti only hope be that senor montijo might be able to dispatch yacht to intercept james b potter warn her of danger lay ahead thus saving ship cargo from what must otherwise be inevitable capture said don hermoso in conclusion be story jack question now be can devise plan by terrible disaster to cause may be averted cargo saved to when do say be steamer timed to arrive in mulata bay demanded jack don hermoso referred to senor marti letter then replied at mid day on day after to morrow ah said jack doe not allow very much time doe of course by leaving here evening spending night in pinar del rio by mean must catch first train to havana to morrow morning must be enabled to get to sea in very good time to intercept james b potter somewhere in strait of florida may be advisable for to arrange plan accordingly although be afraid proceeding to sea to morrow will revive greatly strengthen spaniard former suspicion of especially if james b potter must afterwards fail to turn up at rendezvous at appointed time still if necessary must risk that rather than permit ship cargo to be captured do happen to know where torpedo boat be lying be to effect capture demanded turning to carnero yes senor answered carnero be torpedo boat number be lying in havana harbour from be to sally forth at proper moment conceal behind one of cay lying just to westward of mulata bay where will await approach of american ship very pretty scheme one be exceedingly likely to succeed if interfere commented jack be there other government vessel in havana harbour asked turning again to carnero yes senor certainly answered carnero there be two others tiburon gunboat cruiser infanta isabel steam tug craft of kind capable of taking few soldier on board running round to mulata bay demanded jack yes senor answered carnero there be ballena be at present hauled up on slip for repair boiler be out so need not be considered be have named that government have at disposal persisted jack yes senor answered carnero there be of course trading steamer sailing out of havana government might requisition in case of need now let consider yes happens that on day after to morrow not single steamer will be in port first may be expected be due to arrive at midnight of day good exclaimed jack then think can see way will do better than go out to intercept american don hermoso will render impossible for of three government craft to go out of harbour on day when authority find three steamer disabled may take into head to throw few soldier on board sailing craft of sort send out to endeavour to capture james b potter therefore have better send word to people who be to receive good while need not fear warship of kind have better be prepared to fight few soldier if necessary certainly that can be managed without difficulty answered don hermoso let hear plan jack friend carnero here be absolutely trustworthy therefore may speak without reserve before if know what intend to do will be able to tell others who will know just what be to happen what will have to provide for very well said jack be plan will remember how neatly doctored torpedo boat followed to sea from key west well simply propose to treat three government craft in havana harbour in same way only more so that be to say propose by fouling propeller otherwise to prevent from going to sea at on day until propeller be cleared that think ought to give american ship time to run in discharge cargo get to sea again without molestation in order to do will be necessary that at event must go into pinar del rio to night in order to catch either last train to night first train to morrow to havana perhaps will look le suspicious if go alone to night follow on at leisure to morrow if be particularly anxious to reach havana to night senor can be done exclaimed carnero know short cut from here will take to pinar within hour if be good horseman to do must start almost at once be ready now said jack a to horsemanship well have hunted over pretty stiff country in england ought to be good enough carlos old man will see to bringing along bag with to morrow padre will jack of course a for go with to night for have notion can be useful in carrying out of scheme of yours what say padre say go by mean son if jack think that will be of slightest use to answered don hermoso a for bag so on will of course take care that will go forward with to morrow very well then said jack in case let carlos go with for can not tell that may be glad enough to have with during operation to morrow now suppose have better see about making start what about horse carlos will go give instruction to have saddled forthwith answered latter rose went out to patio jack meanwhile making few final arrangement a to hour place of meeting on morrow in havana five minute later horse be brought round to front of house young men having meanwhile said word two of explanation to lady bidden temporarily adieu mounted accompanied by carnero a guide cantered off down long path leading to main road ere reached guide turned off to right following path led through tobacco field took over fence formed one of boundary of don hermoso property party found in open country over carnero led in bee line taking brook watercourse obstruction of various kind a came pace of rider be by mean rapid nothing more than brisk canter in fact route taken being practically shortest possible distance between senor montijo hacienda pinar del rio journey be accomplished in little over hour when at length pulled up at railway station have good four minute in hand all right senor said carnero a received bridle of two horse will see that nag be properly rubbed down attended to that will be in readiness to go back with coach servant to morrow adios senor luck go with clock in city be just striking ten when after somewhat tedious journey train clattered jolted into western station at havana jumping out lad chartered volante local hansom be open vehicle mounted upon pair of enormously high wheel fitted with such long shaft that can only be turned with utmost difficulty in narrow street drove down to wharf where hired shore boat to take off to yacht be lying moored to pair of trunk buoy in harbour ship bell be chiming five be to say half past ten a boat after having be challenged by anchor watch swept alongside thetis gangway ladder two young men ascended to deck somewhat to surprise found milsom on board for a be not expected until following day must not have be at astonished to learn that skipper be ashore amusing at theatre elsewhere milsom explained that have have enough of havana have be to theatre twice considered that be not patch upon alhambra in leicester square at home have be to cathedral have be shown tomb of christopher columbus genuineness of greatly doubted have sauntered in alameda in evening listening to military band of thought nothing trying to discover spanish girl must hold candle to one of own wholesome handsome english lass have failed have also tried have failed to determine precise number of separate distinct odour stink called go to make up characteristic smell of havana from of will be gathered that worthy man with restlessness characteristic of sailor be beginning to weary of inactivity although during past week have be anything inactive may be mentioned be pining for something fresh in way of excitement appeared that finding with spare time on hand notwithstanding preparation of yacht for projected trip have amused by designing elaborate disguise for craft under impression that time might very possibly arrive when disguise must be found exceedingly useful proudly produced sketch of said disguise when unfolded before astonished gaze of two young men showed thetis transmogrified into something resembling two funnelled torpedo gunboat with ram stem round spoon shaped stern complete be contraption most ingeniously built up of wood canvas by joint effort skill of milsom macintyre carpenter be so handily contrived that according to statement of inventor designer given fine weather smooth water for four hour vessel appearance must be so completely changed that own mother must know having duly admired milsom ingenuity jack explained in detail reason why carlos have advanced time of arrival disclosed scheme for temporary disablement of three men o ' war in harbour into scheme milsom entered with utmost gusto even going to length of rousing poor macintyre out of berth ruthlessly breaking in upon beauty sleep in order that party might have benefit of chief engineer advice assistance when at little band of conspirator broke up at midnight turned in plan of campaign have be arranged down to last detail after there be not very much to be done in way of preparation couple of hour work next day by macintyre crew at portable forge down in stokehold everything be ready for work be to commence a soon a possible after ten o'clock night there be only one difficulty still remained to be overcome be evading of vigilance of custom house officer who still remained on board yacht be true that vigilance have be very greatly relaxed of late since have be borne in upon even limited intelligence that nothing remotely resembling attempt to smuggle anything ashore have ever be made still must be awkward in extreme if one more of must happen to be troubled with insomnia on particular night elect to pas sleepless hour on deck don hermoso might be trusted to attend to matter when must arrive on board about four o'clock little after a did accompanied by senora montijo dona isolda difficulty be explained to don hermoso during progress of afternoon tea refreshment be partaken of on top of deck house adjoined navigating bridge of vessel after meal be over carlos went ashore in steam pinnace brought off small phial of liquid that looked tasted like water then fact having be elicited from chief steward that custom house officer have evinced very marked preference for whisky over aguardiente of native land bottle of former be opened wineglassful of spirit having be poured from bottle like quantity of liquid from phial be substituted for cork replaced bottle well shaken be then sent forward to empleados de la aduana for especial use with compliment of don hermoso that might drink health that of family wish pleasant voyage on last night on board since yacht must weather permitting go to sea time on morrow hour later steward with knowing grin reported to milsom that bottle be already three part empty be right commented don hermoso when statement be passed on to gentleman of custom will not be troubled with sleeplessness to night be for four bell in first watch have scarcely struck when with many yawn retired below who be supposed to be on watch a well a who be off in ten minute be sleeping like log now be time phil before moon rise exclaimed jack a soon a report of custom house officer retirement have be brought aft by chief steward be important to get submarine into water unobserved that done can wait until midnight even later before commencing operation by time everybody will have turned in moreover will have light of moon to help accordingly canvas cover be removed from particular boat in small submarine be hidden mischievous little toy be carefully hoisted out lowered into water submerged until only top of diminutive conning tower showed above water then effectually concealed by being moored to boat boom between gig steam pinnace then advantage be taken of darkness to pas down into everything have be prepared for success of forthcoming enterprise after everybody turned in except carlos who undertook to keep watch on deck until everything must seem sufficiently quiet in harbour to admit of adventurer beginning work without incurring undue risk of detection at length two bell in middle watch one o'clock pealed out from various ship in harbour moon just past full be riding high in cloudless sky affording quite a much light a adventurer desired not sound be to be heard save faint moan of wind in rigging of various craft in harbour lap of water alongside everybody seemed to have gone to bed except anchor watch on board men o war must probably lie down endeavour to snatch cat nap until moment must come round to again strike bell carlos therefore thought time propitious treading noiselessly in rubber soled deck shoe went below quietly called jack milsom macintyre macintyre be first of trio to appear on deck for business being in interior of boat have special dress to don pyjama suit in have be sleeping must serve a well a other accordingly wore walking forward with bare foot slung over rail lay out on boom sliding down painter of steam pinnace got on board craft a blind to anyone who might perchance happen to have noticed movement from thence surreptitiously transferred to interior of submarine having already cast boat adrift immediately sealed by fastening down hood of little conning tower then set electric air pump going in order to store up for supply of air sufficient to last until return of boat while be doing quietly dropped boat astern until lay in deep shadow cast by overhanging counter of yacht where other two must board without slightest risk of being seen ten minute later jack milsom appeared on deck attired in improved fleuss diving dress by use of necessity for air pump pipe be done away with man wore long stout double edged dagger in sheath attached to belt a protection against possible attack by shark with water of harbour be known to swarm while milsom bore in addition formidable lance for same purpose rather for purpose of protecting jack while latter worked man wore attached to wrist by lanyard small light steel bar about four inch long to enable to communicate with companion by mean of morse code by simple process of tapping on helmet also carried attached to belt small very powerful electric lantern light of must switch on off at will to enable to see what be about have made arrangement during previous day have exchanged few brief last word just before screwing in front glass of helmet therefore knew exactly what companion have to do now accordingly proceeded straight aft found jacob ladder hanging over yacht stern by descended to submarine milsom going first stationing on boat deck just abaft conning tower while jack took corresponding place on fore side weight of two men be sufficient to just submerge boat bury to chin when sitting down while must disappear altogether by lying flat on deck degree of submersion therefore be just right for beginning of adventure jack accordingly signalled macintyre by mean of electric button first to back away from yacht then to go ahead dead slow guiding at same time how to steer by mean of button torpedo boat being most formidable of three craft be selected a first to be operated upon submarine be accordingly headed for water of havana harbour be unspeakably foul sewer of town discharging into be almost opaque with quantity of matter of various kind that hold in suspension be therefore necessary for submarine to approach torpedo boat pretty closely ere sinking deeper must have be difficult for adventurer to find prey in muddy water managed excellently approaching within ten yard without being detected then jack unwilling to court failure by running unnecessary risk gave order to sink slowly at same time turning on electric lamp moment saw torpedo boat stern propeller before submarine magnificently managed by macintyre who have worked in previous trial drew gently up until stopped motionless in position that jack must do just what wanted have decided not to attempt to remove propeller in case lest violent exertion required to start nut must cause to overbalance fall to bottom of harbour in case must inevitably be lost in deep layer of foul mud formed harbour bottom therefore took length of stout chain already prepared for purpose having first carefully wound round three blade of boat propeller passed loose end round keel bar rudder where having drawn a tight a milsom must draw shackled together thus rendering impossible to move boat until chain have be found taken off whole job occupied bare quarter of hour must have be done in le have not be for hindrance experienced from fish shark luckily excepted attracted by lamp swarmed round so persistently that be almost impossible to do work for obstruction of cruiser be next craft to be dealt with after gunboat whole operation of disabling three vessel being accomplished with almost ludicrous ease in about hour quarter after adventurer returned to yacht hoisted in submarine stowing away concealing in quarter boat without so far a be aware having attracted attention of single soul chapter ten act of certain very clever conspirator when on following morning saloon party on board thetis mustered for breakfast beneath awning sheltered top of deck house from too ardent ray of sun found that alfresco breakfast room commanded uninterrupted most charming view of whole of havana harbour with picturesque old town stretching along waterside on port hand be at moment dead calm for sea breeze have not yet set in mirrorlike surface of water reflected perfect picture of various craft dotted about harbour of building ashore already blazing in dazzling light of unclouded sun business of day have hardly begun ferryboat to regla be loaded with passenger boat conveying meat vegetable fruit fish to shipping be lazily rippling through scum coated surface of water belated fisherman be sweeping crazy looking craft out to sea thin column of brown smoke be rising vertically into motionless air from funnel of torpedo boat number be evidently getting up steam in good time to go in search of james b potter for awning over head party must also have seen that thin feathery film of smoke be curling upward from cream coloured funnel of own craft for although have be decided not to go to sea until afternoon jack have given instruction to have steam for ten o'clock so a to be prepared for emergency party dawdled over breakfast lady in particular finding so much pleasure in unwonted surroundings that must scarcely find time to eat because of many novel incident be continually demanding attention moreover be in enviable condition of people who be in hurry preparation be complete nothing remained to be done to worry about be embarked upon pleasure excursion part of pleasure be to sit still gaze upon increasing animation of charming picture unfolded around when be tired of gazing word be must be necessary to provide with change of scene meanwhile jack be entertaining with humorous account of adventure of milsom during small hour of morning milsom having already broken fast have taken steam pinnace gone ashore to custom house have once be church in order to procure clearance paper by time that have finished business come off again breakfast be over steward be clearing away table equipage movement of torpedo boat crew be becoming interesting dense cloud of black smoke be by time pouring from craft funnel driving over town with rapidly increasing sea breeze presently small flicker of steam appeared at top of waste pipe minute two later be seen that craft be getting anchor ah remarked jack to senorita isolda fun be just about to begin so be anchor thickly coated with foul evil smelling black mud rose slowly out of water a cleansing hose be turned upon officer on bridge be seen to lay hand upon engine room telegraph push handle little way forward don hermoso who despite jack assurance felt terribly anxious lest after something must at last moment go wrong looked fearfully at little craft stern expecting instant to see foaming whirl of water there must proclaim that boat propeller be working save for very slight momentary disturbance of scummy surface there be result presently very excited individual be seen to emerge from boat engine room hatch rush up on to bridge where instantly plunged into violently gesticulatory conversation with other occupant of structure then pair left bridge hurried aft disappeared below meanwhile boat be adrift presently under influence of fast freshening breeze drove athwart hawse of slashing american schooner stout bowsprit of neatly brought boat funnel down on deck to accompaniment of storm of abuse imprecation from american skipper mate then swinging round gathering sternway boat drifted clear losing mast also in process after somebody on board having recovered presence of mind anchor be let go again swung to wind that interesting little incident have not passed unnoticed be presently made manifest by excited flourishings gesticulation of semaphore upon bridge of cruiser to torpedo boat semaphore duly made reply then boat be lowered from latter craft two officer presumably commander chief engineer jumped into stern sheet be pulled toward cruiser ten minute later same boat pushed off again returned to parent craft while semaphore on board cruiser once more awakened into frenzied activity message being time addressed to gunboat a must be deduced from answering nourishes of vessel instrument conversation lasted for quite considerable time long ere be at end dense cloud of black smoke be pouring out of funnel of jack old friend tiburon now although happening be being watched with most absorbing interest from top of thetis deck house must not be supposed that watching be conducted in obtrusive ostentatious manner very far from occupant of coign of vantage to whom milsom be now added be so far a ordinary observer be concerned lounging indolently in several basket chair reading smoking chatting together apparently giving not thought to anything be happening outside bulwark of own ship save when now then one of must lift pair of binoculars bring to bear upon object ashore ultimately sweeping entire horizon with pausing for moment to watch that before laying down again nobody even if watching party continuously must from action have suspected of taking smallest interest in doings of spanish government vessel yet there be not movement on board cruiser gunboat torpedo boat be hors de combat of further interest to be not being intensely watched by milsom jack presently latter turned to carlos enquired got pencil paper about old chap yes answered carlos have pocket book why then just stand by to jot down such letter a may call out to that gunboat semaphore be at work again feel curious to know what be that want to say ah just so be cruiser want to talk to now stand by cruiser having acknowledged call tiburon semaphore began spelling out message letter of jack read off called out a be signalled when message came to end carlos read out translated into english ran a follows fear there be something wrong with engine also have tried to turn by hand aided by forty five pound of steam can not move more than inch so either way cruiser have reply to make to disquieting piece of information minute two later four sailor ran out upon boat boom climbed down jacob ladder hanging therefrom into one of boat cast off paddled to gangway ladder where two officer be by time waiting two individual at once stepped into boat thereupon be shoved off pulled alongside gunboat lieutenant one of engineer from cruiser gone aboard to investigate commented milsom now keep eye on gunboat semaphore jack will probably get little further interesting information presently did not however for gunboat semaphore remained dumb two visitor from cruiser presently re appeared tumbled down over side into boat be rapidly rowed back to own ship ten minute later stream of smoke began to issue first from one then from other funnel of cruiser be evident that have started to get steam on board in hurry indeed time have arrived for hurry for be now five bell in forenoon watch james b potter be timed to arrive in mulata bay at eight bell hour half thence be probably off harbour mouth at moment if not off harbour mouth at least in sight morro castle with signal staff be not visible from spot where thetis lay moored being shut off from view by eastern portion of old town must probably be seen from cruiser be lying considerably farther down harbour farther over on regla side of while men folk on top of yacht deck house be still discussing matter milsom quick eye caught cruiser answering pennant being hoisted in acknowledgment of signal made to from unseen spot aha exclaimed do see must mind betting next allowance of grog that be acknowledgment of signal from morro that potter be in sight how can find out wonder without doing anything to arouse suspicion of spanish johnny that be interested in matter if be not for suspicion that must arouse simplest way of course must be to take steamboat run down a far a harbour mouth when must see for whether there be steamer in sight must never do must be rather too palpable can not tell by reading cruiser signal demanded don hermoso see there be several flag being hoisted on board now what do mean quite impossible to tell dear sir without possessing copy of spanish naval signal book answered milsom navy have own private code of signal man can read unless have access to official signal book be good be there spot ashore from one can get good view of offing nothing nearer be afraid than punta brava be quite two mile from landing place by shortest possible cut answered don hermoso one must not walk there back in much le than hour half in heat to drive there must be afraid be almost a imprudent a running down to harbour mouth in steam pinnace quite answered milsom a leaned out over rail glanced up at yacht funnel must thus just see clear of awning might slip mooring go out in yacht if like senor see that have steam enough to move be free to go to sea at moment now know so understand answered don hermoso yet think have better remain where be little longer for be anxious to assure before starting on trip that potter have succeeded in landing cargo getting away safely if be to go to sea just now must be obliged to proceed on voyage think must advance good reason for hanging about outside watching movement of strange craft of course not quite see point agreed milsom must undoubtedly be better to remain where be for hour two longer see how affair eventually develops must mind betting that signal have reference to american boat for see how furiously be firing up aboard cruiser be indeed firing up furiously a milsom have said for dense cloud of black smoke be now continuously pouring billowing out of funnel of cruiser to outspoken scorn derision of macintyre who have own idea upon subject of firing theory being that to make steam quickly keep when made one must fire lightly continuously meanwhile preparation for going to sea be progressing apace aboard cruiser boat being hoisted in except one with couple of hand in be hanging on to buoy to cruiser be moored in readiness to unshackle cable from mooring ring so soon a vessel have steam enough to enable to move bell of shipping in harbour be chiming eight in case meant noon when first white feather of steam began to play about top of cruiser steam pipe at sight watcher on board yacht stirred in chair assumed more alert attitude for further development might now be looked for came within next five minute first of being sudden lowering of captain gig aboard cruiser hurried descent of crew into by way of davit tackle hauling of alongside hastily lowered gangway moment later officer stepped into stern sheet with naval ensign of spain snapping in breeze at stern boat pennant trailing from staff in bow shoved off dashed away toward landing step with eight oarsman bending back making good ash blade spring almost to breaking point a though very life depended upon speed swept past thetis within biscuit toss party on top of vessel deck house be not only able to distinguish by gold braid on coat cuff that solitary occupant of stern sheet held rank of captain also that poor man looked worried scared almost out of sens just before coming abreast of yacht of course have club ensign burgee flying boat swerved slightly from course for moment looked almost a though intended to run alongside next moment straightened up again went on way toward landing step brass bounder in stern just touching peak of uniform cap with finger tip in acknowledgment of jack milsom courtesy salute two minute later crew tossed oar swept up alongside landing step hooked on skipper next moment springing up step disappearing in crowd of idler who have gathered at head of step two bell came with steward to lay table for second breakfast luncheon on yacht deck house a three bell struck little party drew in round hospitable board sat down to mid day meal have just about finished when milsom who be sitting facing town wharf put down glass somewhat emphatically on table rising to foot exclaimed now what doe mean what doe what mean demanded jack also rising to foot facing in direction toward skipper be looking phew whistled plot thickens surely be not possible that be seen last night phil eh must have sworn that be not answered milsom yet if be not repeat what doe mean might well ask for there halfway between wharf yacht be cruiser boat with captain elderly gentleman in plain clothes in stern sheet be unquestionable that be making for yacht jack snatched up pair of binoculars lay in one of basket chair brought to bear upon boat why exclaimed will be shot if be capitan general who be coming off to capitan general gasped don hermoso then depend on gentleman movement be observed last night have be informed upon what will do why answered jack will wait until have heard what people have to say then be guided by circumstance pooh believe be scaring unnecessarily if suspected of tampering with ship be not in boat manned by six unarmed sailor that must come off to come along phil a skipper a owner of vessel will go down to receive gentleman learn what business be with so saying followed by milsom descended to main deck stationed at head of gangway ladder by time boat be alongside moment capitan general hat in hand bowing courteously to two englishman passed in through gangway followed by captain of cruiser good day senor singleton exclaimed old gentleman genially offering hand do happen to remember must introduce remember perfectly well of course general answered jack accepting proffered hand with must be confessed feeling of very considerable relief be very glad indeed to have honour of receiving on board although have deferred visit until moment when be about to proceed to sea ah yes answered general so guessed from steam see issuing from vessel funnel be about that have come off to see before go further permit to have honour of introducing to captain morillo of spanish majesty cruiser infanta isabel lie yonder introduction having be made acknowledged with due formality old gentleman resumed now most extraordinary thing have happened here to day occurrence so singular unique that one be driven to conviction certain very clever conspirator have be at work old gentleman whether by accident designedly looked jack square in eye a said be with utmost difficulty that latter be able to keep countenance retain that nonchalance of demeanour expression of polite interest felt be so necessary to avert suspicion of own complicity with very clever conspirator to cover indication of confusion might have inadvertently betrayed shouted to quartermaster who be busy about nothing in particular near stern grating quartermaster bring along four basket chair then to general interest immensely general have just sent for chair when arrive will sit discus matter in comfort meanwhile may offer captain morillo glass of wine have very passable champagne down in cold chamber capitan general friend expressed a perfectly willing to partake of senor singleton gracious hospitality presently seated at ease with foaming glass of ice cold mumm before governor resumed story need not ask senor whether be aware that present condition of cuba be somewhat abnormal for feel convinced that caballero of intelligence must have long ere discovered that island be literally seething with rebellion to extent indeed that rising against spanish rule may be anticipated at moment need point out to how ruinously disastrous to rebel who might be suspected of sympathising with rising must necessarily be for must of course be painful duty to suppress by force of arm be therefore in interest of cuban that be adopting certain measure for prevention of everything of nature calculated to encourage hope on part of native population that rising against spanish authority must by possibility be successful one of measure be suppression of importation of weapon war material of description quite so concurred jack with smile have illustration of vigour thoroughness of effort in direction upon arrival on coast in action taken by commander of gunboat yonder who be only convinced with utmost difficulty that be not engaged in business of smuggling war material into country indeed believe never must have be convinced have not insisted upon making thoroughly exhaustive search of vessel with result of course that nothing of kind be to be found on board old gentleman flushed fidgeted uncomfortably in chair fortified by emptying glass must rather not have be reminded of circumstance especially at moment ah said shaking head sorrowfully a put down empty glass feigned to be oblivious of fact that jack promptly refilled yes be most regrettable occurrence result of very unfortunate mistake on part of certain friend of ours on other side understand however that commander albuquerque made amende honourable in manner be absolutely satisfactory to yourself senor with expression of own personal profound regret trust that will have extreme generosity to allow deplorable affair to be forgotten of course will said jack heartily be not one to bear malice be liable to make mistake at time other of life senor exclaimed general with enthusiasm be indeed delighted to find so generously disposed more so that visit to to day be connected with similar incident only difference being that in case there be unfortunately room for belief that be making second mistake have received most positive information certain american sympathiser with revolutionary movement in cuba have loaded steamer with munition of war for use of insurgent munition be to be landed to day at spot known a mulata bay few mile to westward of port information most unfortunately did not reach in time to allow of taking measure for seizure of cargo upon being landed that appeared at time to be matter of moment for have planned to send torpedo boat to seize vessel cargo upon arrival in mulata bay vessel may mention be to have arrived at destination at mid day to day a matter of fact have arrived for be sighted in offing morning have since be seen heading in toward bay now come to explanation of remark in reference to certain very clever conspirator for when torpedo boat attempted to leave harbour morning for purpose of intercepting smuggling ship be found that machinery have be tampered with so that became impossible to send be then decided to send gunboat when in turn attempted to move be discovered that also have be disabled finally to cut story short be discovered that engine of captain morillo ship have also be so effectually tampered with can not move thus see at very critical moment find absolutely helpless unless something can be done instantly cargo will be landed with deplorable result that armed rebellion will break out in island incalculable mischief will ensue yes assented jack thoughtfully must confess that result seems not improbable not improbable ejaculated general dear sir be absolutely certain have very best of reason for knowing once insurgent find possessed of arm will lose not moment in making determined effort to throw off yoke of spanish rule island will be at once plunged into horror of war now dear senor singleton be in power to avert horror if will precisely thought jack must have bet that old boy be leading up to see exactly how be situated that american ship cargo must be seized yet have ship available with to effect seizure on other hand have ship be in way admirably adapted for service have steam up can leave harbour at moment notice if choose pardon general interrupted jack understand exactly what be driving at want to lend yacht for purpose of conveying party of soldier sailor to to mulata bay interpolated general yes continued jack to mulata bay to seize american ship say be smuggling cargo of contraband of war into island dear sir have very extraordinary nature of request yet dawned upon do recognise that be asking private english gentleman to mix up in quarrel with have absolutely nothing to do right wrong of in least understand why must interfere with american ship even though be engaged a suggest in affording aid encouragement to revolutionary surely senor reason have already advanced ought to be sufficient answered general if be not let give friend don hermoso montijo whom see with wife family on upper deck yonder be not altogether free from taint of suspicion of being in sympathy with revolutionary indeed have be whispered to that must perhaps be unfair to to repeat suggestion have not a yet be absolutely proved let suffice for to say that wish present predicament of government to be laid before together with request have ventured to make to let know how advise in matter general be absolutely preposterous protested jack why must don hermoso montijo family be dragged into affair why must be supposed to be governed by advice must positively refuse to submit matter to in shape form must also refuse to permit to be influenced by advice might see fit to give be guest on board vessel may tell have embarked in for purpose of taking cruise in for benefit of health of lady of family indeed be on point of getting under way when boarded senor retorted general will not pretend to dispute one of statement will simply say that if persist in refusing assistance to spanish government in strait refusal will have effect of very greatly strengthening suspicion already exist a to loyalty of montijo family general exclaimed jack if did know must scarcely have said anything better calculated to defeat own wish make declare that under circumstance will permit to be dragged into business to be perfectly frank with believe that have slightest shadow of foundation excuse for suspicion of senor montijo family in order to show how little ground there be for must such actually exist will do violence to own feeling by acceding to request without consulting senor montijo in way to extent of conveying party of men not exceeding fifty to mulata bay upon condition that be allowed to fly spanish man o ' war ensign while engaged upon service why do attach condition to assent senor demanded general because snapped jack who be now perilously near losing temper can will do work under british flag think excellency senor singleton be justified in demand remarked skipper of cruiser now speaking for first time work that have kindly undertaken to do be essentially spanish government work can only be properly done under spanish flag will bring spanish ensign pennant to hoist senor when bring men alongside added turning to jack will be obliged senor if will answered jack for will hing without then be settled exclaimed general rising to foot when will be ready to leave harbour senor singleton a soon a captain morillo brings men alongside answered jack then to expedite matter let be going at once morillo exclaimed general then turning to jack said senor permit to express to gratitude not only of personally also of spanish government for courtesy in consenting to render important service at exceedingly critical moment fear that in anxiety may have brought rather unfair amount of pressure to bear upon in order to overcome scruple trust that will ultimately forgive for be quite sure that if a have understood intend to prolong stay in cuba time will come when will be glad to have placed under obligation offer thousand thanks senor have honour to bid good day thereupon with many bow excellency capitan general of cuba followed skipper of cruiser to gangway thence down into boat well exclaimed milsom who have contrived to follow conversation sufficiently to get fairly accurate impression of what have transpired have managed to get fairly into centre of hobble by consenting to run men down to mulata bay how mischief do propose to get out of again without putting fat in fire quite easily dear phil may bet bottom dollar must never have consented answered jack see spanish ship have have engine tampered with very well ours have be tampered with too macintyre will have to see to while old chap be talking idea occurred to that if must persist in refusal captain morillo might in desperation take into head to send away boat expedition to mulata bay people there being of opinion that everything be right may take matter prettily easily with result that boat expedition might possibly have arrived in time to effect seizure therefore while for sake of effect pretended to be very unwilling to fall in with excellency view have decided must do so almost a soon a saw what be coming now plan be will take spanish crowd aboard run down toward mulata bay will put effectual stopper upon attempt to dispatch expedition when get down abreast of destination engine will break down instead of going into mulata bay will go driving helplessly away down to leeward before fine roaring trade wind before can get ship again under command james b potter will have discharged cargo got away again reckon upon appearance off place under spanish ensign pennant to give concerned hint a to importance of hustling ' over job twiggez je twig tumble answered milsom very pretty scheme be too jack doe proud old man ought to work like charm now before spanish johnny come aboard will just hunt up macintyre post upon share of work while go explain matter to don family who oop will be interesting to observe expression on countenance of spanish friend when engine tampered with by pestilent revolutionary break down chapter eleven expedition failed few minute sufficed jack to explain situation to montijo family to mingled indignation amusement then suggested that a yacht must possibly be rolling tumbling about somewhat unpleasantly in heavy sea outside while in apparently helpless condition lady might prefer to pas night ashore in one of havana hotel of must for moment listen to such proposal senora explained that have never yet be seasick did not propose to begin now while dona isolda opined that must be worse for than if have gone to sea in ordinary way during afternoon so too elected to remain on board take chance then while be talking together milsom came up on to top of deck house with information that macintyre fully understood what be wanted be making elaborate preparation for perfectly gorgeous breakdown of engine maximum speed of during trip must not exceed fourteen knot at outside presently cruiser first cutter pushed off from parent ship side came pulling toward yacht with twenty seaman five marine on board in addition to own crew armed to teeth captain morillo officer in stern sheet few minute later boat swept up alongside two officer ascended to deck where be met by jack milsom senor singleton senor capitan milsom permit to have honour of presenting to senor el teniente villacampa officer who will have command of expedition said morillo will be responsible for good behaviour of men will lead to attack of ship on shore who will be assisting in landing of cargo apart from duty will of course be under order have brought continued taking bundle of bunting from villacampa ensign pennant will substitute for own colour at moment may deem most suitable now what about boat will tow one be alongside must rather use own think people have better use yacht boat senor answered jack have plenty will look more in keeping very well senor agree with there acquiesced morillo now a be doubtless anxious to make immediate start will bid good bye trust that expedition will be completely successful have full instruction how to proceed senor added to lieutenant then cap in hand bowed through gangway down side a cruiser boat shoved off milsom ascended to bridge laying hand on engine room telegraph rang stand by be ready to slip there mr perkins demanded ready sir answered perkins then let go ordered milsom moving handle to half speed ahead lay hand stow gangway ladder quartermaster stand by to dip ensign to cruiser a pas when have acknowledged haul burgee down stow away in flag locker be acquainted with senor montijo family asked jack politely addressing to lieutenant villacampa who looked a though felt slightly uncomfortable out of element have not that honour senor answered villacampa looking still more uncomfortable then come up on deck house let introduce said jack be most delightful people be sure will be pleased to know men have better consider after deck a end of ship make a comfortable a can there be fairly dry little ship think will be all right there whereupon villacampa gave brief order to men then followed jack up ladder to top of deck house where be duly made known to occupant to great gratification of morillo who witnessed little ceremony a yacht swept past boat lieutenant be very cordially received a have already be agreed upon by principally concerned being very pleasant mannered agreeable young fellow soon found that be enjoying amazingly have fine speedy little ship under senor said anxious to make agreeable a yacht having passed cruiser opened out harbour mouth quickened up pace to fourteen knot e admitted jack in grudging depreciatory tone of voice for inexplicable reason so many englishman use when speaking of own property be not bad for size knot two more must be welcome just now for be late in starting will have work cut out to make mulata bay before dark have be taking look at chart see that place lie inside reef be acquainted with pilotage of part of coast senor oh yes senor answered lieutenant have be in out of mulata bay several time be chiefly why captain morillo selected to command expedition navigation however be not difficult once through cayo blanco passage will be right doubt agreed jack be just getting through passage have be feeling unhappy about draw eight foot of water aft chart say that there be only nine foot in passage villacampa admitted that depth of water shown on chart be about right confessed that situation now that one came to look at be somewhat awkward still be of opinion that if must arrive off mouth of pas before dark everything must be right at five o'clock steward brought up table proceeded to serve tea villacampa who somehow found seated between senorita isolda capitan milsom told that have missed vocation that ought to have be skipper of english steam yacht with lovely fascinating spanish senorita a passenger instead of second lieutenant of dirty spanish cruiser be running along coast steering course of west by south half south gave gradually increasing offing be nice safe course to steer for must take well clear of danger result being that when at length arrived off cayo blanco passage yacht be quite ten mile off land about five mile distant from edge of reef if villacampa have noticed how wide offing be being maintained must probably have suggested desirability of hauling in point two did not for be being made much of by lady while jack have artfully placed with back toward land milsom meanwhile have be watching coast a cat watch mousehole moment that saw certain mark come on raised cap proceeded to mop perspiring forehead with large bandana handkerchief whereupon perkins who have be for time keeping unostentatious eye upon party on top of deck house turned sauntered aft to engine room door sneezing violently a walked past next instant there arose perfectly hair raising clatter clash of metal down in engine room engine abruptly ceased to revolve so sudden startling be clatter that lady screamed clasped hand convulsively in most natural manner possible while jack milsom starting to foot capsizing chair with magnificent dramatic effect dashed one upon heel of other down ladder toward engine room steam from blow off at same moment roaring through safety valve with violence enough to scare nervous person out of wit quartermaster keeping level head in midst of hubbub promptly ported helm turned yacht head toward open sea little craft at once a though entering thoroughly into spirit of thing began to roll rail under a sea caught square abeam spanish seaman marine startled into sudden activity by commotion sprang to foot after glancing about for instant with scared face made dash with one accord for boat be only with difficulty restrained from lowering driven away from davit by strong party of yacht crew under perkins aided by jack villacampa taking affair by large macintyre have certainly very effectively fulfilled promise to produce perfectly gorgeous breakdown lieutenant villacampa be of course naturally very anxious to learn extent of damage how far be likely to interfere with execution of duty confided to by superior poor fellow wrung hand in despair when macintyre presently came on deck with big bolt smashed in two in hand with great show of indignation informed spaniard in broad scotch of of course poor fellow did not understand word that unknown scoundrel have surreptitiously withdrawn nine such bolt from certain coupling that other three have a natural consequence gradually sheered through under excessive strain thrown upon that for part be only surprised that machinery have brought a far a have without giving out that furthermore since must be necessary to make twelve new bolt to replace missing destroyed must be several hour at earliest before yacht must again be brought under control of jack struggling valiantly against violent disposition to laugh uproariously translated to unhappy spanish lieutenant then to add still further to officer chagrin disappointment yacht with spanish ensign pennant snapping from gaff end masthead in roaring trade wind drove slowly steadily past mouth of mulata bay young man have mortification of catching through powerful pair of binoculars lent by jack brief glimpse of james b potter at anchor in bay surrounded by whole flotilla of boat with steam winch hard at work great case swinging over side from three hatchway at same moment be scurvy trick of fate explained to jack that must have be so very near to making capture important enough to have insured promotion to have have success snatched from at moment when be within grasp jack emphatically agreed with that be rather spoiled effect immediately afterward by asking what about damage to engine be however obviously case in nothing must be done wait patiently until necessary repair must be effected after there be a jack pointed out just one solitary grain of comfort in situation in breakdown have occurred while yacht be still far enough from shore to be safe from peril of stranding have accident be deferred until vessel be on point of entering passage through reef yacht must undoubtedly have be flung by sea upon sharp coral dashed to piece when furious surf be at moment foaming swirling over reef to jack directed villacampa attention must have inevitably drowned soul on board be fact so patent to meanest comprehension that spanish lieutenant speedily forgot disappointment hastened up on to deck house to explain to lady how narrow have be escape from terrible shipwreck to congratulate upon circumstance that be still alive meanwhile deck hand under milsom supervision have be busily engaged in getting up on deck rigging sea anchor be dropped overboard when yacht have drifted three mile to westward of cayo blanco passage a there be strong current setting eastward at time effect be not only to bring yacht head to wind sea cause to ride very much more easily comfortably also to effectually check further drift to westward then came dinner in saloon a villacampa took seat at elegantly appointed table noted with keen appreciation prompt orderly service of luxurious meal felt fully confirmed in previous conviction that have missed proper vocation rising moon have just cleared horizon be flooding weltering water with silvery light when saloon party being once more assembled on top of deck house for better enjoyment of grateful coolness of night air large steamer must be none other than james b potter be seen to come out of mulata bay head for passage steaming thence out to sea away to eastward at rapid pace though not so fast that villacampa unconsciously biting finger nail to quick in excess of mortification felt convinced that yacht must have caught have that vessel only be under way at moment be not however be not until american craft have sunk beyond eastern horizon good hour half macintyre came up on deck to report that have completed repair be ready to once more start engine whereupon sea anchor be got inboard since there be nothing else to be done yacht returned to havana harbour at speed of fourteen knot engine working a smoothly a though have never broken down arriving at former berth picking up buoy at about two o'clock be captain morillo who have be anxiously awaiting return promptly made appearance alongside in cruiser cutter for purpose of taking off men learning result of expedition great be wrath disgust on hearing that have failed after in consequence of breakdown of yacht engine be most searching minute in enquiry a to nature cause of accident eventually agreed with jack have undoubtedly be brought about by miscreant who be responsible for disablement of spanish warship who be perfectly evident have determined to ensure success of american undertaking by tampering with machinery of vessel in harbour must by possibility be employed to frustrate ere taking leave ventured to express hope that jack captain milsom must do favour to accompany when went ashore few hour later to report to capitan general failure of expedition a must be duty to do jack courteously yet very firmly declined to do anything of kind pointing out that lieutenant villacampa who have commanded expedition be perfectly able to furnish particular that general might require while further jack considered that very unfair pressure have be brought to bear upon to induce to lend yacht for purpose of expedition therefore felt perfectly justified in declining to afford further assistance to local representative of spanish government whereupon captain morillo expressed profound regret that senor singleton must have cause to feel aggrieved departed taking men flag with thetis steamed out of havana again at eight o'clock same morning be unnecessary to follow in detail course of voyager during pleasure cruise upon have embarked for while thoroughly enjoyed cruise be absolutely uneventful suffice to say that proceeding in very leisurely fashion completely circumnavigated island of cuba calling in at matanzas cardenas nuevitas guantanamo santiago de cuba trinidad xagua batabano other more le interesting port on coast sometimes remaining only few hour at other time spending a many day in harbour while don hermoso made certain mysterious excursion inland have secret conference with more le mysterious people during progress of jack carlos two lady enjoyed amazingly in steam pinnace in craft made excursion up river prowled about among romantic cay to heart content then crossed to jamaica where enjoyed ample opportunity to compare condition of island under british rule with cuba under government of spaniard a also to learn how jamaican construe word hospitality dance picnic dinner at government house elsewhere ball at up park camp on board battleship at port royal succeeded other with bewildering rapidity while be positively deluged with invitation to spend week more on various sugar estate dotted about here there in of most beautiful part of lovely island small wonder be therefore that six full week slid away ere thetis again steamed out to sea from port royal thence coasting along southern shore of san domingo traveller visited porto rico where don hermoso again have much business to transact with mysterious stranger occupying full fortnight after saint kitts antigua montserrat guadeloupe dominica martinique saint lucia barbados saint vincent grenada finally trinidad to see wonderful pitch lake be visited by time month of february in year have arrived don hermoso became anxious to be at home again a certain very important momentous event be pending progress of be anxious to watch a closely a might be wherefore on certain evening yacht weighed anchor shortly before two bell in first dogwatch steaming close past five island diego island gaspar grande mono island swept out through boca de navios shaped course north west by west for cape tiburon in island of hayti be passed at daybreak on morning one following yacht finally entering havana harbour making fast to buoy at eight o'clock on morning of succeeding day montijo family landed immediately after breakfast took first available train to pinar del rio hoping to arrive home same evening jack remained on board yacht a be by time so exceedingly foul that have be decided to dock have cleaned in readiness for emergency singleton being ostensible owner be deemed wise prudent thing that must remain at havana to personally arrange for work to be done lest suspicion a to genuineness of ownership must arise in mind of of spanish official a jack went hither about business after having seen friend off by train be astonished at change have taken place in appearance of havana since have last seen on memorable day when capitan general have visited thetis persuaded rather practically compelled to lend vessel for purpose of attempting capture of james b potter then havana be simply busy seaport now be fortress preparing for war street be full of troop fresh landed from transport in harbour marching to railway station to entrain for various part of island gun ammunition ambulance wagon be rumbling rattling over cobble excited aide de camp be furiously spurring hither thither air be clamourous with strain of martial music incessant shouting of military word of command alameda be armed camp cafe restaurant be crowded with arrogant boasting posturing military naval officer with small sprinkling of civilian who be made to clearly understand that be there only on sufferance jack must not help noticing scowl with soldiery regarded many insulting epithet remark reached ear be not such fool a to permit to be provoked into quarrel single handed with thousand therefore went calmly steadily on way taking more notice of offensive word than if have not be spoken following narrow side street a much a possible in course of time arrived at office of british consul turned in to pay call upon gentleman found official in question up to eye in business nevertheless received very cordial greeting if not particularly hearty welcome hillo singleton what be doing back here at moment above others exclaimed consul rising holding out hand be in hope that be safely back in old country long ago indeed said jack taking other proffered hand why safely back be cuba then especially dangerous place for englishman just now well will not go so far a to give unqualified answer in affirmative to question replied consul will say must certainly not recommend englishman to remain on island at juncture unless be fully prepared to prove to authority that have good sufficient reason for so doing fact be that cuba be crater of political volcano at present moment nobody quite know what be going to happen for year now in fact ever since ' cuban have be in state of more le unrest in more le open revolt against spanish rule indication have for time past be that event of ' to be about to be repeated possibly in more aggravated form be well known that large consignment of arm ammunition military store have recently be smuggled into country yet strangely enough so great have be vacillation of government mind that although have done utmost to put stop to smuggling have finished there effort have be made to discover what have become of smuggled cargo beyond vaguely generally suspecting who have not openly declared in favour of continuance of spanish rule no serious endeavour have be made to discover identity of conspirator fact be that spanish government be acting precisely like fabled ostrich be burying head in sand refusing to see coming trouble even now although two armed rising have very recently taken place one in province of santiago other in of latter by way having be promptly suppressed official mind persists in asserting that movement be nothing more than attempt on part of few bandit to commit robbery outrage of description under mask of patriotism yet may have observed a passed through street to day that despite assertion be behaving very much a though be in state of mortal terror symptom of scare be marked suspicion distrust not to say aversion with regard stranger especially american englishman in island american a may possibly be aware have not taken very much trouble to conceal fact that sympathy be distinctly on side of cuban spanish intelligence seems unable to differentiate between american englishman be why say must not recommend englishman to remain in cuba just now unless posse mean of satisfying spaniard that be not inimical to well said jack if there be englishman in whole island who can do think ought to be man for did not place yacht at service for purpose of smashing up one of gun running expedition that be speaking of just now at moment when one of warship in harbour have be disabled ah yes said consul remember hearing something of affair although authority did best to hush up failed believe in consequence of engine breaking down yes said jack just off mulata bay precise spot where american steamer be landing cargo a matter of fact actually saw at most extraordinary affair remarked consul when vessel be subsequently docked be discovered that propeller have be rendered immovable by being locked with stout chain from be surmised that outrage must have be perpetrated by mean of kind of diving vessel where such craft must have come from heaven only know for nothing of kind have be discovered got wind of in of harbour of cuba although suppose must not be very difficult matter for people acquainted with working of such vessel to conceal very effectually at bottom of out of way bay remember reading year ago story of gigantic craft be airship submarine at will of crew be capable of doing very wonderful thing regarded yarn a nothing more than flight of romancer vivid imagination yet must have be such vessel disabled spanish warship go to prove again soundness of old adage that truth be stranger than fiction yacht disablement be entirely different matter a understood for actually steamed several mile before broke down did ever discover to whom be indebted for mishap how must answered jack went to sea again next morning have be absent ever since be thinking must call upon capitan general ask if of people have ever be able to find clue to identity of guilty party be said consul then let very strongly advise not to do anything of kind have plenty to worry just now without being reminded of exceedingly unpleasant annoying incident finally be persuaded by to clear out of cuba at very earliest possible moment for island be certainly at present place for young fellow like who have good business at home business at here even if be serious in idea of purchasing land establishing tobacco growing estate be certainly not time at to engage in such undertaking for in first place very strong suspicion distrust with authority at present moment regard foreigner must render almost impossible for to secure inalienable title to land in next place when other difficulty be surmounted must find that labourer be to be have mother son of being insurgent openly secretly consequently must get work done on land therefore will manifestly be prudent for to postpone undertaking until present imbroglio be at end island be at peace once more now be afraid that must bid good morning for insurrection have piled up lot of extra business for a well a for others have given very best advice of be capable hope that will not only think over very speedily act upon for tell candidly that cuba be exceedingly unsafe place for englishman just now upon word said jack be very much disposed to believe that be right will certainly think over what have said good bye many thanks for most excellent advice even a young man left office issued upon crowded street knew that have not remotest intention of acting upon consul advice to extent of leaving cuba at event for felt that be morally pledged to stand by montijos so long a might need there be complication of ownership of yacht must need great deal of straightening out lastly close association with lovely senorita isolda during four month cruise just ended have not be without effect upon so that taking thing round told that for to leave cuba at present be quite out of question when jack set about making necessary arrangement for docking of thetis at once found confronted with adamantine procrastination constitutes serious flaw in spanish character manana to morrow be word be most often in spaniard mouth invincible determination never to do to day what can possibly be postponed until morrow be perhaps a marked national characteristic a be indomitable pride of spaniard from highest grandee down to meanest beggar to be found outside church door thus although dock happened at moment to be empty singleton found absolutely impossible to infuse into dock official energy necessary to enable to make arrangement for entrance of yacht on day manana be word wherever turned manana have to be even when at length late on following day vessel be safely docked steam pump started by water be to be pumped out of enclosure vessel left dry accessible to workman proved so exceedingly difficult to prevail upon workman to get to work at length jack milsom driven to despair with patience absolutely exhausted be obliged to set own people on to job of removing from ship bottom thick growth of barnacle sea grass with be encrusted afterwards to cover steel plating with fresh coating of anti fouling composition be thus full week from date of yacht arrival in havana harbour ere be once more afloat ready for sea jack at length felt free to fulfil promise to rejoin montijo family at hacienda chapter twelve bad news be glorious morning when jack after early breakfast made way to railway station having written two day before to apprise friend of coming demanded first class ticket for pinar del rio be gratified to find that not only be there troop going by train also very few people be travelling by that be therefore likely to be able to secure compartment to for found in most unaccountable state of excitement at prospect of meeting friend once more be also acutely conscious of desire to be absolutely alone in order that might be free to picture to precise manner in must be likely to receive there be also reason why young man be anxious to be alone during journey be that mingling curiously with feeling of exhilaration resulting from pleasurable anticipation there be certain vague uneasiness traceable to fact that word either by telegram letter have come to from member of montijo family since have said au revoir to on platform nine day ago have not have much time to dwell upon fact while yacht be in dock indeed have be so exceedingly busy so dog tired at end of day work that have scarcely obtruded upon attention now began to worry a to why be that someone by really meant dona isolda have not be able to find time to drop so much a two three line to say that have arrived safely be hoping to see soon of course a told there be very particular reason why anyone must have written so very vapid commonplace piece of intelligence a that have arrived home safely for might be taken for granted that have done so train in cuba travelled too slowly traffic be too meagre to admit of possibility of accident moreover there have be no news of such thing apart from accident there be absolutely reason that jack must think of why friend must not reach destination in safety yet young man usually so reasonable level headed be now fast worrying into fever because certain people have not done something constantly assured there be not slightest need for to have done when at length train drew up at platform of pinar del rio station saw senor eugenio calderon don hermoso manager waiting thereon heart sank momentary feeling of sickness giddiness seized a reeled out of carriage on to platform muttered to knew be certain that something be wrong then pulled together turned to greet senor calderon a unconcernedly a might be well senor calderon how be how be at hacienda exclaimed don hermoso received note suppose let walk to end of platform senor replied calderon drawing away out of earshot of little crowd of alighting embarking passenger received letter senor singleton in absence of don hermoso opened a have opened letter arriving for since left hacienda when have read came to conclusion that be duty to meet here upon arrival for senor can no longer hide from fear that something untoward have befallen don hermoso family duly received telegram dispatched to from havana apprising of arrival there intention to return home same day a requested by message dispatched carriage here to meet train by said intended to travel on following day carriage returned to house with intelligence that don hermoso of family have arrived either by train indicated in telegram by subsequent train from very naturally concluded that something have occurred to detain party in havana looked from day to day for letter message of kind explaining delay nothing came when at length received letter gathered from that believed family to be at home at once felt that something very wrong have happened came to conclusion that proper thing for to do be to meet here inform of circumstance of course concurred jack that certainly be proper thing to do what can possibly have happened to why dickens did not write to at once when party failed to turn up can see now ought to have done so said calderon see senor added in excuse be constantly expecting to hear from don hermoso explaining absence naming day for arrival in condition of expectancy day slipped away yes assented jack grimly see well be useless to worry about now question be what have become of people disappear in mysterious fashion without cause be certain that did not remain in havana for saw off if have gone back to city must have returned to yacht communicated with in way be equally certain that when stepped aboard train that morning fully intended to return to house disappearance therefore be involuntary on part be confident of now what can be explanation of most singular occurrence can be that by way senor calderon have have visitor to house during absence of don hermoso family yes senor unfortunately have have visitor on one occasion that visit may very possibly now that come to mention have have something to do with disappearance of senor montijo family occurred three week ago visitor consisted of officer of cavalry dozen trooper officer enquired for don hermoso when told that be absent from home demanded key of don hermoso desk compelled to surrender when have handed over key officer sat down at desk spent nearly three hour in going through whole of senor montijo private paper of took away with did make remark say who be demanded jack senor one other answered calderon how long have be in don hermoso service demanded jack for eleven year let consider yes for eleven year nine month senor owe to don hermoso everything have answered calderon suppose be fully in don hermoso confidence asked jack believe so senor answered calderon doubt very much whether have secret from know for instance dropping voice almost to whisper that yacht thetis be understood to be property really belongs to also know that brought out from england large consignment of arm ammunition store for use of insurgent that consignment be landed in laguna de cortes be fully aware that senor montijo be actively sympathetic with insurgent a be member of family household down to meanest stable boy labourer in field in case said jack probability be that paper unknown cavalry officer took away with be of more le compromising character eh very much fear so senor answered calderon if not exactly compromising at least of such character a to prove that don hermoso be sympathetic in correspondence with insurgent faction pardon for saying so senor singleton quite easily perceive by manner that be not at certain of fidelity to don hermoso hope to convince of in due time however meanwhile honour for distrust for prof friendly interest in employer family will remain here to manage estate guard employer interest a long a be permitted to do so if mistake not will presently be leaving here to return to havana with object of discovering have happened to don hermoso family own opinion now be that have be arrested a conspirator upon evidence supplied by abstracted paper if so say most fervently god help for spaniard will show mercy a to fidelity senor perhaps can even now afford small proof of by guiding first footstep in search for lost one when return to havana call upon don ramon bergera whose house be in calle del ignacio immediately opposite mansion of capitan general be great friend of don hermoso although believe quite unsuspected by authority ardent sympathiser with insurgent be also preternaturally clever in obtaining information of kind solving mystery introduce to tell that know of matter have told be guided by with skill courage senor singleton trust that may even yet be well with honoured friend patron family now here come train senor so will bid good bye wish best of good luck must be necessary for to communicate with at time will be advisable to do so by special messenger for there be only too much reason to suspect that letter be often scrutinised during passage through post office now will have to be quick if wish to get ticket so adios senor hasta ma verle sun last ray be gilding wall of morro cabana castle when jack stepped out of train at havana central station that evening residence of don ramon bergera be close at hand young englishman determined to call there then in hope of finding don at home be fortunately successful five minute later found in presence of fine distinguished looking man with piercing black eye seemed to look one through through jack be favourably impressed at once for there be look of strength moral a well a physical of straightforwardness about man who faced that very powerfully appealed to simple honesty of englishman a also did frank open hearted courtesy of reception pray be seated senor singleton said don ramon placing chair for visitor be very glad to make acquaintance allow to offer cigar glass of sangaree latter will refresh for look hot tired dusty a though have just made journey have said jack gratefully accepting proffered refreshment availing forthwith of opening afforded by don ramon remark proceeded to tell whole story of mysterious disappearance of montijo family winding up by mentioning that have made call at calderon suggestion be very glad indeed that acted upon suggestion said don ramon calderon be all right be absolutely faithful trustworthy don hermoso interest be perfectly safe in hand now let consider very serious question of mysterious evanishment of friend family did understand to say that actually saw leave havana yes said jack went with to station chatted with until train pulled out then said don ramon be obvious that disappearance occurred somewhere between havana pinar del rio possibly at santiago maybe at bejucal if can not hear anything of elsewhere will run down to place to morrow institute few judicious enquiry meanwhile fear that senor calderon apprehension a to arrest of entire family be only too well founded fact that party of soldier be sent to search don hermoso house prof most conclusively that friend have somehow contrived to arouse suspicion of authority after be not very surprising knowing what do a to don hermoso connection with insurgent fact that certain paper be seized by search party point to inference that paper contained incriminating evidence if did can only say that be heartily sorry for family for since recent rising government be adopting most ruthless measure to discourage even passive sympathy with insurgent know that don hermoso sympathy be something very much more than passive now there be question must like to ask do happen to know whether by chance don hermoso have be unfortunate enough to make enemy among government entourage for may tell that present moment be particularly favourable one for gratification of private enmity if enemy happens to be connected with government jack considered for moment no said slowly be not aware of anything of stop moment though yes by jove there be something of kind after there be certain captain alvaros belonging to one of infantry regiment who have confounded impudence to propose marriage with senorita isolda although young lady be only about sixteen year of age believe don hermoso very rightly must not hear of refused fellow point blank understood forbade house phew whistled don ramon with show of consternation be that so caramba be sorry to hear that what have just said be amply sufficient to account for everything know good deal about don sebastian alvaros enough to assure senor singleton that be a english say thorough bad egg worse than that be also man of standing importance in official circle now that come to mention remember that be stationed with company at pinar del rio not so very long ago within last two month have be made governor of prison of la jacoba poor don hermoso be sorry for of course knowing alvaros a must have done to refuse be only thing possible be bitter misfortune for family that fellow must ever have have opportunity to see dona isolda of course be also after don hermoso money knowing a doubtless did that son in law of senor montijo will be exceedingly lucky man in respect now senor singleton have anything else to tell because if not will dispense with ceremony bid good evening under other circumstance must have afforded greatest possible pleasure if must have stayed to dine with after what have told will dine at restaurant not very far from here be largely patronised by officer government official possibly may meet someone there from whom may be fortunate enough to extract little information will not ask to accompany because be very desirable that must not be seen together that must not be known that be acquainted for reason will also be advisable that in event of meeting other in street must behave a stranger taking notice of other will naturally be anxious to know how be progressing with enquiry be also desirable that must meet confer together from time to time therefore meeting place have better be here enter by front door a did evening lest someone knowing by sight aware of friendship for don hermoso who must remember be suspected man must see fact of acquaintance thus become known when have occasion to call upon trust senor will be very often come to little wicket in back wall of garden by be about to let out will give gardener instruction to admit whenever may present there will thus be much le chance of acquaintance with other becoming known so saying don ramon conducted visitor down narrow corkscrew staircase into large most beautiful garden where jack gardener be duly confronted with other certain instruction given to latter after gate in wall be opened with prior precautionary peep to ensure that lurking watcher be in sight young englishman be gently hustled into narrow very dark dirty lane way lie to left murmured don ramon a shook hand with jack bade good night walk in middle of road keep wary eye on court passage to right left of a pas back street be always dangerous especially so at night time therefore if anyone must spring out at stop to parley hit out straight hard good night a happened jack did not see solitary human being until presently emerged into one of wider more frequented street twenty minute later be safely on board thetis again to great astonishment of milsom who have be pacing deck in endeavour to raise appetite for dinner meanwhile picturing to pleasant time that supposed jack to be having at hacienda be of course profoundly concerned at news jack have to tell spent remainder of evening in alternately invoking sea blessing upon head of don sebastian alvaros wondering what must happen to montijos must apprehension of friend prove correct endeavouring to devise scheme for discovery liberation of family next morning saw jack early visitor at office of british consul into sympathetic ear of most long suffering official young man poured woe fear indignation that such happening must occur in so called christian country consul must offer very little comfort for a pointed out to jack affair be one concerning spanish government alone with must not possibly interfere at least officially undertook to refer to matter unofficially at next interview with capitan general promised to furnish jack with information might then upon other occasion obtain with somewhat meagre promise master jack be obliged to rest content young man must not remain so for long on several succeeding day wandered about havana street haunted various cafe restaurant in hope of somewhere hearing chance word must throw glimmer of light upon mystery also reconnoitred jail passing repassing dozen time day upon off chance that might sooner later catch glimpse of one of friend face peering out through one of little grated opening in wall to purpose at end of three week from date of disappearance mystery remained a insoluble a ever have don ramon met with better success can not understand exclaimed that gentleman irritably have sought information in conceivable direction have set sort of unseen force in motion with absolutely result even capitan general have drawn blank be ignorant pretend to be of what have happened to friend most have be able to get out of be statement may take for what be worth that have issued order for arrest of member of montijo family wish must get hold of alvaros have not be able to run up against nobody seems to know where be anything about be three four day later that jack by time utterly weary heartsick at lack of success entered restaurant be much frequented by officer of garrison seating at table ordered second breakfast there be not very many people in place at moment soon began to fill up presently young man heart gave great bound felt pulse of temple throbbing furiously a three officer laughing talking loudly entered place began to look about for table one of men be alvaros hence jack emotion a lad sat staring open eyed at alvaros glanced in direction jack saw light of recognition leap into eye see friend exclaimed spaniard there be vacant table next to one at young beast of englishman be sitting let take therewith trio stalked down room with vast amount of clatter seated at table next to one occupied by singleton that beggar mean mischief can see in eye thought jack well continued mentally let do worst mean mischief too will see who be better player at game must keep cool if be to come out on top who know skunk may say something will afford useful tip for few minute three officer sat chatting together then jack noticed that be alvaros youngest of trio ensign apparently who did most of talking third man who be evidently cavalryman merely put in word two here there seemed to be slightly disgusted at boisterousness of companion then alvaros who have feigned not to have recognised jack exclaimed by by must not forget to tell most interesting item of news do of fellow happen to know to have heard of certain don hermoso montijo who owns large tobacco plantation in direction of pinar del rio of course have everybody know have heard of montijo richest man in cuba who be until very recently be afraid that rich will never be of much use to again why simply because old scoundrel turn out to be hand in glove with insurgent have be helping most lavishly with money be more than suspected that be who be responsible for importation of arm supply of sort have entered island reached hand of insurgent within last six month even went to europe taking cub of son with for purpose of procuring most modern weapon spaniard therefore who fall during operation for suppression of present rising will be indebted to don hermoso montijo for death government be going to give ample time in to repent of sin for family sail for fernando po on sunday next on board convict steamer el maranon in company of several other choice miserables so will no longer be troubled with a be chiefly instrumental in laying bare villainy will when estate be confiscated put in claim for a reward be not so much of a of daughter intended to tell dona isolda montijo be universally admitted to be beyond question most lovely woman in cuba for once popular estimate be correct a man know so well a do steady old man steady said jack to hold tight clench teeth blackguard be talking now with express intention of provoking into commission of overt act for must be sorry afterwards must not allow to be provoked infernal fool in anxiety to hurt have made present of what may prove to be most valuable bit of information must not allow to be inveigled into scrape of sort may not be allowed opportunity to avail of so keep tight grip upon jack singleton bottle up wrath for future use when montijos be arrested about month ago continued don sebastian so arranged matter that be confined in la jacoba of course a governor of prison possessed considerable power thus be not difficult therewith fellow proceeded with great gusto to tell story of cruelty like of be to be hoped for credit of one manhood be not often repeated while be telling jack sat tight listened storing up vile word monstrous detail in mind that might have something to whet vengeance upon when time for vengeance must come agitation be so evident distress so poignant that alvaros thought must be very good fun to direct public attention to so feigning to become suddenly aware of swung chair round exclaimed loud enough for everybody in room to hear hillo senor englishman what be matter with appear to be upset about something perhaps little story jar upon puritanical english notion perhaps be yes of course be upset about news that have just heard of friend for now come to look at see that be englishman whom met at don hermoso house whom warned to leave island how be that have not yet gone because pleased to stay answered jack will be leaving to morrow next day for short time now don sebastian alvaros disgrace to uniform that wear unmitigated blackguard scoundrel mean contemptible coward a believe colossal liar listen to a told moment ago be leaving cuba within next day two will return senor if must ever prove that infamous story have just told be even approximately true will not kill will inflict upon fearful punishment for vile deed that cuba will ring with will be warning to man who hears tale to beware of doing like bueno bueno well spoken young englishman cried one two voice from amid crowd several people anticipating fracas started to foot a did alvaros whose feature be now livid twitching with mingled fury fear pig of englishman exclaimed clapping hand on sword hilt will die for attempted to snatch weapon from sheath cavalryman who have entered place with have listened in silence with lowering brow to shameful story now sprang out of seat seizing alvaros by shoulder thrust violently back into chair hissing between clenched teeth silence cochinillo sit down dare to further disgrace sword by drawing on unarmed man will manage affair senor turning to jack have publicly insulted officer of spanish army great a have be provocation must give man satisfaction be englishman must appear be therefore quite possible that may have friend here to see through quarrel must such be case will esteem honoured if will permit to place service at disposal have pleasure to offer card senor so saying produced card case extracting card therefrom tendered to jack meanwhile during progress of above little speech jack have be thinking hard be in for row after despite good resolution of short time before must carry matter through a best must since strange soldier be willing to stand by see fair play there be certainly no need for to further complicate matter by calling upon don ramon of other people whose acquaintance have made during short stay in island of whom be moreover friend of don hermoso while of course british consul be quite impossible therefore accepted proffered card bore inscription lorenzo de albareda colonel th madrid cuirassier handed over one of own in return accept generous offer colonel with utmost pleasure said will leave entirely in hand be at present living on board yacht thetis lie in harbour will arrange that steamboat will be in waiting for at custom house step to convey on board where will find when will have completed arrangement now senor must leave adios until meet again therewith bowing first to new friend colonel then to company at large many of whom clapped hand approvingly jack passed out of restaurant made way to don ramon bergera house to tell what have learned chapter thirteen jack grows desperate by lucky chance happened that don ramon be at home when jack reached house young man be accordingly conducted to room in spanish friend usually transacted business at sight of visitor don ramon flung down pen grasped jack by hand well exclaimed what be have picked up news at last can see be bad news fear by look of be that be ill por dios man look a though might be dying here sit down let ring for cognac said jack need cognac anything else thanks have just gained news of poor friend bad news be a will hear thereupon related have passed at restaurant repeating alvaros word a nearly verbatim a must remember oh despicable villain atrocious scoundrel exclaimed don ramon when singleton have come to end of narrative do really believe that part of story relating to senorita isolda be true may not be that be merely empty boast of inordinately vain man there be individual know who pride on sort of thing so believe answered jack though thank god have never be misfortune to be brought into contact with of until now be afraid that story be only too true scoundrel being governor of prison must have power to to do what say did mere fact that boasted of seems pretty strong evidence that also have will be therefore afraid that oh hang wo do must pull together will be fit for nothing be very true acquiesced don ramon when man be going out to fight must not allow nerve to be upset by giving way to violent emotion now have decided upon what weapon will fight with being challenged party know have choice of weapon have said jack wearily why yes of course suppose have have not given ghost of thought to question of weapon one thing be certain wish to kill alvaros for of course carlos will want to have turn with a soon a can get chance must quite rightly be furious with if be to balk do wish to kill for must entirely upset plan what must like to do must be to give tremendous punishing without endangering life suppose must not be good form to choose fist a weapon must don ramon laughed scarcely know whether not must be good form ' to insist on fighting with bare fist said know that must be most unusual still be not sure that singularity must constitute insuperable bar to acceptance by second at rate there will be harm in offering suggestion to de albareda be thorough good fellow through may safely leave in hand if will pardon for saying so young friend appears to that be acting somewhat quixotically in sparing blackguard in order that friend carlos may be able to take hand in punishment if quarrel be mine must choose pistol shoot fellow dead thus making sure of besides do suppose that poor carlos will ever have chance to get away from fernando po when once have got there never will get there of rest of family said jack eye brightening a thought of great adventure came into mind have already decided what to do so far a be concerned will follow convict ship take montijos out of dear boy remonstrated bergera can not possibly do that know must be act of piracy on high sea care value of brass button what be declared jack be going to do will take chance of being hanged for afterwards will not be piracy for will do trick under cuban flag flag of cuba libre will therefore be belligerent not pirate a to shooting alvaros dead certainly will not do that if can possibly help for punishment a must be altogether too light for atrocious crime of have be guilty upon own confession very well said don ramon must do a please in other matter for see that have already made up mind in case be glad that came straight to with news although be of such dreadful character for now that have alvaros ' statement that poor unhappy friend be in la jacoba that be to leave for fernando po on sunday will know how where to prosecute enquiry be very essential that must assure ourselves of truth of statement otherwise attempt at rescue may miss fire after now suppose will fight villain to morrow morning at daybreak if so do favour of coming here to early breakfast with at eight o'clock can then tell have happened for part will by time be in position to tell definitely how much of alvaros story be true certainly answered jack will come with pleasure meanwhile suppose ought to be getting back to yacht to be ready to receive de albareda so good bye see to morrow be nearly three o'clock when singleton reached thetis in answer to enquiry be informed that stranger have visited ship therefore spent entire afternoon in posting milsom on position of affair generally discussing with jack plan for rescue of montijos from convict steamer plan by way milsom pronounced to be quite feasible stating that like jack be fully prepared to go through with piracy not therewith began to congratulate upon foresight in employing spare time in preparation of wonderful disguise for yacht opportunity to use have be awaiting with steadily growing impatience be past five o'clock when steam pinnace appeared approaching yacht with de albareda in stern sheet officer explained delay by stating that have be obliged to go on duty during afternoon have only just escaped therefrom plunged at once into business on hand by reminding jack that choice of weapon be asking whether have yet decided what must use be at first inclined to be somewhat annoyed when jack explained with earnestness that must prefer to fight with fist only for be man who have profound respect for duello considered ought to be conducted with due formality dignity finally burst into fit of hearty laughter at absurdity a regarded of two men attempting to settle serious quarrel by pommelling other like brace of schoolboy admitted that if jack chose to insist upon fist a weapon must be strictly within right dwelt a don ramon also have done upon unusual character of such demand strongly hinted at own partiality for pistol whereupon jack gracefully conceded point agreed that pistol must be remaining detail be speedily settled hour arranged being sunrise on following morning place botanical garden then de albareda went ashore again to interview alvaros second apprise of nature of arrangement promising to return to yacht in time for dinner spend night on board very pleasant genial fellow proved to be very agreeable evening jack milsom spent together there be many more cheerful place in world than havana botanical garden just at sunrise for at hour mist lie chill heavy upon ground grass be saturated with dew numerous tree not only freely bespatter everything beneath widespreading branch with copious shower of dewdrop a wind sweep through many of have trick of assuming singularly weird uncanny appearance in first faint light of early dawn yet jack felt quite happy not to say exhilarated a friend colonel of cuirassier stepped briskly along dew sodden gravel path on way to rendezvous be open grassy space in south west corner of garden albareda have be assiduously coaching principal ever since leaving yacht in etiquette of duello a observed by spanish army until considered that have made companion letter perfect now be giving jack few last word of caution admonition before standing up to be shot at there be doubt in mind said alvaros intends to kill if can for what said to yesterday have evidently sunk into mind made afraid of therefore must be careful to fire sharp upon word will have for to give fellow due be rather neat quick hand with pistol word will be given thus one two three at word three ' must pull trigger must recommend to look straight between eye from moment that be posted otherwise may attempt to play trick with such a firing fraction of second before proper time something of sort ah here be first on ground thank goodness with full two minute to spare only just managed however for looking back along path by have come here come other fellow surgeon with how be feeling quite cool comfortable good be excellent condition be simple duellist be to exchange not more than three shot at distance of twelve pace be to fire at word of command at last moment be agreed at albareda suggestion that if of combatant fired before word of command be to be penalised by antagonist being given privilege of extra shot at be evident to that condition be exceedingly distasteful to alvaros yet must not complain refuse acceptance since imposed hardship upon man who intended to fight fair matter being arranged ground be selected utmost care being taken that combatant have slightest advantage over other in matter of light distance be paced off men placed now said albareda who be to give word will count three steadily thus one two three at word three ' not before remember may pull trigger now be quite ready then one two three jack most carefully observed one of instruction given by second including that referred to looking antagonist steadily between eye quickly saw that simple proceeding have most disconcerting effect upon alvaros whose return gaze at once became shifty uncertain result being that spaniard bullet flew wide while jack aimed by hand a steady a rock struck alvaros right elbow completely shattering bone inflicting injury that surgeon at first glance thought must probably stiffen arm for remainder of owner life to extent of very seriously disabling under circumstance alvaros ' second expressed satisfied declined further shot whereupon jack friend left ground went respective way jack back to yacht colonel of cuirassier to quarter by time jack got back on board thetis be nearly seven o'clock crew be busily engaged in performing ship toilet for day spreading awning so on therefore retired to interior of deck house with milsom arranged with individual that must spend day in filling bunker chock block with coal taking in fresh water laying in supply of fresh meat vegetable fruit for sea generally preparing to go out of harbour on following day then thought suddenly striking wired to calderon directing to pack dispatch forthwith to yacht wearing apparel of description that must find belonging to of member of montijo family box to arrive at havana next day without fail not later than by mid day train done hurried away to keep breakfast appointment with don ramon bergera whom found awaiting in somewhat anxious frame of mind lest anything untoward must have resulted from duel reassured on point don ramon chatted with jack upon indifferent subject until breakfast be served servant have be dismissed when said be doubt anxious to learn result of enquiry into truth of alvaros story undertook to make yesterday afternoon well can tell have ascertained beyond possibility of doubt that montijos be a scoundrel stated in la jacoba also that be to be shipped off to fernando po by steamer el maranon steamer be appointed to leave harbour on sunday next by whose authority be being thus summarily dealt with can not understand ascertain only thing be quite certain being that have not be tried convicted publicly that however be nothing for be common knowledge score indeed may say hundred of people who have be suspected of disloyalty to government have mysteriously vanished from time to time have never again be heard of in light of what now know however there be little doubt in mind that have be sent either to ceuta to fernando po poor cuba be indeed downtrodden country be little wonder that people be at last rising up in arm against atrocious system of tyranny misgovernment under be groaning capitan general be good man mean well believe be weak be moreover hampered embarrassed to point of helplessness by multiplicity of impossible instruction receives from home furthermore be in hand of number of unscrupulous overbearing subordinate who have arrogated to almost autocratic power who act upon own responsibility without consulting believe be have occurred in case of montijos fellow alvaros have somehow managed to work into position of very considerable power have little doubt that only be responsible for whole shameful business in opinion have be neither more le than determined unsuccessful attempt to force unhappy senorita isolda into marriage with well said jack grimly be going to repent of business in sackcloth ash before dy have received first instalment of punishment morning there be more in store for by way said don ramon what do propose to do with montijos when have rescued in event of mad scheme of yours proving successful oh said jack have thought of thus far of course will be for don hermoso to decide where will go what will do when have got safely out of convict ship imagine that will be anxious to return to own place take care of property if can if not can always find safety in jamaica y e assented don ramon doubtfully be of course right so far a go chance be that alvaros next move will be to procure confiscation of don hermoso property secure possession to now just let consider point for moment must happen what will poor don hermoso do know what must do in case said jack must return to property if alvaros happened to be in possession of well must be so much worse for alvaros be tell don ramon that in struggle be just now beginning in island be bold strong men who be going to come out on top a yankee say in course of next month two spanish government will have hand so full that will have time to deal with individual yes said don ramon with decision believe be quite right there young friend probably most daring policy will be safest for cuban to pursue yes there be possibility in idea of yours believe must think over at greater leisure than have to spare for just now meanwhile will manifestly be very advantageous for don hermoso to know precisely how affair stand be latest development before attempt to return to home will therefore by way how long do anticipate that will take to effect rescue quite impossible to say answered jack maranon will doubt keep cuban coast close aboard until get a far east a say cavana point then steer about midway between great inagua hayti keeping to southward of bank so passing into open atlantic probably taking departure ' in navigator sense of term from cape viejo francais on northern coast of hayti striking thence a straight across a can go to fernando po be intention to go to sea to morrow next day perhaps lie in wait for after will follow at sufficient distance to avoid arousing suspicion of captain pounce upon at first favourable opportunity present probably if go well with will be free again in fortnight from to day upon word said don ramon laughing be positively exhilarating to hear confident tone in talk be actually inveigling into indulgence of sort of ridiculous hope that enterprise will be successful now let talk for moment two a though that hope be going to be realised when have accomplished rescue of friend have better put into cuban port where yacht be not known communicate with by telegraph now what must be best place for to call at really said jack think matter very much thetis have be into practically port in cuba be reason why must not enter of again for must remember that will be time before escape of montijo family be known probably not until maranon have travelled way to fernando po back if be indeed to return to havana by way be by mean certain how must guantanamo do guantanamo must do very well indeed answered don ramon yes guantanamo let be now next matter to be considered be question of cipher in to communicate for of course go without saying that cipher of sort must be used must never do for such treasonable correspondence a have in mind to be carried on in plain language capable of being understood by telegraph clerk letter sorter through whose hand may chance to pas happen to be acquainted with first class cipher suppose yes do if can recall to mind said jack met with in book time ago struck a being especially good from fact that consisted entirely of figure that be not necessary to use precisely same figure time to represent particular letter hence seems impossible for anyone to decipher without key now let consider how did go something like think can let have pencil sheet of paper don ramon produced article required singleton set to work with presently glanced up with exclamation of satisfaction yes said that be right thought have not forgotten be how go proceeded to explain system to don ramon excellent exclaimed latter nothing must be better for be absolutely safe very well senor will use cipher then in communicating with other will wire to upon arrival at guantanamo meanwhile will make business to watch course of event here be prepared to furnish with news a soon a hear of return now be there anything else remaining to be arranged considered for several minute at length came to conclusion that there be not whereupon breakfast having be by time dispatched jack rose took leave laden down with kind encouraging message for montijos to be delivered when rescue of family must have be accomplished from don ramon house jack made way to british consulate where bade farewell to consul explaining to gentleman that be tired of shore life intended to go to sea for change that further did not in least know whether must return whether must decide to go home if will take advice young gentleman said consul will go home stay there at least will stay away from cuba until trouble be over jack promised that must give that advice most careful consideration after bade fellow countryman adieu made way aboard yacht where milsom be found busily arranging to take thetis alongside coal hulk a soon a water lighter have cast off remainder of day be busy time for men for milsom still have clearance to effect store to receive while jack spent afternoon at railway station awaiting arrival of baggage due dispatch of calderon have notified to by telegraph arrived late in afternoon be taken straight aboard yacht where be placed at haphazard in cabin lately occupied by various member of montijo family then when at bustle of preparation be ended yacht be in condition to leave at moment notice jack milsom adjourned to chart house to discus matter be to ensue upon departure of thetis from havana harbour now said singleton a took from drawer in chart case large scale chart of cuba laid on top of case how long do suppose will take to effect transmogrification of ship by mean of disguise of yours well answered milsom seeing have never yet rigged arrangement be not prepared to say to hour so just how long will take reckon under favourable condition ought to be done in about four hour to make certain suppose call twelve hour ought to suffice at same time leave sufficient margin for small alteration may be necessary seem just little bit inclined to sneer at wonderful disguise master jack have better wait until have seen before do venture to remind that be navy man a such know thing two about disguising ship have have little experience in direction during carrying out of manoeuvre be prepared to make bet that if not knowing anything about arrangement mind be to pas vessel in disguised condition within mile must never recognise right phil old chap get back up will take word for that thing be right said jack if seemed to speak disparagingly of contrivance forgive old man will have have good deal to worry lately be afraid that nerve temper be bit on edge daresay will feel better when get to sea again can start to circumvent spanish government at least that part of be responsible for misrule shameful injustice be rampant in cuba now think understood to say that require quiet water to enable to rig disguising arrangement so propose to go to sea to morrow will be thursday run down coast to eastward in search of secluded spot in can effect transformation without being interfered with overlooked by anybody now let have look at chart there ought not to be very much difficulty in finding suitable spot remarked milsom a pair bent over sheet ah continued laying finger upon paper here be must be perfectly ideal place just sufficient water lee to shelter under very little likelihood of being disturbed at work can go in here through boca de sagua la grande haul up to south east come to anchor in little bight in two quarter fathom of water when preparation be complete can go out to sea again by way of boca de maravilla thus avoiding observation of people who tend light on hicacal cay who will be sure to notice a go in by way picked up rather useful little item of information while be ashore afternoon fell in with harbour master who seems quite decent sort of chap a spaniard go have gradually grown to be rather chummy since have be in harbour here upon strength of fact be clearing for sea took into place on quay yonder cracked farewell bottle of wine with a emptied bottle yarned together upon various topic by by made casual mention of maranon to replied by saying that have appearance of being rather fast vessel that thought pity that skipper did not take little more pride in appearance smarten up bit by giving lick of paint occasionally shrugged shoulder asked what must ship be convict ship appearance be matter of consequence a to speed must steam twelve knot most economical speed be eight opined that eight knot must therefore be pace on trip to fernando po for reason rather pitied unfortunate convict who be doomed to travel in for have reputation of being most uneasy ship in seaway also ascertained from that be timed to sail at two o'clock on sunday afternoon must bring off hiding place about let see yes about seven o'clock on monday morning now if skipper must chance to keep coast pretty close aboard a possibly may ought to catch glimpse of from masthead a go past if on other hand must push off into mid channel to get full benefit of current think best plan will be to allow say four hour for delay in starting then follow until sight when further action can be governed by circumstance so have instructed perkins to pas word round among deck hand for everybody to take good look at so that may know again when see good exclaimed jack be excellent news be well worth bottle of wine think suppose that friend have suspicion of intention deliberately told for purpose of misleading not answered milsom confidently be too simple chap to conceive such suspicion a besides why must have done nothing to lead even most suspicious spaniard to connect departure with of el maranon oh what told slipped out in most casual way in ordinary course of conversation may be sure be particularly careful not to question to say anything might lead to suppose that took least interest in movement of ship well said jack must hope for best be horribly anxious phil lest anything must go wrong with scheme of ours so much depends upon success know by way what about pilot for place where be going to transform ship how will manage about will not need to manage ' at answered milsom for simple reason that will not take pilot if get under way at about eight o'clock to morrow morning will reach destination with several hour of daylight in hand with help of chart hand aloft on foremast two leadsmen in forechains will guarantee to take little hooker in out of berth without so much a scratching paint oh will not take pilot who might possibly go back to havana set people wondering what mischief be object in slipping in behind esquivel del norte cay chapter fourteen rescue with due observance of courtesy of sea graceful white hulled thetis dipped farewell salute to spanish warship in havana harbour a next morning swept past outward bound shortly after nine o'clock in morning of glorious april day jack be on navigating bridge with milsom a beautiful little ship looking a spick span a though just fresh from stock with brasswork gleaming flashing like burnished gold in brilliant morning sunlight brought lighthouse abeam gaily plunged keen shapely bow into heart of first blue wind whipped foam crested surge met in joyous greeting playfully flung shower of diamond tinted spray over starboard cathead young man sighed sigh of relief flung from shoulder heavy load of care anxiety have of late be wearing down great deal more than knew even suspected for now at last expedition meant so much to have actually begun very soon must know best worst be to be known perhaps after worst might prove to be not nearly so bad a have be led to believe alvaros be convinced be not only blatant braggart also unmitigated liar might be that foul deed of have boasted have never happened that boast be merely lie milsom regarding companion with sympathetic eye noted how jack straightened up flung back shoulder like fighter preparing for fray how eye brightened cheek flushed a strong salt breeze met nostril swept into lung exhilarating a draught of wine chuckled for knew now that worst be over that collapse have be half dreading must not now come a for be a happy a man can be who be unable to forget that calamity have befallen certain of friend be keen light hearted sailor intensely fond of profession be now fairly started upon expedition very strongly appealed to professional instinct felt like hunter exhilarating excitement of stalking running down prey tended to very largely obliterate memory of everything else be throwing heart soul into mad undertaking of jack for deliverance of friend saw difficulty recognised extreme danger of adventure with keen zest laid out to conquer one evade other even now when yacht have barely cleared harbour mouth adopted first ruse for mystification of foe for understood that be quite possible that curious eye might follow course of vessel possibly suspect something if be seen that be going same road that convict steamer must be following few day later therefore instructed helmsman to make very wide gradual sweep to eastward hauling up almost imperceptibly at rate of point quarter of hour thus rendering absolutely impossible for observer to guess whether thetis be going out through florida strait down nicholas old bahama channel also for first hour allowed to travel at sober pace of fourteen knot after spoke down voice tube to macintyre in engine room next instant little craft be shearing through long foam flecked surge like chasing dolphin a scotchman gave steam that engine must take be about seven bell in afternoon watch when yacht running in toward land on south easterly course head of mast from light on hicacal cay be shown appeared dead ahead milsom at once gave order for engine to be slowed down to fourteen knot then turning to jack said now young man will want assistance for be going to personally undertake job of piloting little hooker into hiding place chart still lie spread out on chart house table where left last night with before ought to be able to con ship into boca without slightest difficulty once be there will take charge again give direction from fore masthead whither be about to go will want to stand by engine room telegraph transmit order to engine room smartly have better keep that mast yonder fair square over bowsprit end until boca open out clearly then can ease helm over to port head straight in now be off therewith milsom left bridge ran down on to fore deck from be presently hoisted to fore masthead in boatswain chair bent on to whip rove through sheave hole at masthead by time that be up there low mangrove clothed cay be visible from bridge then jack gave order for helm to be ported quarter of hour later yacht shot into smooth water between bushy hicacal cay milsom took in hand conning of craft following trend of channel by eye from lofty lookout with couple of leadsmen in forechains to further help there be difficulty for once inside cay water be smooth clear milsom be able to follow unerringly line of deepest water a have anticipated unwonted spectacle of so trim handsome little vessel a thetis attracted interested attention not only of lightkeepers also of fisherman inhabiting little cluster of hut near cottage of former must not be helped after probably concluded that yacht be bound to sagua la grande must think more about quarter of hour later have slipped round projecting point out of sight be safely riding at anchor in hiding place a milsom have foreseen reached destination with hour of daylight in hand moment that anchor be down hand went to work routed out from secret recess of ship heterogeneous assortment of light iron rod bar angle sheet wood framing planking great roll of canvas painted light smoky grey tint milsom asserted must render vessel practically invisible at distance of three mile precise composition of have cost week of anxious thought study then crew be divided into three gang while one party busied under macintyre in sorting out bolting together fixing in position portion be to effect transformation in appearance of yacht bow party under milsom be similarly employed in altering appearance of vessel handsome stern third party under perkins be clothing brightly varnished mast in tight fitting canvas coat painted in pervading grey be to be colour of vessel when work of disguising must be complete fixing bogus fighting top on ship foremast enclosing chart house in casing must give semblance of conning tower getting couple of light signalling yard aloft painting several boat grey when men knocked off work at sunset great deal have be done be not until six bell in forenoon watch next day that work of transformation be finally completed to milsom satisfaction then thetis temporarily re christened libertad so strongly resembled modern two funnelled torpedo gunboat that might easily have deceived even professional eye at distance of mile when further long pennant flaunted from main truck flag of cuba libre waved from ensign staff gallant skipper critically surveying transmogrified ship from dinghy confidently announced that must defy anybody to trace most remote resemblance between vessel upon eye rested trim english yacht have steamed out of havana harbour on previous day on following monday morning at daylight furnace fire be lighted on board disguised yacht at same time man with sharp eye be sent aloft to fore masthead to watch offing over top of low mangrove tree give notice of passage of maranon must happen to heave in sight hour after hour passed with sign of unless one of eastward going trail of smoke showed on horizon during forenoon happened to emanate from waited patiently until noon then nothing having be seen of convict ship jack milsom agreed that be quite useless to wait longer hour later fisherman outside boca de maravilla be astonished to see craft of described a cruiser while others spoke of a gunboat sweep through passage head away north east a though to clear eastern extremity of cay sal bank on way northward through santaren channel vessel showed colour be flying pennant general opinion be that be american man o ' war though what have be doing in sagua la grande harbour how have got there nobody seemed able to guess although to unsophisticated fisherman of sagua la grande mysterious warship appeared to be bound north be really bound south through nicholas old bahama channel when yacht have made offing of fifteen mile by time be of course out of sight of fisherman boat milsom ordered helm to be ported engine sent full speed ahead having by time run on to line ex navy man have pencilled on chart a probable course of convict steamer if craft have left havana at hour arranged be steaming at rate harbour master have anticipated must be pace must now be nearly sixty mile ahead be fairly long lead certainly there be big difference between speed of eight knot of twenty four milsom calculated that if maranon be really ahead of ought to overtake in something like three hour a matter of fact sighted craft dead ahead about five bell in afternoon watch identified to entire satisfaction about hour later passed sixteen mile to southward about one bell in first dog now said milsom when came down from aloft after personally satisfying a to identity of great dirty white rust streaked hull crawling along in northern board let make little calculation plan be to appear ahead of steaming to northward westward to meet in fact instead of overtaking proper time to do will be about quarter of hour before sunset take that be steaming at about pace friend harbour master allowed be to say about eight knot at rate will be about eight mile farther to eastward at quarter of hour before sunset mean that um um yes will be about right now jack hearty cheer up for unless something go very radically wrong with scheme friend ought to be safe snug aboard dandy little hooker in couple of hour time now be friend who be going to play giddy pirate wrest friend at sword point out of hand of oppressor so cut away down below lad get into disguise while be doing that deck hand can be doing same so a to render impossible for to be identified at future time must be met in street of havana elsewhere by anybody belonging to maranon hour later jack re appeared on deck already well bronzed face hand stained to darkness of mulatto skin corpus arrayed in old weather stained very much worse for wear spanish naval lieutenant uniform don ramon have caused one of servant to procure for at second hand wardrobe dealer in havana disguise being completed by addition of black wig ferocious moustache whisker obtained through same channel at theatrical wig maker shop to say that own mother must not have known in get up be to put matter altogether inadequately appearance on deck be signal for roar of mingled admiration mirth from hand meanwhile crew have pinned faith to burnt cork working slop a disguise except five who be to form jack boat crew having discarded working slop donned dungaree overall ancient cloth trouser rusty with salt water stain stiff with tar grease big thigh boot worsted cap cutlas belted to waist knife brace of revolver in belt gave finishing touch of realism to get up obviated possibility of doubt a to seriousness of mission by time moment have arrived when according to milsom calculation yacht ought to be turned round to meet maranon now out of sight astern helm be accordingly put hard over nimble little craft swept round until be heading direct for spot where have be calculated that two ship must meet combination of circumstance must possibly have be more favourable for adventure than be at moment prevailing there be craft of description in sight a far a eye must see trade wind be blowing quite moderate breeze sea be not sufficiently formidable to render task of transferring rescued people from one ship to other by mean of open boat at difficult dangerous moreover sun fast dropping toward horizon be quickly losing intensity of light a rapidly plunging object into delicious soft golden haze in detail be lost be therefore in highest degree unlikely that even keenest eye on board convict steamer must be able to detect imposition be being practised upon presently smudge of brown smoke soaring above horizon broad on port bow showed that unsuspecting quarry be approaching minute two later mast fine a spider web began to rise against warm golden glow of western sky then funnel appeared finally bridge chart house appearing a completely detached isolated object in rarefied atmosphere suddenly showed on horizon alternately appearing disappearing with rise fall of ship over swell then milsom rang down to engine room for half speed little later when maranon be hull up two vessel be closing fast ordered forward port twelve pound quick firer to be loaded with blank charge then when two craft be about mile apart ordered cuban flag to be run up to main gaff end gun to be fired a polite invitation to other craft to heave to at same time stopping own engine apparently skipper of maranon did not know what to make of for beyond hoisting spanish colour took notice of summons making attempt to stop engine mr perkins shouted milsom just heave shot across chap fore foot will ye will see whether understands that language for goodness ' sake take care that hit by mistake want to have destruction of vessel on conscience bang barked twelve pounder for second time there be now vicious tone in bark said unmistakably that gun be shotted while if anybody on board maranon have doubt about that doubt be moment later dispelled by sudden up leaping of fountain of foam twenty fathom ahead of vessel proved conclusively that mysterious gunboat flying cuban flag be in humour to be trifled with spanish captain objurgating vehemently rang down for engine to stop thereupon gunboat by time have swung round presenting view of stern with name libertad emblazoned upon in gold letter lowered boat into four seaman coxswain big black bearded officer dropped when frail craft propelled by four sturdy oarsman pushed off went dancing light a empty eggshell over purple swell toward convict ship officer on bridge of did not fail to note that crew of stranger have carefully trained two long beautifully polished gun couple of maxim on a gentle hint that there be to be nonsense a milsom put meanwhile crew of maranon seeing boat approaching busied with task of lowering side ladder got into position just a boat dashed alongside crew tossed oar although swell be by mean high convict ship rolled heavily upon a soon a lost way jack have to watch opportunity to spring out of boat on to ladder without accident managed cleverly next moment stood upon deck of maranon where found captain of ship chief officer awaiting a stepped in through gangway courteously lifted cap in salute other man be far too angry to acknowledge return salute instead made step forward with corrugated brow clenched fist exclaimed senor demand to know reason of outrage who be why have dared to stop ship upon high sea by way of reply to man menacing demeanour jack allowed left hand to drop on to butt of one of pair of revolver carried in belt instead of answering very reasonable question have be put to said captain greatly regret to trouble must ask to have goodness to muster prisoner on deck please do at once for light will soon be gone be anxious to complete business with before darkness fall muster prisoner on deck stormed captain for what reason senor again ask who be by what authority jack raised hand deprecatingly good sir exclaimed why waste time in asking foolish useless question when have already intimated to that be in hurry will have very great goodness may add wisdom to comply with request will compel to shoot in hope that gentleman who presume be chief officer will be more reasonable obliging than hint have desired effect skipper turned away giving certain instruction to companion made way up on to bridge again while other went below ten minute later prisoner under charge of strong guard of soldier began to make way up on deck presently officer who have gone below to carry out skipper instruction re appeared with information that prisoner be now paraded forward ready for inspection presumed senor wished to make of whereupon jack calling coxswain up out of boat alongside for purpose of keeping eye upon thing generally seeing that trickery be attempted went forward to fore deck where about three hundred men woman child be drawn up in four line rank two on side of deck chief officer mate accompanied first face recognised be that of friend chum carlos oh how shockingly changed poor fellow be thin a skeleton ghastly pale under almost vanished tan of sun dirty dishevelled in rag be not most shocking change jack noticed in be look of mingled fear hate horror gleamed in young man eye kind of look that tell of systematic long continued cruelty take aft said jack to officer who be attending laying hand lightly on carlos ' shoulder a spoke noted with horror how a lifted hand poor youth shrank cowered a though expected to be struck then presently came to senora montijo who poor soul looked into jack face vacantly laughed a directed too to be taken aft be clear that be quite mad jack ground teeth a inwardly vowed fresh vow of vengeance against infamous ruffian who be author of such unspeakable misery ruin little farther on found don hermoso whose condition seemed even worse than of son senorita isolda must not find although searched remainder of prisoner twice over then walked aft to where don hermoso wife son be standing listlessly together exchanging occasional word two with other apparently too utterly wretched to take notice of anything to engage in continuous conversation jack addressed to carlos in english carlos old chap said start look surprised appear to recognise know old fellow be jack jack singleton be yacht over yonder disguised a gunboat have come to take away out of wretched ship restore to home can not find sister be not with apparently simple question have most extraordinary effect upon don hermoso carlos former suddenly dropping face in hand began to sob moan hysterically while carlos a suddenly dropped on knee on deck lifting clenched hand skyward began to call down bitter curse upon head of alvaros jack shuddered a listened again ground teeth in impotent fury for soon gathered from friend wild word that cruelty of spaniard have boasted have indeed be true must gather information a to whereabouts of senorita isolda from now frenzied raving of brother be only with utmost difficulty that at length drew from don hermoso dreadful tidings that daughter who have be brought on board ship raving maniac have very morning contrived to elude guard rushing on deck have thrown overboard never be seen again poor jack be so utterly overwhelmed at awful confirmation of worst foreboding that several minute elapsed ere must speak even then must find word wherewith to soothe despair of friend presently managed to tell again that be there to restore to liberty that there be plenty of friend who must stand by upon return to home then asked whether knew of more prisoner on board who like be victim of spanish injustice tyranny suggesting that if so poor wretch must also be restored to freedom whereupon don hermoso mentioned that believed there be two three more political prisoner on board at jack request accompanied forward pointed out also jack ordered aft when came abreast of gangway directed down into boat whither don hermoso bereaved family followed jack going last informing skipper of maranon ere left that might now proceed on voyage individual forthwith did while a soon a released prisoner be on board yacht boat hoisted to davit craft continued course to westward until convict steamer be out of sight when bow of thetis be again turned eastward speed reduced to dead slow for now have to be stripped of disguise restored to normal appearance again convenient spot for performance of operation have to be found milsom not deeming wise to return effect in spot from have so recently come spot be eventually found in shape of tiny cove near point lucrecia into steamed at daylight next morning leaving again same evening hour before sunset when thetis again showed a trim white hulled english yacht with boat bright varnished a of yore yacht boat bearing slightest trace of ever having be even remotely connected with mysterious gunboat have be seen by fisherman to steam out of sagua la grande harbour when at length by exercise of illimitable patience jack succeeded in persuading friend to believe that trouble be over have induced to settle down in peace comfort aboard yacht also to ease aching heart by telling what have undergone since day when so blithely parted from at railway station at havana be really heartrending story of cruel oppression shameful irresponsible tyranny to felt obliged to listen there be need to give full detail here be sufficient to simply state that upon arrival at bejucal first station beyond santiago be accosted by sergeant who ordered to leave train who with assistance of couple of file of soldier conveyed back to havana by good train late same night marching off to la jacoba prison about three o'clock next morning where of be confined in separate cell later in day be to say about eleven o'clock in morning don hermoso be visited by file of soldier who informed that governor demanded presence roughly commanded to follow having obeyed command don presently found in kind of office confronted with alvaros who ordered two guard to leave alone with prisoner then having be done alvaros informed don hermoso that in consequence of certain information supplied to government house have be searched during absence sufficient treasonable correspondence found therein to send entire family to penal settlement for life next reminded don hermoso that have on certain occasion paid family compliment of proposing for hand of dona isolda that don have seen fit to reject proposal with scorn contumely yet such said be generous forgiving nature that be quite willing not only to overlook affront also to secure pardon of don hermoso family for treason to spanish government if said don hermoso must now withdraw refusal give consent to daughter marriage with don sebastian alvaros scion of one of most noble family in old spain don hermoso reply to suggestion be repetition of categorical uncompromising refusal whereupon alvaros fell into paroxysm of rage swore that must either compel don hermoso to give consent certain very dreadful thing must happen to member of family dona isolda included certain very dreadful thing have happened among flogging starvation might be mentioned whole culminating in condemnation to transportation for life to horror of penal settlement of fernando po when don hermoso persisted in refusal declared that must rather see daughter dead than wedded to such scoundrel a don sebastian alvaros be bare outline of story a told by don hermoso there be detail of word said deed done caused jack singleton to see red to wonder how be that man made in god image must ever become degraded to condition so much lower than of beast perish how be that such fiend in human form be permitted to live to work wicked will upon others however comforted by saying such atrocity a senor alvaros have committed go unpunished time will come when will wish that have shot rather than yield to suggestion of own evil heart how truly prophesied how awful be retribution be to fall upon don sebastian alvaros jack little knew otherwise be possible that even righteous anger might have be mitigated craving for vengeance drowned in fountain of pity chapter fifteen retribution be trifle over thirty six hour from moment of deliverance of don hermoso wife son when thetis brilliant in bravery of white enamel paint gilt figurehead ornamental scroll work freshly varnished boat scintillating brasswork steamed into guantanamo harbour let go anchor off little town village for be scarcely more of caimamera visit of yacht to out of way spot be ostensibly for purpose of enabling that erratic irresponsible young englishman owner to enjoy day two fishing guantanamo harbour being noted for variety of fish with water teem excellent sport afford jack first act be to go ashore pay early visit to telegraph office from dispatched cipher wire to don ramon bergera briefly acquainting that gentleman with bare fact of rescue dona isolda death then allowed crew to take couple of boat go fishing while devoted to arduous task of comforting consoling friend a best must indeed have be chief occupation from moment when montijos have first come on board yacht from convict ship be effort altogether unavailing although be exceedingly difficult to find word of comfort for whose heart be still bleeding from tragic loss of being who be dearest to with senora montijo jack be much more successful than with husband son for poor soul reason be entirely gone to extent indeed that seemed to have completely forgotten circumstance connected with recent misfortune appearing to merely remember jack a someone with whom certain pleasant memory vaguely recalled be connected in whose society therefore took pleasure very rarely spoke never rationally be content to walk fore aft deck by hour with hand on jack supporting arm eye gazing dreamily at deck plank took even more pleasure in jack society than did in of husband son of whom be at time gloomy saturnine silent brooder upon revenge on second day after arrival in guantanamo harbour there came letter from don ramon briefly congratulating jack upon success montijos upon deliverance requesting to remain where be for present a have be unable to gather definite news be busily conducting number of enquiry then after lapse of full week there came letter from same source informing that writer have received communication from senor calderon don hermoso manager stating that senor alvaros now promoted to rank of major have appeared at hacienda with intelligence that don hermoso family having be found guilty of crime of conspiracy against spanish government have be shipped off to fernando po for life estate having be sequestrated have be given to a reward for meritorious service furthermore that senor calderon having have long experience in management of estate major alvaros be disposed to allow to retain post of manager at least for present upon condition that be found to serve new master faithfully that finally senor calderon be henceforward to account to major alvaros for income expenditure connected with estate don ramon then went on to state upon receipt of communication have taken upon to pay flying visit to senor calderon upon occasion don ramon have informed senor of escape of don hermoso from convict ship have instructed to hold property at hazard until don hermoso return letter wound up by strongly urging don hermoso to return to property forthwith hold against comer arming peon dependent if necessary although writer be of opinion that government generally alvaros in particular must soon be much too busy to find time to dispute don hermoso right to possession of property thereupon council of war be held on yacht quarter deck member consisting of don hermoso carlos jack milsom at be ultimately decided that thetis must weigh anchor forthwith run over to calonna there to land don senora carlos jack who must then proceed to hacienda with speed while yacht under milsom command be to proceed to laguna de cortes there remain concealed until must be seen in what way must best be employed after milsom be to return by boat to calonna from thence make way to hacienda in order that might be on spot to receive such verbal instruction a might be necessary arrangement be duly carried out evening of following day witnessed return of little party to home have so joyously left month before little dreaming of sad circumstance under must next gaze upon familiar surroundings be welcomed back by employes of estate with sign of utmost satisfaction tempered with deep sincere sorrow at tragic fate of young beautiful daughter of house who have contrived during short life to render idolised by individual in father service from senor calderon downward in presence of master mistress negro with innate sense of delicacy governs conduct toward whom love be careful that sign of grief at loss of beloved young mistress must be confined to few respectful expression of sympathy when mama faquita senorita isolda old nurse having extracted from carlos tolerably full detailed account of circumstance have culminated in beloved young mistress death went round of negro hut that night kindled in breast of fellow flame of fury vengeful longing be destined to consume senor alvaros be not to be wondered at after what don hermoso have suffered personally through family from spanish misrule interest in management of vast estate must occupy only secondary position in mind that must relegate management almost entirely to capable hand conscientious mind of senor calderon giving first most important place to advancement by mean in power of aim of revolutionary with object therefore shut up in own private room for three week following return home plunged strenuously into voluminous correspondence with marti jesus rabi antonio maceo maximo gomez other more le prominent insurgent leader making exhaustive enquiry into condition prospect of party offering advice assistance in several project while jack carlos made long excursion in various direction for purpose of personally ascertaining feeling of inhabitant adding fuel to smouldering flame of insurrection by mean in power for may be said at once that shocking tyranny cruel injustice callous indifference on part of island authority have rendered possible such disaster a have befallen friend have kindled in jack singleton breast such fiery indignation loathing abhorrence quixotic a resolve may seem to have at once determined to throw in lot with of montijos assist by mean in power to free cuba from spanish misrule in fashion nearly two month went by during by don hermoso instruction armament of thetis have be dismounted remounted upon field carriage constructed by carpenter engineer of vessel landed with ammunition at various point on coast delivered over to armed band of revolutionary who be by time springing up like mushroom over island yacht under milsom command have be dispatched to new york for further supply during whole of time thanks to fact that secret have be kept from everybody sympathiser whose discretion might be relied on rescue return of montijo family remained unsuspected by spanish authority then one morning message reached senor calderon from major alvaros to effect that latter must arrive at hacienda night on business visit that necessary preparation be to be made for reception message calderon at once handed to don hermoso with request for instruction a to how matter must be dealt with whereupon jack carlos who happened to be at hand day at once undertook duty of receiving spaniard suitably be nearly five o'clock in evening when alvaros hot tired dusty from long ride from pinar del rio previous journey by train drew rein dismounted before broad flight of step leading up to gallery ran round house handing over horse to obsequious negro who be in waiting proceeded to ascend step brow wrinkled into frown of displeasure at calderon failure to be present to give suitably respectful greeting upon arrival reached top of step paused for moment to glance around at wide prospect visible from commanding elevation of gallery then strode forward to enter house wide folding door of stood a usual invitingly open a did so ere foot reached threshold be confronted by carlos who emerging suddenly from obscurity of entrance hall levelled revolver straight at spaniard right eye so that before individual must recover from astonishment found gazing into grooved barrel hand up villain murderer exclaimed young cuban glaring savagely along sight of levelled weapon into senor alvaros eye hand up will blow worthless brain out with a little compunction a with must crush venomous snake beneath heel quick hesitate fire alvaros did not hesitate there be that in expression of carlos eye in yearning curl of finger round trigger told spaniard that least sign of hesitation must be fatal with fear of death upon instantly halted flung up hand have only known to what be prelude must probably have kept down marched on to death then from behind carlos jack appeared with whistle in hand raised to lip upon blew shrill blast at sound number of negro appeared one of bearing long coil of raw hide rope with noose at one end of in hand rope jack took from hand of negro dropping noose over alvaros head drew fairly tight then handed rest of rope back to black senor exclaimed quaking spaniard with quivering lip be about to murder not just yet answered jack cheerfully what may eventually do will not pretend to say because see such vermin a be not fit to live at present be only going to give second instalment gave first will remember pointing to officer still stiff elbow of punishment due to for infamous treatment of don hermoso family fellow be by time white a corpse lip be tremulous with terror yet strove to carry thing off with high hand presume senor said that be due to instrumentality that young ruffian be here at moment instead of on way to fernando po a be here take for granted that remaining member of family be not far off rest assured that terrible retribution awaits not only for outrage upon also for rescue of prisoner sentenced by spanish government to transportation yes said jack doubt be quite willing to take word for altering tone from one of banter to of concentrated anger let tell senor alvaros senorita isolda montijo be dead owing to cruelty for other crime retribution be about to fall on be first part of saying unbuckled alvaros ' sword drew weapon from sheath snapped blade across knee there exclaimed flinging piece from will never again disgrace that weapon by wearing lead away pedro if attempt nonsense just choke with lariat way senor exclaimed pedro roughly jerking lariat in direction of step a hint to prisoner that be to descend in ignominious fashion once arrogant now cowering cringing spaniard be led away under jack supervision while carlos selecting heavy riding whip from rack followed procession prisoner be conducted to negro quarter be situated about mile from house with belt of timber between there be stripped to trouser firmly lashed to post have be hastily erected for purpose then whole of negro employed upon plantation having be assembled carlos related to black several suffering indignity alvaros have caused to be inflicted upon member of montijo family how to be due death of senorita sister whom have loved so well when have finished story flogged alvaros until miserable wretch screamed howled for mercy offering most abject excuse apology for conduct vowing by saint that if carlos must release must leave cuba never to return that must surrender montijo estate to rightful owner that must never breathe to single living soul syllable a to what have passed that must also do number of other unlikely not to say impossible thing then when arm be tired must flog no longer carlos desisted ordered alvaros to be cast loose from stake securely confined in empty tobacco shed with negro on guard at door of building to see that did not escape when at shrinking cringing creature be hustled into prison securely bound carlos turned to said have now received second instalment of punishment for atrocious crime will be kept here until be convenient to remove being fed meanwhile upon bread water when convenient time arrives will be placed on board ship marooned will be final instalment of punishment evil deed have called down upon head best thing can wish be that what have suffered to day will suffer in future will bring home to evil of way lead to sincere repentance for therewith passed from senor alvaros sight to be seen by more same night when white people have retired to rest in great casa mama faquita stole away down to negro quarter going from hut to hut roused occupant summoned to great palaver in open space hut surrounded in child be wont to play scene be weirdly picturesque one for prior to rousing negro mama have kindled great fire in centre of open space in front of in great semicircle negro congregated squatting on heel rolling

have be slave be singular combination of good evil on one hand be capable of affection devotion to extraordinary degree toward who have treated well while on other be equally capable of most ferocious implacable hatred of who have injured love also be extraordinarily impressionable mama faquita being full blooded negress be of course perfectly well aware of peculiarity in nature of audience played upon a skilled musician doe upon sensitively responsive instrument dwelt eloquently at length upon invariable kindness with have one be treated by amo family especially by young senorita whom of at least be able to remember a little toddling baby whom have loved a passionately a though have be own a spoke thus tear of grief streamed down cheek wrung hand in anguish evoking ready sympathetic response from hearer then went on to recall to memory sad homecoming of two month ago dreadful tale that have be told when asked why senorita have not also returned finally reminded a though reminder be by time necessary that author of family woe now lay ay at very moment imprisoned in tobacco shed within stone throw of spot where be then assembled spoke with qualified satisfaction of punishment young master have inflicted upon picaro in presence few hour ago admitted that so far a went be good contended that did not go nearly far enough considering monstrous character of crime of prisoner

negro who thoroughly understood how to devise punishment to properly fit crime be enough there be need for to say word with consummate skill have gradually wrought audience up to pitch of demoniac fury have pictured beloved young mistress in power of wretch who crouched with smarting lacerated back yonder in shed insulted ill treated finally driven to madness death by now at word from one of whole body of negro sprang to foot with low hissing muttering execration threat infinitely more terrifying to listen to than loudest yell of ferocity ran to shed with few low murmured word of explanation to guard demanded surrender of prisoner demand be conceded with scarcely word of protest five minute later miserable alvaros in speechless frenzy of fear be being hurried along lonely bush path known only to negro to spot three mile distant what happened to when arrived there must be left untold suffice to say that major alvaros be never more seen of men mystery of disappearance remains unsolved to day although carlos montijo jack singleton be under delusion that know what became of furthermore inhabitant of hacienda be never troubled by inconvenient enquiry about for afterwards transpired that when set out upon fateful journey have not thought fit to say whither be going how long intended to be absent by time therefore that prolonged absence from duty have provoked enquiry trace of be completely lost male occupant of house be just finishing early breakfast next morning when senor calderon presented before in condition of considerable mental discomposure with intelligence that prisoner have apparently contrived to effect escape for one of negro have just come up to house with report that upon opening door of tobacco shed to give captive breakfast alvaros be found to have disappeared trace of have thus far be discovered be distinctly alarming news for be instantly recognised that if alvaros have really contrived to get clear away must undoubtedly make best of way back to havana there report to authority violence to have be subjected also possibly rescue of montijos from convict ship though mention of latter must probably depend upon whether conviction have be result of representation to capitan general whether a don ramon bergera have surmised have be work of alvaros alone in case consequence be likely to be quite serious to montijos carlos accompanied by jack calderon at once hurried away to investigate circumstance of alleged escape upon arrival at tobacco shed found door of building still locked negro guard still posted before door having be re fastened a calderon explained immediately upon discovery of prisoner disappearance entering shed at once satisfied a to truth of statement that late occupant be longer in for building be absolutely empty being perfectly plain structure with simply four stone wall cement floor unceiled roof there be nook cranny in even rat much le man must conceal moreover rope by have be a be thought securely bound before being left on previous evening be lying upon floor immediately beneath one of large shuttered opening in wall be used for admission of light air into shed a required position of rope naturally led to examination of opening beneath lay be then found that massive bolt securing shutter have be drawn that therefore there be nothing to prevent prisoner from escaping through opening provided that must free from rope reach how have contrived to accomplish two thing be mystery for carlos jack have be present during lashing up of alvaros felt that must have be fully prepared to declare that for prisoner to release must be simple impossibility so securely have be bound while sill of opening be quite nine foot from floor for man to reach without help of ladder similar aid seemed equally impossible there be such aid in building occurred to jack that prisoner after freeing from bond might have succeeded in throwing loop of rope over one of shutter bolt so have drawn up to accomplish feat in absolute darkness again seemed absolute impossibility altogether circumstance seemed to be enveloped in impenetrable mystery there be only one indisputable fact be that prisoner be gone then negro guard be severely questioned seemed quite unable to throw light upon matter statement be that have exercised utmost vigilance through night that have heard sound of movement on part of prisoner have noticed nothing to suggest attempt at escape be utterly confounded when upon unlocking door to take in prisoner breakfast found that bird have flown be story amount of cross examination caused to deviate in slightest degree from for when negro lay out to deceive fact that be lying through thick thin cause qualm of conscience investigation thus conclusively pointed to fact that prisoner have somehow contrived to escape that having be established obviously proper thing to do be to endeavour to recapture horse be therefore ordered to be saddled taken up to house fantee negro who have be re named juan who have reputation of being marvellously expert tracker be ordered to examine ground about tobacco shed for track to hold ready to accompany hunter jack carlos then returned to house to equip in something le than hour party consisting of jack carlos mounted armed with rifle dozen negro including juan set out hunt began at tobacco shed beneath unbolted shutter of juan declared that despite hardness of ground have succeeded in detecting footprint of fugitive thence took course northward strange to say in direction of mountain instead of toward pinar del rio a two young white men have naturally expected be so surprising that a soon a direction became apparent carlos called halt openly expressed conviction that fantee be making mistake juan confidently declared that be doing nothing of sort in support of statement pointed to certain barely perceptible mark here there on ground asserted be track of fugitive assertion being corroborated by other negro to eye of white men mark in question be so very slight vague a to convey absolutely meaning at indeed must not in case convince that there really be mark then ground be so dry hard that even horse left scarcely trace of passage be therefore obliged to take juan word for that be on right track follow where led be of opinion that considering alvaros condition after terrific punishment carlos have inflicted upon only few hour previously circumstance that seemed to have be travelling for several hour in darkness over country must have be absolutely strange to must not have made very rapid progress gone very far after first hour be in momentary expectation of coming upon mile after mile be traversed still juan asserted that fugitive be yet distance ahead that did not appear to be gaining on very rapidly due a negro pointed out to extreme difficulty of tracking over such hard for most part stony ground fact be that juan fellow negro having arranged among course of action during short period while carlos jack be preparing for expedition be enacting very cleverly carried out piece of comedy so cleverly performed indeed that of young men have slightest suspicion that be being deceived at length track have led steadily over rising ground almost from moment of starting conducted party to entrance of very wild romantic picturesque looking gorge seemed to pierce right into very heart of mountain for time going have be growing increasingly difficult especially for two horseman now single glance ahead sufficed to show that must speedily become impossible for mounted men for side of mountain grew increasingly steep a one looked forward until about quarter of mile farther on seemed to be practically perpendicular while pine tree grew so thickly that in place appeared a though there must be scarcely room for man much le horse to pas moreover side of hill be covered with big outcrop of rock interspersed with loose boulder to pas over among must require clear head steady eye sure foot two young men therefore determined to dismount forthwith proceed on foot leaving horse in charge of one of negro be well that did so for path almost immediately grew so steep difficult that before have advanced hundred yard party found necessary to frequently drop on hand knee to pas of more awkward place without being precipitated into stream heard brawling hundred of foot below at bottom of ravine now a slowly with difficulty made way along steep mountain side low murmur gradually growing in strength volume of sound told that be approaching waterfall cataract of sort after half hour of exhausting perilous crawling slipping sliding over loose shaley ground came in sight of a opened out before from behind enormous precipitous crag solid column of water about twenty foot in diameter leaping out of narrow cleft in rock three hundred foot above gradually resolving into mist a plunged down into dark gloomy depth of gorge below to carlos still more to jack seemed impossible that fugitive must have chosen to pursue track be now following for to where did lead place be quite new to carlos have never be there before seemed unlikely in extreme that stranger to neighbourhood a alvaros be must know more about than one who have dwelt only few mile off during practically whole life yet juan be now pressing on long way ahead a though be following on hot scent presently disappeared altogether in thick cluster of fir tree high up side of hill ten minute later emerged on other side of clump went scrambling toward spot where stream of water spouted out of rock then carlos saw suddenly stop look steadily down almost vertical side of mountain then at ground at foot took two lad nearly quarter of hour to reach spot where juan stood now surrounded by other four negro to whom be talking animatedly a approached fantee pointed to scar on hillside looked a though have be quite recently made by passage of heavy body look senor cried be where spaniard have gone loose boulder caught just here swept down into gorge below will never see again carlos jack looked yes mark be precisely such a falling boulder must make be apparently quite fresh possibly le than hour old how did juan know alvaros have gone down hillside with boulder jack asked question because answered black triumphantly came a far a a have seen by footprint went farther there be more footprint to be found see boulder struck ground just here pointing to big raw dint in soil bounded off striking again down there where see that mark must have struck here just a spaniard reached spot hurled down to bottom of gorge before be doubtless down there at bottom of stream at moment pinned down by boulder killed other negro emphatically corroborated statement suggestion to jack carlos theory enunciated by juan appeared quite possible of course have to accept juan word for that fugitive footstep have be followed thus far have utterly disappeared at precise spot where boulder whatever be have struck much granted remainder of story seemed quite plausible seemed indeed only possible explanation since be quite impossible to test truth falsehood without descending to river below be also impossibility be disposed to accept a true thus very materially assisted by fortuitous fall of boulder down hillside did negro on senor montijo estate successfully hoodwink white master effectually for ever put stop to further enquiry a to what have become of major alvaros of spanish majesty light infantry erstwhile governor of la jacoba chapter sixteen war cloud overshadows hacienda montijo for first fortnight three week following evanishment of senor alvaros considerable degree of uneasiness prevailed at hacienda montijo inmate of daily looked for appearance of emissary of spanish government charged with duty of investigating circumstance connected with disappearance of important spanish official be recognised that not only must enquiry of such individual be difficult to reply to also that presence must incidentally result in discovery that member of montijo family instead of being at fernando po be with one exception at home again be admitted to be contingency needed careful yet firm handling after much consideration plan be evolved by jack carlos be believed must deal effectively with difficulty necessary step be taken a day after day passed without bringing upon complication apprehended uneasiness rapidly lessened until at length day arrived when conviction forced upon that attention of spanish government be so fully occupied with other much more important matter that disappearance of senor alvaros seemed likely to be permitted to pas without especial notice thereupon jack undertook to pay visit to don ramon bergera in havana with object of ascertaining a far a possible be attitude of spanish official mind upon subject accordingly set out for pinar del rio one morning after early breakfast arrived in havana same afternoon intending to return to hacienda montijo on following day remained in havana full fortnight during don ramon learned many thing among fact senor be solely responsible for arrest attempted transportation of montijos also for seizure of estate neither of act have be reported to capitan general be officially recorded that doubtless because of important reason when have set out on last journey to visit estate have thus secretly seized have omitted to mention to anyone intention destination probable duration of absence with result eventually when accumulated arrears of work at length attracted attention provoked enquiry nobody must throw least light upon whereabouts conviction have therefore at length be arrived at that man being well known a possessing singularly arrogant overbearing irascible disposition have perished in obscure quite possibly discreditable quarrel post a governor of la jacoba prison have be given to man particular have be gleaned by dint of very patient careful enquiry on part of don ramon so judiciously conducted that not particle of suspicion have anywhere be raised that enquiry at be being made with jack returned to hacienda restored tranquillity to mind of inhabitant for have now be made clear not only that might dismiss apprehension of embarrassing enquiry concerning fate of senor alvaros also that nobody be likely to dispute don hermoso right to retain own property sooner be mind relieved upon point than be filled with apprehension on namely poor senora montijo mental condition seemed to steadily grow worse for first few month of unfortunate lady affliction have be very quiet giving trouble at appearing to suffer chiefly from complete loss of memory now just at moment when jack carlos be completing preparation to take field with rebel force change for worse occurred memory returned to intermittently bringing with recollection of daughter fate then by peculiar mental process nothing must console unhappy mother presence companionship of son jack if lad happened to be absent when paroxysm of revived memory occurred poor lady quickly became plunged into condition of such abysmal despair such maniacal violence that be for time being menace to herself everybody else nobody carlos jack seemed to have power of soothing sometimes combined effort of be needed thus came about many month passed during two youth felt constrained to remain within call to devote to task of alleviating misery of unhappy lady meanwhile rebellion have arisen in first instance in province of santiago be for time confined to eastern end of island at moment of outbreak spain have garrison of seventeen thousand men in cuba be amply sufficient force to have stamped out rising have authority dealt with energetically must not must not see until be too late that serious trouble be impending when at length fact be recognised garrison raised to thirty thousand men rebellion have made such headway that rebel already have force of four thousand men in field with maximo gomez a commander in chief antonio maceo a second in command at time however very few white have actually taken up arm in revolutionary cause for gomez be native of san domingo while maceo be mulatto white in cuba entertained same objection to serving under coloured men be to be found practically world over be more than compensated for by great accession of coloured recruit attracted to insurgent rank by appearance of maceo in position of authority at same time secret committee be formed in town in cuba for purpose of preaching gospel of revolt with result that whole province of santiago greater part of puerto principe quickly became aflame general martinez campos capitan general of island at length began to realise increasing gravity of situation sent to home government report to effect that in consequence of rapid spread of rebellion must be absolutely necessary to occupy province of island in force to vigorously attack insurgent met with in field to do effectively must have still more troop accordingly more troop be dispatched with result by end of year spanish arm in cuba totalled le than one hundred thousand men while rebel strength have increased to ten thousand who however be very badly in need of arm ammunition store consequently milsom in thetis be kept busy at time picking up supply wherever must get then smuggling into island with boldness ingenuity completely baffled effort of spaniard to detect proportion of spanish troop to revolutionary force be at time will be observed a ten to one on paper appears to be enormous be not so in reality for whereas cuban be native to soil inured to climate be moreover familiar with topography of country spanish soldier be mostly young raw recruit poor shot quite new to service in tropic unacclimatised of poor stamen therefore peculiarly liable to fall victim to fever dysentery follow upon exposure to tropical rain moreover be badly fed worse looked after great disparity between strength of two force be consequently much more apparent than real then too spanish officer be mostly of very indifferent quality suffered from same climatic disability a men heat enervated to extent that must not be induced to take least trouble about anything undertake least labour made attempt to improve quality of men shooting be lax in enforcement of discipline save perhaps in exaction of proper measure of respect from subordinate be stranger to island quite ignorant of topography be too indolent to attempt to learn anything of lastly map with have be supplied be even worse than useless for be absolutely misleading thus insurgent experienced difficulty in eluding pursuit of spanish force in luring time after time into carefully prepared trap from escape be only possible at cost of heavy loss insurgent be careful that news of oft repeated success against spanish troop must be published throughout island despite desperate effort of authority to suppress a consequence new recruit be constantly being added to rank insurrectionary movement grew apace at length provisional government be formed with marquez de cisneros at head a president of cuban republic first act of new government be to divide up entire island into different district over district be appointed civilian a prefect be of course only natural that prefecture of pinar del rio district must be offered to don hermoso montijo when be made fully acquainted with view of provisional government declined for considered that view on certain point be so extreme a to render government unpopular to bring absolute ruin upon very important section of community planter to wit one of proposal of new government be to impose certain tax for purpose of raising fund wherewith to carry on revolutionary movement to there must of course be reasonable objection when be further proposed that non payment of tax must be punished by destruction of building crop seizure of live stock of defaulter don hermoso asserted that such action be altogether too drastic savoured too much of tyranny to meet with approval firmly declined to associate in way with electing to continue instead to serve movement a heretofore by lavish contribution of money assistance of yacht next step of insurgent leader be also one of don hermoso very strongly disapproved against passionately pleaded in vain with result that certain feeling of estrangement not very far removed from enmity arose between leading spirit of revolution latter appeared have conceived idea so long a industry be permitted to flourish in island so long must spain be able to find necessary fund for maintenance of large army in cuba that moment industry ceased fountain of revenue must run dry troop must be withdrawn therefore determined to march force right through island to havana destroying everything before terrible resolution carried into effect with result that track became long line of burnt cane field fire blackened building owner of whether spaniard cuban foe sympathiser be of course absolutely ruined capitan general with ten thousand men vainly strove to check terrible advance insurgent easily eluded forced way into western province with result that home government superseded campos sending out in stead general don valeriano y nicolan weyler man of wide military experience possessing sinister unenviable reputation for energy relentless severity dispatch of such man a general weyler to cuba be undoubtedly due in very great measure to fact that united state of america keeping watchful eye upon struggle going on a be at very door manifested rapidly increasing disposition to sympathise with insurgent fighting gallantly for liberty against almost overwhelming force exhibition of sympathy american took especial pain to conceal be highly offensive to spain unquestionably went far toward strengthening determination to suppress revolution by force of arm wherefore not only dispatched general weyler to cuba also sent with after troop sufficient to raise spanish army in island to number of two hundred thirty five thousand men including guerrilla volunteer meanwhile antonio maceo with force of nearly four thousand men have penetrated so far west a province of new filipipa where established in stronghold among fastness of sierra de los organos organ mountain from swept down at frequent interval first upon one town in neighbourhood then upon harassing cutting up spanish garrison in generally making of thorn in flesh of weyler spot in have established be distant only ten mile a crow fly from hacienda montijo have sooner made comfortable in new quarter than surprised slightly discomposed inhabitant of casa by paying flying visit have be one of most determined advocate most ruthless executant of republican government policy of destructive suppression of island industry don hermoso firm opposition to policy have created something very nearly approaching to bad blood between two now when be too late probably recognised disastrous mistake have be made for soon became apparent that chief if not sole object of visit be to endeavour to regain don hermoso good opinion attempt be not wholly successful did not repeat visit presence of maceo four thousand very imperfectly disciplined guerrilla troop most of whom be coloured men not too careful in discrimination between friend foe be double menace of very serious character to don hermoso for on one hand be certain sooner later to attract large body of spaniard to neighbourhood for purpose of hunting down while on other must patriot find hard pressed be quite on card that might take into head to sweep down upon estate destroy utterly in order to prevent possibility of spaniard seizing operating therefrom against two possibility be anxiously discussed over dinner table of casa montijo be finally decided that on following day step must be taken to put estate into condition of defence against party now there be three only three possible way of approach to estate first being by main road from pinar del rio second by cross country route jack carlos have followed when riding into pinar del rio on occasion of intervention in james b potter incident third by route alvaros be supposed to have taken on occasion of flight being road from mountain by maceo have travelled last be exceedingly difficult route so difficult indeed that there be several spot at must be made absolutely impassable with very little difficulty most suitable of perhaps being at waterfall near alvaros be supposed to have met death at spot road rather path crossed ravine by way of enormous overhanging rock jutted out from hillside immediately over place where stream flung down into gorge beneath even so needed man with steady head good nerve to traverse for be necessary to get from overhanging rock across chasm of nearly twelve foot in width to large rock on opposite side careful examination of spot convinced jack that few pound of blasting powder judiciously placed beneath overhanging mass of rock must send hurtling down into gorge beneath thus effectually bar passage in direction be immediately done carriage road from pinar del rio must be almost a easily defended for at few yard from main road private road giving access to don hermoso estate be carried across wide stream by mean of single arched masonry bridge bridge must be readily destroyed by mean of dynamite jack soon made arrangement for destruction if necessary at moment notice a for cross country road too led across stream much too deep swift to be forded only passable at point where jack carlos guide carnero have jumped horse across country on far side be open for more than mile affording not sufficient cover to shelter rabbit much le man jack be of opinion that maxim mounted in small earthwork might be thrown up by few men in le than hour must prove amply sufficient to defend passage against force must be likely to be sent against three day therefore after maceo visit to hacienda saw preparation for defence complete save in important matter of maxim ammunition two of together with number of rifle came to hand three week later jack having undertaken to proceed to laguna de cortes there await arrival of thetis with cargo of contraband of war be to land at spot stuff have be purchased with don hermoso money jack therefore felt justified in appropriating a much of a considered might be required also commandeered one of dozen very handsome twelve pounder field gun together with considerable quantity of ammunition when got back with spoil took upon duty of musketry instructor to negro on estate who be knocked off work hour earlier evening for purpose by dint of exercise of almost inexhaustible patience contrived to make very excellent marksman of good percentage of meanwhile with exception above referred to event so far a on estate be concerned pursued even tenor of way nothing in least out of common happened senora montijo mental condition have by time so far improved that society of carlos jack be no longer necessary to welfare remained on estate for war have now come almost to own door service be a likely to be useful where be a anywhere else news came to at irregular interval there by by reached intelligence that in order to isolate maceo prevent return to eastern province of island general weyler be constructing trocha entrenchment with blockhouse wire entanglement complete from mariel on north coast to majana on south be to say across narrowest part of island sixteen seventeen mile in length next news to hand be that trocha be completed manned by twenty thousand men next be that weyler be marching ten thousand troop through province with object of finding destroying maceo men other rebel actual suspected whom might chance to find jack carlos felt that time have arrived for to hold on qui vive be not kept very long in suspense few day later a be about to sit down to dinner negro peon presented with report that large body of spanish troop having marched down road from pinar del rio be at moment pitching camp on plain two mile away just a party have finished meal be on point of rising from table beat of horse hoof approaching house be heard with little later jingle of accoutrement presently footstep accompanied by clink of spur clanking of scabbard be heard ascending step leading to veranda next moment major domo flung open door with announcement of capitan carera ushered in fine soldierly looking man attired in silver braided crimson jacket shako light blue riding breech tucked into knee boot adorned with large brass spur newcomer bowed with easy courtesy a entered then paused apparently taken somewhat aback a eye fell on senora quickly recovered however addressing to don hermoso asked if might have honour of few minute private speech with owner of estate to don hermoso replied by conducting visitor to room in be wont to transact business interview be very brief when be ended soldier bowed out descending step took horse from orderly who have accompanied then mounting went clattering away down private road leading through tobacco field to highway thence to distant camp well what be news pater demanded carlos a don hermoso presently returned to dining room looking very pale agitated news son be answered don hermoso voice quivering with anger general echague who be in command of troop have just encamped in neighbourhood have sent message to regretfully intimating that will be duty to destroy house together with warehouse outbuilding of description to prevent seizure by rebel who be known to be in neighbourhood a act of grace give until noon to morrow to remove household belonging to such place of safety a may select oh doe doe retorted carlos awfully kind of be sure what answer did return to message simply replied that thanked general echague for time given must do utmost to complete preparation by hour named answered don hermoso be right commented carlos grimly think can complete preparation by noon to morrow what say jack say answered jack that can not only complete preparation in time given have plenty of time for play afterwards a matter of fact preparation be practically complete already have nothing to do except blow up bridge that will do a soon a don hermoso senora be far enough on way to pinar to be safe from pursuit then will teach arrogant spaniard much needed lesson on desirability of modifying tyrannical method what do mean jack demanded don hermoso do imagine for moment will seek safety in flight leave two lad to defend property for senor mean at answered jack what mean be natural situation of place be happily such that with preparation already made for defence perhaps one two more can easily make to morrow morning can without difficulty hold estate against much stronger force than encamped on plain below therefore there be not slightest reason why must not remove senora from turmoil excitement of fight be sure to come to morrow see said don hermoso be same thing however stated in different word turmoil excitement of fight a put will scarcely be perceptible here in house will therefore not be likely to have injurious effect upon wife who must be induced to remain indoors while be arguing point with spaniard will therefore remain take share of risk with from resolution don hermoso be not to be moved chapter seventeen wiped out with first sign of dawn on following morning montijo estate became scene of bustling activity for a jack observed since fight must might a well begin early get over during hour of daylight jack carlos who have with tacit consent of don hermoso jointly assumed responsibility of defending place have on previous night held short council of war have finally come to conclusion that of two vulnerable point of attack still remained that have by common consent come to speak of a cross country route be weaker since at one point river be so narrow that must be jumped by horseman consequently be capable of being temporarily bridged without much difficulty defence of position therefore carlos insisted on personally undertaking with assistance of force consisting of two third of negro employed upon estate while jack with other third be to defend approach by way of main road mined bridge be also arranged that jack be to have twelve pounder field gun while carlos took two maxim now happened that while two youth be making final disposition occurred to don hermoso that attack upon estate must afford antonio maceo four thousand guerrilla up there in mountain splendid opportunity to come down take spaniard in rear therefore retired to own room wrote long letter to maceo in fully set forth particular of situation dispatched by hand of trusty negro by way of ravine gorge where alvaros be supposed to have died negro asserting ability to cross gorge at waterfall by mean of pine tree must cut down in such manner a to cause to fall across gap must afterwards throw into abyss returning to estate after execution of mission with maceo men reveille be just sounding in spanish camp when jack having placed force in position in open order behind screen of bamboo scrub completely commanded approach to mined bridge also effectually masked position of twelve pounder proceeded down road alone for purpose of destroying bridge ten minute later deep boom accompanied by volcanic upheaval of dust debris announced successful accomplishment of task at same time that startled spanish soldiery aroused curiosity suspicion of spanish general who at once dispatched small reconnoitring party to investigate nature of explosion jack who have waited to examine result of engineering experiment have seen with much satisfaction while crown of arch be completely destroyed rendering bridge absolutely impassable must be simple matter to repair damage later on observed approach of party at once determined to await deeming excellent opportunity to establish clear understanding with spaniard bring matter at once to issue accordingly stood there on own side of wrecked bridge in clear view of approaching reconnoitring party patiently awaited arrival presently officer in charge of party catching sight of galloped forward alone reining up on opposite side of gap in bridge indignantly demanded hola senor what be meaning of who be responsible for deed be responsible for answered jack mean that senor montijo be not disposed to tamely submit to destruction of property may therefore return to general echague inform that have placed estate in condition of defence that be prepared to resist attack to last gasp that if be ill advised enough to persist in attempt at destruction only will be responsible for bloodshed must ensue be well senor answered officer will tell general what say in turn may inform senor montijo that if persists in mad resolve to resist blood that of soul who take part with will be on own head for general echague be in mood to deal leniently with rebel when turn back upon few hour hence estate will be blackened fire scorched waste man woman child upon will have be put to sword wheeling horse with swaggering show of contemptuous indifference to possible danger rode slowly away jack watched party until have returned to camp officer in command have made report then seeing that spanish troop be to be allowed to get breakfast before being led to attack dispatched calderon who have undertaken to perform duty of galloper to carlos with message to effect that immediate attack be to be expected then having posted sentry given own contingent instruction to get breakfast at once where be mounted horse galloped up to house to snatch meal knew must by time be ready for be hurried meal of course be none le welcome on account imparted that feeling of refreshment vigour be so comforting to man who be about to engage in possibly long arduous fight while also afforded opportunity to personally acquaint don hermoso carlos who also presently came in with detail of what have passed between spanish officer then having fortified with food jack returned to post to find negro force busily discussing own breakfast finished nearly hour before there be sign of movement in spanish camp at length however blare of bugle rattle of drum gave intimation that movement of sort be impending presently troop be seen to be mustering under arm consisted a jack soon saw mainly of infantry there be small body of cavalry with about fifty in number also have two light field piece drawn by six mule while infantry be forming up mule be being put to gun general staff suddenly rode out of camp advanced along main road with evident intention of reconnoitring menaced position ascertaining most promising point of attack jack have idea of allowing to gain even so much advantage a that therefore moved among men selecting twenty of best shot rapidly transferred to patch of cover commanded junction of private with main road instructed to open fire upon reconnoitring party moment that must come into view remaining with to encourage give confidence have scarcely got little body of sharpshooter into position when leading file of reconnoitring party appeared in sight at junction of two road evidently bent upon examining wrecked bridge jack waiting only until entire body came into view gave order to fire effect be disastrous to spaniard for negro concealed a be confident of own absolute safety took aim with utmost coolness deliberation with result seven out of dozen saddle be emptied while general officer have horse shot under there be immediate wild stampede of survivor two dismounted men contriving with difficulty to catch mount couple of riderless horse ere have got beyond range two more men three more horse be bowled over by main body of jack negro who have adventurous party in view a soon a be lost to sight by band of sharpshooter nearer bridge upon regaining camp spanish general at once ordered forward two field gun instruction to artilleryman apparently being to shell little clump of cover in jack have concealed sharpshooter latter despite youth inexperience be shrewd enough to foresee such move a accordingly have sooner put reconnoitring party to flight than withdrew men from place of concealment marched back to rejoin comrade taking care to keep together for have very strong suspicion that must again need for special service ere long gun be advanced at gallop brought to action front unlimbered with very creditable smartness next moment shell fire be opened by weapon upon little patch of cover just vacated by jack marksman aim be good shell after shell dropping so close to where marksman have be concealed that within first five minute must have be destroyed have remained there even although about two out of three shell failed to explode spanish general be soon convinced that gun have accomplished mission for when have fired thirty shell galloper be seen approaching artillery officer next moment individual gave word to cease fire limber up at word driver put mule into motion advanced toward gun whereupon jack who have be patiently awaiting movement gave order to sharpshooter who immediately opened fire upon team with result before gun must be moved animal be down then artilleryman attempted to drag weapon away upon also began to drop at length squad of cavalry be dispatched to move weapon be obliged to gallop nearly mile across jack front within range whole time although covered ground at good pace so hot be fire maintained upon so deadly aim that not one of horseman be able to reach gun jack have got weapon under cover of rifle did not mean to let go singleton soon have something else than two gun of enemy to think about for while have be concentrating attention upon two field piece entire body of troop have begun to move be advancing in two column with evident intention of endeavouring to force passage of stream somewhere in neighbourhood of ruined bridge apparently be unaware of existence of still weaker position carlos have undertaken to defend through strange oversight carelessness on part of commander be advancing in close order jack felt that now be moment when twelve pounder be likely to prove useful intended to captain gun have caused to be loaded with shrapnel time before therefore now carefully aimed weapon at certain spot over troop must pas distance of knew almost to inch then waiting patiently until leading column be within about three yard of fired shell appeared to strike ground explode almost at foot of advancing troop when smoke of explosion cleared away be seen that enormous gap have be made in advancing column have be thrown into utmost confusion men in immediate vicinity of gap on side of having halted in dismay while right left wing have continued to advance in midst of gap must be seen long swath of prostrate men most of whom be lying horribly unnaturally still be pitiable to see men many of scarcely out of boyhood led forth to die in support of grinding unendurable tyranny misgovernment yet be not moment in to indulge feeling of mistaken humanitarian sentiment mistaken because jack knew that unless same men must be driven off must be remorselessly used a instrument of ruthless destruction indiscriminate slaughter so while confusion among rank be still at height ordered gun to be reloaded again plumped shell right in very midst of second shell appeared to have be even more terribly destructive in effect than first for two column be when fell bunched close together seemed to have dropped where men be thickest ere now demoralised troop must recover from panic into have be thrown rank be yet more disastrously thinned rattling crash of maxim fire from carlos position indicating direction from new punishment have come by time general echague have begun to recover presence of mind saw that to attempt to advance farther in close formation in face of such withering fire must be suicidal gave word for men to take open order instantly did moment later slight change in formation of attacking troop showed that while leading column be intended to be used in forcing passage of river at point where bridge have be destroyed other column have be diverted to attack position carlos have undertaken to defend troop having taken open order be next ordered to lie down thus minimise exposure a far a possible in posture advanced to attack creeping gradually forward firing independently at spot where flash of rifle puff of smoke showed that enemy lay concealed there be one small party of men in particular that attracted jack attention careful inspection of through glass showed that be provided with something have appearance of scaling ladder be laboriously dragging after singleton very shrewdly suspected be intended to span gap in broken bridge thus afford passage for troop across river to men to cavalry who be still persistently endeavouring to recover possession use of two field piece jack commended especial attention of negro leaving remainder of spanish troop to be dealt with little later on for defender being safely ensconced in cover rifle fire of attacking party be absolutely harmless to young englishman felt that so long a must keep party with scaling ladder at arm length field piece from being used against be practically master of situation two object gained most successfully party with ladder very soon being wiped out while attempt on part of main body to supply place be effectually frustrated while a for gun by time that cavalry men have lost rather more than quarter of number have evidently arrived at conclusion that to move piece from exposed position occupied be impossible task accordingly abandoned turning attention next to position carlos be defending unequal fight have be in progress for nearly two hour during singleton party have experienced le than dozen casualty while enemy exposed in open have suffered very severely when body of men suddenly made appearance in rear of spanish force with howl yell of vengeful delight rushed forward to attack small flag of cuba libre be borne in midst proclaimed to be body of revolutionary spanish troop be hastily called off from attack on estate formed up in square to receive spaniard might a well have attempted to stop wind a to stem onrush of fierce determined men who be moreover in overwhelming number have time only to pour in couple of hasty ill directed volley then cuban armed with rifle others with sword cane knife machete scythe blade pike hatchet ay even crowbar smith hammer swept down upon overwhelmed for space of perhaps three minute there be hideous melee confused mass of men struggling yelling shrieking popping of pistol shot whirling flashing of blade in sun then out from midst of confusion there emerged bare half dozen of panic stricken horseman who set spur to frantic steed galloped for life off that fatal field spanish force have be wiped out by insurgent hour later when dead have be stripped of weapon ammunition antonio maceo little body of subordinate officer using scaling ladder left on field by spaniard crossed gap in wrecked bridge made way up to house for purpose of thanking don hermoso for letter of warning have dispatched to with request for loan of spade other tool must spare to enable insurgent to bury dead by sunset night long low mound of fresh turned earth showing red amid vivid green of grass grown plain be be left a evidence of tragedy while maceo four thousand patriot be wearily wending way back to mountain fastness richer by two six pounder field gun thousand stand of arm with considerable quantity of ammunition entire spoil of spanish camp be subsequently ascertained that general echague five of staff have succeeded in making good escape from field of slaughter a be anticipated that spaniard infuriated by terrible reverse must be more than likely to seek early revenge jack carlos be kept very busy during ensuing fortnight in so far improving defence of estate a to render practically impregnable remains of wrecked stone bridge be removed timber drawbridge be built in place entrenchment be dug commanding approach to to one two other spot where be thought that passage of river might possibly be forced further supply of ammunition be sent for small lookout semaphore station be constructed on hillside at point commanded view of possible approach to estate then ensued period of rather trying inactivity during jack carlos be kept constantly on tenterhook of expectancy vainly striving to get inkling of intention of enemy then at length came news that general weyler baffled in effort to force general engagement with enemy galled by constant heavy loss be sustaining through ravage of disease at hand of insurgent have issued order for concentration of entire rural population in fortified town in order that might thus be prevented from supplying various band of armed revolutionary with provision other necessary effect of cruel tyrannical order be to drive practically man into rank of rebel since must no longer follow vocation without exposing to severe punishment for disobedience while woman child to number of sixty thousand be perforce obliged to obey decree forsaking home betake to town sooner have done so than became apparent that sufficient provision have be made for maintenance since be impossible for to earn living for suffering loss of life among unfortunate quickly assumed appalling proportion to horror indignation of american people who have be watching with steadily rapidly growing disapproval peculiar method of spaniard for suppression of rebellion be opinion of america indeed not of america alone may be said that there must have be rebellion in cuba for gross corruption inefficiency of local government that proper method of suppression be not force of arm introduction of reform into system of government fact be that state of affair in cuba be generating strong increasing feeling of hostility between united state of america spain for while on one hand outspoken comment of american press deeply wounded sensitive pride of spanish nation must ill brook anything even in remotest degree savoured of censure of interference with own private affair determination of nation to manage affair in such manner a seemed to most fit led to many ill advised act tending to further strengthen sympathy of freedom loving american for oppressed persecuted cuban sympathy found expression in generous supply of munition of war to insurgent feeling of mutual hostility be further strengthened about time be to say in june of year by what be spoken of at time a competitor incident competitor be vessel manned by crew consisting with one solitary exception of citizen of united state in month above named be surprised captured on north west coast of island by spanish authority immediately after landing cargo of arm ammunition destined for maceo little army of patriot crew of ship be forthwith tried by court martial sentenced to be shot under treaty existing between united state spain be specially provided that unless american citizen be actually in arm against spain when captured must only be proceeded against before ordinary tribunal united state therefore through general lee consul general in havana promptly intervened on behalf of crew declaring that trial by court martial be illegal spain a promptly retorted that be perfectly justified in action have taken manifested very strong disposition to abide by decision of court martial execute sentence united state remained so inflexibly firm made so clear that must tolerate departure whatsoever from term of treaty spain after holding out a long a dared be at length compelled to yield order new trial by ordinary process with result that ship crew after having be kept for long time in prison be eventually released expelled from island incident greatly embittered relation between two nation spain especially resenting humiliation of defeat there seems very little doubt that be primal cause led up to spanish american war one day a little party at casa montijo be about to sit down to second breakfast antonio maceo suddenly made appearance good day senor exclaimed a mounted step leading to front veranda good day senora how be to day quite well thank senor answered senora need scarcely ask mountain air evidently agrees with be quite unexpected pleasure senor antonio mean visit to senora be very good of to say so not knowing what facility may have for obtaining news thought must come down to let know that believe have at length driven spaniard completely out of neighbourhood friend general echague attacked in force about month ago with avowed determination a have since learned of dislodging from stronghold have most splendid fight have ever participated in allowed to gradually drive back six mile into mountain until have drawn into very carefully prepared ambuscade there punished so severely that believe will not again dare to trouble especially a learn that general be severely wounded continued taking don hermoso by arm leading to end of veranda out of earshot of senora be not what came down to tell learned only yesterday that fiend weyler maddened by inability to check progress of rebellion failure of arm generally have personally taken field at head of army of sixty thousand men be marching through havana on way to pinar del rio carrying fire sword through province leaving behind nothing black blood stained ruin before left havana proclaimed that free pardon must be granted to insurgent who must choose to surrender to spanish authority certain number of among who have become incapacitated through sickness have with consent of leader accepted offer surrender so far from weakening have strengthened hand for no longer have to nurse look after have also issued order to effect that spanish troop while marching through country will henceforth destroy building crop cattle other property may be capable of sheltering assisting insurgent in way whatsoever furthermore that person met with who have disobeyed concentration order will be treated a rebel mean that will be tried by drum head court martial shot know whether not have yet heard news senor hermoso have aided thus far in so magnificently generous manner deemed duty to come down make certain also to warn of what may expect if weyler must happen to find here a for have come to conclusion can do good by remaining pent up among mountain while be equally certain that with four thousand men can not hope successfully to encounter weyler sixty thousand have therefore determined to endeavour to slip through trocha demonstrate against havana in hope that weyler will thus be induced to abandon march return to protect city so far a be concerned advice to be that leave place at once accompany fly to place of safety whichever please in case can not do better think than turn negro over to with such arm a can spare come in take breakfast with said don hermoso be serious news indeed what be best to do under circumstance be matter be not to be decided in moment need careful consideration therefore will talk over after breakfast with if can spare hour two son young englishman who although only lad seems to have man head on shoulder present inclination be to remain where be let weyler do worst believe that with disposition have made since echague attack upon can hold estate against comer when after hour earnest conference little later on in day tour of estate in company of don hermoso carlos jack antonio maceo took leave in order to return to men among mountain expressed opinion that given ample supply of ammunition sufficient store of provision be just possible that don hermoso might be able to hold even weyler sixty thousand men at bay whereupon be decided that attempt must be made chapter eighteen gallant defence be not to be supposed that so momentous decision a mentioned at close of last chapter must be arrived at without bringing occupant of hacienda face to face with many anxiety one of most serious of be undoubtedly question whether ammunition for have sent must arrive ere appearance upon scene of general valeriano y nicolan weyler with devastating army of sixty thousand men if did might possibly be well if did not well in case disaster be practically certain for nearly week hung painfully upon tenterhook of suspense waiting for news only news reached be to effect that new capitan general with characteristic vigour have issued most rigorous instruction for vigilant patrol of entire coast line of island to be maintained with express object of preventing further landing of munition of war of description whatsoever obvious conclusion at have arrived being that if such supply must be effectually stopped rebellion must eventually be starved out of existence for want of after long week of keenest anxiety intelligence arrived that milsom have succeeded in eluding guardacostas have landed cargo in small cove under lee of san domingo point on south coast that moiety of cargo asked for by don hermoso be even then well on way to estate next day arrived be safely stored to great relief of defender who now found possessed of supply of ammunition ample enough to enable with care to withstand siege of month duration if need be while doubted very much whether general weyler must be disposed to devote even amount of time to subjugation ammunition came to hand only just in nick of time for on very day of arrival anxious watcher became aware of faint odour of burning on breeze when at length darkness closed down upon sky to eastward glowed red showing that weyler destroyer be at hand with dawn smell of burning became more pronounced hitherto crystalline clearness of air be seen to be dimmed by thin veil of brownish blue vapour lookout in eyrie far up mountain side signalled that flame thick smoke be visible in direction of consolacion del sur a day progressed haze with air be charged grew thicker taint of fire smoke more pungent occasional vibration of atmosphere suggested to who became conscious of boom of distant artillery while with approach of whole of eastern sky became suffused with flickering ruddy light lookout up mountain signalling that entire country to eastward a far a eye must see seemed to be in flame on morrow sign of destruction became very greatly accentuated with passage of hour atmosphere became more thickly charged with smoke more pungent with smell of burning cloud of black ash darkened sky from time to time a be swept along upon wing of strong breeze dense column of smoke rising here there showed where spoiler be at work upon property so near at hand that must now be identified named while frequent rattle crash of rifle fire seemed to indicate that there be others who like don hermoso be not prepared to stand supinely by see entire possession destroyed work be still being carried on by don hermoso employes have be turned to morning with injunction at sound of alarm bell be to instantly drop tool muster before shed in arm be stored a for singleton carlos montijo have jumped into saddle at daybreak be maintaining ceaseless patrol of boundary of estate riding in opposite direction encountering other from time to time when must exchange such item of information a might happen to have gleaned in interim through morning work of destruction proceeded atmosphere became hourly thicker more suffocating with smoke great tongue of flame must occasionally be seen leaping skyward here there above top of tree dull boomings from time to time told of blowing up of building intermittent crash of volley firing mingled with shout yell shriek told that desperate fight be raging perchance ruthless summary execution be taking place by by shortly after mid day solitary horseman mounted upon steed in lather of sweat recognised by carlos a next neighbour to eastward came galloping over temporary drawbridge with warning to don hermoso to fly with family dependent since weyler with army of butcher be already approaching in such overpowering strength that nothing must possibly stand before poor fellow gasped out breathless story of ruthlessly savage murder destruction telling how have seen atom of property looted burnt member of family shot down how have at last moment escaped by skin of teeth with horse rode clothes that stood up in a sole remaining possession in world have effected escape with mad idea of flying for life somewhere knew not whither upon learning that don hermoso be resolved to defend property to last poor fellow certain don luis enrile begged permission to be allowed to remain assist in defence since be now ruined man have nothing left to live for save revenge naturally don hermoso readily acceded to request unhappy don luis having drawn in broken gasping sentence main outline of tragical story be still filling in of more lurid detail of morning happening upon farm when lookout perched aloft on hillside signalled approach of enemy while carlos dashed off in one direction to sound alarm bell occupy former defence post jack rushed off in other to raise temporary drawbridge have be constructed to take place of wrecked stone bridge be now only mean of entering upon leaving estate having raised bridge carefully secured against possibility of becoming lowered by accident jack climbed structure to uplifted extremity from thence looked out over wide plain gently sloped away toward east south west of presently became aware of loud confused rumbling jumble of sound when be presently able to dissect resolved into mingled trampling of multitudinous foot hoof rumbling creaking of many wheel combined murmur of many human voice occasional low deep protesting bellow of overdriven animal crack of whip continuous shout of men air be still thick with acrid smoke rendering difficult to see anything clearly at distance greater than mile presently thickened still more jack recognised that thickening be produced by great cloud of dun coloured dust out of midst of there presently cantered into view number of spanish cavalry scout dozen of whom upon reaching main road wheeled to right dashed along toward point of junction with private road leading to don hermoso estate jack considered that moment have now arrived for to quit post of observation accordingly slid down rail of bridge until reached ground where be almost immediately joined by contingent of labourer be to operate under a before for defence of estate at point wood away to left bamboo coppice afforded perfect cover shelter for whole of party since man now knew to inch where be required to post everybody be in position entirely hidden from sight full minute before leading couple of cavalry came into view round bend of road leading to ruined bridge sooner did that leading couple appear than two whiplike rifle report snapped out from somewhere in front of while one rider dropped forward collapsed on horse neck other flung up arm tossed away carbine be carrying in right hand reeled out of saddle to ground with crash while horse tossing up head wheeled sharply round dashed off to rear dragging dead rider by left stirrup next instant pair of scout swung into view when again out snapped that ominous double whiplike crack time one of two rider dropping carbine to ground clapped right hand convulsively to breast a swiftly wheeled horse galloped off while horse of companion rearing upright pawing air furiously for moment with fore hoof fell backward with crash lay dead pinning helpless rider beneath whereupon remainder of party wheeled horse dashing in spur took to precipitate flight shortly afterwards doubtless in consequence of report of men reconnoitring party consisting of dozen brilliantly garbed officer approached evidently with idea of inspecting nature of defence of estate ascertaining weak point jack must have none of moment that came within point blank rifle range opened fire upon with sharpshooter only three of half dozen be able to make good retreat meanwhile main body of troop gradually debouched into view upon plain motley crowd of infantry clad in rag so effectually bleached discoloured by exposure to rain sun that must probably have puzzled own officer to name various regiment to belonged about one hundred cavalry three battery of field artillery whole accompanied by enormous number of baggage ambulance ammunition wagon water cart nondescript vehicle of imaginable description immense lowing bellowing bleating herd of captured cattle sheep goat many of seemed to be half mad with terror mounted officer in score dashed frantically to fro among medley of men vehicle animal finally when herd of cattle be at length separated from main body driven off detachment of three thousand men one battery of gun with proportion of wagon other vehicle halted on plain with evident intention of attacking estate while remainder of body went forward attack began immediately puff two of white smoke have revealed to reconnoitring party lurking place of who have fired upon have of course pointed out spot to artilleryman a upon be to concentrate fire with result immediately gun be wheeled to action front opened hot fire upon bamboo coppice a on occasion of previous attack sooner have reconnoitring party withdrawn than jack moved sharpshooter from cover of bamboo to of line of artfully constructed earthwork while far enough removed from bamboo to be perfectly safe from artillery fire felt certain must be immediately opened upon equally commanded road leading to ruined bridge enabled to effectually check endeavour to reconnoitre point of approach result be that after bamboo have be fiercely shelled for ten minute without producing single casualty among defender reconnoitring party believing that particular patch of cover have be pretty effectually cleared boldly galloped forward under cover of continued shell fire to examine spot from resolution with have be defended felt convinced must be one of key of position there be little doubt that be a much surprised a disgusted to be received with volley from totally different not easily discernible point caused to again retire precipitately leaving nearly two third of number behind finding thus persistently foiled officer in command slightly altered tactic while instructing artillery to persistently shell bit of timber other cover must possibly afford concealment to defender deployed infantry into column of open order threw out strong firing line with instruction to to advance taking advantage of bit of cover that must find shoot at puff of smoke that must see a on occasion of previous attack many of spanish shell failed to burst notwithstanding few casualty now began to occur among jack party of defender therefore decided that moment have arrived for bringing twelve pounder into action gun accordingly jack have by time got mounted on cleverly constructed carefully masked earth battery now opened fire upon enemy artillery a singleton have personally laid piece knew exact range to practically inch be lucky enough to dismount put out of action one of spanish gun with first shot while second swept away one of artilleryman from gun next to third fourth shot did comparatively little damage fifth shell struck one of gun fair upon muzzle at precise moment when be being fired with result that shell burst simultaneously completely shattering fore part of gun a far back a trunnions scattering death destruction broadcast among rest of artilleryman by time spanish gunner have managed to locate position of weapon be punishing so fearfully from moment devoted attention exclusively to with result shell began to drop thick fast about jack ear smothering half blinding with dust occasionally peppering pretty smartly with pebble fragment of stone be mingled with earth of battery be composed still gallantly maintained unequal fight actually succeeded in disabling four out of six gun ere splinter of shell struck on temple knocked senseless when recovered found that darkness be closing down that be in own room on own bed whither have be brought by ambulance party of men mama faquita poor senorita isolda nurse have taken in charge cleaned dressed wound be looking after generally intermittent crackle of rifle fire told that attack be still being pressed faquita informed that there have be very few serious casualty thus far that be going well old woman must fain have kept confined to room jack knew that with darkness must come real danger despite nurse vehement protest not only rose from bed returned to spot contingent of men be still defending arrived there soon found that event have be happening during absence in first place appeared that remainder of gun crew have continued to work twelve pounder after firing away perfectly ruinous quantity of ammunition have actually succeeded in disabling one of two remaining spanish gun soon after accomplishing feat twelve pounder have be dismounted put out of action by shell have completely destroyed carriage at same time have slain four of gunner whereupon little party of sharpshooter remembering tactic jack have adopted during previous attack upon estate have exclusively devoted to repetition of by first of exterminating entire crew of remaining spanish gun then rendering impossible for anyone else to approach gun to work meanwhile officer in command finding useless to try to do anything with men exposed a be upon open plain have withdrawn out of gunshot gone into camp be clear that proposed to wait until darkness came to veil movement jack quite anticipated that first thing spaniard must attempt must be to reconnoitre entire position with object of finding way to get across river knew that there be only two point at feat of crossing be possible namely carlos be defending therefore scribbled little note to friend warning latter what to guard against dispatched by negro messenger whom also instructed to afterwards call at house bring from thence pair of binocular glass be to be found on table in jack bedroom by time that messenger returned with glass have grown intensely dark for to natural obscurity of night there be added further obscuration caused by smoke with atmosphere be laden while to still further intensify blackness heavy thunderstorm be working up against wind combined result being darkness in be literally impossible to see one hand before one face jack be at first inclined to anathematise darkness when at length be enabled to fully realise intensity of felt much more disposed to bless for having moved about dozen pace away from post experienced difficulty in finding way back began to comfort with reflection that enemy utterly strange to country a be must hing until light enough must come to at least enable to see where to put foot yet jack be mistaken in so supposing for a time went on became aware of certain sound out there on plain seemed to indicate pretty unmistakably that despite darkness spaniard be busily employed when moaning sighing of night wind among branch of tree rustle of bamboo clash of palm leaf subsided for instant allowing more distant sound to reach ear intermittently caught what seemed to be sound of pick shovel at work at very great distance moreover there be light flitting about distant camp much movement there though what portended jack be quite unable to discover even with help of night glass at length however period of darkness came to end for sheet lightning began to flicker quiver among densely packed cloud low down on western horizon at first for instant only at comparatively long interval soon increasing greatly in vividness rapidity then young englishman perceived to disgust alarm that spanish soldier have availed of obscurity not only to entrench strong body of rifleman to right left of own end of ruined bridge also to advance long light platform gangway mounted on wheel of one of disabled field piece seemed to be preparing to throw across gap in bridge a soon a must get sufficient light to enable to run into position indeed be actually engaged in moving forward at very moment when jack discovered existence to bring up men place in position among bamboo must enable to frustrate bold attempt to span river be work of minute two for jack then immediately opened hot fire upon working party who be engaged in moving forward gangway sooner have done than found how seriously condition have changed for worse during two hour of total darkness for now spaniard who have established in trench be so close at hand that cover of bamboo be no longer efficient defence casualty among defender became disconcertingly frequent furthermore soon appeared that spaniard have got two strong hauling party sheltered behind couple of low earthwork that people by mean of two stout rope attached to gangway be steadily with much skill hauling thing toward required position jack soon saw however that must be quite impossible for hauling party to haul far enough forward to enable to be dropped into position across gap in ruined bridge moment must come sooner later when concealed men who be dragging upon rope must be obliged to leave cover push platform remaining portion of distance quickly determined to reserve energy ammunition until moment time quickly arrived single bugle blast appeared to be signal for entrenched spanish rifleman to concentrate fire upon clump of bamboo brake wherein jack have hidden men at same instant about hundred infantry men sprang from behind sheltering earthwork made dash at platform movement being clearly visible by light of vivid electric discharge have by time become practically continuous with utmost resolution seized light structure started to run forward toward gap in bridge jack having by time instilled into dusky troop virtue of coolness deliberation in fighting next moment be swept back to cover by perfectly withering fire placed nearly half of hors de combat meanwhile sound of hot sustained firing have gradually breezed up in direction of position carlos be defending ere long became evident that there also attack be being pressed although sound of strife thitherward be soon almost swallowed up in long continuous crash crackle of rifle fire be being maintained by entrenched troop upon jack party young englishman must not avoid suspicion that friend be being somewhat hardly pressed for whenever momentary lull occurred in firing in front of jack must not only hear that volume of firing in carlos direction be fully maintained seemed to that be steadily increasing presently breathless messenger arrived from carlos begging jack to spare former a many men a possibly must to help in driving back body of spanish troop who have actually succeeded in forcing passage across river in response to request jack of course instantly detached man must possibly spare retaining le than fifty to aid in defending own position news have just received made perfectly clear to that defence be practically at end for if carlos have be unable to prevent spaniard from forcing passage of river be in highest degree unlikely that must be able to stem rush much le drive back jack at once began to consider what be best course to pursue under new condition a thought plan began to gradually unfold in mind estate felt be lost for if only sufficient number of spaniard must once get across river to hold carlos ' force at bay for five minute by end of time reinforcement must have crossed strong enough to sweep defender out of existence nothing therefore in case must save estate from destruction might be possible to visit upon destroyer heavy retribution jack mind be thus occupied when messenger arrived from carlos to tell that be lost that carlos with remnant of party with whom be don hermoso wife be retreating up valley hotly pursued by strong party of spanish soldier while other spaniard be in possession of house several outbuilding be obviously preparing to set on fire message concluded by requesting jack to follow with party join fugitive if possible now happened that carlos ' retreat up valley chimed in excellently well with scheme be beginning to take shape within jack brain latter therefore lost time in collecting together little band of rifleman leading through wood round by rear of house outbuilding along bush path to spot at must intercept join retreating party at moreover owing to nature of ground believed must pretty effectually check pursuit cover retreat of main body of defender a pressed forward at head of own scanty contingent sound of occasional shot told that carlos be still maintaining good running fight a path be following constituted short cut to spot desired to reach soon left sound in rear pressing rapidly forward at length arrived at main path aided by lightning be now flashing incessantly contrived to place men in ambush behind number of big boulder studded almost perpendicular side of bush clad hill just a leading file of retreating party came into view round bend of path jack saw with satisfaction that retreat be being conducted in good order first came body of fifty well armed negro who be keeping wary eye about to guard against possibility of being ambuscaded by portion of enemy who might have pushed on got in front of although thing be scarcely likely to have happened then came senora in hammock suspended from pole borne on shoulder of two stout negro with don hermoso senor calderon walking one on side of behind again came main body of retreating defender with two maxim gun in midst with carlos bringing up rear in charge of party of about twenty rifleman who be covering retreat by frequently facing round exchanging shot with pursuer a last came into view jack rose from place of ambush at imminent risk of being shot by friend before must recognise made fact of presence that of party known bidding others pas on leave heaviest of covering work to loss jack must see have be terribly heavy looked weary to death with long hour of fighting yet be gratified to observe that with very few exception men carried a resolutely a ever displayed effect of training by taking fullest advantage of particle of cover dodging behind rock boulder trunk of tree clump of bush taking a careful aim a though be shooting in match re loading then flitting from cover to cover to take up fresh position rear guard under carlos have not passed much more than hundred yard ahead when leading file of pursuer appeared round bend of path breathless from fact that retreating party have sooner disappeared round elbow than spaniard have broken into run taking advantage of circumstance that be for moment out of sight of enemy to shorten distance between pursued a vanguard of twenty pursuing spaniard dashed round bend dropped on one knee raised rifle to shoulder availing of lightning flash to take aim at little crowd of retreating figure imperfectly seen here there through overhanging swaying branch cruise of thetis by harry collingwood chapter nineteen trapped never for moment did suspect existence of little body of men concealed among fern undergrowth boulder sixty foot up precipitous side of hill round base of be winding until before quickest of must pull trigger there rang out above irregular volley aimed with such deadly precision man of went down before be there found blocking path when comrade arrived upon scene minute two later a in turn swung round bend came upon prostrate form naturally halted proceeded to examine body with view of separating living from dead with result that there be almost instantly crowd of about hundred spanish soldier bunched together in narrow path of performing ambulance work majority simply waiting for opportunity to pas be altogether too good chance to be neglected waiting only until jostling crowd in pathway be at thickest jack raised whistle to lip blew single shrill note call be instantly answered by crashing volley from concealed negro took such murderous effect upon crowd below scarcely dozen men be left upon foot who be untouched be so utterly demoralised that incontinently turned tail retreated upon main body shouting back back there be ambuscade round bend of road will be slaughtered to man if go forward whereupon spanish officer in charge of pursuit who be prudently remaining with main body instead of pushing forward with vanguard at once halted men proceeded to enquire what confusion be about truth be that finding on strange ground following narrow winding bush path with deepening ravine on right precipitously steep hillside on left overgrown with fern scrub thick enough to give perfect cover to unlimited number of men with furious thunderstorm raging promised to speedily develop into something very considerably worse than what already be have stomach for continuing pursuit be only too glad of excuse to call halt allow enemy to go upon way without further molestation on other hand jack having satisfied that have at least checked pursuit gave word to men to move forward taking short cut over spur of hill soon found once more in path close upon heel of companion a jack party presently overtook what have originally be rear guard carlos dropped into rear joined friend two youth seized opportunity to effect exhaustive interchange of news to relate to other most stirring episode in defence of respective position young cuban explained mean adopted by spaniard to force passage across river how have eventually be overpowered forced to retire then singleton unfolded to carlos view upon subject of how to deal with enemy must latter be induced to follow to certain spot up among hill jack described carlos remembered spot be now rapidly approaching consisted of nearly straight defile about mile in length with bend in middle just sufficient to shut out view of one end of from other defile be simply cleft in stupendous mass of rock formed great spur of mountain on left hand side of path be undoubtedly result of terrific natural convulsion of prehistoric time have rent living rock asunder leaving vertical wall on side indentation in one wall accurately corresponding to projection on other at lower extremity be to say extremity fugitive be now approaching access to defile be gained by mean of sort of portal le than six foot wide space between rock wall thence narrowing gradually to about four foot thus forming kind of passage about fifty foot long beyond rock wall gradually receded from other until at other extremity of defile be nearly hundred foot wide wall be unscalable throughout entire length of defile abruptly ended in rough torn rock face two hundred foot in height rock face must scarcely be described a unscalable because be so rough that although practically vertical projection on be so numerous pronounced that active man must climb without much difficulty if uninterfered with if summit flank happened to be held by even small force of men armed with rifle to climb must at once become absolute impossibility outside entrance there be small open grassy space backed by dense scrub jack plan be that carlos with about fifty men must enter defile pas through to upper extremity scale rock face there holding against spaniard thus checking further advance while jack remainder of negro with two maxim must secrete in scrub remain in hiding until entire spanish force have passed into defile when must emerge block entrance with two maxim thus bottling up spaniard compelling to surrender be annihilated by time that singleton have completely unfolded plan to carlos vanguard of fugitive have reached entrance to defile where halted awaiting further instruction whereupon carlos ran forward picking fifty men led through portal while jack taking command of remainder caused to carefully drag lift two maxim into concealment obliterate trace of passage of gun into scrub afterwards conceal therein senora don hermoso senor calderon remaining with party have scarcely hidden removed sign of presence to jack satisfaction when storm have be threatening for so long time burst with terrific fury air being continuously glimmer with flickering quivering of lightning flash while very ground beneath foot seemed to quake with deafening soul shaking crash of thunder rain breaking loose at last descended in such cataractal volume even partially sheltered a most of be by dense foliage of scrub amid cowered soul of be wet to skin in le than minute in midst of jack peering out from hiding place few foot from path saw wretched spanish soldiery go splashing squelching past too wet altogether too utterly tired miserable apparently to take notice of where be going seemingly anxious only to press forward in hope of somewhere finding shelter there be about six hundred of by time that have passed into defile storm have nearly spent rain have ceased lightning flickered only occasionally then low down toward horizon thunder have dwindled to low hollow muffled rumbling cloud overhead have broken up be drifting fast away revealing nearly full moon sailing high overhead in strong silvery light of saturated vegetation glittered a last spaniard disappeared within portal singleton cautiously emerged from hiding place forcing way through sodden herbage peered round angle of rock watching movement of retiring foe waited patiently until rearmost file have penetrated good hundred yard up defile then raised hand waving a signal for men to come forth next instant place be alive with men fifty willing hand dragged forth maxim planted fair square in portal pointing up ravine ammunition box be opened band of cartridge placed in position rifle be loaded ere last of spaniard have passed round bend out of sight preparation to give warm reception upon return be complete watcher by portal have not very long to wait enemy be not out of sight much more than ten minute when solitary rifle shot cracked out at head of defile came echoing down rocky side then one then three four more until at length brisk fusillade be proceeding accompanied by good deal of confused shouting lasted for best part of hour when there came first lull in firing then sound of many approaching foot following disorderly crowd of spanish soldier appeared doubling down defile in full flight toward entrance with appearance of first of jack sprang up on boulder shouted to to halt so eager be spaniard to escape from punishment have be inflicted upon at other end of defile that be not until one of maxim opened fire upon that must be persuaded to stay precipitate flight sharp thudding hammer like report of machine gun stream of lead began to play upon thin rank soon brought to halt when flinging down arm cried for quarter of course be at once given then carlos ' party closing in upon from rear spaniard be carefully disarmed ammunition taken away from weapon destroyed by being consumed in huge bonfire formed of dry wood collected from depth of bush while regrettable necessary act of destruction be in process of execution carlos jack went among prisoner questioning a to number who be in command upon what principle be working so on unfortunately be unable to extract very much information for appeared that officer have perished either in attack upon estate at far end of defile while soldier seemed either too stupid too ill informed to be able to give trustworthy reply to of question asked except general weyler have gone back to havana that operation in province of pinar del rio be being conducted by general bernal arolas who by strict command of weyler be laying entire country waste destroying building of whatsoever description church included on ground that afforded possible place of refuge shelter for revolutionary mercilessly shooting down man woman child found on plea that not having obeyed general weyler concentration order be contumacious rebel that in short where host went found smiling prosperity left behind blood stained fire blackened waste troop be not acting in concert a one body in independent detachment to of be allotted duty of covering strip of country of certain width strip be task to ravage from end to end detachment to duty of destroying don hermoso property have fallen have consisted of three thousand infantry troop of cavalry battery of field artillery according to story of prisoner have suffered frightfully during attack officer in command having wasted men most recklessly in determination to conquer at cost indeed if be to be believed with exception of about squadron of cavalry few artilleryman perhaps fifty men left behind to destroy building be sole survivor of attack pursuit question now presented to jack carlos be what be to do with prisoner now that have for that be distinctly embarrassing possession be indisputable fact in first place unfortunate wretch be by time suffering acutely from hunger thirst captor have food drink to give indeed have none wherewith to satisfy own pressing need also since building on estate be doubtless by time utterly destroyed by fire there be place in to confine yet must obviously be height of folly to set free while comrade be still in neighbourhood for must only mean that must bring back comrade to complete work have failed to finish at length after long anxious consultation be agreed that only possible course be to pen spaniard inside defile keeping there by wholesome dread inspired by presence of two maxim strong band of armed men holding portal under carlos ' command that jack with picked body of fifty armed negro must escort don hermoso senora back to house in hope that somewhere among ruin at least partial shelter might be found for unhappy lady who drenched to skin be now threatened with serious attack of fever that after shelter have be found for jack men must reconnoitre camp of enemy endeavour to learn something of immediate intention having be arranged prisoner be given to understand that must make a comfortable a must where be for present that attempt on part to break out must be visited with immediate rigorous punishment after jack party accompanied by don hermoso wife briskly stepped out on way down valley along road by have so recently come emerging about hour later into open space have be occupied by warehouse of a well a whole of negro hut be found to be nothing heap of black smouldering ruin while others have be set on fire flame have obviously be extinguished by pelting rain have fallen during latter part of recent thunderstorm building have happened to contain large quantity of combustible good have naturally suffered most severely be now merely collection of roofless smoke blackened wall while have be empty have suffered comparatively little damage indeed in one two case practically none at except that door have be broken open partly wrenched off hinge one of be at once utilised a shelter for don hermoso wife while negro mounted guard round building don jack hurried away toward house to ascertain condition so far a former be concerned to endeavour to find change of clothing for senora at first glimpse house when reached appeared to have suffered very severely for many of window be broken once immaculately white wall be streaked blackened here there by fire smoke when entered building everything be found in most shocking state of confusion furniture be overturned much of be broken great deal of be irretrievably damaged by fire great hole have be burnt here there in flooring cupboard bureau have be broken open content scattered apparently in search for money valuable many small article of value be missing picture be slashed torn poor dona isolda grand piano have one leg left be otherwise complete wreck priceless china vas bowl have be glory of drawing room be lying on floor shivered to atom little closer inspection revealed that while immense amount of damage have be done much of through pure wantonness lust for destruction building be practically intact roof be still weatherproof of room be in quite inhabitable condition while there be many article of furniture dress a well a many utensil of various kind must still be made serviceable among inhabitable room be bedroom used by don hermoso wife a also usually occupied by carlos jack indeed appeared a though spoiler have confined destructive effort almost entirely to front part of house under circumstance a there be sign of enemy in immediate neighbourhood don hermoso lost time in hurrying back to wife getting up to house into bed that being must do at moment to combat fever have seized upon much having be accomplished jack set negro to search among wreckage for anything in nature of food might perchance have escaped destruction while single handed set off to reconnoitre camp of enemy out on plain shortest route thereto be by way of position carlos have so resolutely defended chose because enemy having forced passage of river at spot believed must there find mean of crossing most easily have scarcely traversed hundred yard from house ere began to encounter evidence of severity of fight have waged throughout afternoon evening of disastrously eventful day in shape of dead wounded men former lying stark cold in light of moon of with limb disposed a though merely slumbered while contorted body of others showed that have passed away in throe of mortal agony with eye decently closed others with sightless eyeball upturned until only white be visible while from lip of wounded there issued one low continuous moan of water water for love of god water be pitiable sight beyond human power of description a jack looked round beheld unit of slain tortured humanity great righteous anger took possession of against arrogant power have be cause of anguish misery to say nothing of what be enacting elsewhere rather than surrender grip upon fair island that have will ability to wisely govern power have deliberately entered upon vindictive war against whom have goaded to rebellion be of course quite impossible for unaided to ameliorate appreciably hundredth part of physical anguish of men who lay there writhing groaning on sodden ground there be one poor wretch who managed to attract attention spanish soldier who lower part of body paralysed supported upon one hand while mutely pointed with other to open mouth protruding tongue who seemed to be very living embodiment of torturing thirst mute appeal in poor creature eye be so movingly eloquent that young englishman simply must not pas on callously leave in torment therefore stooped laying man arm over shoulder lifted poor fellow on to back carried little way to where depression in ground have be converted by rain into pool three four yard in diameter from several wounded men be already slaking fiery thirst there laid down within reach of precious liquid stood for moment to watch poor creature suck down great draught of thick muddy water there be score of other unfortunate in sight whose suffering be probably a acute a of poor wretch whom jack have just helped who have equally strong claim upon compassion stern necessity demanded that must neglect in favour of mission have set out to execute also recognised that first duty be to secure safety of friend therefore perforce steeled heart pushed on toward point at spaniard have effected passage of river where consequently expected to find mean of getting across be gruesome journey if short one for yard that advanced dead wounded lay more thickly piled together until at length by margin of river prostrate body of friend foe be so closely intermingled that found difficult to progress at without trampling under foot while now still night air positively reeked with odour of blood be awful beyond utmost that young englishman imagination have ever pictured a glanced about with shrinking gaze rising gorge again mentally execrated leader to whose savagery unspeakable horror be due now at last be at river now also saw by what mean spaniard have finally succeeded in accomplishing task of forcing passage of barrier single glance at contrivance be sufficient to prove that assailant possessed among at least one skilled engineer for spanning stream jack saw extraordinarily light yet strong bridge constructed entirely of bamboo so lashed braced together a to be capable of sustaining weight of continuous column of men two abreast over entire length be fashioned upon principle of bowstring girder be considerably longer than be actually needed jack accounted for by fact that spaniard have be allowed opportunity to gauge actual width of river have therefore be obliged to guess at yet so light did appear to be that believed thirty men might easily have handled placed in position quickly passed across finding perfectly firm to tread then set out to cross open plain toward distant camp have still night glass with a went frequently made use of a much to avoid risk of being detected by sentry a to observe what be passing in camp from outset failed to detect presence of sentry gradually began to dawn upon that occupant of camp believing defender of estate to be not only absolutely irretrievably beaten also in panic stricken flight have not deemed necessary to post sentry at be sleeping in fancied perfect security in fact found to be actually case when at length with observance of possible precaution actually stood within precinct of camp looked about there be not light in one of many tent round watch fire have burnt low in case have died out altogether not soul be moving from one end of camp to other round be sleeping men waited only long enough to assure that be actually case then withdrawing a carefully a have come hurried back to where have left fifty men resting in one of least damaged of warehouse roused with intimation that be required for instant action then briefly acquainting with what have done what proposed to do ordering to load weapon marched out across bamboo bridge on to plain where bade take open order crouching low on grass advance upon camp exposing a little a possible since must one person in camp awake detect labour must be lost took little band of adventurer full hour to accomplish passage across plain when at length arrived within about fifty yard of camp jack caused signal to be passed along line for hand to lie prone in grass while went forward alone to satisfy that everything be still a have left then a have done two hour previously jack crawled right into heart of camp gazed carefully about everything be still perfectly quiet save that from certain of tent there issued sound advertising fact that there be noisy sleeper within then singleton rose cautiously to foot lifted right hand above head next minute fifty armed negro under whispered direction be moving about camp silent footed a cat collecting piled arm other weapon must find concealing among long grass at safe distance from camp then done jack raised revolver above head fired single shot into air at sound of startled occupant of tent came tumbling out one over to learn what disturbance be about to seize weapon instead of piled arm eye fell upon fifty stalwart negro facing with levelled rifle jack beside with revolver in hand unexpected sight naturally caused spaniard to pause in rush of circumstance singleton took advantage to thrust one of revolver back into belt then raise hand with command for silence spaniard eye still heavy with sleep disconcerted by discovery one of weapon have mysteriously vanished obeyed readily enough whereupon jack requested officer in command to step forward barefooted man in shirt trouser only carrying in hand sheathed sword of spanish infantry captain have evidently snatched from tent pole a sprang from camp bed stepped forward announcing a senior surviving officer demanded to know who jack be what wanted be said jack commander of body of negro of whom see detachment before be in arm against spain a be thousand more of inhabitant of island because very strongly object to cruel tyranny oppression with have be governed demand freedom march through country have be marked by violence outrage of conceivable description have left in track nothing death desolation measure of iniquity be full cuba will endure more general weyler have declared war of extermination against cuban who execute murderous mandate must pay penalty yet since must be manifestly unfair to punish innocent for guilty since be convinced that many of have only obeyed general order most unwillingly will spare of who will surrender execute only who by refusing exhibit readiness to persist in iniquitous deed look for help from comrade yonder triumphed temporarily achieving victory by sheer force of number since parted company have fallen into trap now who still live be prisoner will join will go way of others who have to night laid down life at behest of man who know not meaning of mercy let among who be willing to surrender throw up hand officer turned looked behind man under command have thrown hand above head be enough humiliation be complete drawing sword from scabbard placed point on ground then bending blade into form of bow gave hilt sudden peculiar thrusting jerk blade snapped in twain then tossing hilt from exclaimed in tone of concentrated bitterness surrender burst into tear of anger mortification chapter twenty end of struggle prisoner about hundred in number many of whom be le than half dressed be now allowed five minute wherein to retire to tent assume clothing after be formed up four deep marched off in direction from jack party have come young swift footed negro having be dispatched on ahead with note from singleton for carlos informing latter of capture of camp occupant suggesting that must bring prisoner down to compound adjoining warehouse with arrival of prisoner armed escort within mile of spot where bamboo bridge crossed river began to come upon first evidence of recent fight in shape first of widely scattered unit then of little group of two three dead wounded first be obliged to leave for moment wounded be by jack order now sought for succoured so far a succour be possible by unskilled hand by being in first instance borne closer to river having fiery thirst temporarily assuaged later on by having wound dressed so far a convenience available permitted with so large number of wounded labour of mercy necessarily occupied considerable amount of time so that be broad daylight when at length jack conducted prisoner into compound marched into empty partially ruined storehouse carlos have already caused to be prepared for reception prisoner young cuban have brought down from defile having already be lodged in adjoining building then came question of feeding hungry very formidable task considering practically food on estate have be destroyed by fire on preceding night difficulty however be overcome by jack revisiting captured camp with party of dozen of least exhausted negro collecting wagon load of foodstuff with dozen ox drove on to estate by way of lowered drawbridge then with infinite labour wounded be once more sought out carried into one of storehouse have suffered least from fire where be attended to so far a must be by band of compatriot who have volunteered for service who have given parole that must not again take up arm against cuban next came terrible task of burying dead be also done under jack supervision by prisoner kept in proper state of submission by strong guard of armed negro be by time considerably past mid day at least half of negro who have fought so stubbornly well in defence of estate have have opportunity to snatch few hour sleep be consequently in condition to again mount guard over prisoner then only then did jack carlos retire to room flinging still dressed upon bed sink at once into absolute oblivion two young men be aroused about nine o'clock night to partake of food when learned that don hermoso have taken over direction of affair also that be for most part doing well having be taken in hand by spanish surgeon who one of wounded have be brought in from field of battle having be attended to by mama faquita be now sufficiently recovered to be able to do duty be quite unexpected bit of good news for two young men there be bad news also for in fact that unfortunate senora montijo be in state of such high fever that spanish doctor be deeply concerned a to condition became still more critical a night wore on before again retiring to rest jack went round a expressed saw for that everything be satisfactory did same first thing upon rising next morning then don hermoso carlos held consultation a to how prisoner be to be disposed of difficulty of feeding controlling so large number being one be likely to grow daily be finally decided that a rest of army have by time passed on be scarcely likely to return over same ground sound prisoner together with of wounded who be so slightly hurt a to be able to travel must be set at liberty escorted for few mile on road to pinar del rio by strong band of armed negro whose duty must be to see that released men did not attempt to rejoin main army that a soon a be disposed of estate be practically destroyed therefore must not very well be further injured must be abandoned to spanish doctor such assistant a must persuade to remain with to look after wounded that a soon a senora health must permit don hermoso carlos jack must attach to one of guerrilla band who be hanging upon skirt of main spanish army harassing night day only difficulty in way of programme be question of what to do with senora be disposed of by suggestion from jack that lady must be conveyed to laguna de cortes where thetis be due to arrive in about fortnight be put on board yacht then jack undertook to see to release of unhurt prisoner with business incidental thereto a first step proceeded with band of fifty armed negro to captured camp forthwith went to work to bring in weapon ammunition uninjured field gun tent wagon of must be exceedingly valuable acquisition to revolutionary force might chance to join then horse mule cattle be driven in mule being harnessed to gun wagon capture having be stored a carefully a circumstance permitted prisoner who be to be released be paraded be served with one day ration then gladly moved off en route for pinar del rio under strong escort of armed negro led by jack who be on occasion mounted upon good horse be about four o'clock in afternoon when little army started marched until eight o'clock when camped for night in open jack band returning three mile along road by have gone passing night in wood through road ran arrived back at estate shortly after nine o'clock next morning jack then learned to profound sorrow that unfortunate senora montijo have passed away during night victim of spanish tyranny oppression buried poor lady on evening of day in particularly lovely peaceful spot distance up valley have be favourite resort of daughter ceremony be singularly moving impressive negro on place following body to grave don hermoso in absence of priest reading funeral service over departed wife although loss of lady be deeply felt by there can be little doubt that thing considered death be fortunate circumstance not only for herself also for who most dearly loved for be only too clear that reason have be permanently lost twenty four hour later what have be finest best kept tobacco growing estate on island be abandoned to spanish doctor patient with staff of volunteer assistant from unwounded spanish prisoner to look after montijos father son with jack a many of negro defender a still survived have taken to mountain carrying off with field gun maxim rifle ammunition store of description originally belonging to taken from enemy very formidable force soon proved to be about month later news came to band antonio maceo having evaded spanish army in province of pinar del rio got on other side of weyler trocha have be killed in skirmish not far from havana city have proposed to threaten with object of causing withdrawal of spanish troop from western end of island news proved to be true be very heavy blow to revolutionary who regarded antonio a far away most capable energetic leader soon afterward sustained further very serious loss in person of rius rivera who have arrived in pinar del rio to take place of maceo who in month of march be wounded in skirmish near san cristobal being afterwards captured deported be for about same time layas very prominent effective revolutionary leader be killed in fight in province of havana yet serious a misfortune be deemed to be did not discourage revolutionary on contrary spurred latter to more strenuous effort brief often fragmentary item of intelligence filtered through to from time to time concerning incessant harrying of spaniard by don hermoso active band of guerrilla be cheering a cordial to stimulating to emulative feat of daring enterprise rapidly reduced weyler to very verge of despair meanwhile course of event in cuba be being very keenly watched in united state be steadily increasing already dangerous tension have be gradually growing between country spain be further increased by occurrence of rius incident rius may be mentioned be cuban who like many other native of same island have resided in united state have deemed good policy to secure naturalisation paper a american after have returned to cuba spanish authority who may may not have have good reason suspected rius of being dangerous person arrested whereupon united state consul ever watchful of right of american citizen promptly demanded that man must be immediately brought to trial released if offence must be proved against machinery of diplomacy be sometimes apt to move trifle slowly ere have moved far enough to bring about satisfaction of consul demand be stated that rius have died suddenly in prison put general fitzhugh lee upon mettle very strongly suspected that there be more in man death than met eye insisted upon having body medically examined with result that rius be found to have be killed by blow on back of head while scratched by nail on back of chair in cell be found statement to effect that be certain prison authority be fully determined to murder ugly fact united state consul promptly reported to washington with result that american president immediately ordered to demand full investigation of circumstance promising to back up in demand with necessary support a result of spanish authority after interposing possible obstacle in way appointed commission of enquiry a clear proof be adduced that rius have actually be deliberately murdered incident be permitted to close there be little doubt however that be last drop in cup that from moment united state practically determined to intervene upon first legitimate opportunity unless indeed spain must be persuaded to grant to cuba something in nature of very liberal measure of self government to secure united state government approached madrid with certain proposal action combined with change in spanish ministry resulted in recall of general weyler appointment of general blanco a capitan general in stead general blanco arrived in cuba in month of november charged with task of pacifying cuban by policy of conciliation instead of policy of coercion so vigorously mercilessly pursued by predecessor conciliation a policy be adopted by spain altogether too late to save cuba to have be tried two year earlier pursued in good faith be more than likely that cuban a whole must have gladly welcomed that revolution must have subsided died out for want of support encouragement now island bore everywhere mark of weyler destroying hand once flourishing industry be gone inhabitant be ruined of who have be concentrated in fortified town be dying by thousand perishing of starvation a result of gross culpable mismanagement if not callous indifference cuban be firmly resolved never again to submit to government capable of such shocking abuse experience of last two year have convinced that have now to persevere must compel spain to evacuate island in course of year at utmost while now so incensed be united state with spain that intervention might come at moment therefore received general blanco conciliatory advance coldly so far from surrendering laying down arm pursued operation with even intensified energy meanwhile on january new constitution be one of spain conciliatory measure be proclaimed a in force colonial government be appointed with senor galvin a nominal leader possessed very little power since so long a spain persisted in retaining hold on cuba revolution continued question of governing island be necessarily military one then to add still further to difficulty of spain to bring tension between united state to practically breaking point came dupuy de lome lee incident first of arose out of letter written by senor dupuy de lome spanish minister at washington to friend senor canalejas who be then in cuba on visit in letter senor dupuy de lome be imprudent enough to express in very emphatic language doubt a to good faith of united state in attitude have taken up on cuban question not satisfied with signal act of imprudence writer must need indulge in certain very insulting remark respecting president mckinley letter be stolen from senor canalejas in havana sold to new york newspaper promptly published with natural result that de lome be compelled to resign post second lee incident be sequel to first be doubtless prompted by desire for revenge be nothing le than request by spain that general lee must be recalled from position a consul general for united state at havana upon ground that be persona non grata to spanish authority there needle to say request be not complied with then finally came maine incident last have origin in certain serious military riot occurred in havana on th th of january due to opposition of spaniard military civil to general blanco in character a pacificator pacification of island otherwise than by military operation being very unpopular with resident spaniard especially with army in consequence of riot in view of danger to american citizen arising out of disorderly state generally of city battleship maine be sent to havana by united state government arrived in havana harbour at eleven o'clock in forenoon of january be duly saluted by fort spanish ship of war whose salute a duly returned after under direction of port authority be moored in man o ' war anchorage nothing must even by most hypersensitive be construed into act of discourteous behaviour be shown to officer men of ship on contrary spaniard doubt shrewdly suspecting that eye of united state quickened by recent event to state of preternaturally acute perception be suspiciously watching action be at greatest pain to exhibit utmost courtesy not only official also non official to visitor to whom official resident alike extended most generous hospitality in return for several reception be held on board ship by captain sigsbee officer now happened that on february th fell on tuesday don hermoso montijo son carlos jack singleton completely worn out by many month of campaigning among mountain several sharp attack of fever having amalgamated considerably augmented band with of insurgent leader turned command over to succeeded in entering city of havana unrecognised made way on board thetis have then be for time lying idle in harbour with intention of recruiting health by running across atlantic for purpose of procuring further supply of arm ammunition continual accession to revolutionary rank caused to be most urgently needed be most enthusiastically welcomed by milsom who having heard nothing from of for more than three month be beginning very seriously to fear that like many others of revolutionary have be wiped out in one of countless skirmish be constantly occurring with spanish troop be delighted to learn that be to make run across atlantic back together within hour of arrival on board set to work upon necessary preparation for trip however explained must be scarcely possible to complete under couple of day in then disordered state of city with attendant disorganised business condition great a milsom pleasure at appearance undoubtedly be singleton soon became aware of certain subtle constraint uneasiness in friend manner toward a soon a have satisfied that really existed be not result of own imagination taxed friend with look here phil said there be something wrong somewhere can see by manner what be out with man will have to tell sooner later know so may a well let know what be at once have got into collision with authority roused suspicion in way what be may a well know first a last old man so get off mind so have noticed have responded milsom rather grimly well have guessed rightly jack there be something very seriously wrong though not in direction have suggested of course authority have suspicion very strong one too doubt about vessel must be fool if have not seeing length of time that have be hanging about in water suspicion may be can not posse atom of proof must have seized craft before now clapped hand of into prison be not that jack know what will say what will think of give word of honour that be not through carelessness on part well fact of matter be that submarine have be stolen submarine stolen echoed jack nonsense man surely can not mean by jove do then be fact answered milsom just exactly when went how went know more than do missed fortnight ago a know have be custom to keep about foot of water in boat concealed submarine to keep bottom tight a may also remember that water be changed once week namely saturday morning well fortnight ago last saturday when canvas cover be taken off boat in order to change water in be found to be empty submarine be gone who took by what mean became possible to steal without single soul being penny wiser can not tell believe will ever know for of course when came to question crew there be not man who be not willing to swear that have never closed eye for instant while keeping anchor watch though of course something of kind must have happened suspect custom house officer that authority have insisted on keeping aboard time that have be in harbour of course have not said word to about have however watched continually by smug look of satisfaction be inclined to believe that know something about ever since then have be on prowl everywhere to see if must find trace of boat without success well old chap said jack be exceedingly sorry to hear for in unscrupulous hand that submarine may work terrific amount of mischief everything connected with working of be so simple that ordinarily skilful mechanician must easily puzzle out with little study moreover if have fallen into hand of spaniard a suppose have will have difficulty in accounting for mysterious disablement of ship here on occasion of james b potter incident will make so watchful that henceforth will be able to do absolutely nothing blame phil must not be expected to know that fellow have somehow discovered existence of boat must be expected to watch night day loss be very serious misfortune of course be convinced that be not through carelessness of yours that happened thanks jack for saying answered milsom did not quite think must blame for can not help blaming to certain extent ought to have be more watchful yet how be one to know that existence of boat have be discovered be guarded night day in unobtrusive way be true in such fashion believed quite impossible for anyone to become aware of existence well be gone must manage henceforth a best can without unless can discover whereabouts recover possession of now to change subject what do propose to do with yourselves afternoon american be holding reception aboard maine suppose must care to go think not said jack must be rather too risky have come face to face with many spanish officer during time have be out with revolutionary if be perchance to run up against one of on board that ship might be awkward think that safest plan for don hermoso carlos will be to remain quietly aboard here now not attempt to leave yacht again so long a remains in cuban water upon opinion trio acted remaining below afternoon not venturing on deck at until after darkness have fallen dinner be over on board thetis three occupant of saloon with milsom have adjourned to top of deck house to smoke post prandial cigar enjoy welcome coolness of night air former be entertaining milsom by relating to few of recent adventure while operating against spanish troop when just a three bell half past nine o'clock be chiming out from ship in harbour violent concussion be felt by everybody on board yacht simultaneously ear be deafened by sound of terrific explosion for space of perhaps two three second following dead silence prevailed then from ship afloat street quay ashore there arose low murmur instantly changing to confused clamour of hurrying foot shouting voice expressive of utmost panic dismay became perfect uproar when a everybody involuntarily turned toward spot from explosion have seemed to proceed be seen that american warship maine be sinking rapidly by head while after part of be enveloped in flame a everybody stared in paralysed horror at terrible sight other explosion though of much le violent character be heard on board for second two astonishment dismay seemed to have robbed everybody of power of coherent thought action then milsom started to foot shouted in voice rang from end to end of ship out boat boat own crew more will want inch of room can spare for poor fellow who be struggling for life yonder hurry lad lively now second be worth man life remember for harbour swarm with shark ah here be macintyre come along with be there steam enough in steamboat boiler to move good then will try want two more hand will come jack carlos of course must in little more than minute from first explosion boat of thetis be tearing up water of harbour in mad race for honour of being first in noble work of rescue a went be joined by boat from other ship in harbour among be of spanish cruiser alphonso twelfth a well a large number put off from shore a boat went hither thither seeking for survivor finding remarkably few considering that complement of maine amounted to three hundred forty seven officer in one of spanish boat came dashing up with great show of authority announced that admiral manterolas order be that rescued american be to be put aboard alphonso twelfth where injured must receive attention accordingly a soon a boat of thetis have picked up must find pulled alongside spanish warship delivered over living in case terribly mutilated freight to officer crew eighty six men be rescued sixty of being wounded of number thetis boat be responsible for le than twenty nine of whom seventeen be wounded when at length having pulled about for nearly hour without finding more people to pick up milsom reluctantly gave word for boat to return to ship wreck rather portion of yet remained above water be still burning be perhaps rather peculiar circumstance upon return of boat from mission of rescue saloon party aboard thetis must almost immediately separate retire to respective cabin with nothing more in way of conversation than few curt question answer fact be that be powerfully impressed with conviction that have that night witnessed be in indirect way assisting at occurrence be destined to exercise important influence upon history of two great nation be true at moment occurrence presented appearance of lamentable accident everybody be by time fully aware of fact that trend of event have for time past be of such character a to cause america spain to regard other with utmost distrust to on part of spain be added feeling of aversion not very far removed from hatred at what regarded a high handed action of united state in reference to certain point of dispute between two country there be probably not one intelligent person in havana night who did not feel convinced that unless lamentable occurrence have just happened must prove capable of absolutely satisfactory explanation there must certainly be very serious trouble in immediate future a for jack milsom be thinking hard be well on toward daybreak ere of slept result of milsom meditation became apparent when a be custom joined saloon party at breakfast next morning after exchanging with usual salutation said a drew chair up to table well don hermoso after last night happening suppose will be disposed to defer departure until can be seen what be to come of will not upon word captain know answered don in what way do think likely to exercise influence upon projected errand through american intervention to put whole thing in nutshell answered milsom of course be altogether too early yet to express opinion in public upon occurrence strictly between ourselves in privacy of saloon mind saying that believe maine be deliberately destroyed that submarine be stolen from ship be instrument by be done be also idea skipper answered jack continued if suspicion a to guilt of spaniard must prove correct there will be war between america spain america will without doubt be conqueror spain will be forced to relinquish hold on cuba without need for further effort on part of revolutionary so far therefore a purchase of additional munition of war be concerned believe don hermoso that may save money indeed said don hermoso then in case gentleman may a well defer departure until see what be about to happen did rest of story be matter of well known history few day later court of enquiry into maine disaster be opened on board steamer mangrove then lying in havana harbour sat continuously until march st while wreck of warship be most carefully examined by diver who laid result of observation before court finding of court be that loss of maine be not in respect due to fault negligence on part of of officer member of crew that ship be destroyed by explosion of submarine mine caused partial explosion of two more of forward magazine that evidence have be obtainable fixing responsibility for destruction of maine upon person person last clause of finding notwithstanding there be probably not one united state citizen per hundred who did not feel morally convinced that spaniard be guilty party that being case war be from moment inevitable on april general lee united state consul general received order to leave cuba hand over charge of united state interest to british consul on following day with such american citizen a still remained in havana left for florida in gunboat on april th conference between committee of two american house resulted in adoption of certain resolution be signed by president mckinley on th of same month copy be served upon senor polo y bernabe spanish minister at washington who immediately asked for passport left city on april president of united state proclaimed blockade of cuban coast from cienfuegos westward to cape san antonio thence north east past havana to cardenas a bulk of american fleet have be quietly concentrating at key west from date of destruction of maine blockade be put into effect within eight hour of declaration on april th spanish government formally recognised existence of war between united state on following day united state congress passed following bill without division be enacted by senate house of representative of united state in congress assembled first that war be same be hereby declared to exist war have existed since st day of april ad including said day between united state of america kingdom of spain second that president of united state be hereby be directed empowered to use entire land naval force of united state to call into actual service of united state militia of several state to such extent a may be necessary to carry act into effect be not story of spanish american war let suffice therefore to say that after landing of fifth army corp on island of cuba on june th destruction of spanish squadron under admiral cervera on july rd protocol be signed on august th hostility be suspended finally on january relinquishment of spanish sovereignty over cuba be formally accomplished spanish flag being lowered star stripe temporarily hoisted in place on various fort other government building throughout island singularly pathetic feature of spanish evacuation of cuba be solemn removal of alleged remains of christopher columbus from resting place in havana cathedral conveyance to spain state of island by time that war be ended be of course dreadful beyond description inhabitant be with few exception reduced to state of absolute destitution agriculture have practically ceased commerce industry be dead brigandage be rampant to use expressive language of historian human misery have apparently reached maximum possibility under such circumstance be not at difficult for jack to secure very large estate adjoining that of senor montijo upon exceptionally favourable term although like of friend estate consisted of soil now overrun with weed riotous vegetation of tropic labour be abundant jack friend don hermoso spending money freely soon have trace of late troublous time swept away fresh crop planted don hermoso did not long survive triumph of cause have so nobly espoused with coming of peace there came also time for memory retrospection time for to miss dear one torn from during struggle shortly after completion of great work of restoring estate to original prosperous well managed condition passed quietly away not a result of disease in particular apparently because now no longer have anything to live for be laid to rest beside wife a for jack felt that after what have seen of done in cuba be simply impossible for to turn back upon island therefore disposed of interest in firm of singleton murdock company invested proceeds in further extension development of already large estate to day carlos montijo be two of most popular respected prosperous tobacco planter in island thetis still in existence be now joint property of jack carlos in one other often of together make frequent trip to england elsewhere for purpose of personally conducting more extensive business transaction be still commanded by ex lieutenant milsom rn who never tire of congratulating that at last find in possession of what have appearance of being permanently soft job
