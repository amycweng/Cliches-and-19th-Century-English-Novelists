stifling atmosphere of midshipman berth be very dark for be only just past date of new moon thin silver sickle be that coy orb then showed of have set hour before moreover there be thin veil of mist sea fog hanging upon surface of water through only few of brighter star must be faintly distinguished near zenith there be wind have fallen calm night before about sunset be in horse latitude frigate be rolling uneasily upon short steep swell have come creeping up out from north east during middle watch precursor a hoped of north east trade for be in very heart of north atlantic bound to west indie duly received anathema of shipmate keene at tardy appearance on deck hurled properly spirited retort after down hatchway then made way up poop ladder to tramp out watch on lee side of deck if there can be such thing a lee side when there be wind be dreary work tramping fore aft fore aft with nothing to engage attention nothing to do therefore eagerly watched for hailed with delight first faint pallid brightening of eastern sky heralded dawn for with daylight there must at least be ship toilet to make deck to holystone scrub brasswork gun to clean polish paintwork to wash sheet brace to flemish coil mayhap something to see a well a possibility with rising of sun might get small slant of wind to push few mile nearer to region where trade wind be merrily blowing dawn came slowly perhaps merely seemed to impatience to do so with daylight mist have hung about ship night thickened into genuine unmistakable fog so thick that when standing by break of poop be impossible to see a far a jib boom end fog made mr hennesey second lieutenant officer of watch uneasy a well might for be in early spring of year great britain be at war with france spain holland at time three most formidable naval power in world next to ourselves chance be that second ship might meet must be enemy at length just a seven bell be being struck turned to said mr courtenay have good eye just jump up on to main royal yard will take look round fog pack close believe reach a high a masthead feel curious to know whether anything have drifted within sight of during night touched hat forthwith made way into main rigging glad of even journey aloft to break dismal monotony of blind grey stirless morning in due time swung up on to slender yard sail of have be clewed up not furled ala worthy second luff be mistaken for once in life be whit a thick up there a be down on deck not thing must see fore mizzenmast with intricacy of standing running rigging tapering yard broad space of wet drooping canvas hanging limp looming spectrally through ghostly mist wreath be about to hail deck report failure of experimental journey be checked in very act by feeling something like faint stir in damp heavy air about moment dim yellow smudge became visible on port beam presently recognised a newly risen sun struggling to pierce with beam ponderous mass of white vapour be now slowly working a though stirred by subtle agency by imperceptible degree pallid vision of sun brightened strengthened presently became conscious of faint distinct movement of air from off port quarter to cloth of sail against foot dangled responded with gentle rustling movement on deck there shouted be still a thick a hedge up here sir seems inclined to clear believe be going to have breeze out from north east presently so much better answered second luff ignoring first half of communication stay where be little longer if please mr courtenay ay ay sir answered settling more comfortably upon yard while word be still upon lip stagnant air about once more stirred great space of canvas beneath swelled sluggishly out with small pattering of reef point from three topsail gentle creak of truss parrel a strain of filling canvas came upon yard saw brightening disc of sun begin to sweep round until bore broad upon larboard quarter then sharp word of command from poop in mr hennesey well known tone dulcet a of bullfrog with bad cold came floating up to followed by shrill note of boatswain pipe hoarse bellow of hand make sail few minute of orderly confusion down on deck on yard below now ensued when ceased althea be running square away before languid slowly strengthening breeze with studding sail set on side meanwhile log be gradually clearing for be now possible to see to distance of fully three length of ship on hand before curling sweeping wreath of vapour shut out tiny dancing ripple seemed to be merrily racing ship to port starboard occasionally break clear space in fog bank swept down upon overtook when must be possible to see for distance of quarter of mile for few second then must thicken again be a blinding a ever break came be wider than one preceded showing that windward edge of bank be rapidly drawing down after a break occurred indifferently on side of sometimes on side at once with now then clear space right astern to give spice of variety to proceeding eye a may be guessed be kept pretty busy at length opening very considerably wider than have thus far reached came sweeping down upon starboard quarter a peered into endeavouring to pierce veil of fog formed farther extremity suddenly became aware of vague shape indistinctly perceptible through intervening wreath of mist be now sweeping rapidly along before steadily freshening breeze saw during wink of eyelid when be shut in again knew at once what be must be one thing ship forthwith hailed on deck there there be strange sail about mile distant sir broad on starboard quarter thank mr courtenay promptly responded second what do make out to be be impossible at present to say anything definite about sir answered saw for second then only very indistinctly loomed up through fog like craft of about own size very well sir answered hennesey stay where be keep sharp lookout for next appearance once more returned stereotyped ay ay sir a sent glance searching round ship for further opening next overtook swept down upon port quarter be fully mile half wide when bore about four point abaft beam shape slid into not vague shadowy time a other shape have be clearly distinct frigate unmistakably under similar spread of canvas to own a nearly a possible own size so close indeed be resemblance that for second two be disposed to fancy that by strange trick of light reflection fog be treating to picture of old althea more steadfast scrutiny soon dispelled illusion there be certain unmistakable point of difference between second apparition ourselves of be so strongly characteristic that at once set down a french frigate plot be thickening be not wholly without certain feeling of exhilaration again hailed deck frigate broad on port quarter sir with very frenchified look about thank again mr courtenay answered hennesey with unmistakable ring of delight in jovial irish accent by way have trick of growing more pronounced under influence of excitement ah true for there be continued have mr hudson have kindness to jump below fetch glass will ye look alive shmall anatomy gentle ripple of subdued laughter from forecastle at sally of genial second floated up to from forecastle glimpse of must just catch under foot of fore topsail must see that men be alive down there with pleasurable excitement at prospect of possible fight young hudson smart little fellow barely fourteen year old most juvenile member of mess be soon on deck again with second lieutenant telescope by time fog have shut stranger in again so for moment friend hennesey curiosity have to remain unsatisfied not for long however presumably french frigate have not be lost sight of more than two three minute when caught second glimpse of other craft one first sighted on starboard quarter there be other fellow sir shouted can see distinctly now too be frigate french unless be greatly mistaken by power mr courtenay hope may be right answered hennesey ay there be continued a plain a mud in wineglass if be french look belie mr hudson spalpeen slip down below tell captain that there be brace of suspicious looking craft within mile of ye may call upon misther dawson impart same pleasant information to then turning beaming phiz up to continued courtenay be on stroke of eight bell same 'd better stay where be for present until fog clear since know exactly bearing of two craft will thank ye to keep weather eye liftin ' young gentleman there may be whole fleet of frenchman within gun shot of for that can tell ay ay sir cheerfully answered curiosity having by time got better of keen appetite for breakfast moreover having be discoverer of two sail already sighted be anxious to add to prestige thus gained by being first to sight other craft might happen to be in neighbourhood stay aloft however be not destined to be long one for fog be now clearing fast within ten minute have driven away to leeward of revealing fact that there be two sail already discovered in sight unless there might happen to be others so far ahead a to be still hidden in fog bank to leeward before left royal yard have succeeded in satisfying by mean of glass have be sent up to bent on to signal halliard that two stranger be frigate almost certainly french be exchanging signal at great rate must make nothing of flag at least proved that be not british to make assurance doubly sure however have hoisted private signal to ship have be able to reply there be doubt that be enemy fact having be satisfactorily established be permitted to descend snatch hasty breakfast hasty one be for have scarcely be below five minute when be piped to clear for action be obliged to hurry on deck again hungry midshipman can achieve good deal in eating line in five minute in brief interval contrived to stow away enough food to take keen edge off appetite promising must make up leeway at dinner time provided that be still alive when hour for meal came round last thought sobered down somewhat to certain extent subdued hilarious spirit rose again a upon gaining deck looked round saw cheerful yet resolute face of captain officer noted gaiety with men went about duty stranger have by time shown bunting tricolour so there be further question of nationality of fact that be booked for sharp fight for have heel of be overhauling in grand style must not therefore have escaped have be ever so anxious to do so have made attempt must certainly have be quite justified for have now be ascertained that be forty gun ship while mounted only thirty six piece on gun deck escape however be apparently very last thought likely to occur to captain harrison for although kept studding sail abroad while ship be being prepared for action sooner have first lieutenant reported everything ready than order be given to shorten sail pretty sight be to see how smartly with what beautifully perfect precision everything be done at once studding sail collapsing coming in together at exactly same moment that three royal be clewed up flight of staysail on main mizzen mast hauled down very prettily done mr dawson said skipper approvingly friend yonder will see that have seaman to deal with at event even though can not sport such clean pair of heel a own two frenchman be by time within le than mile of converging upon in manner a to range up alongside althea within toss of biscuit on hand of manifested slightest disposition to follow example by shortening sail perhaps believed that be to do so must at once make sail again endeavour to escape whereas by holding on to everything until drew up alongside must fall easy prey to superior strength if indeed did not surrender at discretion truly two ship formed noble graceful picture a came sweeping rapidly down upon with stitch of canvas set that must possibly spread white sail towering spire like into deep tender blue of cloudless heaven with delicate purple shadow chasing other athwart rounded bosom of a hull up bore swung pendulum like with little curl of snow under bow over low hillock of swell chased sparkling in brilliant sunlight like heaving floor of sapphire strewed broadcast with diamond stood on silent a grave until craft on larboard quarter be leading by about couple of length have reached to within short quarter of mile of when a stood watching intently jet of flame followed by heavy burst of white smoke leapt out from starboard bow port next instant shot went humming close past to dash up water in fountain like jet quarter of mile ahead of take be polite request to to heave to haul down colour remarked captain harrison to first lieutenant with smile well may a well return compliment mr dawson try shot at of with stern chaser if must only manage to knock away important spar on board of might so cripple a to cause to drop astern leaving to deal with other one settle business out of hand yes aim at spar mr dawson must perhaps have be better have opened fire directly be within range be anxious not to make mistake now that have fired upon however need hesitate no longer order be accordingly given to open fire with stern chaser in le than minute two gun spoke out simultaneously jarring old hooker to keel be unable for moment to see effect of shot for smoke blew in over taffrail completely hiding two pursuer for few second when cleared away cheer broke from men who be manning after gun for be seen that flying jib stay of antagonist on port quarter be cut sail towing from jib boom end neat hole in port foretopmast studding sail showing where shot have passed other gun have be le successful shot having passed through head of second frigate foresail about four foot below yard half way between sling starboard yardarm without inflicting further perceptible damage very well meant let try again exclaimed skipper approvingly a word issued from lip saw two pursuing frigate yaw broadly outward a if by common consent next instant let drive whole broadside at waited breathlessly while one might have counted one two then sound of ominous crashing aloft told that be wounded somewhere among spar block followed by shower of splinter came hurtling down on deck breaking arm of man at aftermost quarter deck gun on port side then louder crash aloft caused to look up just in time to see mizzen topmast go sweeping forward into hollow of maintopsail split from head to foot mizzen topgallant mast snapping short off at cap a swooped down upon maintopsail yard two topmen be swept out of maintop by wreckage in descent terribly one of fatally injured there be few minor damage however be quickly repaired then a hand sprang aloft to clear away wreck stern chaser spoke out again one close after other two new hole in enemy canvas testified to excellent aim of gunner unfortunately be extent of damage shot having passed very close to just missed important spar french displayed very creditable smartness in getting inboard flying jib that have cut away for by time that be accomplished have drawn up so close to that by bearing away point two to port starboard respectively craft be enabled to bring whole broadside to bear upon immediately did taking in studding sail otherwise reducing canvas at same time until be three under exactly same amount of sail excepting of course that have lost mizzen topsail with above while theirs still stood intact a for gun be all trained a far aft a port hole must permit a antagonist ranged up on quarter within pistol shot gun be fired point blank a be brought to bear now fight began in real grim downright earnest crew of gun loading firing a rapidly a possible while french poured in broadside with coolness precision extorted warmest admiration despite disagreeable fact that be playing havoc with fore aft one of gun having be dismounted within three minute of arrival of enemy alongside while tale of killed wounded be growing heavier with broadside that received if be suffering severely be paying punishment back with interest a must see by glancing at hull of antagonist side of be torn splintered pierced along broad white streak marked line of port of be knocked two into one while yellow side be here there broadly streaked with crimson a blood drained away through scupper be true be fighting two to one after advantage be more apparent than real for running level with a be must only fight one of battery while be fighting ours gun one of double shotted be being better more rapidly served than theirs will not attempt to describe fight in detail for indeed such attempt must only result in failure a matter of fact there be very little to describe simply ran dead away to leeward three of fighting almost yardarm to yardarm exchanging broadside a rapidly a gun must be loaded run out after first ten minute of fight there be little nothing to be seen for wind be fast dropping again three ship be wrapped in dense white pall of smoke effectually concealed everything be going on at greater distance than fifty foot from observer most impressive characteristic of struggle be noise incessant crash of gun discharge of set up continuous tremor of ship throughout entire fabric of rending splintering of timber a enemy shot tore way through frigate side shriek groan of wounded dying cut into at frequent interval by sharp order from captain first lieutenant curt command of captain of gun stop vent run in sponge load run out so on creak of tackle block rumble of gun carriage clatter of handspike dull thud of rammer driving home shot rattling volley of musketry from marine on poop occasional rending crash of falling spar terrific babble of frenchman on side of sounding high clear in occasional brief interval when gun happened to be silent together for moment can only compare to horrible confusion raging through disordered imagination of one in clutch of fiercely burning fever people fought grimly in silence save for occasional cheer at unusually successful shot frenchman jabbered away incessantly sometimes reviling shaking fist at through open port more often squabbling among at length when fight have lasted about hour wind dropped to dead calm frenchman on starboard side who have forged somewhat ahead of made effort to lay athwart bow before lost way altogether be too quick for for mainmast be towing alongside stopped way so did with what tried to do to driving square athwart bow a bowsprit came thrusting in between fore main mast when lost not moment in lashing spar to main rigging after resolved into tit for tat for other fellow put helm hard aport just managed to drive square athwart stern where raked most unmercifully for fully five minute until drove clear bringing down three of mast before left of course must only retaliate upon with stern chaser played upon with considerable effect what lacked in way of adequate retort to amply made up for to consort raking time after time with such good will in few minute bow be battered into mere mass of torn splintered timber somebody on board cried out that have struck a marine kept up fire upon from poop while main deck gun continued to blaze away whenever swung sufficiently for of to bear notice be taken of intimation presently skipper gave order to cut adrift so that people might have chance to board proceeding must have proved exceedingly awkward for in then weakened condition presently became evident that have thought of boarding on contrary chief anxiety be clearly to escape from warm berth that have thrust into for few minute later fire on side having slackened somewhat observed that craft have boat in water be doing best to tow off from almost immediately afterwards french ceased firing altogether believe skipper fire eater though be felt unfeignedly thankful at cessation of hostility for immediately followed suit giving order for men to leave gun proceed to repair damage be light task for not only be completely dismasted hull of ship be terribly knocked about carpenter reporting five foot of water in hold twenty seven shot hole between wind water apart from other damage be sufficiently serious moreover butcher bill be appallingly heavy list totalling up to le than thirty eight killed one hundred six wounded out of total of two hundred eighty chapter two althea founder french having ceased firing manifesting unmistakable anxiety to withdraw from proximity bestowed little further attention on for quickly became clear to that own condition be quite sufficiently serious to tax energy to utmost first task demanding attention of carpenter mate be of course stoppage of leak very difficult task indeed proved to be owing to rapidity with water be rising in hold by manning pump however employing entire available remainder of crew in baling succeeded in plugging shot hole clearing hold of water by noon when men be knocked off to go to well earned dinner then indeed found time to look around to ask other where french be what be doing there be difficulty in furnishing reply to question for antagonist be only bare four mile off close together bad a own plight be be very much worse for now saw that frigate have raked so unmercifully be in sinking condition having settled so low in water indeed that sill of main deck port be awash dipping with sluggish heave of upon low almost imperceptible swell while own boat of consort be busily engaged in taking off crew with aid of telescope must distinctly see be going on saw also that end of gallant craft be so near a to render disappearance matter of few minute hungry therefore a be determined to remain on deck see last of have long to wait have scarcely arrived at decision must do so when a watched through glass saw boat hung around shoving off hurriedly one after other until one only remained presently that one also shoved off loaded down to gunwale pulled a hastily a overloaded condition must permit toward other frigate have scarcely placed dozen fathom between herself sinking ship before latter rolled heavily to port slowly recovered then rolled still more heavily to starboard completely burying whole tier of starboard port a did so hung thus for perhaps minute settling visibly time finally staggered a be once more to even keel with stern dipping deeper deeper second until taffrail be buried while battered bow lifted slowly into air when inclination of deck rapidly growing steeper suddenly took sternward plunge vanished from sight in midst of sudden swirl of water be distinctly visible through lens of telescope occupant of boat have so recently left saw danger put forth herculean effort to avoid be too near however to escape despite exertion boat be caught dragged back into vortex created by sinking ship into too disappeared few second afterwards saw head popping up above water again here there while couple of boat have just discharged cargo of passenger dashed away to rescue be soon paddling hither thither among little black spot kept popping into view round waited until have seemingly be picked up then went below to secure what dinner might be remaining for when after hurried meal again went on deck horizon away to northward eastward be darkening to light air from quarter came gently stealing along glassy surface of ocean first in cat paw then a gentle breathing caused polished undulation to break into tremor of laughing ripple finally into light breeze before surviving french frigate bore up with squared yard leaving unmolested meanwhile crew having dined turned to again for busy afternoon work consisted chiefly in clearing away wreck of fallen spar saving a many of a much of canvas running gear a must be likely to be of use to in fitting ship with jury rig so well did men work that by sunset be enabled to cut adrift from wreck of lower mast to bear up in wake of frenchman who by time have run out of sight in south western quarter tired a men be there be rest for night for be felt to be imperatively necessary to get ship under canvas again without moment delay moreover despite fact that shot hole have be plugged be found that battered hull be still leaking so seriously a to necessitate quarter of hour spell at pump two hour hand be therefore kept at work watch watch through night with result that when day broke next morning have pair of sheers rigged on end ready to rear into position spar have be prepared fitted a lower mast end of day found once more under sail after fashion heading on course to southward westward for following two day went well with save that ship continued to make water so freely a to necessitate use of pump at middle end of watch fair breeze driving along under jury canvas at rate of five to six knot per hour toward evening however on second day sign of change of weather began to manifest sky to windward losing rich tint of blue becoming pallid hard streaked with mare tail flecked with small smoky looking swift flying cloud while setting sun a neared horizon lost radiance became mere shapeless blotch of angry red that finally seemed to dissolve disappear in broad bank of slate hued vapour sea too changed colour from clear steel blue that have hitherto worn to hue of indigo smirched with black moreover heard captain remark to mr dawson that mercury be falling that feared be in for dirty night indeed so seemed for about middle of second dog watch wind lulled perceptibly have sharp rain squall soon after breezed up again wind coming first of in gust then in strong breeze a night wore on steadily increased until be blowing gale with indication of worse to come sea too rose rapidly came rushing down upon starboard quarter high steep foam crested causing frigate to roll tumble about most unpleasantly under jury rig short canvas altogether prospect for night be so exceedingly unpromising that must plead guilty to having experienced selfish joy at reflection that be eight hour in when went on deck at midnight night found that wind have increased to whole gale with very high confused sea running over poor maimed althea be wallowing along at speed of about eight half knot with dismal groaning of timber harmonised lugubriously with clank of chain pump swash of water washing nearly knee deep about deck for hooker laboured so heavily that be leaking like basket necessitating unremitting use of pump throughout watch worst of keene whispered to that even with pump going constantly water be slowly distinctly gaining thus continued through middle watch be hoped that gale must not be of long duration at eight bell next morning news be that mercury be still falling while wind instead of evincing disposition to moderate blew harder than ever oh what dreary outlook be when swathed in oilskin passed through hatchway stepped out on deck sky be entirely veiled by unbroken mass of dark purplish slate coloured cloud be almost black in deeper shadow with long tattered streamer of dirty whitish vapour scurrying wildly athwart heavy leaden hued white crested foam flecked sea be running in midst of picture be poor crippled frigate rolling labouring staggering onward like wounded sea bird under jury spar spray darkened canvas with miniature ocean washing hither thither athwart heaving deck crowd of panting straining half naked men clustering about pump while others be a busily employed in passing bucket up down through hatchway whole set to dismal harmony of howling wind hissing spray wearisome incessant wash of water groaning complaining sound of labouring hull skipper first luff be pacing weather side of poop together in earnest converse at turn in walk paused for instant a by mutual consent to cast look of anxious inquiry to windward presently saw carpenter coming along deck with sounding rod in hand intercepted just by foot of poop ladder remarked well chip what be best news have to tell best news echoed chip with solemn shake of head there ai no best mr courtenay be worst sir there be over four foot of water in hold now be gainin ' on at rate of five inch hour if here gale break pretty quick wo answer for consequence up went to make report to skipper be bad news indeed especially for unfortunate men who be compelled by dire necessity to toil unceasingly at back breaking labour of working pump felt apprehension a to ultimate safety five inch of water per hour be formidable gain for leak to make in spite of pumping baling must be accomplished yet must take so many hour at rate to reduce frigate to water logged condition ere arrival of moment gale must certainly blow out labouring straining of ship must cease leak must be got under control again must be well when at noon day gale showing symptom whatever of abatement captain gave order for upper deck gun to be launched overboard began to realise condition be such a might easily become critical when about hour before sunset order be given to throw main deck gun overboard became borne in upon that matter be becoming mighty serious with with approach of night gale seemed rather to increase in strength than otherwise while sea be certainly considerably heavier worst of be that there be indication of approaching change for better a for poor althea certainly did not labour quite so heavily now that be relieved of weight of gun water in hold still gained steadily upon pump more experienced hand among be beginning to hint at possibility of being compelled to leave take to boat hint received something of confirmation when shortly after commencement of first watch carpenter mate be seen going round of boat examining into condition with aid of lantern nevertheless despite omen men stuck resolutely to pump baling through night captain first lieutenant animating encouraging by presence throughout long dismal dreary hour of darkness about three bell in morning watch welcome news spread throughout ship that mercury have at length begun to rise again with approach of dawn became apparent that gale be breaking sky to windward gave sign of clearing hope once more sprang up within breast men although still willing even eager to continue heart breaking work of pumping baling be by time utterly worn out water in hold steadily relentlessly gained upon despite most desperate effort by arrival of breakfast time have become perfectly apparent to everybody that poor old althea be doomed ship if however there be doubt a to in mind of of be quickly dispelled for after breakfast order be passed to knock off baling men thus relieved be at once set to work under first second lieutenant one party to prepare sea anchor other to attend to provisioning of boat get ready for launching be attached to first lieutenant party that undertook preparation of sea anchor a idea impressed a being rather ingenious will describe for benefit of who may feel interested in such matter prefacing description with explanation that in consequence of springing up of gale so soon after action with frenchman jury rig be of very primitive incomplete character such a must enable to run fairly well before wind not such a must permit of lying to hence need for sea anchor now that necessity have arisen for to launch boat in heavy weather sea anchor be offspring of first lieutenant inventiveness consisted of old fore topsail bent to couple of boom of suitable length stoutness head of sail be bent to one of boom with seizing in much same manner a must have be bent to topsail yard while clew be securely lashed to extremity of other boom then to boom represented topsail yard be attached crow foot made of two span of stout hawser having eye in centre of to to bend cable lower boom be well weighted by attachment to of number of pig of iron ballast a well a stream anchor after starboard cable be paid out passed along aft outside fore rigging end being then brought inboard bent on to crow foot whole be then made up a compactly a possible with lashing after by mean of tackle aloft be hoisted clear of bulwark lowered down over side lashing be then cut sail dropped into water opening out a did so when lower boom sinking with weight attached to broad surface be exposed acting a very efficient sea anchor at moment when everything be ready to let go ship helm be put hard over bringing broad side on to sea when a drove away to leeward brought strain upon cable that at once fetched up head to wind part of process having be successfully accomplished be easy matter to bend spring on to cable heave ship round broadside on to sea once more in position afforded excellent lee under shelter of to launch boat for contrivance must have inevitably be swamped by time that be done boat be ready for launching captain gave order for to be at once proceeded with beginning with launch being heaviest boat in ship most difficult to get into water felt exceedingly doubtful a to ability of jury spar to support weight of so heavy craft by staying well delicate task be at length successfully accomplished when worst case among wounded be brought on deck carefully lowered over side into boat beneath doctor with instrument medicine chest being already there to receive a soon a have received complement launch be veered away to leeward at end of long line still under shelter of ship hull to make room for first cutter rest of boat followed in succession men preserving to very last moment most admirable order discipline until only captain gig of be placed in command remained proper complement of boat be six men in addition to coxswain in order that wounded who be placed in launch first second cutter might be a little crowded a possible remainder of boat received rather more than full complement in consequence of crew numbered ten told instead of seven be last boat to leave ship skipper having gone below to cabin for purpose at last minute assure that bustle excitement of getting men out of ship being now over found rather nervous trying work to stand there in gangway waiting for reappearance of captain on deck for ship be by time in sinking condition liable to go down under foot at moment having settled so low in water that rolled closed main deck port completely under with sickly lurch of upon still heavy sea be now continuously breaking over while water must be distinctly heard washing about down below at length skipper came out of cabin bearing in hand large japanned tin box jump down mr courtenay stand by to take box from cried down side went needing second bidding box be carefully passed down to stowed away in stern sheet when have done so looked up at ship captain harrison be standing in gangway with hat in hand looking wistfully sorrowfully along deserted deck aloft at jury spar that with rigging so pathetically expressed idea of mortally wounded creature gallantly hopelessly struggling against death be inexorably drawing near such fancy perhaps suggested to for distinctly saw dash hand across eye more than once at length turned descended side ladder watching opportunity sprang lightly into boat shove off mr courtenay ordered a wrapped in boat cloak shove off reiterated in turn forthwith away went men nothing loath a must clearly see for ship be now liable to founder at moment indeed wonder to be that remained afloat so long for have by time sunk so deep that channel be completely buried only showing when rolled heavily away from poor old barkie what desolate forlorn object looked a pulled away from with little more than bulwark showing above water with sea making clean breach over bow continually a rolled plunged with sickening sluggishness to great ridge of steel grey water incessantly swooped down upon into bow pinned down by weight of water within hull occasionally bored a though tired of hopeless struggle for existence have at length summoned resolution to take final plunge so end again again thought be gone again yet again emerged wearily heavily out of deluge of water sought to overwhelm at length unusually heavy sea caught with bow pinned down after plunge into trough clear green unbroken brimmed to figure head poured in foaming cataract over bow sweeping whole length of from stem to stern until hull be completely buried a wave left be seen that bow be still submerged moment later became apparent that end have come be taking final plunge there go shouted one of men a fellow uttered word captain rose to foot in stern sheet doffed hat a though have be standing beside grave of dear friend watching dear old barkie a with stern gradually rising high slid slowly solemnly out of sight occupant of boat giving parting cheer a vanished captain stood motionless until swirl marked grave have disappeared then replaced hat resumed seat remarked give way men mr courtenay be good enough to put aboard launch if please chapter three gig be caught in hurricane upon reaching launch captain first care be to satisfy a to well being comfort of poor wounded fellow aboard doctor have already attended to matter with result that be a comfortable a utmost care forethought must render master meanwhile have be ascertaining exact latitude longitude of spot where frigate have gone down now communicated result of calculation to captain who thereupon gave order for boat to steer southwest on speed trial for day leading boat to heave to at sunset wait for rest to close have not remotest notion a to meaning of somewhat singular order obvious duty be to execute so forthwith made sail upon gig very few minute sufficed to demonstrate that be fastest boat of whole squadron be at surprising for gig be not ordinary service boat be captain own private property having be built to order from own design with special view to development of exceptional sailing power boat sailing being hobby with be splendid craft of kind measuring thirty foot in length with beam of six foot pulled six oar be most beautiful model of whale boat type double ended with unusual amount of sheer fore aft gave fine bold buoyant bow stern moreover be covered in with light turtle back deck that forward measuring six foot in length while after turtle back measured five foot from stern post be fitted with keel nine inch deep amidships tapering off to four inch deep at end be rigged a schooner with standing fore main lug small jib with ordinary crew on board sitting to windward required ballast even in fresh breeze small wonder therefore be that having boat under have run rest of fleet out of sight by midday wind still blowing strong although be moderating rapidly first lieutenant be like captain fond of inventing designing thing speciality took form of log for

althea unhesitatingly allowed hand to turn in a best must in bottom of boat undertaking to keep lookout until other boat have joined company first boat to make appearance be service gig in charge of mr flower third lieutenant ranged up alongside hove to about two hour after sunset soon afterwards following example by throwing out sea anchor then came first second cutter in command of first second lieutenant first cutter arriving about hour after mr flower while second cutter appeared about quarter of hour later launch followed about hour astern of second cutter be not to be wondered at former being rather deep owing to very generous supply of water that doctor have insisted on carrying for comfort of wounded then three quarter of hour later came jolly boat in charge of boatswain finally dinghy carrying four hand in charge of friend fellow mid jack keene turned up close upon midnight long ere however have in succession spoken launch reporting distance that have traversed up to sunset with data thus supplied master have gone to work upon calculation formed basis of sort of table showing ratio of speed of several boat with aid of officer in charge of boat must estimate with moderate degree of accuracy position of of other boat at given moment so long be to say a wind held fair enough to allow boat to steer given course copy of table be then furnished to officer in command of boat after captain ordered mr flower to make best of way to barbadoes with instruction to report loss of frigate immediately upon arrival with request to senior naval officer that craft of sort might be forthwith despatched in search of other boat similar instruction be next given to except port of destination be bermuda of course carried written a well a verbal message to senior naval officer of port to be bound equally of course be impressed upon that if happened to encounter friendly craft en route must induce to undertake search must be so much better having received instruction taken young lindsay out of launch be trifle over crowded at once made sail parted company occupant of other boat giving encouragement of farewell cheer a did so also making sail at same time on west south westerly course must afford about even chance of being picked up by craft either from bermuda barbadoes while in event of being found by stood very good chance of hitting off one of leeward island for remainder of night sped gaily onward with wind about two point free making splendid progress although be bound to admit that with height of sea strength of wind still prevailed there be moment when task of sailing boat became exciting enough to satisfy craving of even most exacting individual lindsay relieved other at tiller watch watch with one hand forward to keep lookout ahead to leeward rest of poor fellow being so thoroughly worn out by long spell at pump rest sleep be even more imperative necessity for than be for by time of sunrise wind have dwindled away to topgallant breeze with corresponding reduction in amount of sea be therefore enabled to shake out double reef that have thus far be compelled to carry in canvas while aspect of sky be more promising than have be for several day past weather be now a favourable a must possibly wish wind being just fresh enough to send along at top speed gunwale to under whole canvas while sea be going down rapidly a day wore on improvement in weather progressed just little too far became even finer than wished wind continuing to drop steadily until by noon be sliding over long mountainous swell at speed of barely four knot with hot sun beating down upon far too ardently to be pleasant needle to say kept sharp lookout for sail through day saw nothing flying fish sparkled out from ridge of swell went skimming away to port starboard gleaming a brilliantly in strong sunlight a handful of new silver dollar being only object to break solitude environed by sunset day wind have died completely out leaving ocean vast surface of slow moving glassy undulation be reluctantly compelled to order canvas to be taken in mast to be struck oar to be thrown out then indeed a night closed down upon star came winking one by one out of immeasurable expanse of darkening blue above silence of vast ocean solitude hemmed in became thing might be felt so oppressive be that a by instinct conversation gradually dwindled to desultory exchange of few whispered remark uttered at lengthening interval until died out altogether while profound stillness of air ocean seemed to become accentuated rather than broken by measured roll of oar in rowlock tinkling lap of water under bow along bend of boat pulled four oar only instead of six in order that might have two relay watch who relieved other four hour men pulled long steady easy stroke of sort enabled to keep on throughout watch without undue fatigue by taking five minute spell of rest about once hour be weary work for poor fellow after progress soon became provokingly slow about three bell in middle watch night a half sat half reclined in stern sheet drowsily steering by star occasionally glancing over shoulder at ruddy glowing sickle of rising moon then in last quarter be suddenly startled by sound of loud deep drawn sigh came to from somewhere off larboard bow apparently at great distance from boat while sat wondering listening with poised oar sound be repeated close aboard of time on starboard quarter accompanied by soft washing of water turning sharply beheld right in shimmering golden wake of moon huge black shapeless gleaming bulk noiselessly upheave out of black water slowly glide up abreast of until be alongside within reach of oar whale whispered one of men in tone be trifle unsteady from startling surprise of creature sudden appearance ay replied

indeed that unless be trick of imagination felt slight tremor thrill through boat a though have touched involuntarily glanced over side be perhaps well that did so for there right underneath boat far down in black depth perceived small faint glimmering patch of phosphorescence that a looked grew larger more distinct until in course of very few second assumed shape of monster rising plumb underneath back water men back water for life there be one of coming up right under keel cried at word men dashed oar into water backed out of way just in time to avoid being hove out of water

situation for for although creature appeared perfectly quiet well disposed there be knowing at what moment one of might gather way run down intentionally inadvertently while there be also chance that might rise beneath so rapidly a to render impossible for to avoid one of men suggested that must endeavour to frighten away by making noise of sort former whaler strongly vetoed proposition asserting whether rightly wrongly know not that if startled chance be that nearest at hand must turn upon destroy boat therefore deemed best to maintain discreet silence in condition of unpleasant suspense remained floating motionless for full half hour whale meanwhile lying a motionless a ourselves when suddenly stir seemed to thrill through whole herd in moment got under way went leisurely off in northerly direction to great relief gave full quarter of hour to get well out of way then oar dipped into water once more resumed voyage at daybreak atmosphere be still a stagnant a have be all through night surface of ocean being unbroken by faintest ripple save where about mile away broad on starboard bow fin of solitary shark lazily swimming athwart course turned up thin blue wedge shaped ripple a swam there be however faint scarcely perceptible mistiness in atmosphere led to hope might get small breeze from somewhere little cared where before day grew many hour older at nine o'clock secured excellent set of sight for longitude having taken precaution to set watch by ship chronometer before parting company with launch be depressing to find after have worked out calculation how little progress have made during twenty one hour since previous noon a morning wore on mistiness have observed in atmosphere at daybreak passed away sky lost rich depth of blue while sun hung aloft dazzling rayless globe of palpitating fire change of sort be brewing felt certain be somewhat surprised that with sky above atmosphere must remain so absolutely stagnant a day wore on thin scarcely perceptible veil of vapour have dimmed richness of sky tint in early morning gradually thickened seemed to be assuming somewhat of distinctness of shape just succeeded in securing meridian altitude of sun for determination of latitude be hour after noon haze have grown so dense that great luminary showed through merely a shapeless blur of pale watery radiance within hour have disappeared altogether from overcast sky still wind failed to come to help atmosphere seemed to be dead so absolutely motionless be although sun have vanished behind murky vapour be stealthily imperceptibly veiling firmament heat be so distressing that perspiration streamed from pore manipulation of oar grew more more languid at length a though actuated by common impulse men gave in declaring that be utterly exhausted must do more must well believe assertion for even whose exertion be limited to steering of boat felt that even such slight labour be almost too arduous to be much longer endured oar be accordingly laid in went to dinner then men flung down in bottom of boat with pipe clenched between teeth fell fast asleep example be quickly followed by lindsay despite effort to contrary when awoke be still breathlessly calm thought for moment night have fallen so dark be upon consulting watch found that still wanted nearly hour to sunset heaven what change have taken place in aspect of weather during four hour so that have lain asleep in stern sheet of boat be quite possible that have remained awake must scarcely have be aware of more than mere fact that sky be steadily assuming increasingly sombre threatening aspect awaking a did to abrupt perception of change have be steadily working out during previous four hour be not putting too strongly to say be startled for whereas last conscious memory of weather before succumbing to blandishment of drowsy god have be merely that of lowering overcast sky might portend anything probably meant more than sharp thunder squall now awakened to consciousness that firmament above consisted of vast curtain of frowning murky black grey cloud streaked furrowed in very remarkable manner from about east south east to west west lower edge of cloud presenting curious frayed appearance while cloud glowed here there with patch of lurid fiery red a though bore within bosom fiercely burning furnace ruddy light of shone through in place have never before beheld sky like aspect be sufficiently alarming to convince veriest tyro in weather lore that something quite out of common be brewing so at once awoke slumbering crew to inquire whether of must read sign tell what might expect newly awakened men yawned stretched arm above head dragged stiffly up on thwart gazing with look of wonder alarm at portentous sky that hung above well if be in chinese sea must say that typhoon be goin ' to bust out shortly observed one of grizzled mahogany visaged old salt who have seen service over world continued have typhoon in atlantic not a ever have heard say have typhoon here have hurricane take to mean pretty much same thing remarked be right tom said thus put upon scent a be chinese typhoon west indian hurricane be same thing under different name third name for be cyclone ' a threatening sky seems to remind dunn so powerfully of chinese typhoon depend upon be going to have taste of west indian hurricane cyclone have read somewhere that frequently originate out here in heart of atlantic if be agoin ' to have typhoon hurricane cyclone like to call say be lord have ' mercy upon ' remarked dunn big ship have work cut out

old audacious frigate a fine sea boat a ever be launched in le time than take to tell of be dismasted hove down on beam end took time to keep hooker afloat get into hong kong harbour very next year be catched again in bashee channel time in lively schooner of six gun knowed be comin ' gived good warnin left plenty of time to get ready for so mr barker lieutenant in command gived order to send yard topmast down on deck rig in jib boom then stripped down to close reefed boom foresail capsized reg'larly turned turtle ' when gale struck only five of lived to tell tale a to here boat if hurricane anything at like chinee typhoon get hold of why will just be blowed clean away out o water up among cloud be just what be goin ' to happen if sign count for anything speaker thrust hand into trouser pocket disgustedly spat small ocean of tobacco juice overboard subsided into gloomy silence be sufficiently alarming retrospect in conscience to have just listened prophetic utterance wherewith have be wound up while powerfully suggestive of highly novel picturesque experience in store for be certainly not attractive enough to cause to look forward to fulfilment with undisturbed serenity nevertheless did not feel like tamely giving in without making effort to save boat life with have be entrusted so set seriously to consider how must best utilise such time a might be allowed in making sort of preparation to meet now confidently expected outburst looked over resource found that consisted in main of eight oar two boat hook two mast two yard three sail coil of two inch rope that thoughtful individual have pitched into boat when getting ready for launching coil of ratline two large ball of spun yarn due to forethought of same other individual painter ten fathom long boat anchor together with grating stretcher other fitting belonging to boat few oddment might might not prove useful be possible to do anything with after considering matter carefully thought be greatest danger to be likely to be exposed seemed to to consist in being swamped by flying spindrift scud water by breaking sea if must by mean contrive to keep water out there be perhaps bare chance that might be able to weather gale after little further consideration thought that what desired to do might possibly be accomplished by mean of boat sail be practically new made of very light closely woven canvas ought to prove water tight so having unfolded idea to men went to work with alacrity to put to test of actual practice of course be utterly useless to think of scudding before gale only hope of living through what be impending depended upon ability to keep boat riding bow on to sea to do became necessary for to improvise sea anchor again be easily done by lashing together six of eight oar in bundle three of blade at one end three at other with boat anchor lashed amidships to sink oar somewhat in water give grip of span made by doubling suitable length of two inch rope be bent on to whole affair boat painter be then bent on to span when apparatus be launched overboard sea anchor be ready for service next task be to cut two lug sail adrift from yard mainsail be then doubled in half one end spread over fore turtle back drawn taut over outside boat under keel then passed length of two inch rope girding boat with confining fore end of sail to turtle back when with aid of one of stretcher be able to heave girth rope so taut a to render impossible for sail to blow away before heaving taut passed second girth rope round boat over after turtle back next connecting girth rope together by length of rope running fore aft along outside of boat underneath edge of top strake doubled mainsail be then strained taut across boat edge tucked underneath fore aft line outside boat foresail be treated in same way with fore edge overlapped by about foot of after edge of mainsail girth rope be then hove taut with finished result that have canvas deck covering boat from fore turtle back to within about six foot of after one edge of sail be next turned up secured by seizing on side deck be complete a then stood be not satisfied with for at after extremity of there be opening six foot long a wide a boat through very considerable quantity of water might enter quite enough indeed to swamp boat with canvas deck lying flat a then be there be doubt that very large quantity of water must wash over pour down through opening must sea run heavily deck needed to be sloped upward from forward to after end of boat so that water might break over must flow off on side before reaching opening to have referred accordingly laid boat mainmast along thwart fore aft amidships lashed heel firmly to middle of foremost thwart then by lashing two longest stretcher together made crutch for head after end of mast to rest in when by placing crutch upright in stern sheet against back board be able to raise mast underneath sail until not only formed sort of ridge pole converting sail into sloping roof also strained canvas a tight a drum head rendering so much le liable to blow away while at same time afforded smooth surface for water to pour off also possessed further advantage that gave little more headroom underneath canvas deck roof completed preparation none too soon for be now rapidly growing dark light of lantern be needed while putting finishing touch to work task accomplished of course at once extinguished lantern for candle be scarce with then for first time became aware of startling rapidity with night seemed to have fallen for with extinguishment of lantern found enwrapped in darkness so thick that must almost be felt however proved to be only transitory for with lapse of few minute eye became accustomed to gloom be then able not only to discern shape of vast pile of cloud threateningly overhung also reflection in oil smooth water latter made visible by dull ruddy glow emanating from cloud be even more noticeable now than have be before be so unnatural appalling sight believe there be not one of who be not more le affected by be first time have ever beheld sight be not ashamed to confess that sensation produced in be for short time something very nearly akin to terror so dreadful portent did seem to be so profoundly impressed be with utter helplessness away out there in mid ocean in small frail boat with friendly shelter at hand nothing to protect from gathering fury of element nothing be to say hand of god say with shame thought far too little of in day not least trying part of be painful tension of nerve produced by suspense enforced waiting for awful ordeal lay before there be nothing for to hing to distract attention from awful threatening sky looked a though might momentarily be expected to burst into devastating flame must destroy world of men indeed frankly avowed that sight be too terrible for crept away under canvas where disposed in bottom of boat strove to while away time in sleep at length must be about close of second dog watch became conscious that swell have almost entirely subsided be gathering weight again coming time out from north west at first heave be only barely perceptible within hour have grown into succession of long steep undulation running at right angle athwart old swell causing boat to heave sway with singularly uneasy movement frequent vicious jerky tug at painter then noticed that cloud have hitherto be motionless so nearly so that movement be not to be detected be working with writhing motion a though be chained giant enduring agony of dreadful torture while awful ruddy light emitted glowed with still fiercer more lurid radiance lighting up restlessly heaving until burned like flood of phlegethon anon there appeared few scattered shred of smoky scud speeding swiftly athwart fiery canopy almost immediately afterwards with low weird wailing sound there swept over scurrying blast came be gone again in second came out from north west judging that be probably direction from gale must come at once rigged out over stern one of two oar remaining in boat swept bow of gig round until pointed due north west scarcely have accomplished when second scuffle came whistling down upon from same direction before have swept out of hearing astern there arose low moaning to windward increased in strength volume with appalling rapidity sky suddenly grew black a ink ahead lengthening line of ghostly white appeared stretching along horizon ahead bearing down upon with frightful speed moan grew into deep thunderous howling roar from to yell might have issued from throat of million fiend in torment white wall of foam yelling fury of wind struck at same instant next thing knew be be lying flat in stern sheet hatless with face stinging a though have be cut with whip while boat trembled quivered from stem to stern with scourging of wind water spray blew in continuous sheet over opening above into sea astern not drop falling into boat long expected hurricane be upon now remained be to see how long frail craft must withstand onslaught of terrific force arrayed against chapter four fall in with capture schooner air be thick with scud water so thick indeed that be like fog being impossible to see farther than twenty fathom from boat scud water swept horizontally along in perfect deluge stung like shot when by way of experiment exposed one of hand to a for wind be like invisible wall driving along be simply impossible to stand up against scourged surface of ocean into level plain of white froth be torn away hurled along like shower of bullet sea anchor fortunately maintained sufficient hold upon water to keep gig riding head to wind be a much a must do with painter strained taut for whole length boat be driving away to leeward stern first at speed of according to estimate fully seven mile hour be perhaps fortunate thing for that such be case for have be riding to sea anchor powerful enough sunk deep enough in water to have held nearly stationary believe must have be swamped within five minute of outburst of hurricane even a be despite precaution that have taken to make canvas covering perfectly secure wind tugged at beat upon with such vehement fury momentarily expected to see torn bodily off boat go driving away to leeward in tatter probably thorough soaking that almost instantly received caused fabric to shrink up strain still tighter than be before may have have something to do with stubborn resistance that offered to gale be that a may held intact to circumstance attribute fact that gig be not instantly swamped woven fabric however stout scarcely wood must long withstand furious pelting of scud water a sail be now enduring in about ten minute water began to drip through first in single drop here there then in few small stream rapidly increased in number until there seemed in thick darkness to be hundred of for in endeavouring to avoid one stream only succeeded in encountering two three more to add to unpleasantness of situation be impossible for to light lantern for although be sheltered from direct violence of gale by canvas wind somehow managed to penetrate beneath creating quite formidable little scuffle there easily frustrating effort to obtain light very soon have annoyance to contend with in shape of gradual accumulation of water in boat whether caused by leak in hull by drainage of water through canvas knew not obliged to have recourse to baling proved to be singularly awkward operation in such cramped quarter such pitchy darkness first mad fury of outburst lasted for about three quarter of hour seemed perfect eternity to in condition of overpowering suspense believe be longer than three quarter of hour at utmost then subsided into heavy gale of wind sea began to get up so rapidly that within hour be being flung hither thither with such terrific violence that in very short time body be covered with bruise while of men actually became sea sick now too new danger threatened for a sea rose commenced to break be not long ere have sea washing in rapidly increasing volume over boat pouring down through opening over stern sheet kept baling in good earnest not only with solitary bucket with hat boot a well to save boat from being swamped bitterest hardship of be that there be relief not moment intermission throughout whole of dreadful interminable night be in continuous peril of death with breath that drew second saw trembling upon verge of eternity escaping destruction a by constantly recurring succession of miracle be frightful experience so frightful that language be utterly powerless to describe most eloquent pen must do more than convey poor feeble miserably inadequate idea of terror suffering of one who have not undergone such experience can form remotest conception of horror thing have end however sooner later at length welcome light of day once more made appearance piercing slowly with seeming reluctance through dense canopy of black storm torn cloud flying scud overhung then almost wished that have remained night so dreary awe inspiring be scene met aching gaze heaven gave sign of relenting sky looked wild a ever although awful ruddy glow have long since faded out from cloud while ocean seemed to be lashed goaded by furious wind into endless succession of rushing mountain wave one of a swept with hissing foam white crest down upon seemed mercilessly bent upon destruction a stood up gazed about for must do so now by leaning well forward against wind seemed marvellous thing to that gig continued to live through for light buoyant though be sea met swept from stem to stern be plain enough to now that be nothing canvas covering that saved a be shipped so much water that be a much a three of must do that being who must work in opening at one time to keep from filling to add still further to misery be one by time dead tired worn out in fact with terror anxiety of past night yet dared not yet attempt to seek comfort refreshment of sleep for critical situation continued to demand utmost watchfulness unremitting exertion when at length sought to renew strength by mean of meal grievous discovery be made that whole of small stock of ship bread be spoiled rendered uneatable by salt water a though misfortune be not in sufficiently serious when sought to quench thirst discovered that bung of water breaker have somehow got out of bung hole allowing so much salt water to mingle with small stock of fresh that latter have be rendered almost undrinkable first gleam of hope encouragement came to about hour before noon that day when anxious watching be rewarded by appearance of small momentary break in sky low down toward horizon to windward showed for moment then be lost again presently wider more pronounced break appeared did not vanish on contrary widened until presently fitful gleam of wan watery sunshine pierced through lighted up bleak desolate expanse of raging ocean for few second almost simultaneously with welcome appearance of transient welcome gleam of pallid sunshine became aware of slight unmistakable diminution in fury of gale change productive of such profound relief to worn out a be by long protracted toil anxiety that actually greeted with feeble cheer be hope thus aroused fallacious for from moment sky began to clear until within couple of hour storm cloud have swept away to leeward leaving sky clear pure blue streaked here there be true with tattered trailing streamer of pinky grey however soon vanished once more revelled in glorious warmth radiance of unclouded sunlight while wind dropped so rapidly that for sea still ran with dangerous weight might have made sail again by sunset a be be so completely worn out that think be really thankful for excuse to leave boat riding to sea anchor few hour longer while sought obtained what be even more necessary to than food drink sleep actual danger be by time past so arranged that of must keep look out for hour while rest slept there being sufficient of to carry through night at rate undertook to keep first look out hour be think longest sixty minute have ever up to then experienced for now constant watchfulness be no longer necessary to insure safety incentive to watchfulness be gone overtaxed nature craved so vehemently for repose that effort to remain awake be absolutely painful continued however to perform task have undertaken when hour have expired flung down in stern sheet where instantly sank into profound dreamless sleep having first of course aroused young lindsay cautioned to maintain bright lookout for passing ship caution gave order must be passed on from man to man throughout night when awoke found that have maintained all through night precise attitude in have flung down to sleep hour before appeared to that have not stirred by so much a hair breadth through hour of unconsciousness awoke spontaneously with light of sun shining strongly through still closed eyelid first thing after of became conscious be that boat be rising falling easily with long steady swinging motion then opened eye immediately noticed that sun be two hour high very soft warm gentle breeze fanned cheek only audible sound be snore snort of many sleeper near mingling with gentle lap of water along boat planking hand save be sound asleep be not greatly surprised at though naturally trifle vexed that order a to maintenance of lookout have not be more strictly observed be not until have risen to foot flung inquiring glance round horizon realised how miserably unfortunate negligence have be for there away in western board distant fourteen mile gleamed sail of large ship more intent scrutiny revealed tantalising circumstance that be steering such course a have undoubtedly carried past about hour before daybreak at distance of little more than three mile have proper watch be maintained must have intercepted boarded without difficulty whether happened to be friend enemy be matter of very secondary import just then in miserable plight a regarded stock of provision water situation be such that even to have fallen into hand of enemy must have be better than to be left a be at once roused hand forthwith went to work to cut adrift sail have served so well to bend afresh to yard while others hauled aboard sea anchor cut lashing adrift took to oar with object of going in pursuit of distant sail for there be yet chance for if must keep in sight long enough there be just possibility that one of crew working aloft might cast glance astern catch sight of tiny sail when must at once recognise a of boat report when if skipper happened to be humane man must assuredly heave to wait for to close so went to work with will soon have boat ataunto once more in pursuit of stranger a fast a oar sail together must put through water experience of first hour sufficed to demonstrate beyond question hopelessness of attempt to overtake ship be leaving rapidly

prolong chance of being sighted to latest possible moment frequently relieving other be of avail strive a must stranger steadily increased distance from until after have be in pursuit of for fully three hour head of royal sank below western horizon lost for good then men sullenly laid in oar declaring that be worn out must do more then began to savagely inquire among who be individual to whose culpable carelessness be indebted for present disappointment culprit be soon discovered in person of little welshman man whose watch followed lindsay man declared that have remained awake throughout watch have duly called successor before resuming slumber there be reason to doubt statement even if happened to be true be still culpable according to own showing for be obliged to confess that have not waited to assure that successor be properly awakened have satisfied with single shake of sleeper shoulder accompanied by curt announcement that be time to turn out have then flung down gone to sleep a for man whom welshman be supposed to have awakened disclaimed responsibility upon ground that if called at did not believe have be called so ineffectively a to be quite unconscious of circumstance at conclusion of inquiry comrade be so furiously incensed with welshman for culpable almost criminal neglect that seemed strongly disposed to take summary vengeance upon needed exertion of authority to protect fellow from violence broke out anew when at noon went to dinner be compelled to make out best meal must upon raw salt beef washed down with water so brackish that must scarcely swallow reduced to such condition a will scarcely be wondered at must be brought to something very nearly approaching despair when observation day revealed disconcerting fact that thanks to excessive drift during gale be still fully six hundred mile from port of destination distance scarce dared to hope might be covered even under most favourable circumstance in le than five day soon appeared a though even protracted period of privation exposure be to be increased for a afternoon wore on wind still continuing to drop grew so light that speed dwindled down to bare three knot by hour of sunset by midnight have still further fallen to extent that sail became useless to oar have once more to be resorted to return of daylight found in midst of stark calm under cloudless sky out of sun soon began to dart scorching beam so pitilessly that task of pulling shortly became labour little le than torture to people in exhausted condition indeed so severe did men find that after persevering until about four bell in afternoon watch gave up declaring to be quite incapable of further exertion thus for remainder of day lay upon oil smooth sea under blistering ray of burning sun with tongue cleaving to palate a began to experience first fierce torment of unquenchable thirst for supply of water undrinkable a be be growing so short that became imperatively necessary to husband with most jealous care to reduce allowance to very smallest quantity upon life must possibly be sustained men sought to forget suffering in sleep disposing in bottom of boat under shelter of now useless sail be far too anxious to be able to sleep for began to realise boat voyage threatened to develop into adventure might easily terminate in ghastly tragedy hour before sunset called men went to supper with going down of sun oar be once more thrown out resumed weary voyage hand of being equally anxious to avail to utmost of comparatively cool hour of darkness to shorten a much a possible distance still intervened between deliverance through hot breathless night toiled in unspeakable agony of thirst when morning once more dawned out of brilliant cloudless sky companion presented so wild haggard appearance with cheek sunken with famine eye ablaze with fever of thirst starvation that be scarcely recognisable hour after sunrise partook of loathsome breakfast of putrid meat nauseous water then composed to sleep if must through long hour of blazing day maintaining however one man hourly watch in order that might be duly warned of change in weather late afternoon change came change of so welcome character that believe may without exaggeration say saved life for about noon when be aroused by man on watch to get meridian altitude of sun for determination of latitude observed bank of purple grey cloud gathering in south western quarter rounded edge a sharply denned a though have be cut out of paper there be mistaking character portended thunderstorm thunderstorm have about four o'clock afternoon of truly tropical violence there be not breath of wind with brought perfect deluge of rain thrice welcome blessed rain pouring from overcharged cloud in sheet of warm water soft sweet a nectar let not drop escape that be possible to save saw that be coming prepared for by spreading sail across boat caught welcome stream in depression that have arranged for reception drinking out of hollowed canvas until must drink more then a rain still continued to fall did desperate deed threw away drop of drinking water in hope of being able to refill breaker with sweet fresh rain water be successful god in infinite mercy allowed floodgate of heaven to remain open until have filled available receptacle at disposal then rain ceased storm drifted away to north eastward sun disappeared below horizon in blaze of cloudless splendour suffering be not yet over for now that hellish torment of thirst be assuaged pang of hunger assailed with redoubled fury hourly growing in intensity until sometime during night while lindsay be asleep boat be in charge of one of men became so utterly unendurable that in fit of madness famished crew fell upon slender remainder of stock of eatable devouring whole at one fell swoop except lindsay own portion despite famished condition loyally set aside for day of breathless calm twelve hour of scorching heat under ray of pitiless sun then with men once more threw out oar resumed heart breaking task of shortening by few mile still formidable stretch of ocean lay between safety nothing that must say must induce single one of to accept ever so small share of provision that have apportioned a share belonging to lindsay declared that last meal have so far satisfied reinvigorated that be no longer hungry while one two of spoke hopefully of possibility that might catch fish two on morrow be somewhere about ten o'clock night that detected first symptom of change in weather first subtle indication that long period of calm have so nearly destroyed be about to end best of indication be of such character a permitted to indulge hope that although calm be about to give way to breeze be likely to be favoured with weather fine enough to permit of pursuing voyage under most favourable condition symptom of approaching change merely consisted in gathering in heaven of thin veil of mottled fine weather cloud just dense enough to obscure most of lesser star render night rather dark while few of brighter star peeped through opening between cloud at tolerably frequent interval permitting to steer course without having recourse to lantern compass prospect of coming breeze seemed to cheer men endow with renewed vigour for gave way with something like will while occasionally went so far a to exchange muttered ejaculation of encouragement one with happened to be trick at yoke line until midnight having relieved young lindsay at four bell be sitting in stern sheet with eye intently fixed upon particularly bright star gleamed out through cloud at frequent interval right over boat nose at altitude of about thirty degree above horizon have consequently selected a suitable guide to steer by be curious fact well known to sailor that object can be better seen on dark night at sea by looking at sky slightly above to one side of rather than directly at hence be that a kept eye intently fixed upon star immediately ahead suddenly became aware of presence of small dark object three point on starboard bow immediately looked straight at must then see nothing whereupon looked into sky rather above point where knew to be when again caught sight of to make quite sure sheered boat four point off course when became quite distinct although only a small black shapeless shadow against dark sky immediately ahead held up hand warningly to men at same moment gave order oar men somewhat wonderingly instantly obeyed staring hard at inquiringly while two three who be lying down in bottom of boat trying unavailingly to sleep raised upon elbow a though to ascertain what be matter lad said in low cautious tone not sound for life there be small craft of sort out there becalmed be intention to run alongside can not of course tell whether be friend enemy so think will be well for to get alongside without attracting attention of crew if can manage if prof to be friend well good if be enemy must take at cost for be in starving condition a be aware while be still five day distant from bermuda believe must possibly live to reach island without provision so muffle oar a well a can have cutlass ready will put alongside h u s h not sound that craft be good three mile away sound travel far on such night a must not allow crew of to discover that be in neighbourhood now muffle oar will soon find out who what be without moment hesitation men forthwith proceeded to muffle oar with portion of clothing in five minute be heading for small dark blot when have be pulling silently for about quarter of hour small thin sound came creeping across water to that within five minute have resolved into strain of marseillaise played upon accordion sung by fairly good tenor voice to several others be almost instantly added that be sufficient craft else might be be assuredly french be relieved of anxiety of approaching vessel uncertain a to whether be friend foe song be sung through to end with great enthusiasm then after slight pause song be started also french so far a must be made out be cut short however before dozen bar have be reached by hoarse gruff voice loudly demanding in clear unmistakable french what in name of saint singer meant by arousing hand at hour of night with miserable braying rendered assurance doubly sure proceeded with increased caution if be possible laying in single pair of oar with double object of resting men a much a possible prior to attack at same time approaching quarry slowly enough to allow crew to coil away about deck go to sleep again if must paddling slowly with utmost circumspection taking care that oar entered left water without slightest splash be full hour more traversing distance separated from stranger long ere reached have made out to be schooner of somewhere about one hundred forty ton by taunt spar a well a by fact of being where be nicely in track of homeward bound west indiaman judged to be privateer when first discovered must have be lying nearly broadside on to swing of swell gradually slewed a stealthily approached until presented stern fairly at affording admirable opportunity to get alongside undetected did gliding up under starboard quarter alongside actually climbing in on deck over low bulwark before alarm be raised then from neighbourhood of wheel there suddenly arose muttered execration in french followed by sharp inquiry in same language of who go there british answered in inquirer own lingo surrender will drive man of overboard british ah sac r r re yes monsieur oh yes surrender gurgled man a seized by throat threatened with cutlas while lindsay led hand forward to forecastle there be few drowsily muttered ejaculation in direction quickly succeeded by volley of execration scuffling of foot slamming of hatch over fore scuttle lindsay sang out that schooner be ours even a did so two figure in rather scanty clothing rushed up on deck through companion before must fully realise what be happening one of snapped pistol at while other aimed blow at head with sword fortunately bullet missed finding billet in body of man whose throat still grasped while managed to catch blow of other fellow on own blade in moment be at hammer tongs be to say swordsman other fellow making dash at now then aiming fierce blow at with butt end of pistol until in self defence seized opportunity cleft skull with cutlas at same instant launched out with left hand sent companion reeling to deck with blow planted fairly between eye at moment young lindsay came rushing aft with dozen of fellow at heel to know what be matter so bidding couple of men to securely bind prisoner descended companion ladder with lindsay at heel to see whether there be more frenchman to be fought there be not however close stuffy little cabin be empty so went on deck again leaving two men to keep watch ward at after end of ship went forward where personally superintended operation of effectually securing crew who afterwards passed down into hold cook however left free being ravenously hungry gave order to at once light galley fire cook best meal ship must afford hand taking keen edge off appetite meanwhile by munching excellent biscuit that lindsay discovered snugly stored away in pantry next care be to hoist in gig have served so well done settled down to wait for dinner breeze promised to come ere long chapter five proceed in search of althea boat wind came away about hour half before sunrise gentle breeze out from north east coming down to first of in form of few wandering cat paw just wrinkled oil smooth surface of ocean be gone again finally settling into true breeze fanned along at speed of four knot schooner proving to be fairly speedy little vessel long ere however have carefully thought out line of action for myself in order that when wind came might be prepared for will be remembered that before parting company with launch have be furnished by master with table showing relative speed of various boat from moment have with assistance of table carefully calculated supposed position of boat at noon so now knew to within few mile where particular boat ought to be looked for upon assumption that have gone well with somehow thought have be very strongly impressed with belief that gale have encountered have not extended far enough to south east to reach launch rest of squadron flower might have overtaken observation upon bearing of centre of storm direction led to entertain very strong hope that rest of boat have escaped being so determined to act upon assumption that have done so to proceed in search of in direction where ought upon assumption to be found of course with different rate of sailing must now be strung out in fairly long line question exercised most strongly be whether must first seek leading boat having found dodge about in waiting for others whether must first seek dinghy having found run down wind in track of others direction from wind might happen to spring up must necessarily influence decision to great extent when came away out from north east discovered that schooner must fetch upon easy bowline spot where sternmost boat might be expected to be found hesitated no longer at once made up mind to first look for dinghy a morning wore on breeze freshened somewhat schooner speed increased to fully seven knot employed early part of forenoon in satisfying that prisoner be properly secured taking precaution to have put in iron a in exhausted condition of own crew must not afford to run unnecessary risk a soon a have eased mind of anxiety personally investigated condition of schooner storeroom to great joy discovered that possessed ample supply of provision water together with liberal quantity of wine spirit other luxury enough of everything in fact to maintain whole of survivor of althea upon full allowance for at least month schooner moreover proved to be susanne privateer of saint malo be nearly new stout substantially built little craft of one hundred thirty four ton register a tight a bottle well found armed with six long six pounder in battery with long nine pounder mounted on pivot on forecastle magazine nearly full nothing of importance happened on day next except that sky gradually became overspread with peculiar patch of fleece like cloud called trade cloud showing that at length have hit off north east trade wind seemed to have be evading for so long according to reckoning upon assumption that wind must now hold fairly steady ought to hit off track of boat about six bell in morning watch on third morning after capture of schooner must allow eleven hour of daylight in to prosecute search to give best possible chance of finding object of quest took care on preceding midnight to haul schooner a close to wind a must lie so that there must be possibility of hitting upon track to leeward instead of to windward of so running away from instead of after at six bell on morning be called in accordance with previous instruction in order might work up reckoning to very last moment so make certain of getting a accurately a possible upon track calculation now showed that must be nearly eight bell instead of six before must reach imaginary line for be making at quarter to eight having previously sent hand aloft to take careful look round gave order to up helm bear away upon west south west course to pack studding sail upon little hooker men thanks to good feeding rest must give consistent with maintenance of proper discipline have by time completely recovered from effect of boat voyage be one a keen a needle on lookout for boat from moment that squared away watch helmsman taking to rigging without order from immediately that have finished breakfast disposing upon royal topgallant yard in eagerness to catch earliest possible glimpse of shipmate calculated that at about five bell in forenoon watch ought to overtake dinghy slowest boat in fleet a moment drew near anxiety reached most painful pitch men on yard straining eye to utmost a peered intently into distance from right ahead to broad on beam carefully slowly scanning horizon for little blot of gleaming canvas must proclaim success of quest fateful moment came went leaving horizon blank noon arrived secured excellent observation for latitude by mean of be enabled to check previous dead reckoning tallied to within le than mile of what ought to be still there be sign of missing boat although calculation showed that have overrun by fifteen mile spot where expected to find hailed yard inquiring whether there be possibility of having run past dinghy without observing men assured that have maintained so bright lookout have be anywhere within boundary of horizon must assuredly have seen be rather disconcerting yet felt that have real cause for disappointment boat might have met with rather fresher wind than have estimated for in case likelihood be that be still many mile ahead of calculation have be based upon supposition that have be evenly maintaining same rate of speed from moment when parted with knew that be in last degree improbable yet be only basis have upon to make calculation for be impossible for to judge by weather have experienced of one thing felt tolerably well convinced be that keeping so much farther to southward than have done in gig other boat must not have met with calm have so seriously delayed consequently unless too have be caught in hurricane have so nearly proved destruction must be somewhere directly ahead of a be then steering there be nothing for therefore to keep on a be until found in condition of anxiety suspense continued to run away to west south west until sunset without sighting anything then fearful of running past one more of object of quest during night time without seeing hove schooner to under foresail jib with topsail aback so that might remain a nearly a possible where be excepting for lee drift through night also caused three lantern to be hoisted one over other from maintopmast stay a fairly conspicuous signal pretty certain to attract attention in event of of boat coming within sight of during hour of darkness of course gave strictest injunction for maintenance of bright lookout through night night passed uneventfully at daybreak after having first gone aloft personally unavailingly examined horizon entire visible expanse of ocean through ship telescope excellent instrument by way made sail again upon schooner resumed search shortly after breakfast secured observation for longitude having worked out calculation found that if boat be still afloat have continued to steer course have be told must must certainly find day a on preceding day men spent watch upon yard maintaining so keen lookout even anxious a be felt satisfied must allow nothing to escape yet day passed evening arrived without discovery of sign of missing boat while anxiety grew more painfully intense with lapse of hour of daylight when at night closed down upon star came winking mistily out from between driving cloud conviction came to that something have gone lamentably wrong to continue search further in direction that have be pursuing must be useless question be what have happened must think of two possible explanation of failure to find boat one of be that have be fallen in with be picked up by passing ship while other be that have experienced bad weather have driven out of course if first explanation happened to be correct one well good missing comrade be safe if second explanation be to account for non success in what direction ought to continue search question be very difficult one to answer with approach to accuracy approximation to truth might be arrived at reasoned thus boat be undoubtedly within limit of trade wind when parted with only disturbing influence that must be likely to meet with in region must be that of hurricane that have encountered reasoning thus went below produced chart of north atlantic be french one reckoning longitude from meridian of paris that difficulty be to be easily overcome upon forthwith proceeded to prick off a accurately a data in possession must permit first spot where have parted company with other boat secondly own course distance up to moment when hurricane struck thirdly supposititious course distance of of boat up to moment when hurricane must probably strike observation have personally made a to bearing course of centre of storm have originally led to conclusion that other boat have probably escaped altogether now a went over matter afresh must not persuade that have encountered anything worse than mere fringe of breeze strong enough perhaps to compel to run before for few hour nothing more assuming then to be case calculated a nearly a must probable direction of wind when gale struck number of hour during must be likely to be compelled to run before pricking off upon chart probable whereabouts at moment when must be likely to find once more able to head for say saint thomas saint kitts from point laid off course for former island then calculated probable position on line at moment compared with position then occupied by schooner thus arrived at new direction in ought to seek for having reached thus far went on deck set new course then with lindsay assistance went over calculation again verifying figure of luckily for anxiety trade wind be now blowing so fresh that on easy bowline a be whole mainsail foresail topsail with royal topgallant sail stowed be a much a must stagger under little witch dancing along at good clean eleven knot under canvas consequence being that in thirty eight hour from moment of bearing up have reached spot where intended that new search for missing boat must begin time however intended to adopt course of procedure exactly opposite to have followed while prosecuting former search then have gone to windward of spot when expected to find boat have run down to leeward along course thought probable have taken now uncertainty a to precise position necessitated search over belt of ocean several mile in width therefore determined to get well to leeward of spot where calculation indicated that ought to find from there work to windward on easy bowline making stretch of twenty six mile in length have already ascertained height of royal yard above sea level from have calculated that lookout stationed at elevation must command circular area having radius of thirteen mile if therefore made stretch across circle of twenty six mile diameter must practically command belt of ocean of fifty two mile in width deemed sufficient for purpose accordingly having reached cruising ground at two bell in forenoon watch having one hand on royal yard a lookout with two more on topsail yard by way of additional precaution made first reach of thirteen mile in south easterly direction then nothing being in sight tacked stood to northward for twenty six mile still nothing in sight so hove about again time reached to southward eastward for distance of twenty six mile continuing search thus throughout entire day without success at sunset hove about again reaching to northward until have arrived at track boat if still afloat must probably pas over hove to for night hoisting three lantern a before to attract attention must happen to arrive within sight of during hour of darkness be relief to that night be tolerably clear with fair sprinkling of star moon well advanced in first quarter so that during first half of night have very fair amount of light did not keep lookout men aloft at night deeming useless a light although a have said fairly good be not bright enough to reveal small object like boat at greater distance than two three mile up to distance be possible to see really better from level of deck than from more lofty elevation of yard have three men continuously on lookout at same time namely one on jib boom end one to port starboard in waist be hove to on starboard tack needle to say that although have three men thus stationed for express purpose of keeping lookout doing nothing else lindsay also kept eye well skinned going even to length of blinding skylight with old sail in order that eye might not be dazzled by even dim light of cabin lamp happened to be eight hour in night have taken advantage of circumstance to turn in early for anxiety attending upon dishearteningly fruitless search be beginning to tell upon have suffered for last night two from inability to sleep on particular occasion however felt somewhat drowsy therefore went to bunk in hope of getting two three hour rest a matter of fact did sleep rest be so disturbed by frightful dream of men enduring unheard of suffering in open boat at length awaking in paroxysm of horror turned out went on deck to find that be seven bell under circumstance must have be called in half hour moon be within very short time of setting when reached deck stood watching half disc creeping insensibly nearer nearer to horizon lighting up sky way with soft mysterious brownish green light casting long tremulous wake of ruddy gold athwart top of running surge lindsay be standing beside yawning top of head nearly off poor lad for although too be anxious a to fate of who be seeking anxiety have not thus far interfered with rest watch be now so nearly up that be quite ready for four hour sleep that awaited be in very act of telling that a must not go below again might turn in if chose eye being while fixed upon setting moon when suddenly almost immediately under luminary caught momentary glimpse of small black object small a pin head a be hove up on back of sea against luminous sky stopping short in what be saying sprang to rail from thence into main rigging dozen ratline of ascended in order to gain horizon clear of run of nearer sea from elevation again looked out instinctively shading eye under hand in moment have again caught sight of object not only so have also detected intermittent flashing a of moonlight off wet blade of oar boat boat shouted in fulness of delight hurrah lad have one of at last let draw jib sheet fill topsail up helm there man let go broad off a rapidly issued order swung out of rigging running to binnacle took bearing of moon allowing point to northward of a course to steer for boat where be gunner shouted word for mr robbins here be sir answered robbins for word have thrilled through little craft like electric shock already watch below be scrambling up through hatchway carrying clothing in hand in eagerness to get glimpse of newly discovered boat mr robbins said have goodness to clap blank cartridge into one of gun fire a encouragement to poor fellow out there will guess by firing that have seen ay ay sir answered robbins shambling away with alacrity upon errand few minute later one of gun rang out what hoped must prove thrice welcome message to shipmate somehow never for moment doubted that be one of frigate boat have seen felt a sure of a though have already alongside although of course must form sort of surmise a to of must prove to be took very few minute to run down to boat when judging distance rounded to laid topsail aback so close to windward of little craft that one of people be able to heave rope end into hauled alongside then to supreme disappointment discovered that be not either of boat that be looking for long boat of merchantman with eleven people in of whom be in very wasted exhausted condition partly from famine partly from wound most of being swathed about head limb with bloodstained bandage concealing disappointment a well a must helped poor creature up over side discovering during process that rescued party be fellow countryman then having removed everything from boat promised to prove of slightest value cast adrift having room on deck for meanwhile unhappy stranger being too weak to stand have sunk down upon deck pointing to parched throat feebly gasping word water in response to appeal of own people have gone to work under supervision to supply cautiously with small quantity of water slightly dashed with brandy treatment have wonderfully stimulative revivifying effect upon so much so indeed that managed to stagger to foot earnestly beg for food of course supplied with forthwith in form of ship bread broken small softened by steeping in weak brandy water gave pending preparation of more substantial appetising meal by cook be perhaps well that circumstance obliged to do so for afterwards learned that administration of solid substantial meal to people in famished condition must probably have have fatal result having satisfied to small extent first ravenous craving for food drink got below provided with such makeshift sleeping accommodation a resource of schooner must permit that might seek in sleep such further recuperation a be to be obtained pending production of meal in preparation for having thus disposed of rescued men nothing remained for to await with such patience a must muster return of daylight to enable to resume search for lost frigate boat be nearly noon next day ere of rescued party appeared on deck first to do so being fine sailorly looking man of forty forty five year of age who introduced to a captain tucker of late british barque wyvern of bristol outward bound to west indie with general cargo of considerable value informed that have gone well with until eight day previously when about noon strange sail be sighted in south western board standing to northward close hauled on starboard tack may be sure said tucker kept sharp eye upon for knew that for honest merchantman happened to meet down here be likely to meet with dozen rogue in shape of picaroons privateer other craft of enemy even own men o ' war offence meant to in saying so mr courtenay know sir a well a do that of men o ' war treat british merchantman pretty nearly a bad a if be enemy boarding impressing best men leaving with so few hand that if happen to meet with bad weather be ten chance to one of being able to take ship to destination well knowing kept eye on stranger soon made out to be uncommonly smart heavy brigantine that close hauled a be seemed to be travelling three foot to one have particularly wicked look about did half like liked still le when having drawn well up on larboard beam at distance of five mile suddenly discovered that be edging away for be already under stunsails so must do more in way of making sail mounted eight brass nine pounder very pretty piece be too so have cleared away loaded in readiness for worst for took to be french spanish privateer have notion of yielding ship to such vermin without making fight for own lad be quite of same mind a not liking idea of being locked up for year in french spanish prison well sir that brigantine came bowling along at pace that within hour of time when noticed to be edging down for be within gun shot sooner be case than yawing broad off for moment pitched shot eighteen pounder took to be across fore foot a polite hint to to heave to be in humour for heaving to just then so hoisted ensign kept on a be going expected that seeing brigantine must give sight of bunting open fire upon in good earnest did do just kept edging away until in five minute be broad on larboard quarter running same way that be creeping up with evident intention of running alongside seeing ordered mr thomson mate to ram extra shot down upon top of have already loaded gun with to depress muzzle so that must fire down upon brigantine low deck a ranged up alongside tell sir did half like look of thing for by time craft be so close to that saw down upon deck quite distinctly seemed to be full of men swarthy greasy black bearded cut throat one of if look went for anything in minute so be within biscuit toss of so close that must hear hissing shear of sharp stem through water moan of wind in hollow of canvas when up jump fellow upon rail hailed in what took to be spanish be french know because can speak little of lingo at same time pointing to gaff end up to ruffian at once began to hoist black flag so ho ' think so be pirate have to deal with eh well that mean neck nothing so here go with sings out to mate to throw open port 'd kept closed until now let rascal have hot sooner said than done thomson gave word port be thrown open nine pounder run out next second four of shot went smashing through brigantine bulwark bowling over like ninepin man happened to be standing in way man on rail jumped down off perch a nimbly a if be scalded heard shout car r r r amba ' something like a waved hand to man at wheel at same moment brigantine delivered broadside before smoke have time to clear away heard felt crash of a dropped alongside fair in waist next second so seemed to rail be alive with dirty garlic smelling blackguard who came swarming over upon deck until seemed that there be room for more well have pair of pistol sword of lad have cutlas for three four minute there be a pretty fight a 'd wish to see going on aboard old wyvern then while be doing best to hold own against four of rascal who came crowding round got knock on head from behind made see about million star before dropped senseless to deck chapter six find launch how long remained unconscious know must have be at least hour must say for when at length came round found lying bound hand foot on deck along with such of crew a have not be killed in defence of ship while wyvern be hove to under topsail with hatch off regular mob of dirty greasy spaniard swarming round main hatchway hoisting out cargo that gang be breaking out down below have hoisted out boat too soon found be using to transfer such good a required to brigantine be to say except long boat for reason did not then understand be lying unused in starboard gangway took time over job of picking choosing from among stuff that carried noticed that while have hand aloft on main royal yard keeping lookout kept at until be too dark to see what be about then left one boat remaining alongside for fully twenty minute after rest have gone while of people be busy down below at length however shoved off a well leaving people lying on deck trussed up like so many chicken two three minute later heard order given immediately followed by cheeping of block creaking of yard parralls by knew that be filling upon brigantine leaving must not understand why have left there alive bound hand foot a be suspected villainy however first idea be that have set barque on fire must not detect smell of burning then thought came to that perhaps have scuttled intending to go down with ship idea of fairly made blood run cold can tell stirred up too went to work to see if must work hand free might just a well have tried to fly scoundrel have made sure work of mistake then sang out to others to try if must work adrift after bit first one then answered that be use be lashed altogether too securely well lad say if none of can work free be afraid be up with for notion be that spanish devil have scuttled ship if so wo be so very long before will founder taking with set men muttering among presently man be lying nearest said if can manage to work way near enough to sir for to get feel of lashing with finger will see what can do towards loosenin ' of 'em for yer ' all right lad ' say will ' sooner said than done worked wriggled up alongside of somehow presently felt finger fumbling about with lashing particular chap ought to tell be uncommonly clever with finger especially in matter of handling rope sure enough in about twenty minute be blessed if have worked lashing so loose that presently managed to slip hand clear of altogether moment be free set to work to chafe finger get life back into for have lashed so tight that have lost feeling in hand a soon a be able to tell once more that 'd got complete set of finger whipped knife out of pocket cut lashing off foot after went round of party cutting adrift a quick a must then while be getting benumbed feeling out of limb swung down through open hatchway to investigate be a have feared have scuttled ship for already there be something like three foot of water in hold may be sure did waste much time down below after making discovery just scrambled up on deck again a quick a ever must told men what have happened barque be bound to go of course must hing to keep afloat so jumped to side to see after boat be gone long boat a told just now be lying in starboard gangway crossed deck to take look at then saw why pirate have left there unused be stove in on starboard side plank being crushed timber broken over space measuring six foot by two a be then must not float two minute must have filled moment dropped into water when chip came to overhaul have notion that must patch up enough to make carry a matter of fact rested between whole lot of drowning for barque be filling so fast that there be time for to put raft together so carpenter fetched tool went to work there then rest of lending hand fetching thing a chip sung out for first of all gently coaxed broken timber planking back into place a nearly a must get then got couple of strip of canvas big enough to cover hole one of dressed with tallow on side working grease well into fabric then with small flat headed tack spaced close together nailed first piece of canvas over hole allowing plenty of overlap then took other piece of canvas be cut inch larger way than first piece tarred well strained tightly over first piece then cut third piece of canvas fixed over hole on inside of boat nailing bottom two end of canvas so that formed sort of pocket then got lot of oakum first soaked in tar then stuffed into pocket arrangement until be packed a tightly a be possible to pack be to keep broken plank timber in place finally nailed up top of pocket declaring a flung down tool that boat be now ready for hoisting out be high time too for by time that job be finished barque have settled to chain plate be liable to go down under foot at moment accordingly hooked on tackle watching roll of ship managed to hoist out boat get into water without accident then hurriedly pitched into couple of breaker of water such provision a must lay hand upon be much for by time cabin be afloat lazarette under water tumbled over side into only waiting long enough behind others to secure ship paper chronometer shoved off in hurry can tell for while be securing few matter have just mentioned poor old hooker gave ugly lurch two told time be up sure enough have pulled above fifty fathom away from when down went stern first first anxiety be of course a to carpenter repairing job soon found that need greatly trouble ourselves about there be just draining of water somehow worked way through few minute spell with baler about once hour be sufficient to keep boat fairly dry comfortable same be very keenly anxious for long boat voyage in such craft a so shaped course to west'ard hoping to fall in with be picked up by outward bounder of sort not blessed sail did see for seven mortal day until sighted upper canvas last night pulled so a to cut off if have picked up believe must have be dead by time for provision soon ran out when be too late discovered that breaker be full of salt instead of fresh water such be tragic story related by skipper of ill fated story be replete with element necessary for weaving of thrilling romance yet be told baldly concisely without slightest attempt at embellishment told precisely a though to be attacked by pirate to have one ship rifled scuttled one boat stolen then to be left bound hand foot on deck to helplessly perish be one of most ordinary commonplace incident imaginable truly who go down to sea in ship do business on great water meet with so many extraordinary experience see so many strange unaccountable sight that capacity for wonder be soon lost most astonishing to shore abiding folk incredible occurrence be accepted a matter of course during whole of day continued to make short tack to windward a before with watch aloft on look out nothing be sighted at nightfall again hove to maintaining position a nearly a possible in same spot until next morning with first sign of daylight sent aloft keenest sighted man have on board that might take good look round ere filled upon schooner to resume disheartening search so eager be that when man reached royal yard star be still blinking overhead down in western sky be too dark to see to great distance dawn be paling sky to windward a cold weird mysterious pallor of coming day spread upward warmed into pinkish grey from into orange from orange to clearest primrose dyeing weltering undulation of low running sea with delicate shifting tint of opal saw fellow aloft suddenly rise to foot stand upon yard with one arm round masthead to steady against quick jerky plunge of schooner while shielded eye with other hand a steadfastly gazed into distance to windward royal yard there do see anything hailed eagerly sudden ecstasy of renewed hope sprang up within breast now fully revealed to how nearly have be driven to confines of despair by long protracted non success of search upon have so confidently entered ai quite sure sir be unsatisfactory reply came down to be still trifle dusky away out there thought just now that ay there be again there be something out there sir about six seven mile away ca yet tell for certain whether be boat be somewhere about size of boat sir keep eye on answered will get glass have look for so saying went hastily to companion removed ship telescope from becket in hung there quickly made way aloft now said a settled upon yard where be object d see that long streak of light shootin up into sky from behind bank of cloud sir responded man well be about p'int maybe nearer p'int to south'ard of ah see ejaculated a caught sight for moment of small scarcely distinguishable speck appeared for instant then vanished again apparently in hollow between two wave few second later caught again presently have dancing unsteadily athwart field of instrument even then be unable to definitely settle whether be be not boat a man at side have remarked looked like boat be about size of boat a seen nearly end on there be indication of life movement about seemed to be floating idly to run of sea just at moment sun upper limb flashed into view over edge of cloud bank darting long gleam of golden radiance athwart heaving welter to schooner looked again half expecting to catch answering flash of wet oar blade there be nothing of kind to be seen undoubtedly however there be something out there something might prove to be boat determined to give overhaul without loss of time so carefully noting bearing distance cautioning lookout not to lose sight of for instant descended to deck straightway gave necessary order for making sail beating up to object being nearly dead to windward be full hour before reached little more than time sufficed to satisfy that really be boat further quarter of hour established fact that be none other than althea launch heart be full of foreboding a observed that although fired gun after gun to attract attention there be answering sign of life to be discovered on board although from moment when became visible from deck lindsay kept telescope constantly bearing upon yet depth at floated in water showed that be not empty lindsay suggested that crew might have be taken out of by craft have fallen in with that reason why floated so deep be that be half full of water must not agree with view there be buoyancy of movement about a rose fell upon surge be convincing proof to mind that be loaded down with something much more stable than water at length when have drawn up to within cable length of man on royal yard sang out that there be people in that be lying down in bottom of boat appeared to be dead will have to pick up ourselves said to lindsay let one hand stand by to drop into from fore chain with rope end a bring alongside lay topsail aback mr lindsay let jib sheet flow if please a sprang up on rail to con schooner alongside lindsay gave necessary order with topsail aback mainsheet eased well off schooner went drifting slowly down toward launch that a now approached looked old battered weather stained almost out of recognition steered so a to shave past close to windward a came drifting in under fore chain man who be waiting there with rope end dropped neatly into springing lightly along thwart into eye of deftly made fast rope to iron ring bolt in stem then turned looked at ghastly cargo that boat carried a gazed whitened to lip look of unspeakable horror crept into eye a involuntarily thrust out hand a though to ward off sight of dreadful object well might for a gazed down into floating charnel house turned deadly sick faint a much at what met sight a at horrible odour rose up out of filled nostril boat seemed to be full of dead lying piled upon one a though have be flung there yet first glance assured that of who be on board on night when parted company in gig be now missing captain doctor be lying side by side in stern sheet rest of ill fated party be lying heaped one upon other doubled up over thwart in other part of boat two mast be standing sail be lowered lay unfurled along thwart on top of oar boathook there be trace of food of kind to be seen water breaker be without bung to appearance empty so ghastly repulsive be sight boat presented that people hung in wind for moment two when ordered to jump down into pas body up over side rallied at once followed when led way skipper doctor be lying upon face a raised former turned over be difficult to say shocked most whether startling ease with lifted wasted body sight of withered drawn shrunken feature be so dreadfully altered that for moment be doubtful whether really be be not body of captain harrison held in arm passed up out of boat without difficulty then did same with doctor struck that latter be not quite dead sang out to lindsay to get very weak brandy water moisten lip of man a be passed up on deck for if life still lingered in of might be possible to save even now by judicious careful treatment ten of inanimate shipmate singled out a possibly alive with rest indication of dissolution be so unmistakable that deemed best not to interfere with to cover body with sail weight well down with ballast pig then pull plug out of boat cast adrift after reading burial service over poor relic of humanity that contained that however be duty might be deferred until have attended to who have be passed up out of a possibly alive therefore dropped under stern allowed to tow at full scope of complete coil of line while devoted to task of attempting to resuscitate other ten a have suspected doctor proved to be alive for after diligently painting blue shrivelled lip for about quarter of hour with feather dipped in weak brandy water eyelid quivered fluttering sigh passed lip followed by feeble groan eye opened fixing upon lindsay in glassy unrecognising stare water water for love of god murmured in thick dry husky whisper raised head gently rested against shoulder while lindsay held pannikin of weak grog to lip for few second seemed to be incapable of swallowing then like corpse galvanised into semblance of life suddenly seized edge of pannikin between clenched teeth a in vice held until have drained to dreg luckily there be two three spoonful left in a afterwards assured that draught must probably have be last ah ejaculated with sigh of unspeakable relief nectar nectar give more adding quickly not yet not yet single teaspoonful five minute oh god what anguish why did not die be that courtenay be dreaming where be captain whipped off jacket placed under head a allowed to sink gently back on deck for at moment lindsay whispered to that captain be coming round turned to render what assistance must captain harrison eye be now open be perfectly plain to that wandering glance be a yet devoid of recognition be not until ten minute later that began to evince understanding of who be what have happened first inquiry be after well being of who have be with in boat to felt constrained to give evasive encouraging reply a be so terribly weak that feared effect upon of straightforward answer giving actual state of matter got doctor down below put to bed a quickly a possible by time that be done other eight poor soul have also be successfully brought round when too be conveyed below made a comfortable a circumstance must permit done disposed of dead with due reverence then resumed search to windward with renewed hope arising out of happy discovery of launch be drawing well on toward eight bell in afternoon watch that day when man whom have stationed in cabin to keep eye upon captain doctor came up on deck with news that be now awake that captain wished to see at once obeyed summons be greatly rejoiced to find that of patient be much stronger wonderfully better in way for long sleep lost time in explaining that be ravenously hungry whereupon sent word forward to galley in le than five minute be busily engaged in disposing of bowl of strong broth prepared from two of small remaining stock of chicken that have found on board schooner when took moment that soup have disappeared captain began to ask question in reply to gave succinct account of adventure from moment when parted company from rest of boat when have finished paid high compliment upon what be pleased to term skill judgment have displayed throughout then recounted what have befallen launch from learned that entire flotilla of boat have remained together faster boat accommodating pace to slower craft until caught in tail end of hurricane with only reached strength of moderate gale when be perforce compelled to separate from time launch have seen none of others again appeared that launch deeply loaded a be suffered very nearly a much a in gig did few in who be capable of doing work having hand full in keeping above water sea have broken over heavily swamping upon several occasion destroying greater part of provision so that within three day after cessation of gale found without food face to face with starvation then followed terrible story of protracted suffering ending in many case in madness death of fruitless effort to work heavy boat finally of utter helplessness despair oblivion captain informed that have little hope that of other boat have outlived gale believed that if be still afloat must be found forty mile so to northward eastward of where have fallen in with launch in direction therefore continued search scouring whole ocean thereabout over area of fully one hundred mile square found none of other boat at length when have be cruising for full week captain who by time be rapidly regaining strength reluctantly gave order for to desist bear up for jamaica may a well here mention that none of other boat be ever again heard of there being little doubt that foundered during gale chapter seven daring act of piracy captain having thus sorrowfully reluctantly abandoned hope of finding missing boat at once became keenly anxious to reach port royal with possible expedition in order that painful business of trial by court martial for loss of frigate might be got over without delay therefore carried on night day so smartly did little schooner step out that on seventh day after bearing up found at daybreak within sight of turk island running in for windward passage before rather languid trade wind most of people be by time getting about once more so that with own men wyvern party deck looked rather crowded a went below to breakfast captain remarked upon expressing satisfaction that time be so near at hand when must exchange cramped quarter aboard schooner for more roomy one to be found in kingston hotel house of hospitable jamaica planter be still dawdling over breakfast in close stuffy little cabin of schooner when lindsay who be looking out for poked head through open skylight to report that there be two sail ahead ship brigantine hove to in somewhat suspicious proximity captain tucker who have be aloft to get better view of stranger declared belief that brigantine be none other than piratical craft crew of have pillaged destroyed wyvern how do bear mr lindsay demanded captain straight ahead sir answered lindsay how far distant be next question about ten mile sir replied lindsay be going at present moment asked captain lindsay withdrew head from skylight to glance over rail then replaced again to answer bare five sir must say wind seems to be growing more scant will heave log sir thank answered captain have doubt judgment be nearly enough correct for practical purpose mr lindsay let hand be sent aloft to keep eye on stranger tell to report anything unusual that may see will be on deck in few minute excusing slipped up on deck to have look at two craft upper canvas of be visible above horizon directly ahead of a lindsay have said one be full rigged ship while other be fine big brigantine be hove to in such close proximity that merest tyro might shrewdly guess at what be going on there just beyond horizon to make assurance doubly sure took ship glass went up on topgallant yard from whence be able to obtain full view of be a have expected boat be passing rapidly to fro between two craft left ship being heavily laden while left brigantine be light be still aloft working away with telescope when captain emerged from companion way at once catching sight of hailed well mr courtenay what do make of be undoubtedly case of piracy sir replied brigantine be rifling ship latter have appearance of british west indiaman whew skipper whistle a walked to rail looked thoughtfully down at foam bubble be gliding past bend if be indiaman will have passenger aboard remarked to doctor who at moment joined doctor seemed to acquiesce although spoke in so low tone must not catch word two stood talking together for few minute then captain hailed again what do judge distance from two craft to be mr courtenay asked good eight mile sir must say answered thank mr courtenay may come down sir returned skipper took to be hint that wanted accordingly slung glass over shoulder swung off yard on to backstay so descended to deck did notice whether seemed to have more wind than have inquired captain a joined pretty much same sir must think answered look a though must fall calm before long be afraid not such luck remarked skipper cocking weather eye skyward carefully studying aspect of heaven fervently wish must then must nab that fellow beautifully with boat might not try sir a be inquired eagerly have enough people be counting wyvern men who have doubt must volunteer hastened to add a eye fell upon three four of whom have taken out of launch who what with starvation still unhealed wound looked more fit for hospital than for boat duty thank mr courtenay answered skipper with smile evidently reading unspoken thought be afraid must not do in first place question whether really have sufficient men to justify such attempt in next place if have must still be desirable in opinion to defer attempt until be much nearer at present nobody can tell what be schooner be such small affair be in hope brigantine will take notice of until be within striking distance of while if be to send boat away must probably make off at once be rather trying to patience to remain idly aboard here drifting along at snail pace be convinced that be correct thing to do perhaps if show only few men about deck brigantine may be tempted to tackle ah if only must sir ejaculated with such intensity of feeling that captain laughed why declare be developing into regular fire eater exclaimed think of passenger sir of woman most likely said be thinking of sir answered captain through clenched teeth with sudden glitter in eye that foreboded evil to brigantine people must be fortunate enough to get within striking distance of turned away walked forward to where saw black peter whilom servant of midshipman mess aboard althea be one of whom have found still alive in launch have picked up wonderfully since then having become almost old self again be lounging on forecastle near port cat head with bare brawny arm crossed on rail a gazed ahead at two craft with be slowly closing peter said get grindstone ready green get cutlass up on deck give thorough good sharpening may want by by ay ay sir answered green with grin a shambled away to get weapon while peter bestirred with alacrity to prepare grindstone for work by drawing bucket of water pouring into trough few minute later peter eye gleaming with excitement one of ivory bared in broad grin of delight be whirling handle round at furious speed a green hand stood on side of stone pressing bare blade to fiercely buzzing disc continued to drift along at exasperatingly slow pace before languid breeze until have arrived within about four mile of two craft when skipper gave order to clear deck cast loose gun instructed that galley fire be not to be extinguished magazine opened until last moment apparently have doubt a to probability of brigantine attacking if so doubt be soon confirmed for when have reduced distance by mile lookout aloft reported that brigantine be filling away in minute two turned stern to rigged out studding sail boom went off before wind setting studding sail a went ah ejaculated captain be a feared smell rat doe not mean to wait for hoist out gig at once mr courtenay pull for life to ship too probably be case of wyvern over again if there be people left aboard must be saved let men go fully armed take more than boat proper complement a be not likely to have fighting to do while may want room in boat that can spare be by time moving so slowly that be unnecessary to heave to in order to hoist out gig time therefore be lost in getting into water within five minute of issuing of order by captain be afloat away from schooner with men picked crew consisting of strongest smartest men in ship bending back a drove beautifully modelled boat at racing speed through water have barely got away however before detected light wreath of smoke curling up between mast of distant ship at same moment observed that although mainyards be still braced aback seemed to be no longer hove to for a watched bow fell off until be nearly before wind went drifting slowly away to leeward sometimes heading in one direction sometimes in yawing about over place with difference of fully four point on side of general direction in be driving be most exasperating a although be drifting slowly be still drifting too in same general direction that be steering thus prolonging time must necessarily elapse ere must overtake while must greatly increase expenditure of energy on part of oarsman to enable to get alongside give way with will men cried rascal have not only set fire to ship have also cast loose wheel so that be now running away from to leeward harder pull sooner will catch better chance will there be for to put out fire remember for aught that know crew may be lying there upon deck bound hand foot utterly helpless to roast alive unless can get alongside in time to save appeal be not without effect upon men hard a have be pulling now put out available ounce of strength possessed brawny muscle standing out like rope upon bare arm while perspiration literally poured off stout ash blade bent like wand a lifted gig clean out of water at stroke tore along over low oil like ridge of swell at speed of dolphin leaving schooner a though be at anchor yet to eager impatience headlong pace seemed to be little better than crawl for light wreath of smoke have seen winding lazily upward from ship hull twining about spar increased in volume with startling rapidity while momentarily grew darker in colour until within ten minute of first appearance have become dense cloud of dun coloured smoke completely enveloping ship in heart of long forking tongue of flickering flame presently appeared have apparently set fire to poor old barkie in at least dozen place be burning like match wood pull men pull cried will be too late be well alight even now in quarter of hour will be blazing furnace if go on at present rate heaven above if there be people aboard what must feeling be now groan of sympathy burst from men in response to ejaculation of mine tugged at oar with strength energy filled with amazement be coming up with ship hand over hand fast a boat flew fire grew still faster presently saw flame climbing aloft by way of well tarred shroud until reached sail when there arose sudden blaze of flame among spar in two three minute shred of canvas have be consumed crawling tongue of fire be circling about mast yard feebly at first steadily increasing until be ablaze meanwhile ship deprived of canvas gradually fell broadside on to wind from position a gradually drifted round until lay bow on to by time be within three quarter of mile of now that be no longer driven to leeward by sail neared rapidly heart sank within a watched for destruction of sail have at first thought fortunate circumstance inasmuch a no longer blew away from now recognised a dreadful happening for stationary a now lay on water light draught of wind have full power to fan fire raged aboard by time that drew up under bow hooked on to bobstay be roaring mass of flame from stem to stern shinned up bobstay so got on to bowsprit from there made way into head must go farther for fore part of deck be sheet of fire upon living thing must exist for more than few second of unspeakable torment even where stood heat be unendurable must not see very far aft for flame smoke fore scuttle be open pillar of flame roared out of a from chimney on fire ten foot abaft be foremast ablaze from deck to truck immediately abaft again be blazing framework of what have shortly before be deck house beyond must see nothing one thing be quite certain be that if there be living people still aboard must not believe possible must be aft be there that must seek so scrambled down into gig again ordered men to back off pull round under ship stern lost time in obeying order be well for that exhibited so much alacrity for a swept round gave way ominous cracking rending sound be heard aboard ship moment later blazing foremast toppled over fell with crash into sea missing gig by bare boathook length look out for other mast will be comin ' down too in jiffy sang out one of men pulled for life alarm be false one main mizzen mast standing for full ten minute longer when got under ship stern became perfectly clear that living thing must be aboard for be even more fiercely ablaze aft than be for'ard whole of from mainmast to taffrail being veritable furnace of roaring flame with tongue jet of fire leaping from cabin window from port scuttle be impossible to board in direction must have simply be act of suicide to have attempted even outside planking right down to water edge be so hot that be unbearable to touch be beyond doubt that if fiend in brigantine have left crew portion of on board unhappy creature must have perished long ere have reached ill fated craft therefore took note of name kingston trader of bristol reluctantly gave word to haul off to safe distance to wait until schooner must run down pick up occurred about quarter of hour later moment that gig be fairly clear of water crowded sail after brigantine fast a schooner be pirate craft easily ran away from by sunset have vanished below horizon nothing further of importance happened to until arrival at port royal occurred on evening of following day when just saved last of sea breeze into harbour captain went ashore reported that same night dining with admiral afterwards did not go ashore until late next day a there be great deal of business have to attend to captain harrison be of course most anxious that trial by court martial for loss of frigate must take place a speedily a possible because must not hope for command until be over happened by quite exceptional piece of luck that there be enough ship in harbour to allow of being held at once be consequently arranged to take place on board flag ship on fourth day following arrival be of course only formal affair loss of frigate being due to cause quite beyond control unless indeed have chosen to run from two french ship instead of fighting so be soon over before noon be honourably acquitted side arm returned to with much congratulatory handshaking on part of officer present captain harrison doctor lindsay be invited to dine with admiral at pen that evening accordingly drove out with last of daylight arriving at house just a sun be setting over hunt bay admiral be very soul of hospitality be therefore large party several officer from up park camp sprinkling of civilian being present to take off salt flavour likely to prevail from too exclusive gathering of naval element a host laughingly put somewhat to surprise found lion of evening captain harrison having most generously made utmost of exploit in capturing french schooner subsequent search for frigate boat so many compliment be paid that being still young comparatively modest have much difficulty in maintaining self possession making suitable reply after dinner while rest of be chatting smoking over wine admiral apologising for being obliged to temporarily absent withdrew taking captain harrison with be absent for nearly hour when returned there be noticeable in skipper manner subdued joyous exultation that told of good news did not however learn what be until have left pen be driving back to hotel in kingston by dazzling silver radiance of tropical full moon prior to that admiral have said to a bade good night come see in office to morrow about noon mr courtenay want to have talk to a soon a be clear of pen ground fairly on road to kingston skipper said to mr courtenay do happen to have noticed that fine frigate minerva lying just inshore of flag ship yes sir have said be beauty be said to be wonderful sailer especially on taut bowline heard yesterday that captain be ashore down with yellow fever very true answered skipper poor fellow died morning admiral have be pleased to give command of to congratulate with heart sir said thought must read good news in face evening when returned to dining room be magnificent vessel sincerely hope that will have abundant opportunity to distinguish in hope sir that will take with thank courtenay thank exclaimed skipper evidently touched by sincerity of congratulation if can only manage to fall in with enemy frequently enough never fear will distinguish if live a to taking with must do so with greatest pleasure a matter of course be permitted to have own way believe from what admiral let drop to to night that have own plan for if so may rest assured that will be far more to advantage than must be accompanying to minerva let see how much longer have to serve before be eligible for examination only four day more sir answered with laugh then will go up a early a possible only four day more exclaimed skipper in surprise thought be more like two month only four day assure sir repeated um well suppose know best be answer given in musing tone to be presently added so much better so much better may ask sir whether remark have reference to inquired certainly courtenay certainly there can not be possible objection to asking be not bound to answer be replied skipper with laugh no continued must not tell anything except have reason to believe that admiral be very much pleased with behaviour that contemplates marking approval in manner be sure will be very pleasing to be must get out of gallant captain be sufficient to cause to pas sleepless night of pleasurable speculation prompt to second presented at admiral office next morning be at once shown into great man presence morning mr courtenay exclaimed a entered bring to anchor for minute two will ye until have signed paper then will be free to have talk to jenkins clear away chair for mr courtenay orderly sergeant reverently removed pile of book paper from chair dusted placed near open window amused by looking out upon busy scene in harbour while admiral proceeded to scrawl signature upon document after document there exclaimed with sigh of relief a signed last one pushed away from thank goodness that job be finished now mr courtenay by way captain harrison told last night that believed must soon be eligible for examination be that so yes sir answered will have served full time in three day more three day exclaimed admiral be that replied that be understand that be good seaman navigator resumed admiral suppose have fear of failing when go up for examination modestly replied that have not provided that be treated fairly have not lot of catch question put to just so responded admiral musingly navigation have doubt be all right continued of course can work ship when be ataunto suppose belonged let say to frigate at end of engagement found in command ship unrigged what be first thing must do considered for moment then proceeded to describe step must take under such circumstance admiral listening time intently uttering word giving sign of kind to indicate whether reply be satisfactory not until have finished when said very good mr courtenay very good indeed on whole have ever helped to fit out ship yes sir answered be aboard poor old althea during whole time that be in hand of rigger ah exclaimed heartily wished anywhere else than there will be bound have done good young gentleman have profited by experience can see will perhaps day be deeply thankful for knowledge then gained now supposing that found on lee shore in heavy gale of wind with mast gone what step must take for preservation of ship life of crew again replied at length stating must anchor moment that ship drifted into suitable depth of water letting go bower backing up with sheet anchor shackling remainder of bower cable on to of sheet anchor latter must then veer away upon to within few fathom of clinch suppose that having done ship dragged parted cable what then persisted admiral then sir said must only trust in god mercy while standing by to take care of ourselves other a soon a ship must strike good exclaimed admiral very excellent proper answer mr courtenay now continued have be asking question with purpose wanted to ascertain for whether must be justified in sending away in command of little schooner that took so cleverly think will believe will do exactly for work have in mind for sickness casualty together have played havoc among officer on station of late to extent have not nearly a many a want consequently be only too glad to meet with young gentleman like who have made good use of opportunity water be swarming with enemy privateer with sprinkling of pirate thrown in must appear from what skipper of unfortunate wyvern say must be put down sunk burned destroyed by mean can best be compassed better still captured therefore propose to fit out little schooner of yours to place in command of for especial purpose of suppressing pest incidentally capturing a many of enemy merchantman a can fall in with now how d think will like job replied delightedly that nothing must possibly suit better be inexpressibly grateful for confidence be about to repose in must leave nothing undone to prove such confidence be justified very well then be settled observed admiral genially will have schooner overhauled at once made ready for sea a quickly a may be then can go to sea for month there will be examination next month for must arrange to be in port then having passed a feel certain will will have commission be off to sea again to win next step chapter eight capture spanish indiaman schooner be turned over to dockyard people same afternoon duly surveyed on following day when presented at admiral office old boy handed list a long a main bowline setting several alteration deemed necessary to fit little craft for majesty service here mr courtenay just run eye over list tell what think of cried a passed to across table ran eye over new gang of rigging fore aft new bulwark six foot high fitted with hammock rail etcetera complete deck strengthened by doubling deck beam new coaming to hatchway so on so on until imagination have conjured up picture of trim little susanne transmogrified out of recognition so stiffened hampered by extra deck beam new rigging that must have reason to deem fortunate must ever succeed in screwing six knot out of on bowline admiral must have beheld face growing ever longer a worked way through precious list to end of for when have finished looked up at blankly laughed aloud a exclaimed why boy what be matter with face be a long a fiddle oh sir exclaimed in accent of despair surely will not allow dockyard people to completely ruin poor little hooker by making alteration addition to be new vessel sir understood from mate of that be first voyage be a sound strong a wood iron can make attempt to further strengthen can only result in destruction of sailing power then a to high bulwark sir what will be use of will not afford atom of protection while will make sag away to leeward like barge new gang of rigging admiral again burst out laughing there there said soothingly a held up hand to stop distress further mr courtenay will go aboard afternoon see how much of really requires before signing order meanwhile go aboard draw up list of such alteration addition a may think needful hand to when come down to have look round did so upshot of be that eventually wheedled admiral into consenting that schooner must remain absolutely untouched above deck only alteration made in consisting in extension of cabin forecastle accommodation enlargement of magazine substitution of iron ballast for stone frenchman have considered good enough to keep little hooker on foot have difficulty in gaining patron consent to retention of low light bulwark with craft be fitted admiral being strongly of opinion that ought to be high enough stout enough to shelter from musketry fire moreover think considered that looked altogether too rakish piratical a then be represented to that under certain condition might be advantageous rather than otherwise in end kind hearted old fellow indulgently let have way result of be that within fortnight of arrival be at sea again with little ship rechristened by name of tern smelling outrageously of fresh paint to unmitigated disgust of thirty six stout fellow who be quartered in forecastle young lindsay with many apology to captain harrison elected to unite fortune with mine rather than turn over to minerva be also given lad very quiet lady like young fellow named christie to bear company do duty a master black peter also came to conclusion that there must be more scope for talent aboard schooner than in frigate without asking anybody leave installed unceremoniously a matter of course in position of cabin servant weighed about five o'clock in evening with last of sea breeze very smart handsome privateer schooner named coquette being in company just managed to sneak through narrow channel between gun rackum cay when wind dropped dead left in east channel in midst of glassy calm rolling rail under to furious swell came sweeping along past plum point coquette be within biscuit toss of too be rolling tumbling about to extent minute expected to see roll stick away lasted for close upon two hour during sun went down in blaze of splendour lavish magnificence of colour such a have never beheld outside limit of west indian water then just a burning glory of west be fading into sober grey while hesperus beamed softly out with momentarily increasing effulgence in darkening blue of eastern sky gentle breeze came stealing to off land to schooner with mutual challenge to other gladly trimmed canvas away went hugging palisade closely for sake of smoother water until plum point be passed when gradually drew away from other coquette shaping course for morant point while edged away for island of martinique having formed opinion that of more knowing of enemy homeward bound merchant skipper might endeavour to slip out of caribbean between island of martinique dominica in hope of thereby eluding cruiser privateer most of chose neighbourhood of windward passage for cruising ground by end of second dog watch breeze have freshened so much that became necessary to hand royal topgallant sail soon afterwards wind hauled gradually round until became true trade wind piping up to strength of gale compelling to haul down single reef in big mainsail two reef in topsail under little beauty lay down thrashed through with life go of thorough bred racer coquette be still in sight eight mile away to windward famous a be for speed have supreme delight of observing that have head reached upon to extent of quite two mile now began to discover great advantage of having exchanged stone ballast for iron schooner being not only much stiffer under canvas also more lively than before be grand sailing weather breeze although strong being perfectly steady while sea be long regular allowing little hooker plenty of time to rise to a came rushing down upon with hissing crest agleam with sparkling sea fire be exhilarating to stand right away aft close by weather taffrail watch little beauty a tore along with breathless speed through dusky night sky be clear a bell save for few detached fleece of trade cloud came swooping along at frequent interval athwart star so that there be plenty of light to see by be a intoxicating a wine to merely stand abaft there a did feeling strong rush of wind past drinking in invigorating freshness coolness a deck heaved plunged beneath foot bending mast swayed reeled to fro truck sweeping long arc among dancing star wind piping high shrill through rigging a schooner leaped plunged irresistibly forward with storm of spray flashing in over weather cat head blowing aft a far a mainmast at buoyant upward leap of to meet sea while whole niagara of hissing foam with under stratum of whirling cloud of lambent green sea fire went swirling past lee rail at speed made one giddy to look at five bell in first watch saw fairly abreast at morant point then a night be clear breeze steady went below turned in nothing of importance occurred during next few day carrying on upon schooner to last stitch that must stagger under arrived off northern extremity of island of martinique exactly at midnight on fifth night after leaving port royal considered that have now reached cruising ground that there be consequently need for further hurry therefore shortened sail to double reefed mainsail fore staysail jib furling square canvas leisurely passed through channel between martinique dominica until be sixty mile to windward of island when headed little hooker to northward ratched a far a latitude of antigua then heaving about returning over same ground again first two day of cruising proved utterly barren of result time be by mean wasted for having sedulously exercised crew in working of gun in cutlas drill day during passage across from port royal now rigged up floating target gave little firing practice taking care to have man on royal yard to give timely notice of appearance of sail that perchance might be frightened away by sound of firing be soon gratified at discovery numbered among crew several very fairly clever marksman be within few minute of sunset on evening of third day of cruise that being again off northern extremity of martinique heading to southward lookout aloft reported upper canvas of what looked like large ship standing out close hauled between island dominica immediately got ship telescope went aloft with being just in good time to catch glimpse of royal head of topgallant sail of ship steering course must carry six mile to northward of having made a sure a must of bearing distance course descended to deck gave order to wear ship after executing manoeuvre hauled down canvas lay in wait for approaching craft schooner although under bare pole head reaching at rate of about two mile per hour estimated that distance of stranger from be then twenty five mile if be making speed of eight knot be fairly liberal allowance must afford ample time to drift fairly athwart hawse hoped to do undiscovered a believed that from cut of canvas be merchantman belonging to one of enemy be most anxious that must not take fright bear up for of island involving in long stern chase with possibly cutting out job at end of if must succeed in reaching refuge of harbour evening be fine with moderate breeze from about east north east not very much sea running swell however be high enough to hide for at least time although star soon beamed forth brilliantly while thin silver sickle of moon hung high aloft condition generally seemed fairly promising for success of course gave most stringent order that light must be permitted to show aboard schooner be careful to remain on deck to see that order be rigorously observed canvas of stranger seemed to grow upon horizon very slowly time of waiting for approach appeared long at length by four bell in first watch have drawn up to within about three mile of gave word to see clear for sheeting home hoisting away at moment notice for time have now arrived when if anything like proper lookout be being kept on board might be discovered at instant minute after minute passed still came steadily on heeling slightly to steady trade wind bowing solemnly over undulating swell with curl of white foam under bluff bow that made appear to be travelling at about three time actual speed have by time fore reached athwart fore foot be edging along at pace promised to place about mile to windward of by time that must be crossing stern now kept night glass immovably bearing upon watching for sudden yaw must indicate discovery of possible enemy in path have by time made up mind that be spaniard mere fact of adventuring thus alone instead of availing herself of convoy be to sufficient assurance that went heavily armed manned also suggested possibility that might be carrying exceptionally rich freight sometimes happening that skipper of such ship especially if chanced to be man of daring courage preferred to take chance of making voyage alone rather than risk being cut off from convoy by swarm of privateer picaroons hovered upon skirt almost from moment of sailing to of arrival people be by time at station with sheet halliard in hand ready to sway away at first word of order from be not so dark be able to see out of corner of eye nudge gesture of delight interchanged a great stately indiaman swept at length athwart stern dark silent a phantom up helm wear round shouted necessity for further concealment being now at end sheet home hoist away for'ard hold on aft with peak throat halliard until be fairly round starboard brace round in trim aft starboard headsheets now hoist away mainsail ah see at last there bear away steady there with lee helm man let come to just yet keep chase upon weather bow must not be allowed to get to leeward of mr lindsay just pitch shot athwart hawse a hint that wish to heave to shot be fired yet third stranger took notice whatever object of captain being apparently to bear away across bow so get before wind when of course cloud of studding sail that rig allowed must afford very important advantage over schooner be not going to permit that if must help soon became perfectly clear that must schooner having heel of ship although be soon under lee of latter with sail partially becalming ours at length finding that must outsail indiaman luffed close in under lee hailed in best spanish must muster ho ship ahoy heave to strike sir to britannic majesty schooner tern only reply to be rattling volley of musketry evidently aimed at a stood on weather rail just abaft main rigging for bullet whistling round head if heave to sir exclaimed angrily by heaven will fire into sink schooner ahoy who be now came hail in very indifferent english from ship in dim starlight must just make out shape of shadowy figure standing by mizzen rigging schooner sir be britannic majesty schooner tern a have already have honour to inform do intend to heave to sir will compel to fire into retorted in english time figure vanished from lee rail of ship without making reply to question annoyed at being treated in curious fashion turned face inward shouted let go off little mr lindsay just far enough to enable to fire at rigging then see whether broadside will bring fellow to sens leapt down off rail turned to walk aft when figure suddenly popped into view again aboard indiaman shouted senor fire for love of god have several lady aboard here will surrender rather than that must be hurt surrender sir surrender next instant heard same voice shouting in spanish order for crew to lay aft back mainyard a broad mainsail of ship collapsed shrivelled into massive festoon to hauling of crew upon clew garnet buntlines leech line preparatory to backing maintopsail too shortened sail in readiness to heave to at same moment a prize five minute later found with sword drawn dozen stout fellow armed to teeth at heel standing upon quarter deck of stranger with little crowd of well dressed men evidently spaniard curiously regarding following by light of couple of lantern that someone have placed on capstan head bueno exclaimed fine sailorly looking elderly man be well be undoubtedly english have therefore nothing to fear so saying stepped forward handed sheathed sword a doffed hat held out hand to receive weapon must not help saying pardon senor may be permitted to ask explanation of remark assuredly noble sir answered spaniard returning bow with dignified grace excited keenest envy explanation be perfectly simple fact be that when schooner suddenly appeared just now a though have risen from bottom of sea first impression be that have be unfortunate enough to stumble across path of detested countryman pedro morillo be determined to sink with ship on board rather than surrender to pray senor who be man pedro morillo of whom speak why must require countryman of own to surrender to why must be so very strongly averse to falling into power demanded ah senor be easy to see that be stranger to water must not need to ask for information respecting fiend morillo answered spaniard be cruel avaricious bloodthirsty pirate sparing man woman friend foe little be really known about senor for who meet rarely survive to tell tale there have be one two who by miracle have escaped be from that have gained knowledge that be better to perish by shot than to fall alive into hand be vessel by mean of perpetrates piracy brigantine very handsome wonderfully fast inquired suddenly bethinking of poor captain tucker story certainly senor that answer perfectly to description of accursed guerrilla have seen of late of course have not must not now be here for morillo be said to be especially vindictive against english inflicting most atrocious torture upon who fall into hand in dim light at first mistook schooner for guerrilla be why fired upon a did permit senor to express profound regret at so unfortunate mistake extreme gratification that be not followed by disastrous result at compliment of course exchanged bow once more after took liberty of addressing to very polite polished skipper few question with regard to ship coupled with hint be anxious to complete without delay arrangement for placing prize crew on board bearing up for jamaica prize then learned be dona dolores of cadiz spanish west indiaman of eleven hundred eighty four ton register homeward bound from cartagena maracaibo la guayra with very valuable general cargo twenty eight passenger ten of whom be lady captain manuel fernandez skipper be most polite anxious to meet view in way at least so informed conducted into ship handsome saloon introduced to passenger female portion of seemed to be frightened nearly out of wit be kind enough to promise that if must be agreeable to whole of people must assist prize crew to work ship suggestion however did not happen to be agreeable to so be compelled to explain a politely a must phrase that duty compelled not only to decline magnanimous offer to secure whole of crew officer men below also to remove arm of description from ship after if must give parole must afford much pleasure to receive a guest on board schooner must see that be bitter pill for haughty don to swallow be politely insistent so of course have to yield eventually did with best grace must muster hour later dolores with christie master mate in command ten of lad a prize crew be bowling along before wind with studding sail set aloft alow while tern followed almost within hail being intention to escort so valuable prize into port thus take possible precaution against recapture chapter nine encounter fight guerrilla on morning one succeeding capture of dolores schooner prize then being two hundred forty mile to westward of dominica sail be discovered at daybreak twelve mile to southward westward of beating up against trade wind close hauled upon starboard tack few minute later be made out to be brigantine paid scant attention to at first craft of rig being frequently met with in caribbean trading to fro between island when stranger almost immediately after rig have be identified tacked to northward a though with intention of getting closer look at at once scented enemy possessing of telescope forthwith made way into fore crosstrees for purpose of subjecting to rigorous examination wondering meanwhile whether by adverse chance stranger might eventually turn out to be notorious pirate morillo in equally notorious brigantine guerrilla have sooner got craft fairly within field of instrument than discovered conjecture to be correct score of trifling detail of rig equipment becoming instantly recognisable a identical with similar peculiarity already noticed by when before saw pirate vessel such be perversity of blind fortune under ordinary circumstance nothing must have pleased better than to meet audacious outlaw cut throat crew in clear sea to try conclusion with now be hampered with possession of valuable prize be most anxious to take safely into port while little force be seriously weakened by withdrawal of prize crew have be obliged to put on board dolores be therefore not wholly without apprehension under untoward circumstance witnessed approach of formidable brigantine must have preferred to have met if possible upon somewhat more equal term there be doubtless bent upon capture of dolores there be nothing for to prepare for a warm reception a be in power to give therefore descended to deck gave order to call hand clear for action at same time signalling to christie that stranger in sight be pirate that be to keep out of harm way during impending action keeping on upon course leaving in schooner to deal with intruder preparation be soon complete none too soon for approaching other a be at good pace space between brigantine narrowed very rapidly nevertheless there be time when be done to say few word to men so a anticipated that struggle upon be about to engage must be tough one called aft said lad have heard of atrocious pirate morillo who haunt water have heard something of doings from poor fellow belonging to wyvern who be picked up by when be searching for althea boat saw for yourselves specimen of handiwork in blazing hull of kingston trader unfortunate crew of ship only too probably perished with scoundrel gang of cold blooded murderer be aboard brigantine after what have heard seen need not tell what be likely to be fate of of of aboard dolores must be so unfortunate a to fall into hand be undoubtedly about to attempt capture of spaniard now be for to say whether will do so whether will send to bottom of sea instead be to be men put alongside of mr courtenay sir will soon show too be to be answered one of men rest instantly corroborating remark by such exclamation a ay ay will give gruel never fear well spoke tommy true for son so on very well said be answer expected now go to gun men see that make shot tell while clearing for action have also made sail shot ahead of dolores within five minute of moment when crew went back to gun be within mile of brigantine craft be then crossing bow tearing through long low swell like racing yacht with storm of diamond spray flashing up over weather bow at graceful plunge of into trough be beautiful vessel long low with enormously taunt raking mast phenomenal spread of canvas craft well worth fighting for thought what proud day must be for if perchance must be fortunate enough to capture take triumphantly into port royal harbour be now well within range so sang out to lindsay who be looking after matter on forecastle to know whether nine pounder pivot gun be ready ready sir bearing dead on brigantine be answer then heave shot across rascal fore foot at once shouted man hoist away ensign at flash of gun continued to fellow who be standing by peak signal halliard a word left lip there be ringing report smart concussion springing upon weather rail be just in time to see shot neatly strike water immediately under brigantine figure head spray from leaping up leaving dark stain upon foot of foretopmast staysail well aimed exclaimed exultantly if will all do a well a throughout fight lad will soon give good account of while be still speaking there came answering flash from brigantine at same moment boldly ran up black flag at gaff end ere report have time to reach nine pound shot crashed fair into bow raking fore aft carrying off top of unfortunate helmsman head a flew out over taffrail poor fellow sank to deck in heap without groan without quiver of body sprang to wheel just in time to save schooner from broaching to anyone hurt there for'ard shouted for saw two three men stooping a though to help someone yes sir answered one of men poor tom parson have have chest tore open doubt be over with must avenge then shouted back load again give between wind water if can be already reloading gun even a spoke minute later piece again rang out shot striking brigantine covering board fair square close to midship port making splinter fly in fine style be now so close to that must see that deck seemed to be full of men thought heard shriek a shot struck reply be almost instantaneous whole starboard broadside being let fly a shot into wind in stay once more shot five nine pounder came crashing in through bulwark filling air with perfect storm of splinter happily hurting one large jagged splinter struck in left shoulder lacerating flesh rather badly one of men sprang to assistance quickly bound up up helm man let go off until starboard broadside bear said to man who now relieved at wheel adding in shout to crew stand by starboard gun fire a come to bear upon bang bang bang modest broadside of three six pounder spoke out almost simultaneously did not see shot strike anywhere almost immediately afterwards down came maintopmast peak of mainsail main masthead have be shot away dolores at least be safe for pirate having lost after sail must now be compelled to make running fight of before wind must enable christie to haul wind get out of danger men raised cheer at lucky shot determined not to throw away least advantage gave order to port helm bring schooner to wind on starboard tack so getting weather gage of brigantine a rounded to antagonist fell off two craft thus presenting larboard broadside to other being ready fired at precisely same moment report of two discharge being so absolutely coincident that did not know brigantine have fired until shot came smashing in through bulwark wounding five men rendering one of six pounder useless by dismounting so close be to other by time before must load again brigantine have passed astern of none of gun must bear upon hers upon crew be doing utmost to keep close to wind with peak of mainsail down must not lay higher than within about eight point determined to take utmost advantage of comparatively helpless position while might for lucky shot on part might make case ours at moment therefore signed to helmsman to put down helm at same moment gave order ready about helm lee nimble little schooner spun round upon heel a smartly a dancing girl presenting starboard broadside to brigantine stand by starboard broadside fire a gun bear shouted a swept round almost square athwart antagonist stern six pounder once more spoke out one shot striking stern of fair amidships smashing wheel to piece while other two took in larboard quarter at angle must have caused to traverse very nearly three quarter of length of deck before passed out through starboard bulwark brigantine no longer under control of helm fell off until be running dead before wind when pirate trimmed yard square moment later saw number of hand in fore rigging swarming aloft moment that starboard broadside must be brought to bear upon fired next moment bowsprit foretopmast went former with flying jib towing under bow while latter dangled to leeward by rigging with royal towing in water alongside lad having by time reloaded starboard gun again fired hulling pirate then by order left gun to clear away wreck for encumbered a now be with jib under bow square canvas hanging over side schooner be gradually coming to although helm be hard weather ended fight for when next found time to look at brigantine have studding sail boom rigged out on side people be busy getting studding sail upon while straight wake that be making showed that have already contrived to rig up temporary contrivance for steering seeing at once hove schooner to went to work to repair damage for now have have opportunity to discover stuff of senor morillo be made struck a by mean improbable that moment have repaired damage must return attack afresh altogether fight have not lasted longer than eight ten minute at utmost during short time have lost two men killed outright while six including be wounded four of severely christie recognising that duty be to take care of prize have hauled wind when passed ahead of be now about mile to windward with maintopsail to mast when saw that fight be over filled away came booming down to sweeping close athwart stern heaving to close to leeward of a bore down upon saw in mizzen rigging speaking trumpet in hand when be within hailing distance hailed to ask if must be of assistance adding that one of passenger professed to be doctor have chivalrously offered service must be required be good news to indeed for being small craft carried surgeon for proffered help poor wounded lad must have be obliged to trust pretty much to chance such unskilled help a must have afforded among hailed back expressing thanks for offer at once sent away boat for medico not caring that christie must run risk of sending away boat crew out of own scanty company in about ten minute boat returned bringing in little swarthy burnt up specimen of spaniard most portentous looking case of surgical instrument although by mean handsome senor pacheco soon proved to be warm hearted skilful ministering to wounded with utmost tenderness with touch a light gentle a woman when have attended to others requested to oblige so far a to bind up shoulder afresh at once did informing at same time that be exceedingly ugly wound must be particularly careful lest gangrene must supervene in case if life must be saved at expense of arm must have reason to esteem exceptionally fortunate remained on board chatting with for about hour after have coopered up very kindly promised to visit other patient again in afternoon if must send boat for declined invitation to breakfast upon plea that have already taken first breakfast while be still too early for second be full of polite compliment congratulation upon having beaten off such desperado a morillo be known to be graphically described consternation have prevailed in cabin of dolores when brigantine be identified a notorious guerrilla contrary to expectation greatly to relief pirate did not return to attack a measure of precaution in case idea must occur to morillo later on a soon a damage be repaired stood to northward westward day shaping fresh course for morant point at sunset that evening sun went down in heavy bank of cloud have be gathering on western horizon afternoon slowly working up against wind almost certain precursor of thunderstorm a dusk closed down upon wind began to grow steadily lighter until by end of first dog watch air be so scant a to barely give steerage way night closed down a dark a wolf mouth so dark indeed that standing at taffrail must only barely with utmost difficulty trace position of main rigging against intense blackness of sky a for dolores lost sight of altogether must only determine position by dim uncertain haze of light faintly streamed above high bulwark from skylight of saloon by momentary gleam of lantern passing along deck blinking intermittently through open port intense darkness lasted only about hour however when sheet lightning began to flicker softly low down upon western horizon causing image of ship now two mile astern of to stand out for instant like cunningly wrought model in luminous bronze against ebony blackness of sky behind with setting in of lightning last faint breathing of wind died away altogether leaving spaniard to box compass in midst of glassy calm sweltering heat of be partially relieved by flapping of big mainsail a schooner heaved languidly upon low swell came creeping down upon from north east night seemed preternaturally still silence enveloped being so profound that noise of ship occasional heavy flap of canvas accompanied by rain like pattering of reef point creak of jaw of mainboom of gaff overhead on mast jerk of mainsheet tautening out suddenly to heave of schooner kicking of rudder gurgling swirl of water about along bend only served to emphasise while broke in upon with irritating harshness altogether disproportionate to volume so intense be silence outside ship one seemed constrained to listen intently for sound startling cry to come floating across glassy water to break suspense anxiety of waiting despite one better judgment for sound caused discordant noise inboard to quickly become acutely distressing at least such be feeling at time feeling that possibly may have grown out of increasing smart of wound be now giving so much pain have little hope of getting sleep night especially a heat below be absolutely stifling gradually so gradually that approach be scarcely perceptible storm worked way in direction brighter glimmer increasing frequency of sheet lightning alone indicating that be nearing until just about eight bell in dog watch first faint muttering of distant thunder became audible while vast pile of sooty cloud overhung seemed momentarily to assume new more menacing shape a now almost continuous quivering of lightning revealed to anon low down in western sky there flashed out vivid sun bright stream of fire distant a be lighted up whole sea from horizon to horizon tipping ridge of swell with twisted line of gold transfiguring distant dolores into picture of indescribable fairy like beauty a brought sharply into momentary distinctness sail spar delicate web of rigging tracery low deep rumble of thunder followed be quickly succeeded by flash nearer more dazzlingly brilliant than first now storm seemed to gather apace lightning flash following other so rapidly that very soon booming rumble of thunder became continuous a did blaze of sheet lightning be now flickering among cloud in dozen place at once bringing out into powerful relief titanic mass weirdly changing shape varied hue converting erstwhile cimmerian darkness into quivering supernatural light caused ocean to glow like molten steel revealed object belonging to ship a distinctly a though have be illuminated by port fire so vivid continuous be light that not only distinctly saw fin of shark fully mile distant be also able to watch leisurely progress until have increased distance so greatly a to be no longer distinguishable continuous quivering flash of sheet lightning among cloud afforded of superbly magnificent spectacle beauty of display be soon still further increased by wonderfully rapid coruscating discharge of fork lightning between cloud cloud a though fleecy giant be warring with other exchanging broadside of jagged white hot steel thunder accompanied discharge giving forth fierce crackling sound far more closely resembling that of irregular volley of musketry than did deep hollow booming crash followed spark like stream of fire that lanced downward from cloud to ocean few minute more storm be right overhead with lightning hissing flashing about thunder crackling crashing booming aloft with vehement intensity of sound came near to being terrifying whole atmosphere seemed to be aflame noise be that of universe in process of disruption suddenly schooner seemed to be enveloped in vast sheet of flame at same instant that ear splitting crash of thunder resounded about there be violent concussion when few second later recovered from stunning stupefying effect of terrific thunderclap be to become aware that foremast be over side stump of fiercely ablaze there be necessity to pipe hand for watch below now came tumbling up on deck alarmed at shock in few minute have bucket passing along fortunately be able to effectively attack fire before have taken very firm hold quarter of hour of hard work saw flame extinguished be narrow escape for schooner hand of most serious part of be loss of foremast completely disabled for moment went to work however to save sail yard rigging so on attached to shivered

fortunately enemy hove in sight to take advantage of crippled condition consequently arrived safely in fort royal harbour in due course on eighth day after occurrence of accident forthwith received full share of congratulation condolence from sundry from admiral downward congratulation of course being upon good luck in having effected capture of so valuable prize a dolores while condolence be offered pretty equally upon having met with accident having failed to capture morillo wonderful brigantine chapter ten senor jose garcia meanwhile wounded shoulder have be giving great deal of trouble

again be kept busy from morning to night attending to hundred one detail connected with refit nevertheless found time to present for examination having passed with flying colour next day found full fledged lieutenant thanks to very kindly interest taken in by genial old friend admiral to same kindly interest be also indebted for friendly overture made by hospitable invitation without number received from planter other person of importance belonging to island have duty to attend to wound to think of therefore very sparingly accepted invitation came pouring in upon nevertheless made many new friend enjoyed short spell ashore amazingly admiral be a have already said particularly kind to in way in nothing more so than in unstinting commendation bestowed upon conduct during first brief cruise in tern yet despite be not difficult for to perceive that reflection that morillo gang be still at large greatly nettled must not find surer way to continued favour than by finding capturing destroying audacious pirate accordingly made what inquiry must relating to whereabouts of fellow headquarters also instructed black peter to try luck in same direction up to within twenty four hour of time when schooner must again be ready for sea neither of have met with slightest success when however twenty four hour have dwindled down to ten received welcome intimation that black peter have at length contrived to get upon morillo trail information be brought to by black peter who having secured afternoon liberty broke by coming aboard about ten thirty instead of at six o'clock pm presented

presented at admiral office timing so a to catch old gentleman immediately upon arrival from kingston when having reported tern a ready for sea received order to sail forthwith also written instruction in reference to especial object of cruise be by mean surprised to find indicated that while doing utmost to harass enemy be to devote especially to task of hunting down cutting short career of morillo pirate gang of cut throat weighed shortly before noon beating out against sea breeze roared through rigging with strength of gale when be fairly clear of shoal gave order for black peter prisoner of previous night to be brought on deck minute two later fellow half caste spanish negro stood before when beheld what manner of man be must readily believe to be on term of friendly intimacy not only with morillo with human scum of caribbean rascal presented not altogether unpicturesque figure a stood in brilliant sunlight poising with careless easy grace of practised seaman upon heaving lurching deck of plunging schooner for be attired in white shirt with broad falling collar loosely confined at neck by black silk handkerchief blue dungaree trouser rolled up to knee secured round waist by knotted crimson silk sash head be enfolded in similar sash fringed end of drooped upon left shoulder be fellow countenance that riveted attention despite be of ugly enough to have commanded attention anywhere to natural ugliness there be added further repulsiveness of expression bespoke character notable alike for low unscrupulous cunning most ferocious cruelty for fact that have be encountered upon ground whereon morillo of gang must have dared to show must readily have believed that not only have pretty intimate knowledge of movement haunt of pirate that be probably distinguished member of gang well fine fellow pray what may name be demanded in english a be led up halted before too mosh speakee anglish promptly replied shrugging shoulder until touched great gold ring adorned lobe of ear spreading out hand palm upward toward what do speak then demanded still in english for somehow did not for moment believe rascal statement espanol answered with shrug flourish of hand good then remarked in spanish will endeavour to converse with in own tongue what be name be called jose garcia senor answered be born continued interrogatively in city of havana thirty two year ago senor be reply then if be spaniard consequently enemy of great britain what be doing in kingston demanded ah senor exclaimed protestingly be enemy of great britain although born spaniard have lived in jamaica for last fifteen year earning living a fisherman fifteen year repeated strange that must have lived so long among english speaking people without acquiring knowledge of language still more strange that must have spoken english last night in grog shop in presence hearing of steward how do account for so very singular circumstance a that fellow be so completely taken aback that for few second must find reply then seemingly convinced that further deception be useless suddenly gave in exclaiming in excellent english ah sir forgive have be lying to with what purpose demanded instinct perhaps answered with short uneasy laugh moment be brought on deck recognised be aboard british ship of war smelt danger ah remarked afford illustration of adage that guilty conscience need accuser ' what have be doing that must smell danger upon finding aboard british man o ' war have be doing nothing feared that intended to impress answered fellow so be returned not for long if behave when have rendered service require of will be richly rewarded according a serve faithfully otherwise what be service sir demanded with slight uneasiness of manner last night boasted that must at anytime find morillo unless happened to be at sea said now want to find morillo tell where may meet with will receive fifty pound within hour of moment when will have carried ship prize into port royal harbour morillo who be morillo demanded trying unsuccessfully to assume air of ignorance indifference at mention of name be pirate of whom be speaking last night answered sharply for suspected that be about to attempt further deception with must have be drunk indeed to talk about man of whom have never heard exclaimed with hollow pretence at laugh do mean to tell that know morillo anything about demanded angrily now take time to consider answer want truth truth be determined to have by one mean have attempted to deceive once beware how make such attempt second time now what do know of morillo pirate nothing fellow answered sullenly there be shrinking of together sudden grey pallor of lip told how severe tax upon courage be under circumstance to utter lie think again said pulling out watch will give five minute in to overhaul memory if by end of time fail must endeavour to find mean to refresh will do demanded fellow with scowl entirely failed to conceal trepidation remark have caused made reply rose walked to binnacle took squint at compass then long look aloft a turned over in mind idea have suggested to asking whether must be justified in carrying into action believed now pretty well understood kind of man have to deal with took to be treacherous unscrupulous lying scoundrel coward withal a indeed such people generally be be cowardice proposed to play upon in order to extort from information desired to obtain in word plan be to seize up threaten to flog if refused to speak only difficulty arose from doubt a to how ought to proceed in event of threat failing to effect desired result must be justified in actually carrying threat into execution for after fellow really might not know anything about morillo remark to black peter on previous night might be nothing more than boastful lie if be flogging might give must not make tell that of have knowledge somehow have conviction that must tell great deal must be glad to know if only chose so finally decided that if continued contumacious must risk giving stroke two being guided in after conduct by behaviour under lash by time have fully arrived at resolution five minute grace have expired returned to where fellow still stood guarded by jack with drawn cutlas well demanded be to be will speak freely must compel have nothing to say demand to know by what authority have be kidnapped brought aboard accursed schooner be reply did not tell few minute ago that be impressed answered have be brought aboard here in order that may render service be convinced can render if will when service have be faithfully performed will not only set free again will also handsomely reward know what service be that require of once more will will not render repeat have nothing to say put in iron again if choose can not make man tell doe not know answered garcia a spoke turned away seeming to consider that dialogue be at end here not so fast joker interrupted seaman who have fellow in charge seizing garcia unceremoniously by back of neck twisting round until faced again ai good manner sonny to turn back upon superior until tell that have done with that can go half breed turned upon custodian with snarl drawing back of upper lip exposed whole row of yellow fang while hand went a from long habit to girdle a though in quest of knife look of contemptuous amusement with sailor regarded cowed fellow again faced meekly enough now said little fit of petulance being over let ask once more for last time will will not afford information require senor englishman will not be spaniard morillo be spaniard nothing can do will induce to betray fellow countryman be that plain enough for quite answered almost a satisfactory a though have replied to question have a good a admitted that can if choose tell want to know now remains for to see whether there be mean of compelling to speak take away for'ard keep sharp eye upon continued to sailor who have in charge a go pas word for carpenter to rig grating perhaps taste of cat may loosen gentleman tongue cat exclaimed half breed wheeling suddenly round a be being led away do mean that be going to flog certainly unless choose to speak of own free will answered very well then will speak blood be on own head hissed through clenched teeth will direct how to find morillo when have found will amply avenge insult to audacity in seeking will make life unendurable torment to that will pray with tear of blood to put out of misery will be there to see suffer to laugh in face a refuse to grant boon of speedy death be right answered cheerfully must take risk of fate have so powerfully suggested now that matter being disposed of will be glad to hear from how be to find friend fellow regarded in stupid surprise for moment a though must not understand failure to terrify by vaguely awful threat then with gesture interpreted a indicative of final abandonment of to destruction seemed determined to court said do know anything of grenadine senor answered nothing except that exist that form practically unbroken chain of islet stretching between island of saint vincent grenada be so assented one of most important of islet be situate about thirteen mile to northward of grenada be called cariacou be supposed to be uninhabited be nothing of kind morillo have taken possession of established quite little settlement upon there be snug harbour at south western extremity affording perfect shelter concealment for brigantine round shore of harbour have built storehouse residence for people pray only that may be at home to give fitting reception be much obliged for kind wish replied drily now just one question more be harbour of speak difficult of access be there rock shoal at entrance inside none whatever can safely be entered on darkest night be answer good returned will do for present senor garcia many thanks for information will observe have accepted a true word that have spoken must like to think everything over again satisfy that have made mistake because warn that if have will be shot on instant may go be forthwith marched away placed in close confinement below for interview with have convinced that fellow be a malignantly spiteful a snake must willingly destroy ship hand if opportunity be afforded after retired to cabin got out chart set course for island of cariacou course must just comfortably lay with yard braced taut against lee rigging sheet well flattened in trade wind be blowing fresh enough to compel to furl topgallant sail be steady under whole topsail mainsail little hooker drove ahead over long regular ridge of swell at good honest nine knot pace hour after hour a steadily a chronometer sighted island sixteen mile distant on evening of fourth day out at once shortened sail hove to in order might carry out little plan have concocted during run across chapter eleven cariacou afterward a soon a darkness have closed down sufficiently to conceal movement filled away again upon schooner stood in until be within two mile of southern extremity of island also form southern headland of harbour mentioned by garcia when having run well in behind head again hove to launching dinghy proceeded toward harbour mouth crew being two men who like be armed to teeth pulled in with muffled oar in due time arrived within stone throw of shore coast here proved to be precipitous rocky swell set round southern extremity of island breaking with great violence upon shore rendering landing absolutely impossible moreover night be so dark that although in other respect admirably suited for purpose be impossible to clearly see where be going two three time inadvertently got so close to rock that narrowly with utmost difficulty avoided being dashed upon at length however rounded southernmost head entered harbour almost immediately afterwards made out narrow strip of sandy beach upon landed without difficulty leaving two men to look after dinghy lay off few yard from shore ready to pull in again take aboard at moment notice if necessary having landed ascended rather steep grassy slope seventy eighty foot high stood to look about harbour be quite spacious affair entrance being about mile wide while harbour seemed so far a must make out in darkness to be quite two mile long general shape of inlet immediately suggested to conviction if a garcia have informed morillo really have established headquarters here must be almost certain to have constructed couple of battery one on headland to defend place at once set about task of ascertaining how far conjecture might happen to be correct toward eastward from where have halted land continued to rise in sort of ridge culminating in what have appearance of knoll struck that if battery really existed on side of harbour ought to find not far from spot accordingly wended way toward a best must forcing passage for through grass scrub with most unpleasant conviction might at moment place hand foot upon venomous snake reptile of sort finally after about twenty minute of most unpleasant scrambling found alongside knoll a have more than half suspected now proved to be nothing le than rough earthwork mounting four thirty two pounder devious path have brought to face of battery so have to clamber up steep face of slope before must get view of interior did entering battery through one of embrasure when found standing upon level platform constituting floor of battery keeping carefully within deep shadow of gun crouching down upon hand knee at once proceeded to reconnoitre place presently made out couple of hut smaller of concluded must be magazine while larger probably accommodated garrison be in utter darkness however first impression be that be untenanted to make quite certain crept very softly up to larger building finding closed door listened intently at for few second heard nothing save sough of night breeze through branch of cotton wood tree that grew close at hand presently detected sound of snoring in interior a listened grew momentarily more distinct unmistakable sound certainly emanated from more than one sleeper thought that there be probably at least three four of at work hearing be not quite keen enough to enable to accurately differentiate sound thus arrive at correct number of who emitted be however sound asleep therefore not likely to be disturbed by slight noise moreover hut be well to windward sough swish of wind through cotton wood seemed powerful enough to drown such slight sound a might be likely to make so stole softly across open area to nearest gun at once proceeded to carefully spike with aid of nail leather covered hammer with have provided despite deadening effect of leather hammer still made distinct clink to ear sounded loud enough to wake dead few second anxious work sufficed to effectually spike first gun a nobody appeared to have heard then proceeded to spike next next until have rendered four of harmless done slipped out of same embrasure by have entered successfully made way back to beach to spot off dinghy lay awaiting presence of battery on south head of harbour entrance convinced that there must also be similar structure on north head a soon therefore a found once more aboard dinghy headed straight across mouth reaching northern side in about twenty minute hour search enabled to find battery be looking for proved to be pretty exact counterpart of one have already visited here again succeeded in spiking four of gun without discovery regarded a fairly successful night work so a must have to be stirring pretty early in morning now returned to schooner having hove to with head off shore turned in have good night rest at daybreak on following morning be called by black peter within ten minute be on deck be then eight mile off land with schooner heading to eastward at once wore round bore straight away for harbour mouth clearing for action making arrangement a went hour run with wind well over starboard quarter brought off mouth of harbour at once entered a soon a be fairly inside schooner be hove to two boat be lowered carrying eleven men armed to teeth in addition to officer in command one of boat be commanded by christie other by lindsay mission be to capture two battery commanding harbour mouth blow up before spiked cannon must be again rendered serviceable brought telescope to bear upon battery a soon a be far enough inside harbour to get sight of be amused to observe that there be terrible commotion going on in presence have be promptly discovered first attempt to open fire upon have resulted in discovery that gun be spiked of course be by mean easy matter to estimate strength of garrison of battery calculated that must probably total up to about thirty men to battery a must be nearly quite spaniard felt that boat crew have sent away must be quite strong enough to satisfactorily account for be disappointed for although pirate opened brisk musketry fire upon lad moment that be fairly within range latter simply swarmed up hill carried two battery with rush pirate retreating by rear a tern clambered in through embrasure moment that boat shoved off from schooner side saw that spirit of emulation have seized upon two crew for went away at racing pace action throughout be evidently inspired by same spirit result of be that two battery be destroyed within five minute of other while whole affair from moment when boat shoved off to moment when arrived alongside again be accomplished within hour quarter too without loss whatever on side even wound severe enough to disable recipient pirate be le fortunate loss in two battery amounting to five killed at least seven wounded severely enough to render incapable of escaping seven be brought on board by lad secured below immediately upon arrival meanwhile have not be idle for while boat be away have employed time in making with aid of telescope most careful inspection of piratical stronghold be obliged to admit to that must be difficult to imagine still more difficult to find spot more perfectly adapted in way for purpose harbour be spacious enough to hold fleet almost completely land locked so once inside ship be perfectly concealed while fact that opening faced in south westerly direction rendered absolutely safe in weather so far a enemy be concerned two battery at harbour mouth be so admirably placed that ought to have proved amply sufficient for defence of place doubt must have so proved in other hand have proper lookout be kept that have fallen so easily to be fault not of morillo of man whom have left in command at bottom of bay inlet for partook of nature of latter rather than of former lay settlement that morillo have established consisting of le than seventeen building there be also small wharf with brig lying alongside moment that boat arrived alongside ordered men out of have dropped astern when sail be made stood down toward settlement with ensign flying at gaff end a drew near be able to make out that here too presence be productive of tremendous amount of excitement presently fire be opened upon from battery of six nine pounder have be constructed on rising ground immediately to rear of wharf while black flag be boldly run up on flagstaff close at hand did not suit purpose however to engage in running fight therefore bore down upon brig discharging port broadside at battery when be within pistol shot of running alongside grapnelled done man jack of swarmed ashore lindsay holding wharf with dozen of lad while christie with remainder of crew made rush for battery took ten minute sufficed to spike gun blow up magazine done found master of whole place inhabitant having taken to flight moment that third battery fell into hand now proceeded to make leisurely inspection of place with result that discovered to be quite miniature dockyard with storehouse mast house rigging sail loft complete in fact there be possible convenience for repairing refitting ship be there be also large magazine full of ammunition quite armoury of musket pistol cutlass several dismounted gun ranging from six pounder to thirty two pound carronades while storehouse be well stocked with provision store of possible description one large building immediately facing wharf be apparently used a receptacle for plunder for found several bale of stuff have evidently formed part of cargo cargo there be surprisingly little of be accounted for later on by discovery that brig be full of plunder to hatch in addition to building be in use a store there be two most comfortably fitted up a barrack while at back of settlement well up side of hill stood little group of seven handsome timber dwelling house standing in own garden nestling among lofty tree clothed hillside having secured complete possession of place first care be to have small amount of plunder lay in storehouse gun conveyed on board tern sent down main hatchway job took about two hour during few shot be occasionally fired at from wood a bullet fell short did not trouble ourselves to go in pursuit of individual who be firing upon next act be to blow up magazine thus destroying whole of pirate stock of ammunition when have be successfully accomplished went systematically to work set fire to whole of storehouse barrack one after other until whole place be in flame finally turned attention to seven dwelling house on hillside proved to astonishment to be most elegantly sumptuously furnished in respect only peculiarity noticeable being lack of uniformity among article contained in of house plainly showing that have be gathered together at different time from different place evidence of female influence be abundantly present in house from assumed that formed abode of morillo most important subordinate during short sojourn in port six largest of building set fire to leaving seventh a refuge for unfortunate woman who be doubtless concealed at great distance in adjacent wood burning of house completed destruction of settlement be accomplished absolutely without casualty of kind on side waited until house be well ablaze then retreated in good order to harbour few shot being fired at here there from ambush a went a be well out of range took notice of in due time arrived once more on wharf next business be to take possession of brig did forthwith christie with eight hand going on board a prize crew be beamy bluff bowed motherly old craft named three sister hailing out of port of spain be evidently british built whole appearance being that of sober honest slow going trader such a one constantly meet with doing business among island hold however be full of booty conjectured that morillo have through agent purchased in perfectly straightforward manner for use in conveyance of booty from cariacou to such port a afforded opportunity for disposal without asking of too many inconvenient question be work of few minute for prize crew to transfer few belonging from schooner to brig done got craft under way stood out to sea brig under stitch of canvas that must show to breeze while schooner under topsail foresail jib have to heave to at frequent interval to wait for first intention be to send brig to port royal in charge of prize crew alone remaining off island in tern until morillo must appear a must be certain to do sooner later in brigantine little reflection however caused to alter plan to determine upon escorting three sister to destination lest must haply encounter morillo on way in case fate of defenceless prize crew must probably be too dreadful to bear thinking about a soon therefore a be clear of harbour set course for jamaica away went cheek by jowl brig with roaring breeze over starboard quarter reeling off six half knot per hour with a much fuss splutter a though be going fifteen for first two day nothing of importance occurred on third night out from cariacou however to be strictly accurate about two o'clock in morning being watch on deck night dark somewhat overcast two sail be sighted on starboard bow heading to eastward on port tack steering course must bring close to one of be craft of considerable size other small vessel from moment that two fact became apparent made up mind that one be prize of other though of two be captor there be just then mean of ascertaining smaller craft be perhaps privateer big one prize quite a likely big craft might be frigate small craft prize in case however behoved to be very careful for one of two be almost certain to be enemy if happened to be also captor of other be more than probable must tackle from moment therefore when first sighted never allowed night glass to be off for more than few second at time when first discovered be hull down only just distinguishable in darkness a two vague blot of black against lowering gloom of night sky trade wind be piping up rather stronger than usual that night while stranger be approaching other on nearly straight line consequently closed other rapidly within about twenty minute from moment of discovery be able to make out that one of twain be full rigged ship while other seemed to be large brigantine few minute later discovered that ship be showing much broader spread of canvas than brigantine thus proving latter to be faster craft of two be scarcely likely therefore that ship be frigate if not that must be merchantman doubtless prize of brigantine at point question suggested to might not brigantine be morillo craft appeared to be about same size so far a be possible to distinguish in darkness if so must fully account for boldness with held on upon course instead of heaving about endeavouring to avoid possible enemy for doubtless have made out almost if not quite at same time a have discovered most fervently hoped might be a surmised for if so must have fellow at advantage inasmuch a must doubtless have put fairly strong prize crew on board ship must proportionately weaken own crew full of hope that ishmael of sea might be about to place within power caused hand to be called having first made sail sent to quarter gunner at same time descending to magazine sending up plentiful supply of powder shot by time that be ready brigantine consort have neared to within couple of mile two craft closing meanwhile doubtless for purpose of communicating instruction that be quite prepared to fight aboard brigantine be perfectly evident for must see that deck be lit up with lantern light of shining through port enabled to ascertain that mounted six gun of side craft held luff be now quite clear that brigantine be much faster more weatherly of two walking away out to windward of big fellow a though latter have be at anchor moment that made sail in answer to challenge now ensued little bit of manoeuvring on side with twofold object of discovering whether stranger happened to be enemy if so to secure weather gage of have advantage however a be running free must haul wind at moment advantage kept by hauling up on starboard tack then heaving in stay with topsail aback waiting for brigantine to close presently did ranging up within biscuit toss of lee quarter be now so close to that despite darkness be quite possible to make out detail be with feeling of mingled disgust disappointment discovered that might be certainly be not be beautiful notorious brigantine be however in probability enemy seemed to that so far a must make out in uncertain light of partially clouded star have french look about so with idea of securing advantage of first hail sprang upon rail a ranged up alongside hailed in spanish ho brigantine ahoy what vessel be that belle diane french privateer what schooner be that came reply also in spanish of most execrable kind uttered with unmistakable french accent britannic majesty schooner tern monsieur to ship must request to surrender will be under painful necessity of blowing out of water answered firmly persuaded of policy of rendering a formidable a possible to one enemy well meant endeavour proved to be signal failure enemy be not in case to be so easily frightened le anglais mille tonneres heard frenchman in brigantine main rigging exclaim a waved clenched fist in air then retorted in what doubtless believed to be purest english vat be dat say monsieur angleeshman if surrendaire vill blow out of de vattar have have sacre be monsieur who vill blow dat footy leetle schooner of yours into ze sky if surrendaire promptement eh right monsieur blaze away then a soon a like retorted in best attempt at french must muster then to own people who be at quarter stand by starboard gun wait until roll toward now fire imposing broadside of three gun rang out at precise moment when brigantine rolled heavily toward exposing deck to fire heard shot go crashing through bulwark to accompaniment of sundry yell scream told have not be altogether ineffective almost at same instant three of gun replied muzzle be so deeply depressed be just then rolling so heavily toward that shot struck water between neither saw felt more of meanwhile square canvas being aback antagonist swept rapidly ahead of seeing filled upon schooner bore up under brigantine stern raking with port broadside a crossed stern immediately hauling wind making half board across stern again to regain position upon weather quarter starboard gun be by time reloaded gave three of double shotted a recrossed tremendous clatter with howl shriek followed discharge showed that have wrought considerable amount of execution among frenchman there be something gone aboard of what be ca make out exclaimed lindsay who be standing close beside ah continued see what be now be mainboom that have shot away can see outer end of towing overboard see be paying off with loss of after sail can no longer keep luff be even a lindsay have said have shot away brigantine mainboom thus rendered big powerful mainsail useless so that despite lee helm that be giving be gradually falling off until within minute two be nearly dead before wind placed almost completely at mercy for be now enabled to sail to fro athwart stern raking alternately with port starboard gun with nine pounder a well while must only reply with two gun people have run out through stern port still although disabled be by mean beaten plucky crew keeping up brisk fire upon from two gun until by lucky broadside dismounted even then must not give in despite relentless fire that continued to pour into contrived after time to get two more gun into position with renewed fire upon a briskly a ever sort of thing however must not continue for very long fire be so hot gun be so well aimed that fairly drove plucky fellow from only two gun that must bring to bear upon within couple of minute of cessation of fire lantern be waved aboard brigantine someone hailed that surrendered while at same moment sheet halliard be let go canvas came down by run a further intimation that have have enough of upon of course at once ceased firing ranged up alongside prize hailing that must send boat aboard then for first time discovered that large boat be so severely damaged that of must float whereupon lindsay offered to board prize in dinghy with two hand take possession accordingly little cockleshell of craft be dropped over side in le than two minute chum hailed to say that be safely aboard that execution wrought by fire have be terrible brigantine having lost nearly half crew captain chief mate being among killed added that brigantine long boat be undamaged that proposed to hoist out with assistance of prisoner send to by two hand who have manned dinghy if must look out to pick up in event of being unable to bring alongside to of course agreed quarter of hour later boat be safely alongside with prize crew of twelve picked men tumbling trap into meanwhile what have become of three sister big ship looked round for behold there be about mile to windward bearing down upon in company phew thought here be nice business while have be playing game of hammer tongs down here big ship doubtless manned by strong prize crew have run alongside old brig taken yet can be so christie have eight hand with believe fellow must make stout fight for before giving in can not understand will soon see if have captured will have to recapture be then turning to men who be busy securing gun repairing such slight damage a have be inflicted upon rigging said avast there with gun load again lad for may have to fight once more in few minute here be big ship running down upon look very much a though have taken brig fill topsail let draw headsheets getting sufficient way upon schooner tacked stood toward new comer passing close under stern of ship with intention of hailing before must get trumpet to lip figure sprang into ship mizzen rigging christie well known voice hailed tern ahoy be mr courtenay aboard ay ay answered be here mr christie what be doing aboard there why answered christie be in charge know seeing busy with brigantine thought might a well try luck at same time so managed somehow to put brig alongside ship well just took well done mr christie shouted before must get out word voice be drowned in roaring cheer that tern gave vent to a heard news told in christie usual gentle drawling tone by time that cheer have died away two craft have drawn so far apart that further conversation be for moment impossible chapter twelve become victim of villainous outrage making room christie presently hauled to wind hove to ten minute later presented on board schooner brought alongside by ship gig manned by four of ship crew to report own share in incident of night from report gathered that like at first have mistaken french privateer for morillo brigantine have also arrived at conclusion that ship be prize of latter have kept keen watch upon movement of schooner until have become apparent that intended to attack supposed pirate when at once turned attention to ship with object of ascertaining whether with phenomenally slow craft a three sister anything must be done with believed that with luck must a felt pretty certain that attention of ship prize crew must be fully occupied in watching manoeuvre of brigantine schooner trusting to hauled wind until have placed brig in position merest trifle to windward of course that ship be steering when taking chance of having thus far escaped observation clewed up furled everything afterwards patiently awaiting development of event now ensued very curious amusing thing having transpired that french prize crew of ship have seen brig have at once jumped to conclusion that be prize to schooner curious behaviour of three sister have puzzled not little at outset when opened fire upon brigantine knew at once that must be enemy supposing that prize crew of brig whom rashly judged to be own countryman have taken advantage of preoccupation to rise recapture vessel immediately bore down to assistance lucky mistake enabled christie to fall alongside ship without difficulty when laying aside for nonce gentle lady like demeanour led eight men up ship lofty side over high bulwark on to deck where nine of laid about with such good will after about minute resistance astounded frenchman be fain to retreat to forecastle where in obedience to christie summons forthwith flung down arm surrendered at discretion then clapping hatch over stationing two men with drawn cutlass by a guard christie proceeded to liberate imprisoned crew of ship discovered to be british west indiaman black prince homeward bound at time of capture two day previously with exceedingly valuable general cargo then sent own men back to three sister have time be lying alongside secured to indiaman by grapnel brig then cast off two craft forthwith bore down upon to report fight between ourselves brigantine being by time over by time that own brigantine damage have be repaired be daylight be ready for making sail once more before doing so caused whole of frenchman to be removed to schooner where be first put in iron then clapped safely under hatch after visited first belle diane then indiaman must confess be astonished when beheld effect of fire upon former must scarcely credit that so much damage have be inflicted by six pounder in so short time stern above level of covering board being absolutely battered to piece while shot have also ploughed up deck fore aft in long scoring gash so close together crossing other in such way a showed what tremendous raking have received began action with fifty seven men told out of eighteen have be killed outright remainder with one solitary exception more le seriously wounded looking upon path shot have ploughed along deck be only surprised that of people be left alive to tell tale in addition to five of twelve gun be dismounted rigging have be good deal cut up be now of course knotted spliced by lindsay people be very fine vessel of three hundred forty four ton measurement oak built copper fastened copper sheathed to bend very willow drawing only eight foot of water very beamy with most beautiful line spar looked enormously lofty compared with own a stood on deck gazed aloft canvas have evidently be bent new for voyage have only arrived in west indian water week previously from brest black prince be stated to be first prize having given diane pretty good overhaul satisfied that hull be sound gave lindsay instruction then proceeded on board black prince where arrived in good time for breakfast where made acquaintance not only of skipper fine grey headed sailorly man named blatchford also of thirty two passenger eighteen of whom be male while remainder be of gentler sex wife daughter mostly of male passenger there be young child among fortunately appearance seemed to create little flutter of excitement among petticoat also not little astonishment apparently for overheard one of matron remark to behind fan why be scarcely more than boy black prince be noble ship of twelve hundred fifty ton frigate built only nine year old splendidly fitted up full to hatch of coffee tobacco spice other valuable also have reputation for speed have induced skipper to hazard homeward voyage alone instead of waiting for convoy poor old fellow be of course dreadfully cut up at misfortune for having be in enemy hand more than twenty four hour be recapture in legal sense of term a such be entitled to salvage for however unfortunate a be existing state of affair be of course vastly better than of few hour before interrupted in bemoanings to thank for having rescued out of hand of philistine french privateersman informed that must be duty to take into fort royal received news with equanimity explaining that even have not insisted on must certainly after recent experience have availed of escort to return to kingston there await convoy breakfasted with passenger then leaving christie aboard a prize master returned to schooner made sail in company arriving at port royal five day later without further adventure admiral be a might be expected immensely pleased at appearance with three prize in company still more so when reported to discovery destruction of morillo headquarters have done well boy wonderfully well better even than expected of said shaking heartily by hand go on a have begun venture to prophesy that will not be long before will feel justified in giving t'other swab ' pointing a spoke to single epaulet to say be delighted at reception very feebly express feeling overwhelmed a kind old fellow spoke such generous word of appreciation encouragement of course knew that have done well regarded success a due fully a much to good fortune a to own effort be almost overwhelmed with joy at so full complete recognition of effort so astonished indeed be must only stammer something to effect that success be due quite a much to loyalty with christie lindsay have seconded gallantry with men have stood by a be to own individual merit be right boy remarked admiral be glad to hear speak like doubt what say be true doe not detract in least from value of own service always think better of officer who be willing to do full justice to merit of who have helped promotion will not come to le quickly for having helped shipmate to theirs have done well will see to that be adequately rewarded christie lindsay by getting step by getting somewhat better craft than little cockleshell in have already done so well be of opinion that require be opportunity by piper will have old gentleman kept word for when went aboard tern on following day dined slept at house of friend little way out from kingston night christie lindsay met with beaming face information that former have got step a master while lindsay have received acting order a lieutenant pending passing of necessary examination only drawback to good news be intelligence that man garcia have mysteriously disappeared during night leaving not trace of whereabouts behind hour two later went ashore waited upon admiral at office in accordance with instruction received from on previous day upon being ushered into presence at once began to question relative to quality of diane be able to speak nothing good of for indeed what have seen of during passage to port royal have convinced that be really very fine vessel in respect splendid sea boat wonderfully fast have doubt thoroughly wholesome comfortable craft in bad weather just so commented admiral when have finished singing praise what have said quite confirms own opinion of be that in capable hand may be made exceedingly useful moreover be more nearly match for morillo brigantine than be little tern eh well lad have be thinking matter over have made up mind that be good enough to purchase into service so will have seen to at once of course will give command of will want considerable amount of attention at hand of shipwright after mauling that gave will supervise everything will hing without approval so see to that spoil notice that mount six six of side now propose to alter arrangement by putting four long nine in place of six six with eighteen pounder on forecastle with such armament a crew to match ought to be able to render exceedingly good account of do think of idea replied truthfully that considered excellent in way then launched into discussion of minor detail with need not weary reader at end of went aboard tern paid off crew preparatory to being turned over to shipwright along with prize happened that just about time there be exceptionally heavy press of work in dockyard for there have be several frigate action of late resource of staff be taxed to utmost to effect repair following upon such event to get ship ready for sea again in shortest possible time with result that such small fry a diane tern be obliged to wait until heaviest of work be over frigate be again ready for service thus happened that although contrived to worry dockyard superintendent into putting few shipwright aboard diane three week passed still brigantine be very far from being ready for sea during time made headquarters at mammy wilkinson hotel in kingston that being hotel especially affected by navy men although be seldom there planter big wig of island generally proving wonderfully hospitable literally overwhelming with invitation to take up abode with about time have mentioned happened that certain alteration be being effected aboard brigantine be especially anxious to have carried out according to own idea therefore spent whole of day for several day in succession at dockyard going up to kingston at night sleeping at hotel be during interval one night about ten o'clock negro presented at hotel inquiring for upon making appearance in entrance fellow full blooded african dressed very neatly in white shirt white duck trouser scrupulously clean for wonder approached ducking head respectfully

moment until fetch cap so saying left fellow hastened to room where closing door opened chest furnished with supply of money then closing locking chest hastened away to where negro be waiting for a passed through hall several men of acquaintance be lounging there smoking one of hailed with hillo courtenay whither away so fast lad be on tip of tongue to explain to errand bethought just in time that if lindsay have be doing anything foolish might not care to have fact blazoned abroad so kept own counsel merely replying be called out upon small matter of business so effected escape from into dark street oh here be exclaimed a negro emerged at appearance from deep shadow of hotel portico now then way be mr lindsay in town jail sar no be in de harbour lock up answered guide dis way sar be not so bery far harbour lock up queried where be did know that there be such place oh yes sar dar be follow sar show de way sar answered negro right heave ahead then said away went little way down

minute winding hither thither penetrating deeper deeper into labyrinth of dark crooked lane gradually edging nearer to harbour while a thought working way considerable distance to westward presently guide who have be humming negro melody to lifted up voice in louder key began to chant praise of certain lubly chloe whose eye be like star whose breaf ' be like rose fellow have wonderfully melodious voice in listening to a strode easily along at swinging pace improvising verse after verse in honour of unknown chloe lost bearing a well a count of time be only brought back to consciousness of present by suddenly finding head closely enveloped in what seemed to be blanket while at same instant foot be tripped from under so must have fallen forward for restraining influence of blanket of pair of arm gripped mine tightly behind back so be instantly overpowered effectually precluded from making slightest effort to free then before have time to realise what be happening be lifted off foot despite desperate struggle ineffectual effort to shout for assistance carried in through open doorway flung upon face upon ground where someone at once knelt upon securely lashed hand behind back other individual at same instant lashing ankle firmly together dere dat will do peter t'ink can not do much harm now remarked voice of whilom guide a fellow spoke be relieved of very considerable weight have be pressing upon holding down then be rolled over on side a blanket enveloped head very nearly suffocated be cautiously removed felt prick of something sharp against left breast same voice

of be now dyeing front of white shirt so moment be manifestly inopportune for attempt at escape resistance even therefore submitted with best grace must muster to insertion of gag between teeth reserving to myself right to make ruffian smart for outrage upon at first available opportunity before gag be placed between teeth contrived to repeat inquiry for explanation nebber mind massa courtenay will find out about dat in good time sah answered leading spirit of twain with reply be perforce obliged to be content for moment having made perfectly secure two negro squatted down upon haunch with much deliberation produced from pocket short clay pipe plug of tobacco knife after carefully shredding tobacco charging pipe proceeded to smoke with much gravity in perfect silence struck that possibly might be waiting for someone whose appearance upon scene must hoped throw light upon cause of extraordinary outrage give inkling a to what sort of end might expect to adventure meanwhile having nothing else to do proceeded to take stock of place at least a much of a must command in cramped constrained position there be little nothing however in what saw about of character calculated to suggest explanation of motive for seizure building be simply one of low one storey adobe structure thatched with palm leaf such a then abounded in lower quarter of kingston be usually inhabited by negro half breed population of place interior appeared to be divided into two apartment by unpainted partition of timber framing decorated with cheap gaudy coloured print tacked to wood at four corner a good many of picture be of religious character in most of blessed virgin figured more le prominently took that legitimate occupant of place be roman catholic furniture be of simplest kind consisting of table in centre upon burned cheap tawdry brass lamp illumined apartment large upturned packing case covered with gaudy tablecloth serving a table against rear wall of building three four old straight backed chair have evidently come down in world for be elaborately carved upholstered in frayed faded tapestry few more cheap gaudy coloured print adorned wall heavy curtain so dirty smoke grimed that original colour pattern be utterly unrecognisable shielded unglazed window two three hanging shelf one of supported dozen so of dark green bottle depended from wall be floor upon lay be simply bare earth rammed hard thick with dust swarming with flea a quickly discovered whole place reeked of hot stale smell seems to pervade abode of people of uncleanly habit two negro smoked silently gravely for full half hour about end of time captor slowly with due deliberation knocked ash from pipe rising to foot yawned stretched in so doing eye fell upon shelf upon stood bottle sauntering lazily across room laid hand upon one of bottle placed on centre table then lifting up cloth covered packing case revealed shelf within interior from withdrew water monkey two earthenware mug dish containing most uninviting looking mixture presently guessed from odour to be composed of salt fish boiled yam mashed together cold placed upon table still without speaking pair drew chair up to table seating opposite other proceeded to make hearty meal helping alternately with finger from central dish washing down mixture with mug of rum water be still thus agreeably engaged when distant sound of rumbling wheel clattering hoof became audible rapidly drawing nearer accompanied by persuasive shout ejaculation of negro driver dat be de boy moses wid de cart bepects remarked negro whose name have not yet learned what drefful row de young rascal make dat nigger wo nebber learn discreshun continued wiping finger carefully on flaming red handkerchief drew from breech pocket peter grunted unintelligible reply next moment vehicle pulled up sharply at door cessation of clatter being immediately followed by entrance of negro lad eighteen year of age brought de cart a tole caesar remarked be right be sar remarked caesar hitherto unnamed negro loftily when did ebber know to fail in what undertooken eh sar nebber sah nebber answered moses appreciatively ' so dat be de gebberlum be pointing at with chin a lay huddled up on floor yes sar be answered caesar curtly in tone of voice be evidently intended to cut short further conversation now peter continued if have finished yo

silent grunted affirmative stooping a did so seizing leg while caesar raised by shoulder in powerful arm remarking a did so massa courtenay jus ' listen to if please sah be goin ' to take for nice pleasant lilly dribe in cart be goin to sit on so dat may not fall out now still have knife wid if feel begin to struggle will be under de mo painful necessity ob drivin ' into to keep quiet so hope dat will lie most particular still durin ' yo little journey sabbe nodded head dat right den resumed caesar now peter up wid away go therewith two black rascal raised carefully carrying into open placed in mule cart covered with thick layer of green forage caesar coolly carrying out threat to sit upon drove away chapter thirteen in power of enemy drive be most unpleasant one for for cart have spring boy moses like jehu drove furiously fortunately lasted only five twenty minute so however at end of period pulled up on what guessed from running of vehicle sound of rippling water to be sandy beach conjecture proved to be correct for when presently be hauled out from underneath forage stood upon foot more dead than alive found that be on margin of tiny creek cove about three quarter of mile to westward of outskirt of kingston small canoe lay hauled up on sand in bottom of craft be carefully deposited after be run down into water when caesar peter sprang lightly into giving final shove to seaward a did so paddled away leaving moses cart to make best of way back to town lying upon back in bottom of canoe with face turned upward to star be able to see that be heading eastward toward kingston harbour about hour later canoe glided up alongside small felucca of thirty ton burden be made fast by painter canoe secured to satisfaction negro caesar climbed over felucca low bulwark heard bare foot pattering along deck until a supposed reached companion when sound became muffled be presently lost then caught sound of voice caesar others so indistinctly that be unable to distinguish what be being said conversation however be brief for in three four minute tread of caesar bare foot again became audible accompanied by of others then discovered that conversation of be subject be being conducted in spanish seemed to suggest have fallen into hand of enemy though why spaniard must wish to kidnap so very unimportant personage a myself must not for life of imagine unless have adopted new system of warfare one element of consisted in kidnapping a many of enemy officer a possible without much reference to importance otherwise of course must soon see for a lay there in bottom of canoe cogitating to effect became aware from remark interchanged by on deck be about to be transferred to felucca if spaniard have adopted novel system of kidnapping british officer must doubtless find of fellow officer on board in same plight a presently caesar swung over felucca bulwark down into canoe when at once seized by shoulder calling upon friend peter to lend hand proceeded to pas up over felucca rail to three spanish speaking individual who stood on deck stretching out arm to receive be very careful not to hurt unnecessarily during process of transfer from circumstance derived certain amount of comfort inference being might be motive in thus seizing bodily harm to be intended having safely transferred from canoe to deck of felucca abductor next conveyed below to hot stuffy little cabin of craft where outstretched upon locker be barely long enough to accommodate length left without word returned to deck carefully closing door drawing over slide at head of companion ladder then a carefully closing flap of hitherto open skylight done conversation with caesar satellite be continued in leisurely desultory fashion for about hour burden of being unintelligible to through closed skylight when two negro descend into canoe shove off wishing others quick pleasant passage then followed leisurely movement on deck accompanied by throwing down of rope two creaking of block parralls few quiet ejaculation a of men pulling hauling clink of windlass pawl loud slatting of loose canvas in strong land breeze be blowing finally a latter sound ceased felt felucca heel strongly over to port heard increasing gurgle wash of water along bend under counter of little craft accompanied by occasional call from for'ard to helmsman by knew that be under way standing down harbour toward port royal by by felt felucca come upright there be warning cry on deck sudden violent flap of canvas overhead felucca heeled slightly over to starboard by knew that have squared away jibed over be running out of harbour few minute later felt beginning to rise fall over gathering sea a skimmed away off land motion steadily grew stronger merging into swift floating forward rush a sea came up astern of followed by long dragging pause a crest swept past presently companion slide be pushed back door at head of ladder be flung open man one of who have helped to convey below descended into cabin phew senor be warm down here exclaimed in perfect english a stood gazing thoughtfully down upon must of course make reply a be still gagged probably observed dreadful condition that gag lashing round wrist ankle have reduced to for continued a stooped over be now at sea a be therefore impossible for to raise alarm effect escape think may safely make little more comfortable look terribly distressed amigo order be imperative that be to be delivered safe sound there a removed gag cast off lashing ought to be more to liking for pity sake ejaculated give something to drink that horrible gag have suffocated something to drink with pleasure senor what will be plain water grog ' a english call think have better be grog for can not recommend water carry in scuttle butt so saying went to little cupboard alongside companion ladder produced therefrom water monkey two tin pannikin bottle of rum of placed on cabin table there senor help freely little josefa that contains be yours thanks senor replied a poured out with shaking hand benumbed finger generous modicum of rum filling up pannikin with evil smelling water drink to better acquaintance so saying emptied pannikin at gulp set down upon table now senor continued a companion in turn proceeded to help to pledge perhaps will kindly inform first whom have honour to address secondly why have be brought aboard felucca thirdly to what place propose to convey assuredly senor answered spaniard will afford much happiness to gratify so very natural reasonable request in first place senor be excellency most humble servant juan dominguez captain of felucca in next place be here by order of excellent friend patron don pedro morillo captain of brigantine guerrilla in third place be conveying also by don pedro order to cariacou island understand have already visited under certain memorable circumstance so that be be be kidnapped not in accordance with wild scheme of spaniard to cripple too active navy by robbing of officer that must lay hand upon in order that cowardly bloodthirsty pirate might at leisure in safety wreak revenge upon for injury that in exercise of duty have done speaking in frankness believe be coward confess that information thus calmly communicated to by spaniard who be most probably naturalised british subject caused blood to run cold for have heard quite enough of morillo to feel tolerably well assured that if motive in causing to be kidnapped be revenge must not be satisfied with merely shooting stabbing to heart must undoubtedly exercise utmost ingenuity to render passage out of world a lingering painful a possible from account be quite adept in art of torture seem disturbed at intelligence amigo remarked companion gazing upon with smile of amusement well continued perhaps have cause to be who know have heard that be who taking advantage of friend absence at sea visited cariacou destroyed poor morillo battery building there carrying off brig everything else that crew must lay hand upon hope for sake that morillo be misinformed that will be able to demonstrate to complete satisfaction entire freedom from complicity in very ill advised malicious transaction may then be content to simply hang at yardarm if fail to convince phew sincerely pity do indeed senor thanks very much retorted with best attempt at sarcasm must muster for began to perceive that fellow be amusing by endeavouring to frighten did not intend to afford very much gratification in way pity be infinitely comforting to especially a be evident to that feeling be genuine may ask whether share in present transaction be undertaken purely out of friendship for morillo be being carried out upon business basis well to be strictly truthful there be little of answered dominguez why do inquire if be not indiscreet question now thought wonder whether question of be intended to indicate that be open to bribe bribe to put ashore again safe sound provided that make sufficiently liberal offer perhaps attempt may be worth making will at event enable to judge what be chance so far a be concerned so replied to be candid with friend dominguez occurred to that have undertaken little adventure a much with object of turning more le honest penny a for other reason now supposing must experience difficulty in satisfying morillo upon point that just now referred to what do imagine will be result something exceedingly unpleasant for assume since be good enough to express pity for something exceedingly unpleasant repeated with laugh well yes be one way of putting certainly be very mild way so ridiculously mild that suggests idea of what be in mind when said pitied flaying alive be unpleasant so be being roasted alive over slow fire so be gradual dismemberment finger toe at time then hand foot so on until only trunk remains be unpleasant exceedingly so must imagine from what have seen of behaviour of who have undergone operation at friend hand in contingency just now suggested fancy that morillo must do best to devise something considerably better worse whichever please to call for shuddered feeling of horrible sickness swept over strive a must must not help a inhuman wretch spoke with evident gusto of torment to might failing morillo ability to devise still greater refinement of cruelty be subjected by time that have finished speaking have succeeded in rallying courage sufficiently to remark thanks reply to question leaf nothing to be desired in way of lucidity now supposing must happen to feel repugnance to delicate attention on morillo part that have just alluded to what inducement must be sufficient to persuade to 'bout ship land on wharf at kingston instead of at cariacou ah replied dominguez be question be not to be answered off hand there be several point occur to a requiring careful consideration before must name sum must induce to act a wish of course will understand have personal animus against have never injured therefore have feeling of revenge to gratify by delivering into morillo power on other hand morillo be friend be always glad to oblige when can particularly when a in present case be well paid for now if be to act a suggest must be thwarting instead of obliging must convert from friend into enemy think that be now in position to understand what mean mean must be compelled to disappear a completely a though ground have opened swallowed because be one of morillo characteristic that while be staunch generous friend be also bitter relentless enemy never forgives so long a enemy life will never rest until have be revenged upon reminds that if must succeed in coming to arrangement must not regard matter between morillo a settled warn that will have to maintain ceaseless watch for so long a live will never relax effort to get into power afloat with greatly superior force may reckon to be reasonably safe ashore very well now what have told will enable to understand position in relation to matter at present be friend have enemy in power if aid abet enemy to escape become enemy will necessitate prompt retreat to other side of world to begin life afresh with haunting feeling go where will do what may be never safe that alone point to necessary demand on part of considerable sum very considerable sum from a compensation for many serious inconvenience danger must inevitably follow upon falling in with proposal be not there be mate miguel lad luis for'ard of must require very substantial inducement to lead to fall in with view altogether must say that what propose must probably cost well at least ten thousand pound ten thousand pound ejaculated nonsense man must be dreaming why must no more raise ten thousand pound than must fly no queried coolly not even to save from not even to save from utmost refinement of cruelty that friend morillo be capable of devising answered decisively pardon senor can scarcely believe retorted dominguez with hateful sneering smile of have be exceptionally fortunate in matter of prize since arrival in water feel convinced that in prize money alone must now have very handsome sum standing to credit then if be correctly informed have made many friend be for instance great favourite with admiral who must doubtless be willing to advance very considerable sum to help out of present exceedingly disagreeable predicament have doubt there be others who must be equally willing to help if position be clearly laid before man alive can not do exclaimed angrily so far a prize money be concerned suppose three thousand pound be very utmost that posse a for admiral be more to than other officer be certain that must absolutely refuse to advance single penny piece for such purpose a suggest to do so must simply be offering inducement to others like to kidnap officer then hold to ransom tell what be continued may rest assured of if harm befalls if in short deliver into morillo power admiral will make suffer a severely for a morillo must possibly do so there be between two fire if care for opinion be that admiral be likely to prove worse enemy to than even morillo over business possibly might be case if admiral happened to discover have be implicated in replied companion with exasperating composure then see never will have taken possible precaution against how about caesar peter two negro who brought aboard here inquired pshaw answered dominguez impatiently do suppose must inform against not why be well never mind what be except feel perfectly safe so far a be concerned very well retorted time will show whether confidence in be well founded not meanwhile position be such that three thousand pound be outside figure can offer a ransom may take leave a please then fear amigo that day be numbered replied dominguez composedly a rose from seat preparatory to returning on deck be sorry for continued very sorry must think of before else three thousand be not nearly tempting enough possibly when have have little longer to think over will be able to see way to make very considerable advance upon sum there be plenty of time josefa be grand little ship have one fault be slow expect that will reach cariacou in le than full week have therefore six seven day before in to consider matter must see way to raise ten thousand at time before sight island will be happy to talk with again meanwhile there be bunk will turn in at once must prefer to take turn on deck first thanks answered with alacrity delighted to discover be not to be confined to cabin think will go on deck for hour so to get breath of fresh air be rather close down here a will returned dominguez amicably enough have fear of attempting to escape be scarcely likely think to go overboard offer a meal to shark do smoke can recommend a drew from locker box of cigar helped to one mechanically lit dominguez following example then politely offering precedence up companion ladder accepted courtesy made way somewhat stiffly up steep step for limb be still cramped from compression of ligature have be bound after what have passed through be inexpressible relief to to find once more breathing free pure air of heaven with star spangled sky arching grandly overhead be brilliantly fine night morning rather for be by time past two o'clock be sky cloudless save for small shred of thin wool like vapour skimming rapidly athwart star trade wind be blowing moderate breeze felucca be bruising along on easy bowline with long swinging plunge soaring over low jet black glistening surge at pace of five half knot perhaps with perfect thunder of roaring breaking sea under bluff bow belt of winking sparkling sea fire couple of fathom wide sweeping past lee rail swirling into broad short wake that trailed behind land be still clearly in sight on port quarter range of liguanea mountain towering high into star lit sky gradually sloping away to eastward in direction of morant point beside dominguez there be one other figure visible on deck that of man at helm long thin weedy looking figure so far a must make out in ghostly starlight one who have evidently used sea for time if one might judge by easy floating poise of figure on plunging deck a stood on weather side of tiller with tiller rope lightly grasped in right hand swaying rhythmically to leap plunge of little hooker a dominguez followed out on deck stepped aft to small dimly lighted binnacle glanced into made brief remark in low tone to silent helmsman walked forward took long look ahead on bow then returning aft excused to for turning in upon plea that must soon be watch on deck so dived below left left thus to fell to mechanically pacing short deck of felucca for few minute smoking thoughtfully while turning over in mind disquieting conversation have just passed between dominguez then gaze happening to wander aft to solitary figure at tiller sauntered aft endeavoured to strike up conversation with fellow however proved to be so boorish saturnine in manner that quickly abandoned attempt pitching half smoked cigar over rail retired below tumbled standing into bunk dominguez have indicated a mine where despite food for serious reflection that occurrence of night afforded soon fell into sound sleep week succeeded abduction be so utterly barren of event that may be passed over with mere remark throughout whole of time have perfect weather with steady moderate trade wind under impulsion of felucca bruised along upon proper course reeling off five to six knot per hour with regularity of clock during whole of time strange to say sighted not single sail have be by mean idle during time however a may well be supposed for day at noon saw little hooker hundred thirty to hundred fifty mile nearer spot where if nothing happened in interim to prevent be to be delivered into hand of fiend in human form whose hatred of be so intense vindictive that have taken considerable amount of trouble put to considerable expense merely to get into power wreak blood curdling revenge upon to tamely submit to be thus handed over to morillo tender mercy be very last thing contemplated have reason to believe that picture drawn by dominguez of form morillo revenge must probably take be tolerably truthful one while be prepared to face death in form at moment notice in way of duty have not remotest intention of permitting to be tortured to death merely to gratify ferocity of piratical outlaw if must possibly help so for first three four day devoted wholly to task of endeavouring to bribe custodian to forego intention of handing over to morillo to land upon nearest british territory instead by by made discovery that effort in direction be doomed to failure dominguez be clearly so profoundly impressed with morillo power with tenacious memory for injury that conviction have borne in upon that if yielded to persuasion must be absolutely necessary to safety not only to buy over whole of engaged upon business of abduction also to place whole width of globe between morillo to execute little matter satisfactorily must according to own calculation necessitate disbursement on part of modest amount of ten thousand pound sterling sum a explained to over over again be utterly beyond power to raise be not that dominguez be grasping avaricious be simply that regarded certain course of action necessary to own safety well being in event of consenting to yield to wish a have intention of suffering pecuniary other loss damage by so yielding appeared to that thing must not be done under sum have named there be whole matter in nut shell attempt at bribery having thus resulted in failure there remained to one other alternative that of resort to force against dominguez two men who formed crew for come what must be firmly resolved never to suffer to be delivered alive into morillo hand if be doom to die at end of adventure must die fighting so while feigning to yield to inexorable force of circumstance began to meditate upon most promising mean whereby to escape from exceedingly unpleasant dilemma in found involved after giving whole matter most careful attention came to conclusion that simplest plan must be to take attempt to take felucca from dominguez associate having done so make for nearest british harbour chapter fourteen seize felucca having come to conclusion next thing be to devise plan of sort upon attempting to do soon discovered that be wholly impossible so much depending upon circumstance over have control whatever that might have formed dozen plan with never chance to carry one of through only thing therefore be to await opportunity be prepared to seize moment that presented perhaps most difficult part of task be to preserve through trying time demeanour a must effectually conceal from dominguez fact be alert on watch for something managed somehow by leading to believe that rather than suffer torture have determined to provoke morillo into killing outright plan of dominguez highly approved while expressing doubt a to possibility of achievement in suggesting a find have in above paragraph have plan have perhaps conveyed wrong impression what intended reader to understand be that have finished scheme complete in detail to depend upon plan of sort certainly have be of vaguest most nebulous kind consisting in nothing more specific than mere determination to seize felucca at first favourable opportunity sail single handed to nearest british port of how be to be accomplished have not most remote idea only point upon be at clear be that must be inadvisable for two reason to make attempt too early first reason for arriving at conclusion being that longer deferred action nearer must be to barbadoes for island intended to make while second reason be must dominguez perchance suspect of sinister design longer delay on part le suspicious watchful must be likely to become fortunately for purpose be making rather long passage of little hooker not being by mean particularly weatherly craft consequently first land fall on sixth day out be curious shoal accompanying group of rocky islet called los roques roccas off la guayra close to hove about stood to northward on starboard tack occurred during early morning about hour after sunrise trade wind be then blowing steadily moderately weather be a usual fine clear toward noon however became noticeable that wind be very decidedly softening down when dominguez took meridian observation of sun be not going more than four knot be custom aboard felucca to dine in middle of day a soon a dominguez have worked out calculation skipper dining first then going on deck while mate took meal while miguel be below dominguez usually took tiller of late have occasionally relieved with vague idea possibly might at opportune moment be advantage for to be at helm a happened chanced to be first on deck on particular day without premeditation went aft relieved miguel so that when few minute later dominguez came on deck found in possession of tiller staring intently at floating object about quarter of mile away slightly on weather bow kept rising into view vanishing again a long lazy undulation of swell swept past be staring at so hard senor courtenay do see anything demanded dominguez a sauntered aft toward from companion cigar in mouth yes answered replying to last question first there be something out there what be can not for life of make out there there be can see now lifting on back of swell about point on weather bow ay answered eagerly see unless be greatly mistaken know what be keep away little senor if please let go off point want to pas too close to object if be what imagine pray what do imagine to be senor if one may be permitted to ask question inquired a gave pull upon tiller rope kept felucca away a requested turtle sleeping turtle unusually fine one too answered dominguez in low voice a stood staring out away over weather bow with one hand shading eye while other held smouldering cigar a dominguez spoke little thrill of sudden excitement swept over for thought just so know what mean intends to make effort to capture turtle probably by mean of boat if doe chance will have come steadied instantly returned in perfectly nonchalant tone of voice supposing that be a imagine sleeping turtle what then senor hush senor pray replied dominguez in low excited whisper keep silence will soon see presently object lifted into view again only ten dozen fathom away a went drifting quietly past got so distinct prolonged view of a to render identity unquestionable be a dominguez have imagined sleeping turtle of enormous size holy virgin what magnificent fellow ejaculated dominguez a creature vanished in trough on weather quarter must have senor if lower sail so that felucca can not drift far will have objection to being left by for few minute while miguel boy go after turtle with boat demanded eagerly so chance have come if must so demean for few minute a not to arouse suspicion of man by ill timed exhibition of eagerness too earnest assent to proposal took second two to steady nerve then asked can not go in boat together have never yet seen turtle captured must greatly like to witness operation senor be sorry be out of question answered dominguez hastily boat be small be very doubtful whether will be capable of carrying three of that great brute if be so fortunate a to catch must send miguel luis only that know must not be able to secure unaided will not be gone long senor felucca can not drift far in light breeze with so little swell running n o suppose not answered with just slightest imaginable show of reluctance right senor continued away with by mean must be sorry to spoil sport for will lower sail not just for moment senor answered dominguez must creep far enough away that flapping of canvas may not wake friend yonder will lose then poking head through open skylight called softly in spanish miguel miguel come on deck at once friend there be large turtle out here floating fast asleep want to catch miguel mumbled reply of sort what be must not tell dominguez briskly withdrew head from skylight sprang upon rail looking away out on weather quarter for turtle be still visible at interval fully quarter of mile astern now there will do be far enough away now think muttered stepping lightly off felucca low rail to deck here miguel a worthy emerged from companion wiping lip with back of hand help to lower sail quick senor courtenay will do favour to haul taut sheet a sail come down so that may not flap about make more noise than can help certainly answered cheerfully letting go tiller rope seizing fall of sheet lower away whenever like single lateen sail stretched upon long heavy tapering yard came sliding down mast rustling heavily despite must do to prevent presently lay quiescent stretched along deck with after yardarm projecting far over taffrail sprang up on companion slide to see whether turtle be still visible be rejoiced to find that be floating unconspicuous unrecognisable object by time nearly mile away apparently quite undisturbed by rustling sound of canvas be still there senor demanded dominguez in eager half whisper nodded pointing silently to where must see creature appearing at interval on ridge back of swell good ejaculated dominguez now where be luis oh here be a individual poked head up through fore scuttle to see what be going on still working jaw betraying that too have be disturbed during process of consuming midday meal just look into boat luis son see that oar baler be in while miguel unship gangway can still see senor courtenay yes replied be still there long way off now think have better keep eye on direct by occasional wave of hand a pull down will have job to find thank answered dominguez if will not be troubling too much will be greatly obliged oh trouble at responded must stand here to watch fun in case dominguez miguel soon managed between to unship gangway done lifted boat mere dinghy out of chock on top of main hatchway slued bow round toward gangway ran over side fisherman fashion three of immediately jumping in shoving off from felucca side dominguez who steered boat looking round at from time to time for direction a to way in be to head boat released now from scrutiny of spaniard eye be no longer necessary for to maintain that painful self restraint have cost so severe effort in order might not by look gesture arouse ghost of suspicion a to intention so while continued to mechanically wave boat to right left a circumstance demanded now gave mind to task of determining detail of proposed line of action to begin with be fully resolved that dominguez companion having left felucca must never again return to if must possibly prevent at right moment must make sail upon little craft head for barbadoes leaving to get ashore a best must here conscience pricked little for have already have experience of voyage in open boat knew what meant on other hand however life be at stake for have by time become perfectly apparent to that unless must raise sum of ten thousand pound demanded by dominguez be simple impossibility that individual must most certainly deliver over to morillo in case there be reason to believe must die cruel lingering death of torment considered quite justified in avoiding by mean in power moreover be not very far from land roccas be only twenty five mile away at utmost must easily be reached by dominguez before midnight weather be fine water smooth voyage of dinghy be therefore not likely to be of very adventurous dangerous character so that by taking possession of felucca turning spaniard companion adrift must only be inflicting upon very mild punishment for unlawful seizure of person especially when cruel object of seizure came to be taken into consideration must not leave however wholly without provision water if must help first thought therefore be how might be able to convey to small supply of without affording opportunity to regain possession of felucca after few minute deliberation thought must see way by might be accomplished meanwhile dinghy went drifting rapidly away astern propelled by miguel luis who stood up at oar looking ahead while dominguez stood up in stern sheet looking over shoulder occasionally glancing back at for guidance at length however caught sight for of turtle thenceforward kept attention wholly fixed upon a soon a became fully satisfied of jumped down off companion for moment for action on part have now arrived first thing be to get sail upon felucca again to masthead long heavy lateen yard with big sail be easy task for one man there be however little winch affixed to fore part of mast chiefly used for very purpose so upon jumping down off companion first act be to assure that mainsheet be securely belayed after rushed forward setting hand taut main halliard threw two three turn of fall round barrel of winch then ran aft again sprang once more upon companion to see what be happening aboard dinghy be by time drawing pretty close up to sleeping turtle whole attention of trio aboard appeared to be absorbed in effort to get alongside creature without waking now therefore be time for action accordingly dashed forward to mast shipping crank handle of winch hove away upon halliard for dear life yard sail crept slowly oh how very slowly up mast canvas rustling in wind noisily enough to wake dead still more to reach ear give alarm to in dinghy having once begun there be nothing now for to go on with work get yard mastheaded good way upon felucca before in dinghy must pull back get alongside at length after what seemed to be interminable time although rapid click click of pawl told that in reality be accomplishing task very smartly managed to get yard two third of way up mast when took turn with halliard once more rushed aft to get look at boat a have expected slatting of canvas have reached given alarm boat be now round heading back after felucca miguel dominguez straining frantically at oar while luis have taken place of latter at tiller little craft be being pushed furiously along a must tell by manner in nose dipped white foam boiled round at stroke of oar felucca be gathering way with wind square abeam imperfectly hoisted sail ramping full seemed to be quite holding own seized tiller kept away point carefully watching progress that of boat ten minute later experienced satisfying conviction that be steadily leaving pursuer once fully assured of lashed tiller once more running forward completed setting of sail when let little hooker come up to full by next matter demanding attention be that of conveying supply of food water to luckless occupant of dinghy without permitting to come alongside there be several small breaker of fresh water on deck constituting supply of felucca one of must be ample for occupant of dinghy until must get ashore be picked up indeed boat have not capacity for more than one be carefully bunged with cork canvas so must safely launch one of overboard for dinghy to pick up therefore proceeded to unlash one roll toward still open gangway then came question of provision there be large wash deck tub on forecastle knew to be water tight struck that might be utilised to float dry provision until dinghy must pick up so first making sure of position of boat dived below routed out of dominguez ' bunk large canvas ditty bag have often seen there emptying out clothing contained proceeded to fill with bread such other provision a must most readily lay hand on when full tied securely at neck took on deck placing in wash deck tub after have dragged latter conveniently close to gangway then going below again brought up three plate knife fork three tin pannikin few other oddment that knew must be useful placed in wash deck tub with provision then when thought that be ready boat mast sail caught eye a lay upon hatchway having be flung there by luis when cleared out boat determined must also have a while quite resolved to abandon be most anxious that must be afforded opportunity to reach shore alive well then everything being ready once more ran aft to see whereabout boat now be be long way astern quite two mile a looked appeared a though dominguez have already given up pursuit for boat did not seem to be moving occupant be however on foot staring hard in direction waving arm frantically therefore put helm up jibing round proceeded to run down toward be rather risky thing to do thought that with care must accomplish what wanted still evade recapture when saw returning for a doubtless thought started pulling again for minute two then once more lay upon oar watching on part also be careful to keep keen watch upon movement intention being to pas within hailing distance of if possible without giving chance to dash alongside that be intention soon became aware for a felucca swept down toward must see that oar be in water that be quietly manoeuvring to get dinghy head on a close a possible to spot over expected to pas be not to be quite so easily caught napping so carefully measuring distance with eye again put helm up just at right moment sweeping past dinghy within dozen fathom hailed discomfited occupant somewhat to effect dinghy ahoy be not going to allow to come alongside again so must recommend to make best of way to roccas a know bear south south west twenty five mile distant have doubt that if can reach be certain to be taken off sooner later meanwhile wish to starve so be going to launch overboard provision water for to pick up also boat mast sail weather promise to hold fine so ought to make fairly good quick passage of meanwhile moment dominguez became aware of what be doing swept boat round with couple of powerful stroke of oar once again gave chase with might main dominguez at same time shouting to that if must allow to return on board must land wherever pleased never ask so much a penny piece by way of ransom must have trusted fellow must willingly have acceded to proposal must not have already shown to be so coldly callous so absolutely indifferent to fearful fate to have undertaken to consign that felt must be sheerest most insane folly to place in power again therefore kept felucca away until found that be rather more than holding own in race when once more lashed tiller calling to dominguez to look out for thing be about to launch overboard ran to gangway first successfully set wash deck tub afloat then rolled breaker of water out through open gangway finally sent mast sail adrift after returned to tiller watched process of picking up several article a gradually brought felucca to former course close hauled upon starboard tack chapter fifteen heavy weather provision water mast sail be successfully secured by occupant of boat after dominguez to great satisfaction made sail to southward in hour tiny speck of canvas have vanished beyond horizon left free to attend to own necessity without further anxiety on score of being boarded therefore once more lashed tiller in position that felucca must practically steer then having first taken good look round to see if anything be in sight proceeded below found chart dominguez have be using ascertained bearing distance of island of barbadoes careful study of chart revealed rather disconcerting fact that taking into consideration circumstance that barbadoes be to windward while jamaica lay well to leeward of must be almost a quick to return to latter a must be to beat out to former on other hand however there be to be taken into consideration that on wind felucca might be made to practically steer a have already ascertained by experiment while be quite certain that must not be persuaded to do such thing while running off wind moreover by ratching far enough to northward to enable felucca to fetch barbadoes on next tack must be stretching away in fairly promising direction for being picked up by one of many british cruiser be watching principal outlet from caribbean to atlantic after mature deliberation therefore arrived at conclusion must not do better than adhere to original determination of trying for barbadoes next question be how be to dispose of time rather what portion of time must be best to devote to sleep one fact stared in face at outset namely that until be once more safe ashore must have to make shift with smallest possible amount of sleep care of felucca calling for almost constant attention consequently must have to so arrange period of rest that must coincide with time when felucca must best be left to take care of period must obviously occur during hour of daylight when must be possible to take good look round if nothing be in sight likely to approach within dangerous proximity for hour two lie down on deck in shadow of sail snatch short nap then take look round repeating process a often a possible throughout day in order might be fresh lively for unbroken watch through hour of darkness having arrived at conclusion forthwith proceeded to carry out plan found to act fairly well only drawback being that for want of watching felucca evinced tendency to run little off wind while when attempted to remedy by lashing helm inch two le weather erred to about same extent in other direction by gradually coming to until sail be shaking have to jump hurriedly to foot jam helm hard up to prevent from coming round upon other tack little by little however remedied defect so that by sunset have going along just full by almost a steadily a though have be standing at tiller steering meanwhile wind have be very moderate day with distinctly perceptible disposition to become still lighter have gradually softened down until little hooker be barely doing three knot per hour while sea have dwindled away until only long regular undulation of swell be left being overrun by wrinkling of small uncrested wavelet frequently precede setting in of calm yet there be reason why calm must be anticipated for be in region where trade wind blow year round except when for few hour give place to one of hurricane occasionally sweep over caribbean with devastating effect must be possible that phenomenon be about to happen there be especial reason why might not be so for be hurricane season there be sign in heaven of approaching atmospheric disturbance unless indeed faint scarcely perceptible hazy appearance up aloft have sinister meaning when sun have declined to within few minute of setting shinned up mast took good look round there be nothing in sight waiting therefore until sun have sunk below horizon did in midst of thin smoky haze through rayless luminary glowed like ball of red hot iron descended to deck forthwith set to work to prepare such supper a meagre resource of felucca permitted after discussing a star be shining brilliantly overhead little craft be steering again stretched out on deck to snatch nap time slept for several hour for when be at length awakened by rustling of sail be close upon midnight starting to foot first glanced aloft then around there be nothing to be seen darkness being so profound that needed very small stretch of imagination to persuade that might absolutely be felt be thick opaque darkness remembered having once experienced when a boy went exploring devonshire cavern clumsily allowed candle to fall become extinguished in pool of water seemed to press upon to become palpable to touch to so closely wrap about very breathing became impeded oh how frightfully hot close be air be absolutely stagnant slight draught created by uneasy motion of felucca seemed to positively scorch skin moreover there be dew deck plank rail everything that hand came into contact with be dry warm groped way to rail looked abroad over surface of ocean will perhaps convey at event to who have used sea idea of intensity of darkness when say that not faintest glimmer of reflected light came to from polished undulation of slow creeping swell water however be highly phosphorescent for alongside felucca round a rolled pitched with quick jerky uneasy motion there extended narrow band cloud of faint greenish blue sea fire in midst of flashed glittered million of tiny star interspersed here there with le luminous patch in form of ring disc that vanished grew into view again at quick interval in most weird uncanny manner groped way to companion from thence below into little cabin where lighted lamp seated at table well under cheerful if somewhat smoky beam for grave like darkness of deck have oppressed with feeling very nearly akin to horror even dull yellow light of lamp seemed inexpressibly cheerful in comparison with there be barometer aboard felucca so have nothing to guide to meaning of weather portent be convinced that something out of common something more than mere thunder squall be brewing if so must probably have hand full in taking care of felucca with nobody to help still so awkward condition of affair be preferable to of being delivered over to morillo for to work fiendish will upon cabin be much too hot to be comfortable so having quickly conquered feeling of depression produced by darkness have preceded lighting of cabin lamp helped to one of dominguez excellent cigar lighting went on deck where dull gleam of lamp issuing from small glazed skylight now made quite pleasant little patch of yellow radiance on deck bulwark immediately adjacent be by time broad awake having secured rest sleep just then needed so fell to pacing to fro over small patch of illuminated deck determined to watch matter out might have be thus engaged for about hour when became aware that darkness be no longer so densely oppressively profound a have be there be just faintest imaginable gleam of light in sky whereby be possible to barely distinguish that firmament be packed with vast piling mass of heavy menacing cloud very gradually light strengthened assuming a did so lowering ruddy tint until in course of hour whole sky have appearance be seen when reflects great distant conflagration now knew of surety that hurricane be brewing for fearful ruddy light in sky be self same appearance have once before beheld when in althea gig have be attempting to make way to bermuda there be mistaking sign for be one once seen must never be forgotten now storm fiend having unfurled fiery banner thus given warning of impending war time of inaction be over for there be plenty to do before felucca must be considered a prepared to engage in coming struggle at best preparation must only be partial one for craft be not only small be old crazy miserably weak for ordeal lay before be not in power to remedy so serious defect a tint must do be to take in great lateen sail secure substitute for if must very much smaller piece of canvas that while sufficient to save from being overrun by furious sea must not be too big for felucca to carry fortunately there be such sail on board small lug sail made of stout canvas nearly new be intended to be substituted for lateen on rare occasion when little craft might be caught in heavy weather sail now proceeded to drag up from below bend to yard after lowered away lateen laid fore aft deck made up securing a well a must by passing innumerable turn of light warp round after firmly lashed to bulwark with a many lashing a must find pin cleat for next job be to close reef set lug did with aid of winch done went forward beginning with fore scuttle proceeded to carefully batten down opening in deck bringing cabin lamp on deck in order might have sufficiency of light to work by skylight secured a well a must by passing lashing over cover to couple of ring bolt conveniently placed in deck finished up by backing companion door with couple of stout piece of timber sawed to proper length wedged in between upright rendering practically impossible for door to be forced open by sea while by drawing over slide must at last moment effectually close access to cabin completed labour with be fairly well satisfied only portion of defence about have serious doubt being skylight glazed panel of might easily be smashed by sea be obliged to take chance of being unable to find anything with to protect now remained be to watch wait have to wait very long for when having completed preparation found time to again glance aloft at frowning sky observed that heavy mass of fiery cloud have hitherto seemed to be practically motionless so stealthy be movement be now working with restless writhing motion while ever anon small detached fragment of vapour must come sweeping rapidly out from westward athwart twisting mass a though caught torn off from main body by sudden momentary partial violent movement in atmosphere small scurrying fragment of cloud vanguard of approaching tempest rapidly increased in size in number while twisting writhing of great cloud mass momentarily grew more rapid convulsive until appeared a though entire firmament be in throe of mortal agony suggestion soon becoming intensified by arising in atmosphere of low weird moaning sound that at interval rose strengthened into wail a of spirit of drowned sailor lamenting coming havoc a wailing sound arose grew in volume sudden stirring in stagnant air became apparent first in form of exaggerated cat paw that smote savagely upon glassy surface of water scourging into sudden flurry of foam then dying away again then in sudden gust swept screaming past felucca hither thither sometimes high enough aloft to leave water undisturbed at other time striking a be rebounding from surface leaving in path streak patch of ruffled water have scarcely time to subside ere gust went howling past to leave more disturbed than before sudden scurryings of wind be forerunner of hurricane only sprang up short five minute before low hoarse murmur of gale became audible a sound arose looked away to westward quarter from came saw by faint sombre ruddy light of unnaturally glowing sky thin white line appear upon horizon lengthening thickening a watched until became rushing wall of foam bearing down upon felucca at terrific speed while behind heaven grew pitchy black murmur became low deep roar roar grew in volume to bellow bellow rose to unearthly howl howl to yelling shriek a hurricane leapt at felucca happily be lying stern on to seized in grip causing stout close reefed lug sail to fill with report like of cannon burying bow deep in creamy hissing smother ere gathered way while scud water flew over in blinding drenching sheet for moment a gripped tiller convulsively thought little hooker be about to founder bow first after shuddering pause of few breathless second of horrible suspense gathered way in instant be flying before gale like frightened thing at speed dare venture to say have never before attained be wild scene in midst of now found with outburst of gale supernatural ruddy glow of sky have suddenly faded to be succeeded by frightful gloom yet be not actual darkness for whole surface of sea have in few brief second become level sheet of boiling foam so strongly phosphorescent that emitted light enough for to see with tolerable distinctness hull mast sail of felucca to make out position character of principal object about deck same weird ghostly light probably be that reflected from cloud enabled also to discern form to distinguish that be no longer rounded swelling mass that have hitherto be be now rent tattered ragged with mad fury of wind have seized upon be dragging at headlong speed athwart arch of air too be full of spindrift to perhaps double height of felucca mast that too be luminous with faint green misty light imparted weird unreal aspect to everything shone upon effect be further heightened by unearthly screaming howling of gale there be nothing for to keep felucca running dead before gale fortunately for be by mean difficult feat a craft steered a be easily a boat indeed almost steered for first half hour so nothing special occurred hurricane continuing to blow a furiously a at first mad outfly while felucca sped before a smoothly steadily a though mounted on wheel running upon perfectly smooth level road only fear just then being that mast must go over bow sail be blown out of bolt rope spar however be good one well stayed while sail be practically new gear be good everything therefore held although must feel that little craft be straining to alarming extent about hour thereabout after gale first struck movement of hull gentle easy at first rapidly increasing told that sea be beginning to rise soon after trouble commenced in earnest for sea got up with astounding rapidity a did so steering became increasingly difficult especially when stern of little hooker be thrown up on crest of sea at period for few breathless second rudder seemed to lose grip on water felucca be hurled irresistibly forward with bow buried deep in boiling foam while seemed hesitating whether to broach to to starboard to port alternative of must have be equally disastrous since in case must have assuredly capsized gone down by what seemed nothing short of series of interposition on part of merciful providence in case just at moment when broach to seemed imminent inevitable felt rudder take fresh grip on water be again safe until next sea overtook so continued throughout remaining hour of dreadful night with grim death threatening at upward heave of little craft until at length after what seemed to have be very eternity of anxiety day broke slowly sullenly ahead by time have grown absolutely callous indifferent nerve have be kept in state of acute tension so long that seemed to have become incapable of further feeling of kind have ceased to care whether survived not rather have become so thoroughly convinced of absolute impossibility of ultimate escape that there seemed to be nothing left worth worrying about moreover be by time utterly exhausted with tremendous exertion of keeping little craft running straight for so long time for at critical moment of have spoken helm seemed to so nearly lose power that became necessary to jam tiller hard over first to side then to a felucca seemed actually starting on wild sheer must have flung broadside on to sea so have abruptly finished career mine at same moment thus be with when dull sullen dawn at length came oozing through mirky blackness ahead gradually spreading along horizon grey dismal lowering bringing tattered shape sooty hue of wildly flying cloud into stronger relief revealing horizon serrated with frenzied leaping of angry water hissed roared around straining felucca chasing like angry wolf about to leap upon prey at first thought be alone in scene of mad turmoil presently when light grew stronger a felucca hung poised for instant upon crest of foaming comber boiled in over rail amidships flooded deck knee deep caught momentary glimpse of large craft nine mile away on larboard bow running like before gale be hull down of course very probably in hollow of sea when first caught sight of for saw only head of lower mast with three topmast rising above topgallant mast struck carried away be running under close reefed maintopsail goose winged foresail took to be frigate though whether one of own enemy be too far off for to be enabled to judge of nationality may have be be undoubtedly fast vessel for soon ran out of sight although estimated speed of felucca to be quite nine knot about hour later became sensible of distinct abatement in fury of hurricane in course of hour have still further moderated until have become no more than ordinary heavy gale yet so callous have now become that change afforded scarcely satisfaction have grown so utterly indifferent have long ceased to care what happened be worn out with fatigue limb ached a though have be severely beaten hand be blistered raw with chafe of tiller eye be smarting for want of sleep rest felt that must have soon come what might of so a gale have moderated somewhat determined to heave to believed felucca must now bear weight of small close reefed lug even when brought to wind if did not well did not matter nothing mattered just then except must have rest so sail being set on starboard side of mast watched opportunity availing of smooth brought felucca to on starboard tack with worse mishap than shipping of sea over weather bow a came up with head pointing to windward swept away whole of port bulwark from abreast windlass to wake of companion a came to little craft laid over until water be up to lee coaming of main hatchway for second two thought be going to turn turtle with once fairly round head on to sea rode wonderfully well especially after have lashed helm lee got mainsheet aft latter be heavy job managed in about hour with assistance of watch tackle that done craft must take care of therefore slid back top of companion swung heavily in through opening stumbled down ladder staggered across little cabin flung to skin a be into bunk where instantly lost consciousness whether in swoon only in profound sleep never knew chapter sixteen last of felucca be awakened five hour later by sound water washing heavily to fro upon looking over edge of bunk discovered that cabin be afloat floor being covered to depth of nearly foot so that looked down upon miniature sea violently agitated by furious leaping plunging rolling of felucca must tell by roar of wind hissing of sea with frequent heavy fall of water on deck that be still blowing heavily first impression be that water have come down through companion slide of have left open few minute of patient observation convinced that although slight sprinkling of spray rained down occasionally be not nearly sufficient to account for quantity surged splashed about cabin only other explanation must think of be that felucca have sprung leak leaping out of bunk made way on deck to ascertain truth of conjecture be dismal dreary scene presented when swung out on deck through companion top be still blowing with force of whole gale sky to windward be a black threatening a ever sea be running so high breaking so heavily that a succeeding comber came sweeping down upon felucca with foaming hissing crest towering above to nearly height of masthead appeared to new to scene a be that next sea must inevitably overwhelm yet deep in water a instantly noticed to be little craft still retained buoyancy enough to climb somehow up steep slope of advancing wave though not to carry fairly over crest one of broke aboard usually well forward a luck must have with result that while have be sleeping below whole of lee bulwark forward half of on weather side have be swept away leaving deck open to sea have swept away movable thing leaving nothing mast splintered end of stanchion standing constant sweeping of deck by green sea rendered task of moving about extremely dangerous for rush of water over fore part of deck be quite heavy enough to lift man off foot carry overboard wanted to sound well so securing pump rod for convenience be hung in becket in companion watched opportunity rushing forward succeeded in dropping rod down well getting firm grip upon fall of main halliard before next sea broke aboard then a water poured off deck quickly drew rod out of well dashed aft with to shelter of companion in time to escape next sea inspection of rod then sufficed to realise worst fear little craft have upwards of three foot of water in hold evidently be leaking badly sooner must devise mean of relieving of weight of water in better must be for have made discovery dozen hour earlier must probably have regarded with perfect indifference five hour of death like sleep have so greatly refreshed that now felt new man state of indifference have passed away with intensity of fatigue instinct of self preservation be once more asserting first idea be to rig pump be instantly discarded for have to stand in companion way for couple of minute watch heavy rush of water athwart deck to be convinced of absolute impossibility of maintaining position at pump for even if lashed there utmost effort must barely suffice to prevent from being swept overboard while to work pump must be quite out of question then remembered that lazarette hatch be situated immediately at foot of companion ladder thought that by raising cover might get sort of well from to bale in way at least keep leak from gaining upon even if found impossible to reduce for time be what now wanted have conviction that felucca seam be opening through violent straining of in heavy sea through tremendous pressure of wind upon sail felt tolerably confident that if must succeed in keeping afloat until gale have blown out must be well at point of meditation suddenly occurred to that be hungry thirsty so descended companion ladder made way to small pantry in search of something to eat drink be small place scarcely larger than cupboard very imperfectly lighted by single bull eye let into deck have one merit be well provided with good wide shelf upon everything must possibly spoil be stowed here be lucky enough to find abundance of food such a be several bottle of thin sour wine dominguez crew drank instead of coffee ate drank there in pantry standing up to knee in water when have finished went to work with bucket rope to bail water out of lazarette standing out on deck on lee side of companion drawing water out of lazarette a out of well stuck doggedly to work throughout whole afternoon well on into night until must bail no longer for very weariness then having convinced have succeeded in checking rise of water took final look round to ascertain whether anything happened to be in sight must see nothing night being again dark a pitch came to conclusion that be blowing trifle le hard than have be that felucca must live through night even though must cease to bale so descended to cabin again flung into bunk where dropped sound asleep a head touched pillow when next returned to consciousness awakening be brought about through agency of water splashing in over side of bunk felucca having steadily filled during period of sleep until cabin be fully three foot deep in water be broad day oh blessed change sun be shining brilliantly down through skylight while wind have evidently dropped to pleasant breeze heavy sea however be still running a must tell by movement of felucca must hear water well gurgle up side of little craft go pouring across deck from time to time although not so frequently a before turned in rolled reluctantly out of bunk for seemed to be aching in joint of body head be burning throbbing with dull pain like what must be occasioned by stroke of small hammer waded waist deep in water to companion ladder up crawled so out on deck gale have blown out wind having subsided to very gentle breeze soon discovered be fast dying away to calm although what little wind there be still came breathing out from westward sky be perfectly clear of rich deep pure blue colour without shred of cloud to be seen in whole of vast vault in midst of about two hour high hung morning sun dazzling globe of brilliance heat sea now found have subsided almost entirely very heavy swell be still running over felucca rode laboriously water in interior occasionally pinning down to extent that quick running swell must brim up over bow pour in perfect cataract athwart deck however be not surprised at for a nearly a must judge felucca showed barely nine inch of freeboard still little hooker seemed surprisingly buoyant considering water logged condition now that sea longer broke over there seemed to be reason why given enough time must not be able to pump dry resume voyage to barbadoes so rigged pump went to work hoping that a gale have now abated sea have gone down straining of hull opening of seam have ceased consequently felucca be longer in leaky condition toiled on throughout whole of roasting morning with sun beating mercilessly down upon while water swirled athwart deck about leg until noon then utterly exhausted with labour skin burning with fever hand raw bleeding be fain to cry spell ho give up for time while sought somewhat to eat drink have worked with good will sanguinely hoping that when felt compelled to knock off must discover have sensibly diminished amount of water in felucca interior hope be cruelly disappointed for when reached companion on way below found that there be perceptible difference in height of water in cabin from what have be before turned to indeed water seemed to have risen rather than diminished sure indication that hull be still leaking that by effort of mine must hope to keep craft much longer afloat now a descended to cabin noted violence with water surged hither with rolling pitching of little vessel wild fear seized upon might find provision in pantry spoiled moment later surmise be changed to certainty for a opened door of small cupboard like apartment recoiling wave surged out through doorway surface bestrewed with hard coarse biscuit that sailor speak of a bread water have risen high enough to flood shelf upon eatable have be stowed everything be washed off utterly spoiled worse still there be possibility of obtaining further supply for lazarette storehouse be beneath cabin floor have be flooded for hour moreover be unapproachable fortunately did not feel very hungry be however consumed with burning thirst water cask having be washed overboard quenched by draining whole bottle of thin sour wine of have before spoken then went to work to collect biscuit must secure carried up on deck to dry in sun spreading out on cloth on top of companion while engaged upon task also in removing small stock of wine to deck for cabin be by time uninhabitable began to consider what must do to save life when felucca must founder a founder must now that have demonstrated inability to keep leak under question be not very knotty one one demanding very profound consideration obviously there be one thing to do be to build raft with such material a offered to hand just at point first difficulty presented in shape of question what available material be there for a have already mentioned deck have be swept of movable thing including big lateen yard have doubtless gone overboard when bulwark be carried away there seemed to be absolutely nothing unless set to work to break up felucca yet stay there be mast yard spread supported lug sail tiller good stout serviceable stick of timber yes certainly hatch must now be safely taken off a sea no longer swept over deck heavily enough to pour over coaming surely with material ought to be able to construct raft buoyant enough to support even although must be obviously necessary for to construct on deck then patiently wait until felucca sank floated off for must be quite impossible for to launch so to work went first task being to descend into flooded forecastle grope about for axe that knew be kept there somewhere be fortunate enough to find almost at once then returning to deck lowered away lug sail cut canvas adrift from yard carefully lashing latter that might not roll be washed overboard then began to cut away mast chopping deep notch in close to deck when heard beginning to complain cut lanyard of weather rigging when away went over side with crash gave good deal of trouble for wanted spar on deck not overboard so have to go to work to parbuckle up side managed pretty well by watching lift of sea then cut mast in half laid two half parallel athwart deck secured yard tiller to a cross piece with good stout lashing finally to last firmly lashed four of main hatch cover when have platform of twelve foot long eight foot wide to support now remained to be done be to secure provision wine did by stowing whole in double thickness of tarpaulin edge of gathered together tightly lashed with spun yarn finally securing bundle to raft by short end of rope so that might not be washed away when felucca must take final plunge have then done everything that be possible for to do by time that task be finished sun have sunk to within hand breadth of western horizon while wind have dwindled away until have become faintest zephyr scarcely to be distinguished save by slight ruffling of water here there where touched being so nearly flat calm already great oily looking patch of gleaming smoothness have appeared be spreading momentarily through faint blue rippling still betrayed movement in air a for be utterly exhausted with long day toil under roasting sun bone in body be aching be in burning fever be sick with smart of raw bleeding hand old feeling of callousness indifference to fate be once more upon a gazed at crazy looking raft have constructed with such lavish expenditure of painful toil smiled in grim irony of must have done so much to preserve life now seemed of such little worth promised soon to become unendurable burden to reaction from excitement have sustained during labour have set in be persuaded that have further exertion be necessary for preservation of life must not have undertaken meanwhile felucca have sunk nearly to covering board might be expected to founder at moment climbed laboriously upon top of closed skylight took last long look round to ascertain whether anything have drifted into range of view while have be engaged upon raft there be nothing horizon be bare throughout entire circumference so climbed down again staggering to raft flung down upon with bundle of provision a pillow patiently awaited evanishment of felucca poor little craft what forlorn weather beaten sea washed wreck looked a lay there wallowing wearily a seemed to painfully upon long creeping glassy undulation of swell how different from trim sturdy little hooker have sailed seaward so confidently saucily out of kingston harbour few year no not year must be month be only day few day ago seemed more like year than day to yet why of course must only be day heaven how head ached how brain seemed to throb boil within skull surely be not blood must be fire be coursing through vein causing body to glow like white hot steel big glassy mound of swell came creeping along toward felucca a rolled toward curled in over covering board poured in heavy torrent across deck swirling round raft shifting foot two nearer side a swept past dabbled one of hand in be dully surprised that contact did not cause water to hiss boil mountain of water came brimming over deck of shuddering craft shifted raft so far that fairly overhung covering board so that when felucca rolled in opposite direction end of raft not only dipped in water actually lifted floated heave of water sucking perhaps foot off deck next two three undulation passed harmlessly by swing roll of felucca be such that just happened to meet at right moment though lagging little at last then came great liquid hill towering high above horizon until sinking sun be utterly obscured on swept toward felucca have now slewed so that faced coming swell nearly stem on water in meanwhile rushing forward a sank down into trough until stem head be completely buried now be meeting breast of on coming swell bow still pinned down by rush of water in interior now glistening green wave be upon sweeping aft along athwart deck mounting over coaming of main hatchway pouring down opening in smooth hissing four sided cataract snatching up raft in embrace shooting dozen fathom clear of doomed craft rushing along deck until even companion skylight be submerged by time hull be full curious rectangular hollow in surface of water marked position of main hatchway be filled hull be completely hidden save for splintered stanchion projected above water here there then a wave passed bow of felucca emerged gleaming dripping with snowy foaming cascade poured off uncovered portion of deck higher higher rose bow out of water until ten foot in length of felucca be revealed deck gradually sloping until assumed almost perpendicular inclination when slowly silently glidingly without sob gurgle of escaping air wreck slid backward downward until vanished beneath water now gleaming in gold crimson with last ray of setting sun few second later great luminary also vanished sudden grey pallor overspread ocean found alone indeed swaying upon vast heaving expanse with nothing between death save clumsy structure have so laboriously put together now looked so insignificantly small that caught wondering why weight did not sink did not on contrary raft proved to be surprisingly buoyant riding over great glassy round backed hill of swell a dry a bone with gentle swaying movement somehow seemed to soothe fever racked frame so that condition of semi delirium have possessed just before felucca foundered passed away left sufficiently possessed to recognise necessity for eating drinking if be to survive get better of misfortune so carefully opened bundle extracted from small quantity of sun dried biscuit thanks to curiously gentle manner in raft have be launched have received no further wetting proceeded to make such meal a must washing down with sparing draught of wine although biscuit have dried superficially be still wet pasty in middle horribly nauseous to palate so that made poor meal after stretched at full length upon raft endeavoured to find relief in sleep exhausted though be sleep must not come to on contrary memory imagination rapidly became painfully excited thought of dominguez wondered whether companion have escaped hurricane then thought of morillo fiendish hatred of so thought fancy chased one until became mingled together in inextricable jumble through heard singing shouting laughing arguing upon impossible subject with wholly imaginary person performing know not what other mad vagary until finally suppose must have become so utterly exhausted a to have subsided into restless feverish sleep chapter seventeen captain lemaitre consciousness returned to with sensation of soft delicate light impinging upon closed eyelid opened eye upon picture of sky of deepest richest purest blue studded with wool like tuft of fleecy cloud opalescent with daintiest tint of primrose pink a sailed overhead with slow gentle movement out from north east eastern horizon be aglow with ruddy orange light up through soared broad fan like ray of white radiance spoke of phoebus ' chariot wheel through scale of countless subtle change of tincture gradually merged into marvellously soft richness of prismatic sky gentle breeze warm sweet a woman breath lightly ruffled surface of sea heaved in long low hill of deep brilliant liquid sapphire around here there sea bird wheeled swept with plaintive cry slanting motionless pinion in long easy graceful curve over slowly undulating swell sat up looked about vaguely wonderingly for moment forgetful of circumstance have placed in so novel situation at instant glowing point of golden fire flashed into view upon eastern horizon a upper rim of sun hove above undulating rim of sea in moment rippling blue of laughing water be laced with long broadening wake of gleaming dancing liquid gold a great palpitating disc of god of day left ocean couch entered upon journey through heaven forgetfulness be momentary a radiance warmth of returning sun swept over glittering scintillating golden path stretched from horizon to raft memory of have gone before apprehension of what still haply awaited returned a quickly a cramped aching limb must allow staggered to foot flinging anxious eager glance around in search of sail horizon however be bare save where long narrow pinion of wheeling sea bird swiftly cut for moment here there sighed wearily a resumed recumbent position upon raft wondering whether rescue must ever come whether be doom to float there tossing hour after hour day after day like veriest waif until thirst starvation have wrought will upon until storm must arise now laughing ocean must overwhelm in fury indeed cared very little just then what fate awaited for be so ill frame be so racked with fever head so distracted with fierce throbbing beating of wildly coursing blood in that only thing craved for be relief from suffering be matter of utmost indifference to at moment whether relief came from death from other source so long a came quickly strength be leaving with astounding rapidity be quite aware that if wished to husband little still remained to ought to eat mere idea of eating excited so violent repugnance that be with utmost difficulty resisted almost overwhelming temptation to pitch slender stock of sea sodden biscuit overboard on other hand be consumed with torturing thirst that vainly strove to assuage by so reckless consumption of equally slender stock of wine at end of day only two bottle remained such recklessness be of course due to fact be unaccountable for action be possessed of kind of madness knew have lost control over cared not what happened more than once found seriously considering advisability of throwing off raft so ending everything without more ado have often wondered why did not do so be certainly not fear of death prevented a day wore on suffering steadily increased in intensity brain throbbed pulsated with pain so acute that seemed a though million wedge be being driven into skull host of weird outrageous horrible fancy chased other through imagination became possessed of idea that raft be surrounded hemmed in by ever increasing multitude of frightful sea monster who fought with other in furious effort to get within reach of day night seemed to come go with bewildering rapidity finally everything became involved in condition of hopelessly inextricable confusion eventually merged into oblivion next consciousness be that of sound of gurgling running water of buoyant heaving plunging motion of flashing sunshine coming going upon closed eyelid of vibrant hum of wind through taut rigging in hollow of straining canvas of murmur of voice of regular tramp of footstep to fro on planking overhead for moment thought be aboard tern just awaking from sleep during have be haunted with unusually long series of peculiarly unpleasant dream a opened eye looked with somewhat languid interest upon surroundings became aware be in small plain fairly snug cabin of seemed to posse previous knowledge at same moment confused rapidly clearing memory of what have happened came to together with knowledge have be rescued from raft be feeling very much better attempt to move preliminary to turning out revealed disconcerting fact be a weak helpless a new born infant so be perforce obliged to remain where be in short time dozed off into light sleep again soothed thereto by hum of wind gurgling wash of water along side of ship close to ear gentle heave plunge of fabric bore from nap be awakened by somewhat noisy opening of cabin door upon opening eye beheld swarthy somewhat dirty looking individual bending over from appearance at once set down a frenchman a gazed up into face with mild curiosity impression became confirmed by exclaiming in french ah monsieur so have come to sens at last eh good knew must save although francois declared to be a good a dead when brought aboard now mon ami what do say can eat something thank replied in same language now that come to mention think can good ejaculated unknown rest tranquil for short time will see what rascal cook of ours can do for stay dose of quinine will do harm just by way of precaution know although think have driven fever out of at last permit so saying laid rather grimy hand upon forehead for moment then transferred to wrist remarking good skin be cool moist pulse normal again have have friend will do will do henceforth cook must be doctor need now be plenty of good nourishing food to restore strength now drink a soon a have swallowed will away to galley while speaking individual have be busying with bottle from extracted small quantity of white powder mixed with water then handed mixture to drink thank said handing back glass now monsieur do favour to tell name in order may know to whom be indebted for preservation name repeated with laugh oh will keep monsieur will keep at present most urgent necessity be food be now going to get for when return will tell may wish to know while be eating for present adieu monsieur if feel disposed to sleep again do so sleep be nearly a valuable a food to just now when have of latter ready for will wake never fear so saying before must utter word vanished slamming cabin door after retirement caused sensation of distinct relief at be very greatly annoyed with for have not man doubly saved life first by rescuing from raft afterwards by nursing through what believed have be serious illness yet ingrate be even in brief interview have just described have taken unmistakable dislike to man be not so much that be unclean in person attire be possible that there might be good sufficient excuse for what have excited antipathy when came to analyse feeling be certain false ring in voice subtle something in manner suggestive of idea that friendliness heartiness be not natural to be assumed for purpose yet why must be so why must have rescued from raft afterwards troubled to fight drive out fever threatened to destroy unless from feeling of humanity compassion for pitiable condition must not imagine yet there have be so fancied fierce shifty gleam in coal black eye during few brief minute that have bent over a lay there in bunk seemed to reveal cruelty treachery rather than pity good will let describe man standing there beside bunk have conveyed to impression of individual nearly six foot in height afterwards found stature to be five foot ten inch in stocking broad across shoulder in proportion big boned lean almost to point of emaciation skin be dry of unwholesome yellow tint shrivelled a though have once be stout burly of form have now become thin while skin have failed to shrink in same proportion a flesh eye be a have said black small deeply sunken in head hair be dull dead black be worn cropped close to head black beard be trimmed to point wore moustache long end of projected athwart upper lip like spritsail yard hand be thin showing tendon of finger working under loose skin at movement of while finger be long attenuated ingrained with dirt furnished with long talon like yellow nail looked a though never received slightest attention finally clothing consisted of cotton shirt looked a though have be in use for at least month since last visit to laundress pair of grimy blue dungaree trouser pair of red morocco slipper a lay there in bunk recalling appearance of rescuer trying to evolve therefrom definite impression of man character became aware that duty of ship seemed to be carried on with very unnecessary amount of vociferation contumelious language englishman will sometimes in critical urgent moment garnish order with expletive two by way of stimulus to crew upon occasion to be now referring there be not slightest excuse for anything of kind weather be fine wind moderate be evidently not engaged upon performance of feat of complicated difficult navigation for course remained constant there be making shortening of sail simply appeared that officer of watch happened to be one of distressing trouble making individual who regard a incumbent upon to continually haze men for be constantly bawling trifling order accompanying with running fire of abuse must have be furiously exasperating to person addressed after absence of about hour man who have already visited returned time bearing large bowl of smoking plate containing three large ship biscuit of coarsest kind broth however exhaled distinctly appetising odour have effect of again reminding that be hungry so with visitor assistance contrived to raise into sitting posture forthwith attacked content of bowl previously breaking into small quantity of biscuit broth proved to be turtle soup deliciously made taking time over task consumed whole of companion meanwhile giving account of ship circumstance attending rescue name monsieur said in reply to question of mine be lemaitre jean lemaitre native of fort royal in island of martinique owner a well a captain of la belle jeannette schooner be now honouring with presence be in slave trade monsieur doing business chiefly with spaniard exactly month ago to day sailed from havana for guinea coast came west south about round cape san antonio stretching well over toward spanish main in order to avoid if possible pestilent cruiser of yours seem to be everywhere be always ready to snap up everything that can lay hand upon by great good fortune managed to dodge got through without being interfered with threw into track of hurricane necessitated remaining hove to for twenty six hour four day later a be sailing merrily along saw something floating ahead of ten minute later ran down raft on saw lying face downwards while shark be righting other in effort to get at drag off francois mate be for leaving where be asserting that must surely be dead to pick up dead man must make voyage unlucky be humane man monsieur insisted upon heaving to sending away boat to bring aboard boat crew have hard job of to drive off shark to get safely into boat monsieur even so creature followed boat alongside to number of seventeen for counted francois suggested that must throw to declaring that be a good a dead already that be shame to disappoint shark after have waited so patiently for be humane man monsieur a believe have already mentioned must not listen to proposal so have brought down below placed in spare cabin where have attended to ever since be ten day ago now behold fever have left appetite have returned in week please good god will have on deck again a well a ever be thank monsieur said be infinitely obliged to for humanity prompted to pick up despite dissuasion of mate francois also for trouble have taken in nursing through illness fortunately be in position to make substantial recognition of gratitude upon return to jamaica a to presume there will be difficulty will be first business to take such step a will insure against pecuniary loss on account ah monsieur exclaimed lemaitre beg that will say no more on score hurt that must think necessary to mention so mercenary word a of reward be sailor although have misfortune to be enemy be reason why one brave man must not aid in distress without looking for reward a to return to jamaica doubt can be managed upon return voyage return voyage interrupted can not manage forthwith captain can make quite worth while to up helm run back at once be of utmost importance to to return to port royal with least possible delay ala monsieur can not be done interrupted lemaitre in turn cargo of slave be even now awaiting in cameroon river patron in havana be impatiently looking forward to delivery if be to disappoint must be ruined for have many competitor in trade to contend with especially since talk have arisen about making slave trading illegal regret to be obliged to refuse monsieur there be help for at least said will transfer to british man o ' war must chance to fall in with one be captured lose ship for pain exclaimed lemaitre oh monsieur will give ship wide berth if fall in with trust to heel nonsense monsieur returned surely can not suppose must be so ungrateful a to permit such thing be british officer must of course make point of seeing that in case be held exempt from capture representation must be quite sufficient to secure that for well monsieur will see will see answered lemaitre therewith took empty soup bowl from hand retired from cabin slamming door a usual behind for next three day continued to occupy bunk strength returning slowly on fourth made shift with lemaitre assistance to get into clothes crawl on deck from moment progress toward recovery be rapid meanwhile hazing of have spoken continued at regular interval day night soon ascertained that individual responsible for be none other than francois who so kindly suggested must be hove overboard to shark fellow be evidently born bully never opened mouth to deliver order without abusing insulting men a often a not abuse be accentuated with blow sound of accompanying cry of men must distinctly hear in cabin that however be hardly worst of for soon discovered that lemaitre skipper of precious craft in such doings be permitted be drunkard for night at about nine o'clock used to hear come below order out rum water after francois second mate according to whose watch below happened to be must sit for about hour drinking one against other until language of became incoherent when pair of must stagger stumble off to respective stateroom be first experience of slaver most unpleasant experience be vessel schooner of one hundred twenty ton register although superbly modelled magnificent sea boat sailing like witch be rendered uncomfortable in extreme a abode by filthy condition cleanliness seemed to be regarded by lemaitre a wholly unnecessary luxury with result that effort be made to keep in check steady accumulation of dirt from day to day much le to remove already existed even daily washing down of deck with british sailor have assumed importance imperative character of religious function be deemed superfluous be crew more careful a to own condition that of clothing be fact that during whole period of sojourn on board la belle jeannette never saw one of people attempt to wash article of clothing a natural result of steadfast disregard of most elementary principle of cleanliness little hooker simply swarmed with vermin bad a be be not worst crew from lemaitre downward be low brutal quarrelsome gang always wrangling together frequently fighting while a have already mentioned one predominating idea of francois chief mate be that must only be kept in order by constantly impartially rope ending round possibly may have be right at event found far easier to excuse behaviour after have seen crew than have before time lemaitre have be behaving toward with rough clumsy off hand kindness that personal appearance must have led one to expect try a must must not bring to regard a genuine because through there seemed now then to rise to surface underflow of repressed malignity not pronounced enough to be certain about yet sufficiently distinct to provoke in vague sensation of uneasiness distrust to put matter concisely although lemaitre be by mean effusive in expression of good will toward although there be certain perfunctory quality in such attention a showed there be with curious subtle something so intangible that found utterly impossible to define describe yet impressed with feeling that be unreal assumed mockery pretence though why must be so must not for life of divine chapter eighteen double tragedy have be up about for full week have during period observed in lemaitre manner toward not only steadily decreasing solicitude for welfare be perhaps only natural now that health be rapidly improving also growing disposition to sneer gibe at covert at first more pronounced unmistakable with recurring day that strongly tended to confirm singular suspicion have endeavoured to bring home to mind of reader in preceding chapter then one night incident occurred that in moment explained everything revealed to unpleasant fact that so far a enemy morillo be concerned be still in a great danger a when on board felucca although in present case danger be perhaps trifle more remote have already mentioned lemaitre habit of drinking into state of intoxication night habit obscene language that man seemed to revel in when in condition be so disgusting to that not least prized advantage afforded by convalescence be ability to remain on deck until nightly saturnalia be at end lemaitre companion have retired to cabin on particular night however of be about to speak slight recurrent touch of fever caused to slip quietly below turn in before orgy began not that expected to get to sleep simply because believed warmth dryness of bunk must be better for than damp night air on deck punctually at nine o'clock lemaitre chief mate came noisily clattering down companion ladder glass bottle of rum be produced carouse began have not progressed very far before became apparent to a lay there in hot bunk tossing restlessly that lemaitre be in unusually excited quarrelsome condition that francois chief mate be rapidly approaching similar condition a gulped down tumbler after tumbler of liquor be always argumentative contradictory when drinking together to night be unusually so at length francois made remark a to extraordinary good fortune have met with on particular voyage in having come so far without falling in with british cruiser at lemaitre laughed scornfully declaring that there be not british cruiser afloat must catch la belle jeannette that even if be otherwise must have fear of voyage for said have not guarantee of safety in presence of simple fool courtenay on board have not saved life by rescuing from raft do suppose must reward humanity have have by making prize of schooner not if there be one thing ass of british pride upon more than be chivalrous sense of honour sentiment child that must not outrage for value of fifty such schooner a same added with inflection of deep cunning in voice want to meet with british cruiser at close enough quarter to be compelled to hand dear courtenay over to countryman oh why not demanded francois what advantage be to to keep on board be because be so fond of company pah if have eye in head must see that despite gratitude to for saving life despises what do mean to do with be going to turn adrift among negro when arrive upon coast never must understand why insisted upon saving at queried lemaitre with sneering laugh ah be because be fool francois mon enfant more arrant fool even than dear courtenay do suppose did out of pity for condition because love british will tell why idiot be because will fetch good five hundred dollar at least in slave market at havana so be what intend to do with be retorted francois well lemaitre always knew for as unless have told so with own lip must never have believed to be such as a to sell man for five hundred dollar when can just a easily get thousand for yet call fool idiot pah sicken oh sicken do growled lemaitre by time well advanced toward intoxication take care what be saying friend will be apt to sicken so thoroughly that will be fit for nothing toss over lee bulwark doubt be who be fool who be clever one must like to hear by what mean must propose to get thousand dollar for fellow true be young stalwart will be in prime condition by time that get back to havana will see to have known better men than sold for le than five hundred dollar ay white men too not negro did not say be as retorted francois who talk of selling at havana not do not know who courtenay be then will tell most wise noble captain be youth who attacked destroyed morillo settlement at cariacou remember name perfectly well be told at havana by one who ought to know that morillo have given out among friend that must pay one thousand dollar to anyone who must bring courtenay to alive be not know what morillo be have declared feud against miserable meddlesome englishman not only will gladly pay thousand dollar for privilege of wreaking vengeance upon man who delivers friend courtenay into hand will be free to sail sea without molestation from morillo a long a life what think of captain lemaitre be true demanded lemaitre ay answered francois a true a that be sitting here in cabin why did not tell of before francois friend asked lemaitre in wheedling tone why did not tell before echoed francois ask rather why tell now will answer that be because be fool can not keep good thing to myself when have sac r r re what need be there for to make a wise a eh however be not going to let have choice little bit of information for nothing have told how to make clear five hundred dollar over above what must have earned without information have be idiot enough to give must pay amount do understand ay understand answered lemaitre with sudden return to former sneering aggressive manner must like to know just for satisfaction of curiosity how propose to compel to pay that two hundred fifty dollar that talk about why easily enough snarled francois with sudden fury a realised that lemaitre intended to evade extortion if must if pay immediately after receiving reward from morillo will denounce to will say that intended to have yielded up prisoner to british in order that might curry favour with secure immunity from capture by that must never have given up to morillo at for threat suppose know what will mean for eh oh so be what must do be friend returned lemaitre with harsh laugh well well will be time enough for to threaten when refuse to pay two hundred fifty dollar until then there be need for to quarrel so fill up glass francois let drink to health of dear courtenay who after be quite worth picking up off raft think then followed gurgling sound a two toper filled glass gulping smacking of lip succeeded by banging of empty tumbler upon table came clearly to through latticed upper panel of door then certain staggering sound a two struggled to foot be followed by lemaitre thickly bidding companion good night a pair reeled stumbled away to respective berth slept badly that night fever with intelligence have just acquired combining to make restless wakeful after tossing from side to side until about two bell in morning watch gradually sank into troubled sleep from be startled by sudden outbreak of loud excited shout succeeded by sound of fierce scuffling accompanied by volley of oath exclamation stamp of foot heavy fall rush of footstep up companion ladder sudden heavy splash alongside then followed terrific outcry on deck with hurrying rush of foot on planking overhead furious slatting of canvas a schooner shot into wind more excited shout ending in sort of groaning mingled with ejaculation of dismay sudden silence then terrific jabbering suggestive of idea that hand have incontinently taken leave of sens sprang out of bunk hurriedly proceeded to dress rushing on deck bare footed to see what be matter a emerged from companion way saw hand gathered aft most of staring hard over taffrail while one man be busily engaged in binding up left arm of second mate hillo monsieur charpentier exclaimed what be matter have anything happened happened monsieur must think so exclaimed second mate turning to white ghastly face most awful thing have happened when went below just now to call francois be unable to make hear although called several time knocked ever so hard at door so ventured to turn door handle enter cabin what do think saw monsieur why poor francois lying dead in bunk clothes soaked with blood great gaping wound in breast right over heart be so horrified monsieur scarcely knew what to do collecting with mighty effort went to call captain when reached cabin found door wide open monsieur lemaitre crouched in corner of with great bloodstained knife in hand eye glaring lip mumbling muttering know not what saw that there be something wrong with monsieur believed have gone mad be about to turn away call for help saw before be aware sprang upon seizing with one hand by throat while with other aimed blow after blow at with terrible knife defended a well a must monsieur fighting bravely for life what can one do against madman captain seemed to posse strength of twenty men forced irresistibly back against bulkhead then drove knife through arm believing that have killed relaxed hold upon whereupon hurled to deck sprang over fallen body bounded up on deck from thence overboard now tell monsieur that have scarcely struck water when shark rose seized dragged under see monsieur look astern be gone there be nothing to be seen of what will do oh mon dieu what will do be quite sure that captain be seized by shark demanded looking round from one to of men who have now turned face inboard stood staring alternately at charpentier oh yes monsieur excitedly replied dozen of together saw be monster continued one of captain have scarcely risen to surface after plunge overboard when shark seized by middle dragged under saw blood dyeing water did not shipmate captain never uttered cry just threw up arm vanished be not that friend yes yes exclaimed again be jules describes exactly a occurred then said seems to monsieur charpentier captain lemaitre mate being dead nothing remains for to take command navigate schooner to destination monsieur can not do for unhappily be not navigator replied charpentier wringing hand do mean to say that know nothing about navigation demanded ala monsieur nothing be reply be there one else among who can navigate schooner asked men looked at other shaking head muttering not finally charpentier exclaimed see monsieur there be not one of who can navigate what be to be done monsieur be officer at least so understood francois to say perhaps must well demanded seeing that fellow hesitated perhaps must what pardon monsieur exclaimed be in hope that considering difficulty be placed in by most lamentable tragedy must kindly take command navigate schooner see remarked well continued if such be wish of have objection to do a wish understand will only consent to navigate schooner back to west indie will not undertake trouble responsibility of carrying ship to destination shipping cargo disapprove on principle of slave trading consider iniquitous traffic will have nothing to do with if be willing will navigate ship back to port royal guaranteeing immunity from capture upon arrival in consideration of rescue succour that have afforded when there will have difficulty in procuring someone who will navigate schooner from thence to havana other port that may choose to go to just talk over among yourselves let know what decide on doing must see that proposal be not at to charpentier liking indeed to liking of of crew cared not for be quite determined to have nothing to do with kidnapping of unfortunate black in end be obliged to give way although charpentier tried hard to dissuade from resolution result being that immediately after have ascertained position at noon wore round shaped course for martinique island being in direct line with jamaica at first be rather apprehensive that disappointment of men at so unprofitable result of voyage must cause to be troublesome did not question of turning back having once be settled seemed to take matter very philosophically fact that be now relieved of mate tyranny perhaps reconciling to such disappointment a might otherwise have felt need not dwell upon return voyage be singularly uneventful suffice to say that favoured with fine weather fair wind way made exceptionally smart run across atlantic entering port royal harbour on morning of twenty second day after bearing up eleven week to day from date of abduction by dominguez sudden reappearance created quite sensation among dockyard people disappearance having be involved in so much mystery that sort of surmise have be indulged in to account for be of opinion have fallen overboard into harbour have found secure hiding place in maw of shark there be others who happening to have be present when be summoned from mammy wilkinson hotel upon supposititious errand of help rescue to young lindsay at once mentioned circumstance with result that very strong suspicion of foul play be aroused friend patron admiral be especially concerned upon account even going to length of offering reward of fifty pound for such intelligence a must lead to discovery resulted in nothing worthy caesar peter perhaps being too much afraid to utter word of what knew then there occurred more frigate action resulting in so heavy pressure of work that nobody seemed to have time to think about mysterious disappearance of somewhat obscure young lieutenant now that have unexpectedly turned up again safe sound be overwhelmed with congratulation while admiral sent party of police to house to have be conveyed with instruction that two negro be to be at once found arrested house however proved to be empty when police made domiciliary visit a for negro whereabouts be never discovered possibly excitement of reappearance talk to gave rise alarmed caused to beat hasty retreat to other island to great joy discovered that diane be not yet recommissioned repair alteration to having be greatly delayed by more pressing work of repairing frigate while admiral in hope might still turn up with extreme kindness have marked treatment of have determined not to give command of to anyone else until must be absolutely ready for sea therefore at once stepped into former position lost time in getting a many men to work upon a must be spared there be le difficulty in accomplishing morillo be believed to be more busy than ever several outward bound ship being overdue without occurrence of bad weather to account for disappearance meanwhile during progress of work aboard brigantine gave up to task of getting together crew of old friend black peter constituted nucleus while several former tern volunteered again inducing other men of acquaintance to come forward join so that by time that finishing touch be being put to diane have fifty two first rate men waiting to go aboard a soon a ship must be ready to receive wanted five more to complete complement picked up by making raid one night upon low boarding house in kingston where crimp be in habit of taking in sailor keeping in hiding until have extracted from penny of hard earned wage at length five week from date of reappearance time arrived when diane being ready for sea with gun mounted provision water store of kind on board sail bent hauled off alongside powder hulk to ship ammunition delicate job having be successfully accomplished under personal supervision went up to kingston to dine with admiral prior to sailing calling at hotel on way in order to change clothes a entered building head waiter negro stepped forward handed letter addressed in unknown foreign

several men o ' war being in port at time while large contingent of civilian might always be met at admiral table old gentleman received with wonted kindness cordiality introducing to such of guest a have not met before relating over dinner table with much gusto story of abduction escape then produced be letter of defiance took with to show added fillip to conversation lasted until cloth be drawn sat rather late over wine when rose to go admiral invited into library for moment said well lad d intend to accept piratical rascal challenge most assuredly do sir if can fall in with answered very well said admiral will have opportunity to give thrashing that so richly deserves there handing packet be order will find be that while cruising against enemy doing a much harm a can to commerce be to keep bright lookout for morillo capture destroy at cost when do sail moment can get aboard sir answered be right be right will then be able to make good offing before land breeze drop returned admiral well continued good bye boy successful cruise to if when return bring morillo with can assure of destruction will have swab for will consider that have well earned therewith left drove into kingston where routed out boatman made best of way aboard diane hour later brigantine be under way threading passage through shoal to seaward under influence of roaring land breeze question now exercised mind be where be to look for morillo in what direction must be most likely to find be most difficult question to answer after considering matter in bearing came to conclusion that most likely haunt must probably be near one of great entrance from atlantic to caribbean sea where must be conveniently posted to intercept plunder outward homeward bound ship although must probably take care not to establish too near lest must run foul of of cruiser stationed in same locality for protection of british bottom trading to from west indian port must in likelihood select spot two three hundred mile away out in atlantic from must command outward homeward route of ship bound from to europe opened chart of north atlantic studied carefully trying to imagine in place thinking what must do under such circumstance reasoning in way at length fixed upon belt of ocean suitable for piratical purpose thither determined to make way thoroughly searching mile of intervening water a did so then came question whether must select windward mona passage by to make way into atlantic after much anxious consideration decided upon windward passage being channel most frequently used by merchantman accordingly set course for morant point then went below turned in when went on deck next morning shortly after daybreak found that diane have weathered point be now on starboard tack heading well up for cape mayzi with blue mountain already assuming hue from be named a brigantine rapidly left astern be brilliant morning with trade wind piping up to tune of gale yet little ship be showing topgallantsail to sheering through rather short choppy sea like mad thing with yard braced hard in against lee rigging lower half of foresail dark with spray while white foam hissed seethed raced past to leeward at pace made one giddy to look at diane be perfect marvel in matter of speed good sea boat withal be undeniable a stood aft to windward of helmsman watched little hooker thrashing along felt sanguine must be fortunate enough to encounter senor morillo must have small chance of escaping by showing clean pair of heel following midnight found handsomely weathering cape mayzi most easterly extremity of island of cuba after held on until have brought southern extremity of great inagua broad abeam when again tacked so worked way out to sea between handkerchief shoal grand caicos passing inward bound indiaman on way spoke vessel asking if have sighted suspicious craft of late to skipper replied that four day previously have be chased by french brig have contrived to elude in darkness that have on following day sighted spoken british frigate euterpe have forthwith proceeded in quest of brig thenceforth sighted nothing until fifth day out when fell in with euterpe have just returned to station after unsuccessful search two day later sighted british privateer made sail tried to run away from a soon a made out pennant fearing so skipper said when overhauled compelled to heave to that must impress of men a have a many hand a required let go without compelling to pay toll report be that atlantic be absolutely empty of shipping having sighted nothing british line of battle ship three frigate during passage across finally reached cruising ground have selected a being most likely spot in to meet morillo there cruised for full fortnight just reaching to fro athwart wind under mainsail topsail jib still there be sign of guerrilla of other craft at length became so thoroughly discouraged that one night soon after sundown went below got out chart proceeded to study afresh with view to selection of other cruising ground at length after long anxious consideration fixed upon new spot for determined to bear up next day if by noon nothing have hove in sight chanced however that at dawn next morning craft be made out ten mile to windward of officer of watch at once came down below called went on deck immediately to find that day be just breaking stranger even then only barely visible against faint light be spreading along eastern horizon a stood looking made out to be square rigged vessel apparently of great size running down toward under easy canvas thought came to that here be guerrilla at last that patience be about to meet reward few minute later by time a supposed have grown light enough to reveal canvas to approaching stranger craft suddenly hauled wind then saw that be brig that be not merchantman be obvious from fact that be under such short canvas showed being two topsail spanker jib just such canvas a privateer gun brig must show in fact on cruising ground at once set down for one other of nationality however be impossible to correctly judge at distance in still imperfect light there be certain subtle something in appearance that suggested france a land of birth meanwhile a have rounded to on same tack a ourselves evidently with intention of taking good look at before approaching too near held on a be going taking notice whatever of in about quarter of hour however became apparent that be head reaching upon whereupon dropped foresail to keep pace with while on part took small pull upon lee brace enabled to head up point higher so gradually edge up toward such excessive caution a stranger be now exhibiting convinced that must not be british must consequently be enemy having once made up mind upon point very gradually braced yard a flat in against rigging a must come flattened in main jib sheet thus brought diane on taut bowline without a hoped arousing suspicion of stranger meanwhile keeping telescope constantly levelled upon in order must see hand in rigging going aloft to make sail might follow suit without loss of time did not wish to take initiative because by so doing might possibly alarm while so long a kept on a be be gradually almost imperceptibly closing state of affair prevailed for about hour when suddenly with view perhaps of compelling to disclose intention stranger tacked obliged thus to throw off mask at once did same hand who have be standing by waiting for order at same time springing into rigging to loose additional canvas by time that little hooker be fairly round on starboard tack yard swung topgallant sail gaff topsail be sheeted home in act of being hoisted together with flying jib foretopmast staysail main maintopmast staysail while fore tack be being boarded sheet hauled aft caused immediate stir aboard stranger who in turn at once set plain sail to topgallant sail wind being altogether too fresh for of to show royal to manoeuvre just described brought brig about three point before starboard beam eight mile to windward of craft being now close hauled on starboard tack there be strong breeze blowing from north east with fair amount of sea on day be brilliantly fine with rich clear crystalline blue sky dappled here there with puff of white trade cloud sailing solemnly athwart masthead splendid day for sailing have whole of before soon became apparent that be gaining upon brig weathering fore reaching upon at same time a be now broad daylight sent men to quarter hoisted colour fired shotted gun to windward a invitation to to heave to of took notice whatever by nine o'clock at hour took observation of sun for longitude have fore reached upon brig sufficiently to bring couple of point abaft weather beam then in accordance with rule for chasing tacked again whereupon did same thus bringing right astern slightly to windward of be now stern chase being a nearly a possible seven mile ahead of wind held steady hour after hour two craft went plunging along at racing speed brigantine gaining steadily time until by one o'clock chase be within range opened fire upon with long eighteen pounder shot flew close to on side a must see by jet of water thrown up be fully hour before hit then did fair in centre of stern immediately shot into wind aback took fully five minute to box off again when seeing suppose that must not now possibly escape people clewed up course hauled down topgallant sail staysail until have reduced canvas to what have be when first sighted hoisted french colour bore up for be at time that first made out upper canvas of vessel just appearing above horizon in northern board evidently steering in direction upon sending aloft one of midshipman who be acting a lieutenant reported a craft of apparently about own size fact that be heading toward led to conclusion that must be privateer small cruiser like evidently attracted by sound of gun a did not wish for assistance if friend additional anxiety of having to fight at same time a brig if enemy called hand aft made brief speech impressing upon importance of settling brig business a promptly a possible in order that might be free to give other stranger undivided attention if necessary answered with hearty cheer went back to gun quarter of hour later brig rounded to within biscuit toss to windward of giving larboard broadside a did so be beginning of regular set to hammer tongs between french fighting with utmost courage determination playing havoc with rigging cut up so severely that dozen of people be kept busy aloft knotting splicing at length however when fight have thus be raging for full hour with heavy loss on side tacking suddenly under cover of smoke of starboard broadside shot across brig stern raking with double shotted broadside from larboard gun have effect of bringing mast down by run rendering wreck unmanageable now felt that be ours be reckoning without host rather without second stranger whom have be altogether too busy to give thought to a smoke of gun blew away to leeward prepared to tack again preparatory to passing once more athwart brig stern got full clear view of stranger who approaching from to windward have hitherto be hidden from by brig by smoke of combined cannonade be le than mile distant from be at moment in very act of taking in studding sail be brigantine single glance at sufficed to assure that be guerrilla at last feud between morillo be to be fought out to bitter end have long ago prepared red swallow tailed burgee such a pirate have dared to exhibit immediately gave order to hoist at fore royal masthead flag have scarcely reached truck when saw black flag flutter out over other brigantine rail go soaring aloft to gaff end morillo have evidently recognised challenge be prompt to answer sweeping under brig stern again at distance of only few fathom hailed asking whether surrendered pistol shot flew close past ear be only reply so gave starboard broadside then wore round to meet new antagonist leaving brig meanwhile to own device be of opinion that morillo must have have very shrewd suspicion a to identity long before exhibition of burgee because of eager haste with bore down upon so eager indeed be that carried studding sail just minute two too long mistake on part enabled to make couple of short stretch to windward secure weather gage before be ready to round to although a soon a people detected purpose worked with frantic haste to shorten pirate opened ball by giving whole larboard broadside while be in stay tacking toward gun be fired hurriedly did harm shot flying high over between mast without touching so much a ropeyarn five minute later passed close across guerrilla stern making half board to clear delivered larboard broadside with eighteen pounder thrown in shot taking effect raking from end to end morillo be standing aft by taffrail a passed near enough to hear wash of water about pirate vessel rudder suddenly snatched up blunderbuss singling out fired point blank at one bullet knocking cap off while lodged in left shoulder third killing man at wheel close behind guerrilla immediately ported helm while springing to wheel put hard starboard thus passing second time athwart antagonist stern again raked mercilessly time with starboard broadside keeping wheel hard over swept round until be once more in stay guerrilla having tacked toward minute earlier with evident intention of raking in turn be just little too quick for however gathering way so smartly that a neared other became evident that unless one other of tacked again must inevitably run foul of other have mind for sort of thing however a must probably hurt quite a much a antagonist so holding on until have only just room to clear guerrilla singing out for second shot to be rammed home in larboard gun eased helm down just at right moment ranging up so close to other brigantine that almost grazed side when exchanged broadside at precisely same instant with terrible effect on side at same moment topsail be thrown aback to deaden way a guerrilla passed ahead helm be put hard up paid square off across stern firing starboard broadside into a did so result time be absolutely disastrous to pirate for gun be fired at precise moment when guerrilla stern be lifted up on crest of sea while be in trough beyond in consequence of shot struck trifle below normal water line producing very serious leak even under most favourable circumstance must have be exceedingly difficult to stop be not worst of shot by lucky accident so far a be concerned have somehow become concentrated of taking effect upon pirate rudder stern post with result that former be shot away latter a well a two three hood end so badly started that ere ten minute have elapsed became apparent that guerrilla be rapidly filling meanwhile however held on across stern filling topsail again tacking a soon a have room while pirate brigantine deprived of rudder shot into wind got in iron obstinately refusing to pay off on tack enabled to sweep across bow pouring in port broadside a passed raking fore aft bringing down foremast by run holding on for few minute next wore round getting starboard broadside a passed then cut close across stern again raking a before by time however have become apparent that be sinking so having once more tacked ranged up close athwart stern with topsail aback when instead of firing hailed to ask if surrendered senor replied morillo who be standing aft close to now useless wheel will never surrender wrote letter hope received in said must fight until ship sink under mean to do so also told that feud with be to death so take therewith scoundrel quickly levelled pistol for second time day fired point blank at there be doubt whatever that time must have slain for pistol be pointed so truly that actually looked for moment right into barrel of have not be for diane helmsman who unceremoniously seized by arm in very nick of time quickly pulled aside a be bullet whistled close past ear dastardly act so exasperated people that forthwith without waiting for order poured whole of port broadside into devoted craft completely demolishing stern so for few second a drew slowly athwart wake got full view of deck be cumbered with killed wounded literally streaming with blood still by miracle morillo survived last destructive broadside of ours for when smoke blew away saw still standing erect shaking fist defiantly at be by time evident to that guerrilla be doomed ship be settling fast in water to continue firing upon must only be waste of ammunition therefore filled topsail few minute later tacked again getting broadside from sinking ship when stationed square athwart bow where be pretty well out of way of fire with topsail aback mainsheet eased off waited patiently for final moment saw be rapidly approaching yet even now morillo persisted in firing at with two bow gun compelling to fire upon in return so useless fight went on until guerrilla have settled so low in water that sea welled in over bow at plunge of rendering impossible to longer maintain fire then with folded hand stood by watching for end very melancholy picture be upon looked there be illimitable expanse of ocean round blue a sapphire heaving in long regular ridge of swell whipped into foam here there by scourging of strong trade wind with rich blue sky above dappled with wisp of trade cloud sun shining brilliantly down from midst of causing heaving water to flash glitter under fiery beam so that sea way be too dazzling to look at there right in centre of glowing picture lay two brigantine with bulwark torn splintered to piece sail riddled with shot hole rigging badly cut up deck scored with shot mark littered with dead wounded men while guerrilla be even more melancholy wreck than a lay heaving rolling sluggishly with covering board awash sea sweeping deck from stem to taffrail at plunge wreck of foremast towing under bow there be not soul visible on board when first engaged deck have appeared to be crowded with men now most of be either killed wounded few who have escaped seemed to have flung down exhausted for have disappeared a for craft herself be now only when rose heavily upon ridge of swell that must see hull at plunge that took into hollow threatened to be last yet lingered a though reluctant to leave brilliant sunshine warm strong breeze lingered until began to wonder whether must not after remain afloat water logged wreck then in moment stern rose high in air revealing shattered rudder stern post with long slow diving movement plunged forward like sounding whale silently vanished in little swirl of water at once bore up for spot where have disappeared finding easily by torn splintered fragment of wreckage came floating up to surface crew went down with to man for although cruised about spot for fully hour never saw even so much a dead body come to surface so ended that terror of sea guerrilla with bloodthirsty pirate crew with destruction ended feud have be thrust upon by one of most fiendish monster in human form that ever sailed ocean may perhaps seem to reader cold blooded deed on part to remain passively by calmly watch passing of wretch to account in reality be act of mercy for end be at least swift whereas have saved of must only have be that might terminate career upon gallows meanwhile brig have dropped six mile to leeward during fight crew have made best of opportunity by endeavouring to get jury spar aloft time however be too short for when ran down to be still in thick of work have now have enough of fighting for when again hailed to ask if surrendered at once replied in affirmative in due course took possession of nereide of bordeaux armed with twelve long nine pounder with crew originally of eighty six men of whom twenty three be killed fifty seven wounded in fight with spent remainder of day in completing rigging of jury mast that people have begun made sail upon craft just after sunset same evening arriving safely in port royal harbour three week later now what remains to be said tale of association with fate of morillo pirate be told need add be that when account of exploit be told received great deal more credit praise than felt really deserved while a for friend admiral well be a good a word for within twenty four hour of arrival with prize in port royal harbour handed with hearty congratulation many kind word commission entitled to mount t'other swab end
