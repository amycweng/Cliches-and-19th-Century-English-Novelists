turned adrift by harry collingwood be very fast moving book by master of nautical writing will enjoy especially so if listen to a audiobook turned adrift by harry collingwood chapter one seizure of zenobia zenobia at lloyd be beautiful little clipper barque of ton register so exquisitely fine be line that cargo carrying capacity amounted to few ton more than register tonnage in fact naval architect who designed have be instructed to ignore altogether question of cargo capacity to give whole attention to matter of speed most faithfully have carried out instruction for zenobia have be designed built to order of firm owned famous queen line of sailing clipper trading between london natal aim of company be to drive off competitor secure monopoly of passenger trade between london garden colony there be only one way in aim must be accomplished namely by carrying passenger to fro in le time greater comfort than of competing line question of cargo did not matter so very much for at time be to say about year steam service to south africa be very different from what be to day steamer be small slow infrequent natal be just then attracting big influx of well to do people from england passenger rate be high a also for matter be freight on such special merchandise a be at time being carried out to colony who took credit to for foresight believed that there be big money to be made in sailing passenger trade needle to say competition between different line be exceedingly keen owner of queen line be very rich corporation be prepared to sink money in effort to secure monopoly zenobia be latest outcome of rather speculative policy at moment when story open namely about two bell of middle watch on night of january rather in early morning of january to be exact barque be somewhere about latitude degree south longitude degree west have not precise figure by do very greatly matter night be fine clear starlit with moon well advanced in fourth quarter hanging few degree above eastern horizon shedding just enough light to touch wave crest immediately beneath with soft flash of ruddy golden light wind be piping up fresh from south east little clipper be roaring through under plain sail to royal with yeast slopping in over starboard rail at lee roll lee scupper afloat for quick passage be order of day quick passage meant carrying on mr stephen bligh chief mate officer of watch be living fully up to tradition of service be zenobia second outward voyage first trip have be accomplished in unprecedentedly brief period of forty six day be now ambition of skipper two mate to beat even brilliant record at moment there seemed excellent prospect that laudable ambition might be achieved for morrow must only be twenty fourth day out have be extraordinarily lucky in matter of crossing line having slid across with good breeze have run into south east trade without loss of moment same south east trade something remarkably like be still piping up fresh although be by time well beyond ordinary southern limit ship company amounted to twenty four told namely captain john robert skipper mr stephen bligh chief mate mr peter johnson second mate dr john morrison surgeon ours being one of few ship in trade at time carried doctor boatswain carpenter sailmaker cook two steward twelve men of whom eight be ab four only o last not least in own estimation two apprentice tom bainbridge in fifth year of apprenticeship being one while mark temple just turned seventeen year of age in third year of apprenticeship be other there be not much love lost between bainbridge by way for be of sullen sulky temper have tried hard to bully when first made acquaintance in old boadicea before joining zenobia mutual ill feeling did not greatly matter for be in port watch in starboard so very rarely met except when be case of hand consequently have not very much opportunity to quarrel in addition to above carried twenty cuddy passenger of whom six be men while remainder consisted of nine lady five child be afraid above detail be not very interesting be necessary to give in order that reader may fully understand what be to follow a have already mentioned story may be said to have have beginning about two bell in middle watch about one o'clock in morning on certain specified date for until then there have be nothing out of ordinary to distinguish voyage from other five minute after have struck two bell in accordance with chief mate instruction lookout on topgallant forecastle have responded with usual cry of well one of forecastle hand came slouching along aft ascending poop ladder with certain suggestion of haste trepidation approached mate will ye mind steppin ' for'ard minute sir enquired there be strong smell o ' burnin ' down in fo cbele strong smell of burning interrupted mr bligh dickens there be yes of course will go temple turning to just keep lookout for minute two while be gone will ye ay ay sir replied mate dashed down poop ladder went scurrying away forward regardless of drenching shower of spray came flying in over weather cathead with mad plunge of overdriven ship for next five minute paced anxiously to fro along weather side of poop with ear wide open for sudden outcry might confirm awful suspicion of fire having broken out below heard nothing save continuous hiss roar of sea under lee bow along bend heavy slop of water in over rail with lee roll of ship thunder piping of wind aloft be beginning to hope that be worse than false alarm when man who few minute previously have come aft to summon mate came running yes positively running along deck again stumbled up poop ladder came to puffing panting with sign of most extreme agitation delivered message mr temple gasped skipper always insisted upon midshipman apprentice being mistered by foremast hand upon ground that be officer if only in embryo mr temple mate say will ye please slip below quietly call cap'n robert without disturbin ' passenger be to tell that ship afire in forehold that mr bligh will be much obliged if will come for'ard to fo cbele at once when ye have done that ye be to continue lookout on poop until ye be relieved ay ay mason will do answered then a turned together to leave poop asked be matter serious mason have mr bligh actually found seat of fire be there chance of being able to master ca say a yet answered man ai actually found fire be there all right shivered involuntarily although night be warm for happened to know that good deal of cargo be carrying be of highly combustible character such a furniture piano manchester good like to say nothing of several case of sporting ammunition knew that if once fire happened to get good hold upon such material a that chance be against being able to master especially in such strong breeze a be then blowing if must be compelled to leave ship thought of poor helpless woman child peacefully sleeping down below of what plight might be if be driven to take to boat out there in heart of south atlantic hundred of mile from nearest land tiptoeing way to skipper cabin rapped gently with knuckle on panel of door bent head to listen for reply knew that captain robert be light sleeper judged that must not take much to awake be mistaken for immediately following upon low knock came quiet reply hillo who be there what be be temple sir replied may enter for answer heard light thud of bare foot inside cabin a skipper sprang from bunk next instant door quietly opened captain robert stood before what be temple demanded anything wrong yes sir be afraid there be replied in low tone mr bligh be down in forecastle have just sent message aft to directing to call say that be afraid fire have broken out in fore hold that will be much obliged if will kindly go to at once fire ejaculated skipper in fore hold say humph notice smell of here started sniffing violently a stooped for slipper put on who gave alarm mason sir replied came aft just after two bell reported strong smell of burning down in forecastle mr bligh went for'ard at once leaving to keep lookout on poop have be gone about five minute when mason again came aft with message directing to call see answered skipper very well a emerged from cabin quietly closed door behind go back to poop keep eye upon ship will not be long with one bound a seemed to be out on deck running forward a for returned to station on poop anxiously paced backward forward in momentary expectation of hearing call for hand when came to look more closely appeared that such formal call must be quite superfluous for presently light flashed out from window of small house just abaft foremast in boatswain carpenter sailmaker cook two steward be berthed by rather feeble beam perceived that fore deck be full of men crouching under shelter of topgallant forecastle presumed therefore that upon first alarm of fire have turned out dressed have be sent on deck by mate to be out of way while investigation below be being made be about time noticed with keen satisfaction fact that wind be not blowing quite a strongly a have be during earlier part of watch be beginning to think that skipper be remaining below rather long time be drawing most disquieting conclusion from circumstance when one of crew man whom recognised a owen lloyd generally known among messmate a welshy came aft entered little house abaft main hatch where bainbridge have lodging few second later small glimmer from open door showed that man be lighting lamp illuminated snuggery minute two afterwards lloyd emerged again went forward while bainbridge also stepped out on deck disappeared beneath break of poop be gone three four minute then reappeared accompanied by mr johnson second mate whom have evidently be directed to call for pair immediately proceeded forward at trot decided that matter be assuming distinctly serious aspect five minute later bainbridge came aft ascending to poop remarked to in usual surly offhand manner be wanted at once in forecastle temple be to keep lookout in place right replied how be getting on for'ard have found fire yet go look for sonny waste valuable time in stopping to ask silly question be ungracious reply received suppose be reflection that served right for persisting in attempt to be civil to lout drove out of head thought have flashed into for instant that be rather queer that skipper must have sent for at moment when bainbridge be actually on spot must serve purpose quite a well so all unsuspectingly trundled away forward flinging leg over coaming of fore scuttle dropped down into forecastle noting en passant that dozen more of hand be still huddling together under shelter of topgallant forecastle a be in very act of swinging down off coaming thought caught sound of subdued chuckle emanating from somebody among group before have time to give matter thought wonder what might be cause of such ill timed mirth foot reached deck of forecastle found centre of group of half dozen of crew with slush lamp swinging violently with motion of ship darting feeble ray thither a hung suspended from smoky beam overhead in same instant caught momentary glimpse of form of captain robert mr bligh mr johnson bound hand foot with gag in mouth huddled up in three of recently vacated bunk a for supposed fire there be sight smell of what began before must utter sound felt head dragged violently back big gag thrust between jaw while arm leg be at same instant seized by powerful hand lashed so securely must not have moved of by so much a inch no not to save life work be done with speed precision might be expected of men accustomed to manipulation of rope tying of knot then be lifted off foot flung with scant ceremony into one of unoccupied bunk there be last one passenger can be left until to morrer mornin ' to be dealt with exclaimed voice recognised a of welshy now lad voice continued let go on deck take of muslin off there be use in strainin ' hooker to piece bainbridge say a be quite far enough south abeady bainbridge must be possible that bainbridge be mixed up with vile conspiracy for conspiracy be clearly enough to obtain possession of ship without necessity to fight for bound form of skipper two mate to say nothing of proved beyond doubt very cunningly devised scheme be too ably planned most efficiently executed enticement of mate into forecastle by suggestion of fire then after just right lapse of time fictitious message to skipper through followed by summons of second mate finally capture of insignificant self be much too subtle scheme to be evolved by uninventive brain of average british shellback fancied that recognised certain bainbridge like neatness of touch finish in perhaps be prejudiced for never liked fellow yet if be not in why be still free instead of being down in forecastle captive like rest of remembered now that on several occasion have seen fraternising with men for'ard during dog watch have thought nothing of at time beyond reflecting to seemed to be rather bad form on part not by mean conducive to good discipline a recalled occasion to mind while lay there in close evil smelling bunk idly wondered whether have used for purpose of seducing men from duty allegiance persuading to join in outrageous act of unprovoked mutiny for unprovoked most assuredly be owner be most liberal provider food be best obtainable allowance of far exceeded board of trade scale men have grog a well a lime juice served out to regularly day skipper be easy going with to degree neither of mate must by wildest stretch of imagination be termed slave driver although of course exacted certain amount of daily work finally afternoon watch below be never called upon except when necessity demanded in short zenobia be a comfortable ship a sailor need wish to go to sea in be certain that atrocious seizure of ship have not originated in discontent on part of men who be neither better worse than average british seaman have be played upon by skilful hand baser passion have be so strongly appealed to better judgment have be blinded felt morally convinced that there be not man among legitimate occupant of forecastle who possessed ability to do thing then asked who be master spirit who have contrived so effectually to blind mislead simple minded men so powerfully to influence that have eventually permitted to be betrayed into act converted into outlaw with man hand against why have done have grievance real imaginary against of officer that fact be patent from manner in seizure of ship have be effected there have be none of brutal violence bloodshed usually accompanies mutiny upon high sea then why mentally repeated have men mutinied at answer came to mind be bainbridge yes prejudice ill feeling apart must think of other individual in ship with will disposition to concoct carry out such scheme to begin with be only discontented person so far a knew on ship discontent be of dangerous kind be dissatisfied not with one particular thing with everything be poor a understood practically friendless except for uncle who have apprenticed to sea in order to get rid of be restive under discipline character being strongly imbued with false pride chafe at subordinate position have often heard declare that be born to be leader of men have laughed at what seemed to to be inordinate conceit hated work a heartily a loved trashy sensational literature displayed quite childish love of dainty food showy clothes be not only fault be unblushing liar scoffed at such old fashioned virtue a honesty truth godliness sneered at time that found on knee offering up morning nightly petition to maker be cruel when have chance to be so in short seemed surcharged with gall bitterness possessed only one redeeming point so far a must ever discover be that be splendid navigator prided upon skill with sextant often used to assert in cynical way of might be jest earnest one must never tell day must become pirate king establish magnificently on fair island of pacific heaven thought must be possible that fellow have actually be in earnest that mutiny be outcome of evil ambition certainly looked very much like meanwhile during time that thought speculation have be running through head hand on deck have be noisily engaged in shortening sail from time that took about job easier more buoyant movement of ship conjectured that have taken in not only royal also topgallantsails together with probably flying jib few of lighter staysail then when mutineer have done that deemed necessary in way of shortening sail four of came down into forecastle with aid of rope bight of be passed round body skipper mate be hauled up on deck carried into fore house where found boatswain chip sail a securely trussed up a ourselves there still gagged bound helplessly hand foot be left to meditation until after very eternity a seemed of extreme discomfort first came daylight finally eight bell of morning watch when sliding door of house be thrust open one of men entered fellow named adam after looking at meditatively for moment carefully examining lashing to assure that still held firmly removed gag from mouth for for one be profoundly thankful informed that breakfast be about to be brought to that hand must be loosed to enable to partake of warned that instruction be to shoot at slightest sign of attempt on part to break out of house slightest uplifting of voice to give point to statement exhibited fully loaded revolver captain robert at once recognised a own personal property pray who gave instruction adam demanded skipper ai allowed to say answered man be to tell continued that ai none of yer permitted to talk to of men to ask question if persist in doin ' so be to be gagged again very well agreed skipper artfully then will not ask anything that feel ought not to tell suppose will have objection to tell without asking have be done with regard to passenger gen'lemen have be lashed up same a yourselves locked away two in cabin while woman folk kid be locked up safe in other cabin so there ai chancet of none of 'em bein ' able to slip for'ard help yer anyways now ask nothin ' more because ai goin ' to answer yer replied adam with show of testiness suppose can tell if choose what new skipper bainbridge be going to do with insinuated be not going to keep cooped up here until man o ' war come along capture ship be now look ' e here mister temple go for to try to pump will be worse for yer expostulated adam ai got nothin ' against want to hurt yer if can help s'help will have to shove that there gag back into yer mouth if clap stopper on tongue of yours ah here come cooky with grub announced with sigh of relief a doctor made appearance at door with well loaded tray picture that tray presented be conclusive evidence that might be ultimate intention of mutineer toward did not mean to starve to death for breakfast be placed before consisted of best that steward pantry must produce did fullest justice to even skipper making hearty meal although believe be not so much because have good appetite a that have very shrewd suspicion of what lay before be exceedingly doubtful a to when must next have opportunity to sit down to good well cooked meal a for be healthily hungry be altogether too young of too sanguine temperament to feel very anxious a to what be to be outcome of adventure moreover be unburdened by responsibility of sort therefore ate drank until be fully satisfied be still busy with breakfast when alteration in motion of ship apprised of fact that helm have be put up that be now running off with wind on port quarter next moment heard voice instantly recognised a bainbridge summoning men to brace yard be trimmed very nearly square then came order to loose sheet home hoist away topgallantsails royal next men who have gone aloft to loose sail be ordered to rig out port studdingsail boom to set royal topgallant studdingsails on way down finally topmast lower studdingsails be set zenobia went rolling wallowing away to westward under rag must be packed upon remark be made upon so long a man adam remained with when at length have finished breakfast have reluctantly submitted to be trussed up again because must not help ourselves nothing must be gained by offering unavailing resistance be once more shut in left to ourselves skipper turned to mr bligh remarked now what doe scoundrel mean by shift of helm think be only about four five degree to southward of rio at moment can man be such fool a to think of running in until sight coast then turning adrift to get ashore a best can because if doe will have british man o ' war after in time believe boy be quite such as a indeed regard a being very far from as except in one particular instance of organising mutiny answered bligh have slightest notion of what intends to be after think may be quite certain that bainbridge wo give much of chance to report until have have time to get well out of neighbourhood what say johnson be in watch must know good deal better than do if be speaking of bainbridge answered second mate fully agree with that be very far from being fool quite other way about indeed from what know of young villain must say that may be depended upon to give smallest possible chance of reporting quickly opinion be so far up to moment of shifting helm zenobia have be following usual ship track to south'ard round cape hence have be liable to fall in at moment with other ship must not exactly suit bainbridge book therefore have shifted helm be now running off track far enough to avoid meeting with other ship in opinion will continue so to run until considers quite out of danger what will do afterward how will dispose of will leave to better guesser than to imagine only thing that feel at certain about be that will not murder if have intended to do that must not have taken such elaborate pain to get alive uninjured into power quite so fully agree with there returned skipper thing ca fathom be young scoundrel motive for taking ship what proposes to do with now that have her by way mr temple be think who first named bainbridge a ringleader of rascally job what led to fix upon so pat well sir said fact be that after brought in here left bound hand foot gagged so that must neither move talk endeavoured to beguile time by asking who be responsible for seizure of ship then trying to find answer to question forthwith proceeded to give resume of cogitation have ultimately led to fixing blame for affair upon bainbridge shoulder in course of remark happened to mention at first have be inclined to suspect man nicknamed welshy have soon come to conclusion that fellow have not brain necessary to plan coup carry out to successful conclusion in masterly manner have distinguished actual operation ah welshy ' be in though cut in boatswain know be for bainbridge be for ever gettin ' away together by theirselves talkin ' by fathom welshy ' be one of here socialist buckos who be got notion that hand ought to be on same level that nobody ought to have more of anything than anybody else be rare hand at preachin ' about equality right o ' man be welshy ' must be bit surprised if turned out that 't be a first give mr bainbridge idee of seizin ' ship even if be know that be pretty well mixed up in for be everlastin'ly yarnin ' about hardship wrong of sailormen throwin ' out hint like did take notice of 'em at time in fac chip used to argufy with laugh at now since here mutiny job have happened seem to see that talk have purpose that be feelin around like with idee of findin ' out how many of might be depended upon to back up bainbridge in seizure of ship must appear that be successful in winning over hand except three remarked skipper did ever attempt to sound of ay that did sir lot ' time now that come to think of answered boatswain nothin ' what might call definite understand s'pose pretty soon saw that chip sail be likely to have truck wi such idee a mutiny seizin ' ship so soon knocked off talkin ' to about reckon that used to report to bainbridge pretty often tellin ' what have said how have took expect be mr b who told not to say anything more to about yes agreed skipper fancy have got hang of thing pretty accurately bos'n be pity that never occurred to of to mention matter to mr bligh must have given notion of what be brewing put on guard murdock parson simpson vehemently protested that lloyd remark be of so very general character bore so striking resemblance to ordinary grousing universally met with in ship forecastle really mean nothing that never occurred to of to attach especial significance to what unfortunately have proved to be exceptional case great deal more be said upon matter before be dropped remark be mostly of desultory character a have particular bearing upon thread of story be unnecessary to repeat chapter two turned adrift zenobia continued to run to westward during whole of day before wind steadily softened down hour after hour until by two bell in first dog watch be little more than mere breathing scarcely strong enough to keep heavy course filled must tell by motion of ship that sea a well a wind be going down for by time that above named hour arrived be bowing swaying upon fast subsiding swell a easily gently a though ship have be cradle rocked by mother hand thing have be tolerably quiet out on deck during forenoon later on when men have turned to after dinner heard sound outside house indicated considerable amount of activity on part of mutineer boom plank be stowed on roof of prison be overhauled several of be flung down on deck then welshy came in cast loose carpenter ordering to bring chest of tool outside be presently followed by sound of sawing hammering later on heard certain order being given indicated that mast yard tackle be being sent aloft finally there be great commotion laughing out on deck intermingled with alarmed bleatings of sheep be housed in longboat ah ejaculated skipper a last named sound reached ear know what mean be clearing out longboat preparatory to getting over side mean to turn adrift in not only also unfortunate passenger for if have not intended to send a well a ourselves away must have kept longboat given one of quarter boat must have be amply big enough to have accommodated seven six if mean to keep chip with wo stay sir may take word for observed boatswain parson be straight chap a straight a make 'em will find that be not sort of man to have truck wi ' mutineer not may compel to stay objected skipper must be very useful sort of man for to have with may not give choice of going staying yes be very true agreed murdock if asks to stay will say likewise give to understand that if keep by force wo do work for 'em know chip understands that if say thing like that will stick to if be only to spite believe a will want to keep man against will because always mean trouble sooner later muster bainbridge be far too 'cute to run risk of anything of sort besides there be joe caton say a sarved time in shipbuilder yard be a good ship carpenter a will find goin ' be stoppin ' with 'em of own accord reckon bainbridge will be satisfied with well perhaps may be so will soon know agreed skipper continued with sigh of anxiety if mean to turn passenger a well a ourselves adrift feel assured that do wish bainbridge must let advise in matter of fixing up longboat for reception of woman child will need many little comfort that inexperienced lad such a be will never think of will be bad enough for poor soul even if everything be possible be done for welfare longboat alone will not be big enough to take with degree of safety to say nothing of comfort must watch for opportunity give view upon matter said chief mate wonder whether at moment sliding door of house in be confined be thrust back lloyd otherwise welshy entered behind ranged up athwart deck outside be to be seen number of seaman with rifle in hand cutlas girt about waist be evident that mutineer have lost time in hunting up ship arm chest at time almost obsolete item of ship equipment providing with mean of effectually suppressing anything in nature of resistance on part attempt to recapture ship good a'ternoon gen'lemen observed welshy with grin might indicate triumph attempt at ingratiation splendid weather for boat trip ai be come to cast yer loose dare say ye will be much obliged to for ca be very comfortable to sit there hour a'ter hour with foot lashed together hand tied behind back ye see agreed a be best to take risk then there 'd be call for bloodshed dare say understands what mean yes a proceeded to cast off skipper lashing have come to cast ye adrift let warn not to dream of attemptin ' anything foolish for have got ship mean to keep rifle be loaded with ball cartridge men a carry will shoot to kill if e'er one of see of doin ' what did ought to do understand cap'n mr mate rest of yer at pointed question severally intimated that understood for indeed must hing else whereupon glowering scoundrel resumed that be right just a must be ai none of got nothin ' against e'er one of yer want to have vi'lence if can be helped there wo be none onless yourselves brings about if doe well stand clear that be got to say now bein ' agreed that want vi'lence bloodshed nothin ' in way disagreeable also bein ' agreed that prefers to have here ship to own self have be decided to send gent lady gen'lemen aft away in longboat to go just exac'ly where bloomin ' well like there be twenty eight of yer told includin ' woman kid longboat will just comfortably hold yer with provision water for three week new skipper cap'n bainbridge say that in weather wi ' purty little breeze ought to be able to make south american coast in ten day easy ten day exploded skipper yes doubt if wind hold fine weather last suppose that doe what then pulled up short panting breathless with anger got pull upon recovered self control then said in perfectly quiet steady voice look here lloyd be seaman of experience ought to understand do understand have doubt that to send heavily loaded open boat away upon ten day voyage with only three week provision water be well practically downright murder must see er mr bainbridge about really must must arrange have opportunity to do so can not will not undertake responsibility of such voyage a be proposed be sure will mr bligh mr johnson will simply refuse to go in boat too added chief mate ditto tersely added johnson will refuse to go eh snarled lloyd suppose make yer suppose there be use in supposing anything interrupted skipper profess to be anxious to avoid anything in nature of force bloodshed very well tell that there will be if scoundrel persist in turning adrift under such circumstance a have named stand back attempt violence with fine fellow be free now if dare to lay filthy hand upon will kill with shook clenched fist savagely in lloyd face now continued authoritatively go aft tell bainbridge want to see must will speak to before leave ship to great surprise man obediently turned away with low spoken word two to armed men who remained on guard outside door swung round end of house walked aft a must tell by sound of receding footstep be absent about quarter of hour during captain robert quietly cast off chief mate lashing then pair of released mr johnson boatswain who in turn released sailmaker being done under eye of armed guard before door who looked stolidly on without protest by word deed have scarcely done when became aware that ship be being brought to wind presently order be given to man brace there be usual yo ho yo hip round with boy like cry british merchant seaman deems necessary to indulge in when be pulling hauling presently understood that ship be hove to on starboard tack with head to northward then order be given to man capstan men be heaving round when lloyd returned with grin of comprehension at finding released from bond informed skipper that bainbridge be willing to see whereupon captain robert left escorted by welshy went aft meanwhile who be left behind in forward house gathered from various sound reached that longboat be now being hoisted out presently heard heavy splash of a be dropped into water alongside be followed by order to overhaul unhook yard tackle in comparative silence that then ensued occasionally caught alternate murmur of skipper bainbridge voice be speaking in ordinary conversational tone multitudinous sound of ship faint rustle of canvas aloft patter of reef point creaking of yard timber wash of water alongside subdued hum of many voice on deck prevented from catching word of what be being said however gathered that captain robert have be protesting against turning so many people adrift in longboat alone for presently heard bainbridge shout order to lower away captain gig next to dinghy jollyboat be smallest boat belonging to ship be roomy enough to accommodate ten people comfortably without ballast seven with provision water enough to last crew for three week considered that if bainbridge be indeed going to give gig a well a longboat with of course adequate supply of provision water must be able to manage tolerably well in anything short of gale presently lloyd who appeared to be acting a bainbridge lieutenant came forward again entered house now then gen'lemen remarked with grin seemed to think necessary to assume when addressing longboat ready passenger be waitin ' to go down into so 'd better come along see to stowin ' of 'em mr bainbridge have agreed to let have gig also so ought to be a happy comfortable a sandboy forget what told yer about not wantin ' to have trouble bloodshed ship ours mean to keep so if want to go away with whole skin what have got to do be to get from alongside a quick a possible without makin trouble for a sure a of ye attempt to make trouble there will be bloodshed forget mr bligh mr johnson be to go first see to stowin ' of passenger when longboat got complement rest of yer can foller be not taking chance be laughed mr bligh sarcastically a rose to foot although hand of appear to be armed be not going to run risk of having too many of loose out on deck at once for fear of what might do eh well be fine courageous lot of mutineer must say must even chance fight with single one of when started out to take ship must need entice for'ard one man at time upon pretence that fire have broken out in hold ugh envy bainbridge crew of bold buccaneer not little bit with scornful laugh swaggered out on deck followed by second mate minute later heard voice speaking to passenger calling upon by name one by one to pas down side woman child first be pitiful to hear low moaning sobbing of of poor creature a reluctantly left firm spacious deck of ship fearfully clambered down side ladder into dancing longboat looked so small dangerous refuge in comparison with bulk of barque embarkation of passenger proceeded slowly because of woman child among of whom be frightened while many of be weeping bitterly despite best effort of husband father brother male friend to encourage at length last passenger went down over side be assigned place in longboat then lloyd again came forward summoned of who remained in house to follow a passed out on deck started to walk aft to gangway five armed seaman who have mounted guard over followed at heel a cleared galley formed part of structure in have be confined whole of after part of ship from fore end of main hatchway came into view saw that vessel be indeed a have supposed hove to on starboard tack with mainyard laid almost square mainsail brailed up remainder of canvas set fabric be full of sound of gentle creaking of timber truss parrals soft rustling of white cloth overhead have way on be curtsying rolling gently on long sluggish swell came creeping up from eastward apart from swell sea be quite smooth surface being scarcely wrinkled into pure delicate blue tint by easterly breeze have died down to so gentle zephyr that lighter canvas even topsail flapped to mast with heave dip of hull sky be cloudless save away down toward west where great mass of vapour broken up into small patch blazed crimson gold in ray of declining sun gilded reddened sleepy undulation beneath bainbridge with peaked cap thrust aggressively to back of head brass buttoned blue serge jacket opening to display white shirt flowing black silk necktie also incidentally brace of revolver suggestively stuck in broad elastic belt girt waist with smile of insolent triumph upon dark saturnine otherwise rather good looking face stood alone at break of poop with hand thrust deep into trouser pocket white canvas shod foot planted wide apart watchfully regarding proceeding on main deck beneath while whole of crew with exception of cook five men who constituted especial bodyguard be drawn up athwart deck along face of poop structure man armed with rifle with sheathed cutlas girt about waist captain robert mr bligh stood together at open lee gangway through above lee rail must be seen tossing mast of longboat a little party approached skipper turned after running eye over for moment said mr temple will be obliged to ask carpenter sail to go with mr johnson in gig longboat be already pretty well crowded considering that part of complement consists of woman child will find that gig already have four breaker of fresh water in will serve for ballast will have to provision from longboat a bainbridge absolutely refuse to give so much a biscuit will find mr johnson already in just jump down lend hand if please gig with mast already stepped be lying outside longboat with mr johnson in while chip in longboat be overhauling stock of provision in latter passing certain portion into gig according to second mate instruction be bit of job to get to across crowded longboat have just stepped into be about to address johnson when stopped short for heard captain robert voice raised in final appeal to men lad said in loud clear voice before quit ship want to give last chance to undo evil that have day done to avert from yourselves punishment that most surely awaits if persist in following path into have be beguiled by plausible young scoundrel meaning eh skipper jeered bainbridge with harsh laugh from poop above even now men continued captain ignoring bainbridge interruption at last moment be not too late for to withdraw from unholy compact return to duty be not to blame for what have happened have simply be deceived led astray by one who ought to have known better than to tempt to step can only end in destruction ask to lay down arm place yourselves at mercy promise upon honour a seaman gentleman that if will do so not one of except ringleader will ever hear word about matter stop shut up not word a value life yelled bainbridge suddenly flying into fury whipping revolver out of belt so be little game be must bribe men to betray to put into power very well now jump down into longboat at once if dare to open mouth again speak word of temptation to men will blow head off wound up with oath captain robert be not to be deterred so easily from seizing only opportunity have thus far presented by might make effort to regain command of ship ascendancy over crew be at sort of man to be frightened from duty by flourishing of pistol before eye be duty to nullify mutiny if must therefore turned to men again lad said bethink yourselves what sort of future be to be yours if persist crack bainbridge pistol barked out from poop poor captain robert reeled back clutching breast from red blood be spouting into arm of mr bligh who be standing close by bainbridge startled perhaps at what have done for skipper have always behaved like father to lost last vestige of self control became in moment very personification of raving bloodthirsty maniac levelling still smoking revolver at bligh commanded latter with very tornado of curse instantly to place body of captain in longboat shove off from ship side forthwith unless wished to share skipper fate still supporting swooning body of captain in arm bligh allowed gaze to search in turn face of of armed men who now clustered round seeing nothing to justify hope that further appeal must meet with least success replied right lad be going worse luck for here one of to crew just drop shooting iron for minute if be not afraid of lend hand to lower skipper over side will ye then a one of men mechanically obeyed mate murmured in ear be sorry for silly buckos for mean hang man noose for hand of there be time for yet if repent before be out of sight have to do be to bear up in chase of run ensign up to fore royal mast head will know what mean will have reason to regret now then aloud a two took skipper body between handsomely doe below there boatswain just ease captain down lay in main sheet where doctor can get to work upon between somehow contrived to get unfortunate skipper body down side into sternsheets of longboat where dr morrison at once proceeded to examine wound moment that be done mr bligh scrambled down side ladder made way aft among woman child who be huddled together most of sobbing quietly with face buried in hand seized tiller thrusting hard over gave word to shove off make sail order be promptly obeyed five minute later longboat with gig towing astern be running off to leeward with standing lug jib set while of who be watching barque saw head sheet trimmed aft mainyard swung a slowly gathered way stood to nor'ard eastward close hauled on starboard tack have be under way about ten minute when mr bligh hailed mr johnson to haul up alongside when have done so said mr johnson now that captain robert be so seriously hurt will want to come into longboat with because be only one at present capable of navigating understand be sure temple will have to take command of gig do best can with that young scoundrel have not permitted of to bring sextant with have not even given chart so much a boat compass so will have to do best can without have be considering situation have come to conclusion that best plan will be to make for rio according to rough reckoning bear about west by no'th true distant say twelve hundred mile will have to shape course for a nearly a can by sun star plan have advantage by continuing to steer westerly course be bound to hit south american coast somewhere even if must miss rio also stand very good chance of falling in with being picked up by something bound round horn so much for part of business next a be bit crowded here boat be rather deeper than like will have to take boatswain in exchange for mr johnson paused ran eye speculatively over crowd in longboat then addressing generally said wonder whether one of gentleman must care to go in gig with mr temple a can all see feel for yourselves be rather uncomfortably crowded aboard here boat must be safer if be relieved of weight of even one of while there be plenty of room in gig be just a safe a longboat suppose need not tell that temple be excellent seaman navigator while gig be faster boat of two will probably arrive at least couple of day ahead of pause of few second duration followed appeal then mr cunningham who happened to be only unattached male passenger among party arose said if consider change desirable will be very pleased to go in gig in fact be only male passenger who have encumbrance ' with in shape of wife child therefore will make difference at to boat happen to be in being case will make exchange at once then temple have better make sail get over ground a fast a can said mr bligh therewith gig be hauled up close alongside longboat transfer at once effected mr johnson turning over to bigger boat while boatswain mr cunningham joined in gig transfer be not lengthy process for bainbridge have not permitted of to bring away of belonging at moment richest of have only what happened to be wearing in way of clothing then a chief mate cast off painter thrust two boat apart said make sail temple crack on for be worth a soon a get in report mutiny get british consul to send out tug something with provision water to look for see that report matter at once to nearest naval station within reach so that men o ' war may be dispatched to seek zenobia get hold of before have time to do very much mischief forget course be west by no'th a near a may be in eye of setting sun when reach horizon goodbye quick passage to goodbye sir returned same to trust that doctor will be able to put captain on foot again by time that get in will remember instruction lose not moment in carrying out directly arrive goodbye hoist away bos'n simpson boom out sheet with boathook sun be by time within ten minute of setting glowed great palpitating disk of incandescent red through thin veil of innumerable small closely clustering cloud stretched in gorgeous tint of gold crimson purple against background of very pale green right athwart horizon ahead colour being brilliantly reflected in softly rippling slowly moving undulation came creeping up after heaving gently up on ample breast then sweeping on ahead of straight toward sinking luminary wind have just strength enough in to keep sheet of single lug from sagging into water gig be sliding smoothly along with small sound of lapping gurgling water under at rate of about three knot in hour leaving behind thin swirling wake of small bubble tiny whirlpool vanished upon breast of next on coming longboat under fore main standing lug small jib deeply loaded a be be doing knot le than ourselves soon passed slid ahead of while away down in north eastern board broad on starboard quarter topsail upper canvas of barque shone primrose yellow above ridge of swell a stood away from heading about north east close hauled on starboard tack there be prospect that be about to have fine night almost too fine in fact to suit for although light wind meant smooth water in turn meant safety for deeply laden open boat have long road before not too many provision too much water for sustenance during journey for own part if must have have choice must have preferred little more wind provided that be fair even although involved somewhat heavier sea to help on way chapter three start voyage in gig first matter to gave consideration after be fairly under way have parted company with longboat be that of food drink began by taking stock roughly of what have jotting down item in pocket book to begin with have four five gallon breaker of fresh water twenty gallon in then have two sack of cabin bread by partial count estimated to contain about three hundred biscuit altogether in addition to have one dozen tin of ox tongue six small tin of potted meat four jar of marmalade two of jam two bottle of pickle four bottle of lime juice one bottle of brandy two bottle of rum when have jotted everything down made few calculation then spoke shipmate said include mr cunningham in term for misfortune put upon same footing doubt heard mr bligh say little while ago according to reckoning be somewhere about twelve hundred mile from rio be nearest port mean twelve day voyage with fair wind time blowing fresh enough to keep going hour after hour at rate of five knot now of who have used sea need to be told that favourable condition of affair be so exceedingly unlikely that be scarcely worth talking about to begin with be making bad start for instead of doing five knot be doing little if anything more than with prospect of flat calm within next three four hour therefore think will be wise of to recognise at outset that voyage be good deal more likely to take twenty day than be to be accomplished in ten of course in saying be regarding matter from most unfavourable point of view remember that have have easterly wind without break ever since crossed line may be that trade be extending unusually far south just now that be still on southerly fringe of if must prove to be case will be right for by steering west by no'th course will be edging to nor'ard working way back into permanent trade wind on other hand easterly wind may not be trade wind at own opinion be that be not in case may expect westerly breeze be to say foul wind at moment think must only be acting with common prudence to take probability into consideration now brings to question of food water a have seen have be taking stock of what have making few calculation with following result first with regard to fresh water have just twenty gallon of one hundred sixty pint if must be certain of making voyage in ten day amount of water must afford sixteen pint per day to be equally divided between five of be fraction over three pint per day per man say pint at of three meal half pint at three interval between meal little enough will say very true yet think must endeavour to do with le must try to be satisfied with four half pint per day of twenty four hour per man by mean will be able to make water last sixteen day in sixteen day many thing may happen may end voyage if have luck may be picked up may have rain enough to enable to replenish water supply since of thing may happen ought in common prudence to determine at outset not to drink more than four half pint per man per day think may be able to manage upon without very great hardship what say think can manage if set mind to do at once answered mr cunningham after little further talk boatswain carpenter sailmaker also agreed to make attempt in same way arrived at determination to be satisfied with four biscuit per day with suitable proportion of tongue potted meat jam what not also agreed upon quantity of spirit be to constitute man daily allowance cunningham being of opinion that very small allowance of stimulant must be almost necessity seeing that food be to be so restricted in quantity then having settled important question piped to supper man receiving exact quantity of food agreed upon when have finished be of one opinion namely that although appetite be far from being satisfied must be quite possible for to sustain life under such condition for fortnight three week without serious deterioration of health strength by time supper be over have fallen dark have lost sight of longboat barque be magnificent night sky deep indigo cloudless blue studded with myriad of star water perfectly smooth save for long low undulation of swell only fault have to find with weather be that there be too little wind breeze having died down until be making scarcely two knot in hour fortunately have difficulty in matter of determining course for happened that mr cunningham wore small compass attached to watch chain a charm after have made necessary allowance for variation soon managed with assistance of miniature compass match to pick upon star low down on horizon by must steer fairly straight course for at least couple of hour at expiration of must of course be easy to pick then arranged matter of watch there be four of in boat who be sailor first proposal be that of must take watch of three hour mr cunningham must not hear of be appeared civil engineer by profession have natural love of sea matter pertaining to sea life be quite enthusiastic amateur yachtsman with sufficient knowledge of way to handle boat to justify fully in entrusting with temporary charge of gig at least in fine weather insisted on taking fair share of work there might be to do therefore decided that also must be allowed to stand watch undertook to stand first watch from six o'clock to nine being arranged boatswain carpenter sailmaker at once disposed for sleep two upon thwart third coiled up in eye of boat while cunningham who declared that have inclination for sleep placed beside in sternsheets began to chat in low tone of voice so that might not disturb others naturally subject uppermost in mind be mutiny began to talk about happened to express surprise that bainbridge have allowed doctor to leave ship upon cunningham gave vent to low chuckle of amusement dear chap said bainbridge did dare to keep fully intended to do so at first acquainted morrison with fact doctor must have at price swore that if be not allowed to leave with rest of must poison hand within week after bainbridge be only too glad to let go continued to chat for time upon subject wondering what possible motive bainbridge must have for proceeding to extreme a of capturing ship by what mean have contrived to win men over how have managed to do without exciting slightest suspicion so on then cunningham began to speak of be appeared orphan twenty eight year of age without single friend in world who felt enough interest in to care what might become of have already explained little earlier in evening that be by profession civil engineer now went on to tell that entirely without friend influence a be have found so difficult to make headway in england that have at last determined upon going out to natal in colony being comparatively speaking new country have hoped to find scope for professional knowledge that added be knocked on head by young villain bainbridge who have not only prevented from reaching natal have actually turned adrift in open boat to fetch up who know where with only clothes stand in yet not exactly that corrected with quiet chuckle of amusement for although expensive surveying instrument kit be on board zenobia contrived to get at trunk morning extract therefrom bag containing one hundred forty sovereign a well a telescope dozen stick of tobacco of carefully secreted about person have with now well returned if be case may call lucky for will find hundred forty british sovereign exceedingly useful when get ashore a for telescope may prove of utmost value to before trip be over be considerably better off than be for be allowed to leave ship with literally only clothes be wearing remainder of clothes together with sextant nautical other book sixteen pound odd in cash be still in berth aboard barque if swab have not already seized of course be hoping to find ship at rio aboard may be able to work passage home once back in london owner be bound to find berth supposing there must happen to be ship at rio in can work passage home what will do in case asked cunningham oh said must simply have to take first berth must find irrespective of where vessel might happen to be bound for in last resort can place in hand of british consul be sent home a shipwrecked seaman see said cunningham thoughtfully resumed after moment silence there be need for to adopt of course know old chap hundred forty sovereign will be quite sufficient to see comfortably home from rio can repay whenever happen to be able very heartily thanked young civil engineer for exceedingly generous offer protested must not possibly accept that in fact there be not least likelihood thing must turn out so badly in rio a to compel to avail of generosity nothing must satisfy companion short of definite promise must accept help must matter result awkwardly upon arrival eventually very reluctantly yielded to importunity gave required promise thus began sincere friendship between be only further strengthened by long series of remarkable adventure lay ahead of although at moment little dreamed that anything out of ordinary run of event be to befall of toward end of watch breeze evinced slight tendency to freshen when at nine o'clock handed over charge of boat to boatswain cunningham disposed ourselves to secure such sleep a might come to be slipping along through water at rate of good honest four knot in hour a may be imagined sleep that night be of somewhat intermittent character for boat thwart be not most comfortable bed in world be fully conscious of responsibility have be laid upon to guide gig life have be entrusted to over trackless ocean without aid of chart nautical instrument of kind save toy compass attached to cunningham watch chain be well aware that only hope of success lay in keeping of most accurate account possible of boat progress direction therefore be up looking about at least dozen time during night fine weather continued through hour of darkness during boatswain carpenter watch wind gradually freshened up until by three o'clock when chip called sailmaker to relieve boat be buzzing merrily along at speed of between six seven knot after that wind began to soften rapidly away again until at length when sun swept into view above eastern horizon scarcely have steerage way hour later fell flat calm accordingly lowered sail done directed sailmaker who be lightest of therefore least likely to capsize boat to shin up to masthead see if must detect sign of longboat barque incidentally take good look round entire horizon upon off chance of there being sail anywhere in sight reported horizon bare in direction except in eastern board where fancied must occasionally detect faint something might possibly be sail of longboat although be by mean sure even a to that opining what have seen if indeed have seen anything at might be distant fin of prowling shark mention of shark gave idea asked companion whether perchance of happened to have small stuff about out of might contrive to make fishing line whereupon chip with smile requested to vacate seat in sternsheets for moment opening locker in after thwart of boat produced excellent cod line with hook sinker complete explaining that a soon a gathered inkling of what bainbridge intended on previous day contrived while engaged in knocking up temporary pen for sheep to filch said line out of cook galley to secrete afterward seizing opportunity to transfer to gig locker when learned that be about to be turned over to there happened to be piece of dry shrivelled bait still transfixed upon one of hook therefore dropped over side paid out line made fast inner end to one of thwart forthwith forgot about in small bustle of getting breakfast while be still engaged upon meal suddenly became aware that fishing line be being violently agitated upon hauling in found that have be fortunate enough to hook young dolphin about two foot long now raw dolphin be not exactly appetising dish especially to who like ourselves possessed nothing keener than really strong healthy hunger still there be fish so much to good a supplementary to rather meagre breakfast allowance well in short at least boatswain carpenter sailmaker managed to eat nearly half of cunningham have not yet arrived at starvation point where raw fish must be devoured with relish declined to share banquet for did not blame really after have succeeded in so far conquering prejudice against raw food a to nibble cautiously at portion found that be by mean so repulsive a have imagined although be certainly not at inviting be undoubtedly nutritious when at length finished breakfast not only be hunger completely satisfied felt refreshed invigorated after meal breakfast disposed of simpson once more shinned aloft took look round there be still nothing in sight indeed how must there be seeing that there be wind to fan anything into ken must not now even discern faint appearance to eastward have imagined might indicate position of longboat that of course might be due to fact that like have lowered now useless canvas with not breath of air stirring be intensely hot ray of unclouded sun beating down upon fiercely a breath of furnace inwardly execrated that scoundrel bainbridge lawless crew a thought of crowded longboat hapless woman child to say nothing of wounded skipper pent up in with nothing to protect from pitiless heat glare well shipmate said will do good by lying here idly sweltering calm may last for week for aught that can tell there be not slightest sign of breeze springing up so far a can see propose therefore instead of doing nothing strike mast out oar go in search of wind there be need continued seeing sign of protest on face of companion for to exert very greatly can scarcely make ourselves hotter than be do what will therefore suggest that throw out oar paddle quietly ahead upon proper course ought to be able to get three knot out of boat with little exertion mile of progress mean so much to good moreover want to remember that can not afford to lie idly here stock of provision will only last certain time just picture to yourselves what condition will be if through suffering to be delayed by calm provision water must become exhausted before reach land be picked up idea be that four of must pull while fifth steer at end of one hour by watch who steer must relieve one of at oar so that four hour of will get one hour rest now what say lad be mr cunningham watch therefore let take first spell at yoke line be easy enough to see that others did not like idea of working at oar in blistering sun be that to be wondered at reminder to of possibility in store for must provision water be exhausted before relief in shape other came to have effect with many grumbling imprecation at inopportune calm set to work to strike mast ship rowlock get out oar five minute later pulling stroke cunningham in sternsheets with yoke line in hand compass charm on seat beside be moving quietly easily to westward at speed of quite three knot fortunately for gig be particularly good boat of whaleboat type built for speed long flat on floor with beautiful line apart from low swell did not trouble at water be smooth a oil when therefore have once got way upon boat be easy matter to keep going without very much exertion hot only who have be exposed in open boat at sea in tropical calm can in least understand appreciate what suffered sun ray striking almost vertically down upon head reflected upward again from shining surface of water scorched like fire before first hour have passed face be so painful that scarcely dared touch oh how perspired in le than ten minute singlet drawer be have on having like rest stripped off rest of clothing be a wet a though have be overboard natural result of such profuse perspiration be that soon became intolerably thirsty know of be first to suffer from cause know have not be at oar more than twenty minute when began to feel must willingly give everything possessed for good long cooling draught of spring water however clenched teeth said nothing for knew perfectly well that if word thirst be once mentioned hand must instantly begin to clamour for water might have greatest difficulty in restraining others from making raid upon breaker regardless of consequence after self restraint be of little practical value for presently carpenter flung loom of oar athwart boat until rested upon gunwale tossing clenched fist above head cried in husky unnatural tone of voice great jumpin gehosophat how thirsty be mr temple vote knock off long enough to have drink round be a dry a limekiln inside tongue beginnin ' to rattle again teeth ' more reason why must keep quiet chip retorted sharply thirsty of course be so be for matter there be reason why must yelp about a for having drink know a well a do that with small quantity of water have in boat have be necessary for to pledge solemnly to take more than certain quantity daily must wait for next drink until dinner time come along mr temple interrupted sailmaker who with others included have now cocked oar proper 'lowance of water be pint at meal 'alf pint at other time ca 'ave that there hextry pint now certainly can not answered a well a be able to speak for saliva gathered in mouth at mere thought of nectar like pint of water if did must be a thirsty a ever within next half hour then must be sorry enough that there be more water coming to except at meal time for rest of day will tell what will do be now glancing at watch within three minute of nine o'clock at ten will take spell of ten minute man will then have third part of pint of water with suspicion of rum in a pick up then at twelve will dine man will have half pint at three o'clock will have third of pint at six will have supper at nine o'clock if find that really require will have remaining third of pint now be best can do be only thing that dare do must just make best of yes agreed cunningham be quite right mr temple must be satisfied with strict allowance ask for more there be one thing may do to ease thirst be wonderfully efficacious let man take off clothes saturate with salt water put on again soaking wet if do say once half hour will find marvellously refreshed quite able to wait for drink until proper time for arrives ay said have heard of trick before splendid one be too believe although have never have occasion to try until now let test at once lad remember once hearing man say that if shipwrecked people must only keep clothes thoroughly saturated with salt water must practically manage to do without drinking at without further ado stripped off singlet pant wrung perspiration out of plunged over side put on again example being immediately followed by others then time having arrived for cunningham to take spell at oar exchanged place with sailmaker again proceeded sensation of coolness imparted by contact of wet clothing with body be very refreshing a long a lasted be able to pull quick steady stroke put along at rate of about three knot with little fatigue worst of be that did not last long for within ten minute sun have dried clothes again began to perspire once more soon found simple remedy for by ceasing work just long enough to enable to pour two three bucket of water over other then getting to work again although frequent stoppage doubt have effect of retarding progress to extent think actual loss of speed be very great for refreshment derived from often repeated sousing be such that be able to put good deal more life vigour into work than must otherwise have be possible a regard alleged abatement of thirst although did not experience perceptible relief during first hour of experiment certainly did afterwards so did others although at ten o'clock avidly took third of pint of water there be further complaint of thirst here let mention for benefit of reader who may be so unfortunate a to find at time in similar predicament that then made important discovery that most effectual method of assuaging thirst with very limited quantity of water be not to gulp down have done with to sip slowly about teaspoonful at time retain sip in mouth at least minute before swallowing amount of comfort not to say enjoyment relief refreshment thus obtainable be nothing short of marvellous despite device that must think of to obtain relief suffering during day be terrible for although by assiduously sousing other with salt water at frequent interval contrived to avoid worst torment of thirst face arm hand in fact exposed portion of body be so frightfully scorched by sun even before knocking off work to take midday meal have begun to blister by face arm be covered with blister through interminable day toiled on on at oar with not shred of cloud to be seen in direction blazing sun scorching remorselessly sea round polished shining gently undulating colourless plain unbroken by so much a solitary ripple save created by oar blade passage of gig through water occasional dash of dozen flying fish out of sea under boat stem once twice thin wake cut by dorsal fin of cruising shark about three quarter of hour before sunset carpenter who be then steering boat shouted hurrah bully there be change of sort comin ' at last see edge of there cloud liftin ' over sea line ahead that mean wind will eat hat ay p'rhaps rain too what do think mr temple with one accord cocked oar standing up took good long look ahead secretly welcoming will confess excuse to cease pulling for minute two for back be by time aching frightfully skin of thumb just where joined hand be so completely chafed away that flesh be red raw bleeding yes there be edge of cloud distinct enough white clean cut sharp edged upper portion of big thunder cloud unless be greatly mistaken be rising fast too so fast even a stood gazing at fully doubled area permitted glimpse of soft slaty blue tint merging into white yes agreed replying to parson question change be coming all right will not be very long before be here lay in oar men think in prospect of what that cloud promise that may venture to spare further ash flourishing to day for will have breeze before very long with thunder lightning rain a well unless be greatly mistaken will pipe to supper at once so that may be able to get meal in peace quietness have over done with before breeze come be likely enough to have plenty of other matter than eating drinking to think about attend to when happens oar be laid in willingly enough for other four be in just a bad plight a be cunningham indeed be far worse for unlike ours hand be soft tender when after oar have be laid in stretched out hand palm upwards showed to presented positively sickening sight when murmured regret commiseration only smiled expressed conviction that must be all right again in week for be one of pluckiest men ever met grit through straight a die with not bad spot anywhere in be in fact everything that be apt to think typical briton must be lost time in getting meal that called by courtesy supper within hour have disposed of be waiting patiently for be to come while be still calm light have mast stepped sent sailmaker aloft to take good comprehensive look round see whether must discover sign of sail sooner have with much pain tribulation climbed to top of precarious perch than sang out that must just see in northern board what looked like head of ship royal of course must not tell in direction be bound for like be becalmed slowly boxing compass be to say head be pointing first one way then while be aloft clinging to boat masthead watching stranger in hope of being able to make further discovery concerning people started to clew up furl royal circumstance simpson duly reported served a hint to in gig for if stranger have detected symptom that royal must presently be too much for be high time for to look after ourselves accordingly proceeded forthwith to close reef lug otherwise make such preparation a be possible to enable effectively to meet onslaught of threatened squall chapter four at mercy of wind sea that squall be indeed brewing be by time perfectly evident for while have be getting supper cloud have made appearance on western horizon have rapidly risen now hung enormous lowering mass of livid purple vapour in western heaven covering arc of horizon of fully hundred degree completely hiding setting sun towering aloft until upper edge be nearly overhead yet so far there be not breath of wind surface of sea remained unbroken polished mirror perfectly reflecting hue of overhanging cloud to westward deep rich azure of sky away down toward east when simpson again climbed boat mast to take final look at stranger reported naked masthead a standing up black sharp motionless against soft primrose tone of northern sky ten minute later just a brief twilight of region have begun to veil scene saw faint glimmer of lightning in heart of now slowly advancing cloud few second after low mutter of thunder reached ear before rumble of have died away there suddenly darted from bosom of cloud long vivid baleful sun bright flash seemed to strike into sea within quarter of mile of immediately followed by so stupendous crash that caused very timber of boat to vibrate tremble so verily believed a though flash have be signal great cloud seemed suddenly to burst apart next moment be enveloped in very deluge of rain fairly roared a threshed surface of sea round bread bread shouted cover with tarpaulin keep dry if let get wet will be spoiled immediately made dash for two bag of biscuit hastily enveloped in small sheet of tarpaulin that chip have have forethought to toss into gig while be being lowered from davit now said a soon a have taken such precaution a be possible for preservation of bread spread out sail from gunwale to gunwale right across boat rain be far too precious to be wasted be sort bos'n make good deep sag in middle of sail will soon fill at rate then can drink a much a please put what more can catch into broached breaker filling until overflow find pannikin one of there be enough for drink round already hollow sail filled with sweet tepid rainwater faster than must drink before rain ceased have emptied pint pannikin twice have filled broached breaker right up to edge of bung hole then have drink round after bathed smarting blistered hand in cooling liquid before emptying into sea downpour lasted for perhaps twelve minute then ceased a suddenly a have begun a suddenly a though tap have be turned off up aloft have opportunity once more to look around glancing instinctively to westward in first instance for be where expected wind to come from first thing saw in fast deepening twilight be broad belt of dark water flecked here there with white about mile distant advancing in direction hurrah lad exclaimed here come breeze foul one be true even foul wind so long a there be not too much of be better than none at set lug for board on port tack since ca go straight to port will make board to nor'ard will at least be going in right direction yes bos'n in reply to question from functionary keep sail close reefed will have wind want little over before very long unless be greatly mistaken wind swooped down upon in fierce little flurry careened gig to gunwale despite careful tending of sheet by boatswain then with hand of sitting well up to windward boat gathered way darted off upon course be a nearly a might be due north west lying well down to with spray from short choppy sea that squall instantly whipped up showering in over sharp weather bow at plunge quickly drenching to skin there be worse to come for wind be freshening moment rapidly kicking up short steep choppy sea surge of smothered with spray a gig leaped viciously at under steadily increasing pressure of wind upon close reefed lugsail so that within very few minute be taking one hand time to keep boat free of water by continually baling with bucket although eased craft a much a possible by keeping weather leech of sail ashiver most of time just luck growled boatswain a slacked sheet to still fiercer puff if have be fair wind now must have shown whole canvas to must have be reelin off seven even eight knot a easily a possible a be ca make headway agin time ai far off in opinion when will have to up stick run afore will not do that until be obliged said feel at like losing in course of two three hour ground that have made by hardest day work that ever did in life murdock when ca face longer will lash oar together ride to a sea anchor at full scope of painter will keep boat head on to wind sea will ride a comfortably way a other while although drift will probably amount to a much a three knot hour will not lose nearly a much ground a must by scudding before be interrupted by sailmaker who be sitting far enough forward to be able to see distance past luff of sail seaman like be instinctively keeping lookout now suddenly turned yelled sail ho close aboard on lee bow hard up mr temple hard up sir keep broad away that chap will run down there be urgency imperativeness in man tone made clear enough that there be time for investigation therefore did only thing remained to be done under circumstance namely trusted to correctness of sail judgment implicitly followed direction dragging tiller hard up at same time calling upon boatswain to ease off sheet still further under pressure of weather helm boat at once fell broad off a did so saw through rapidly deepening darkness great black blotch swing into view past luff of sail next instant resolved into shape of big hulking brigantine wallowing along down toward with topsail yard down on cap reef tackle bowsed up eight men on yard busily engaged in reefing topsail be not yet so dark that men must have seen distinctly in fact one of paused in work to flourish hand at yet for sailmaker watchfulness craft must have driven right over there must be doubt of fact that crew have seen for in addition to man who waved to from yard there be two men pacing monkey poop aft who paused in march to look at a drove past other yet although yelled to frantically to heave to pick up made movement to do anything of sort ten minute later craft vanished in darkness light be too poor to enable to read name on stern a swept past have look of portuguese built craft justly unjustly portuguese have gained rather sinister reputation for callousness inhumanity in behaviour toward people circumstanced a be at moment s'pose think be out here in hopen boat for pleasure fun o ' thing be boatswain sarcastic comment upon behaviour prefaced by stream of profanity a vessel disappeared from view a soon a realised that crew of brigantine have intention of heaving to picking up again brought gig to wind soon found that must not do wind sea be rapidly becoming too much for to continue fighting against meant speedy swamping capsizal of boat therefore adopted plan have be expounding to boatswain when brigantine hove into view securely lashing four oar of boat together in bundle bending extreme end of painter to middle of bundle launching whole overboard at same time lowering sail striking mast when drag of boat upon oar brought head to wind sea enabled to ride in comparative safety comfort although breaking sea occasionally slopped in over bow necessitating frequent employment of bucket a baler there be very little sleep for of night for within hour be blowing really hard with heavy steep sea frequently broke aboard causing intense discomfort a water rushed aft surged about foot leg to wild plunging of boat keeping one of constantly busy baling to prevent boat from being swamped be thankful that have not added discomfort of cold to contend with for hard though blew wind be quite warm yet even so be unpleasant enough since be in greatest peril moment of long weary night utmost effort being continually required to keep boat above water notwithstanding everything be fine exhilarating experience for added to joy of battle with element there be wild grandeur of scene great mass of black cloud scurrying athwart sky with little patch of starlit blue winking in out between roar swoop of wind menacing hiss of phosphorescent foam cap a came rushing down upon boat in endless succession combining together to form picture like of a viewed from wildly leaping half swamped spray smothered open boat be given to comparatively few men to look upon gale lasted through night breaking at sunrise although sky cleared with coming of dawn wind continued to blow so strongly that be not until sun have crossed meridian that again became possible for to make sail upon boat meanwhile found that during night have hauled round from north west be therefore still practically dead in teeth moment that sea have gone down enough to render sailing once more possible got under way headed westward close hauled upon starboard tack under double reefed sail took fresh heart when presently saw that even under exceedingly unfavourable condition then prevailing be about a unfavourable a must possibly be boat be keeping good luff hanging well to windward thanks to exceptionally deep keel making about four knot of headway hour hope rose high that even yet despite delay have already experienced might be able to cover distance to coast before provision gave out for if be doing well under almost worst condition must possibly befall might not do when condition improved certainly did improve a afternoon wore on for wind eventually dropped sufficiently to permit to shake out reef sail boat under whole canvas while with moderating of wind sea also went down ceased to break although swell still ran very high be only heavily breaking sea be really dangerous to now that no longer have to fear drove gig for be worth luffing through fresher puff hawsing up to windward fathom by fathom generally handling a though be sailing in race a indeed be in sense race against time continued to do exceedingly well through afternoon indeed up to about midnight wind be softening time shortly after midnight speed began to slacken until by daylight of next morning have once more fallen to le than three knot moreover weather be by mean satisfactory in appearance there be actual cloud to be seen in sky instead of being clear deep rich blue a ought to have be a doubt must have be have there be fine weather in prospect entire vault of heaven be veiled in thick steamy colourless haze through sun showed a feeble shapeless blotch of white there be barely enough wind still dead against to fan along at bare two knot did not like look of sea despite almost total absence of wind be in strange state of unrest long heave of swell being overrun by small short choppy miniature sea seemed to leap up at brief interval without visible cause then curled over fell in casual sloppy manner suggested idea that must have liked to break must not summon up energy to do so else may have failed to do sloppy sea managed to retard way of boat through water very considerably to fill soul with exasperation for be distinctly hindering progress while must see valid reason why must exist at have appearance of having sprung up solely to delay for other purpose more than once when felt exceptionally impatient at miserably slow rate of progress have on tip of tongue to propose that must again take to oar did not actually speak word for in first place doubted whether gain in speed must be sufficient to justify expenditure of strength in next place hand be by time in such frightful condition of rawness that idea of proposing what must make very much worse seemed to smack of downright cruelty unless must urge more valid reason than mere desire to get ahead little faster situation just then be scarcely desperate enough for that be very shortly after midday be gathered aft partaking of meal that dignified with name of dinner when boatswain who be sitting on after thwart facing suddenly paused in act of conveying piece of biscuit to mouth stared intently over shoulder for moment then sprang to foot shading eye with hand what be murdock asked turning a spoke in direction toward be gazing do sail ho interrupted boatswain pointing eagerly with hand do ye see mr temple sir ay do answered a caught sight of faint pearly gleam afar off on north eastern horizon mr cunningham will kindly lend telescope for moment certainly with pleasure answered cunningham producing instrument from pocket be not very big affair being only about six inch long by perhaps inch half in diameter be three draw tube measuring about one foot nine inch long when fully extended for size be most splendid instrument have ever used quickly brought to bear upon distant gleam lens instantly resolved into head of fore main royal of craft barque brig standing to southward when have finished with instrument boatswain took squint through after carpenter sailmaker when have have turn cunningham applied to eye a boatswain passed telescope over to chip turned to eagerly looked at hard with so expressive eye instantly read what be in mind shook head must never do murdock said be too far to south'ard have borne three even couple of point farther to nor'ard might have felt inclined to risk what be talking about demanded cunningham be question of whether can can not intercept that ship because if be be most emphatically in favour of making attempt mind say that can actually intercept believe might manage to get close enough to to be seen for be almost certain to have man two aloft at work upon rigging yes ye be right mr cunnin'ham be exactly notion eagerly agreed boatswain believe that by runnin ' away off in about here direction pointing away toward south east ought to lift pretty nigh to rail by time that draw up abreast of if can do that stand very good chance of bein seen have no great faith in prospec of fetchin rio if get chance of bein picked up by ship ought to take moreover than like look of weather none too well 'd deal rather spend comin night aboard ship than in here gig there be certainly good sound reason common sense in murdock word particularly in what said about weather so turned to carpenter to ascertain view of matter what do say chip asked be of opinion that will be justified in losing ten fifteen mile of ground upon off chance of being able to close with yonder craft near enough to be seen why yes mr temple certainly be answered chip wo go so far a to say that will be actually able to manage think be dooty to have good try for be like bos'n have got sort of feelin ' that ai goin ' to fetch rio trip all right then said three constitute majority even if sail happens to think a do ah mr temple interrupted simpson agrees with bos'n then round go interrupted in turn putting helm hard up bore away sail jibed over off went almost dead before wind heading about south east bringing stranger about point half abaft port beam sailing before wind be very different matter from plugging to windward with sheet flattened well in although shift of helm have effect of making seem that wind have suddenly died away almost to nothing there be longer that heart breaking smack smack of small sea against weather bow have seemed to retard way in such exasperating fashion on contrary with sheet eased well off lug boomed out with boathook so that yard swung square across length of boat went sliding smoothly away to leeward with long easy buoyant motion pleasant musical gurgling of water along bottom planking swift gliding past of tiny air bubble occasional morsel of weed told be now travelling at rate of quite four knot for first half hour stranger did not appreciably alter bearing relative to boat seemed to indicate that be practically holding own with hope soared high especially a within brief period have raised royal head of topgallantsails above horizon when latter circumstance enabled to see that have starboard topgallant studdingsails set enthusiasm flagged again for argued that must be slow coach indeed if with breeze then blowing studdingsails set must not do better than four knot held peace however for there be use in damping hope of others while there be always possibility that if of hand happened to be employed aloft eye of one of might chance upon sail small though be ought to be perfectly visible at distance of five six mile even in somewhat hazy atmosphere by end of first hour after have begun chase became apparent that have heel of for although be still steering exactly same course a at first have drawn up square abeam of there be imperatively necessary that must keep if did not wish to slip past even although keeping of there must entail upon necessity to edge gradually away thus bringing own course ever more nearly parallel to hers instead of causing two steadily to converge then about end of second hour of chase by time have lifted stranger main topsail yard above horizon have discovered that be barque rigged breeze suddenly freshened up sufficiently to add extra knot half to speed be misfortune rather than otherwise for for although increased speed also increased that of stranger when reached did about ten minute later whereas added only about knot half to rate of travel probably quickened up pace by more than double amount a be painfully apparent from increased frequency with be obliged to edge away to keep square abeam now anxiety have along felt began to be shared by others one of whom kept cunningham telescope continually bearing upon barque began to fidget where sat to mutter grumble under breath to cast frequent look at sky astern have not materially altered aspect since morning except that haze have thickened somewhat at last boatswain must restrain no longer if here humbuggin ' breeze 'd only drop grumbled 'd out oar pull to ai goin ' to drop be worst of be agoin ' to freshen still furder cussed old hooker goin ' to run away from be what be agoin ' to do let have look at there glass again mr cunnin'ham continued ca make out what be thinkin ' about aboard be fine weather surely there ought to be work to be done aloft here got telescope to bear upon for at least tenth time since chase have begun relapsed into temporary silence while subjected visible part of to most searching scrutiny presently resumed with animation ah thought 'd be strange if bos'n must find somethin wanted doin ' aloft in such fine weather a just take here glass mr temple chip will catch hold of tiller for minute two see if there ai man sittin ' astride of weather main tawps l yardarm doin ' somethin other handed over tiller to chip took telescope raised eyepiece to eye instantly have small exquisitely clear picture of three mast of distant barque from level of second reef band of main topsail upward with rope piece of rigging gear even to reef point of topsail rising falling upon horizon line with lift of ship upon swell there sure enough at point named by boatswain tucked away in shadow of weather clew of topgallantsail so that be not very easy to make out saw what certainly took to be figure of man that boatswain be not mistaken presently became apparent for while still looked fellow leisurely swung on to foot rope began to lay in along yard quick exclaimed must attract attention somehow for have finished job be laying in off yard off with jacket sail jump up on thwart wave for be worth sailmaker tore off white canvas jacket grasping by one arm sprang up on mast thwart waved furiously while kept telescope focused upon slowly moving figure of distant seaman man worked way steadily in swung off yard to topmast rigging with merchant sailor usual deliberation descended until vanished below horizon line seemingly without giving single glance at widespreading surface of sea that stretched away for mile on side of will do sail said may belay flourishing get down off thwart shellback have gone down on deck without so much a glance in direction laid down have without stoppin ' so much a to take look round snarled boatswain savagely dashing clenched fist down on gunwale will be jiggered if can understan ' what be comin ' to sailorman a sail here sea fust there be that there portugee a went past without stoppin ' to pick up although see 'd must 'ave knowed that be castaway now here be here bloomin ' barque manned by chap a seem to think while to give look round while be aloft to see whether there be poor sailormen washin ' about in distress ai british will take bible oath o ' that british shellback do that there sort o ' thing why when first went to sea be never ordered aloft what skipper used to say take good look round men afore come down again never know when may be passin ' within sight of poor unfortunate perishin ' of hunger thirst prayin ' to be sighted picked up well said be afraid be up with so far a barque be concerned nevertheless will stick to a long a remains in sight hand may be sent aloft aboard before disappears wind may drop although confess see sign of at present in case be comforting in way to know that be in track of south bound ship be certain to sight others within next day two will be pretty poor luck if can not intercept one of although spoke so confidently be afraid be not very successful in cheering up companion in misfortune second disappointment be producing effect upon be becoming depressed pessimistic although agreed that proper thing to do be to hang on to distant barque in hope of eventually attracting attention of somebody aboard must see that be fully convinced that attempt must result in failure so did chased that barque until sun set shade of night hid from sight although about mid afternoon got so close to that lower yard showed above horizon when lifted on swell kept telescope bearing upon time more hand be sent aloft a afternoon progressed steadily drew away from again until when at length lost sight of in gathering darkness only royal upper half of topgallantsails be showing above horizon time so absorbed be in chase that be scarcely conscious of fact that wind be steadily freshening minute result being that when at length be compelled to abandon hope of being seen picked up suddenly awoke to fact that be blowing quite strong breeze that have kicked up such high steep sea that be no longer possible for to round to ride to sea anchor a have done on night one before be therefore obliged to scud before wind night under whole canvas to avoid being pooped swamped by breaking sea remorselessly chased be harassing anxious night for hand of for by midnight be blowing what be generally termed fresh gale be breeze strong enough to compel ship of say thousand ton to reduce canvas to single reefed topsail to in small open boat be about equivalent to what hurricane must be to bigger craft there be sleep for of for be in constant imminent danger taxed resource of hand to utmost limit through night to keep boat from being overwhelmed chief danger to open boat under such circumstance arises from fact that lying so low in water a doe sail becomes becalmed time that settle into trough of sea gradually loses way then a be hove up on breast of next following sea sail suddenly fill again in have to be careful that in filling doe not jibe over for if did so must certainly capsize boat in guarding against danger of equal magnitude be incurred for unless boat be kept dead stern on to sea chance be that will broach to be filled by breaking head of sea when overtakes when come to be remembered that twofold peril threatens open boat about twice minute hour after hour a long a gale continues faint idea may be gained of anxiety discomfort be called upon to endure on occasion be now attempting to describe while anxiety of be sufficiently acute man who be most worried be one who be at helm for behaviour of craft under such circumstance be in one respect distinctly harassingly peculiar at most perilous moment of be moment before be actually overtaken by breaking crest of wave be apt to refuse to answer helm who be steering loses control over seems to be seized with perverse determination to take broad sheer one way other with disastrous result despite hard over helm then only thing to be done to retrieve situation be to effect lightning shift of helm against past experience better judgment notwithstanding generally have desired effect reason commonly assigned being that contrary to what be usually supposed body of water constituting head of sea actually have quick forward motion when overtakes craft large small be only beginning to gather fresh headway result be practically same a though be going astern instead of ahead helm must be manipulated accordingly whether be really true explanation of curiously awkward phenomenon of have spoken can not say know that phenomenon occurs that placed in direst peril at least hundred time during never to be forgotten night peril from appeared to time escaped by very skin of teeth by what seemed to be nothing short of series of miracle true be told that day of miracle be long past after who know chapter five martha brown of baltimore through night until nearly noon next day be compelled to continue scudding before gale pretty crew of scarecrow looked when morning at length dawned disclosed to other vision drenched to skin with flying spray haggard red eyed with fatigue want of sleep wearing that peculiar indescribable expression of countenance mark man who have be face to face for hour with imminent death about four bell in forenoon watch gale suddenly broke sky cleared wind moderated so rapidly just before noon by carefully watching opportunity be at length able to round to once more ride to makeshift sea anchor then boat riding dry be to say shipping water baled out next proceeded to overhaul stock of provision with object of ascertaining what damage if have sustained through constant drenching of sea to have be exposed bread biscuit water be that be really anxious about remainder being packed in tin jar bottle be great relief to to find thanks to precaution have taken nothing have suffered to very serious extent then went to work to calculate position a nearly a must although roughness of data rendered exceedingly difficult to arrive anywhere near mark at length by patient careful figuring reached exceedingly unsatisfactory conclusion that not only have lost ground previously gained be somewhere about thirty mile south of spot where bainbridge have sent adrift then thought turned to longboat began to ask other how have fared be still afloat be true only because of long continued almost superhuman exertion while boat be exceptionally good one by mean overloaded how must be with consort overcrowded with helpless terror stricken woman child perilously deep in water scarcely dared to think for with recollection of what have recently passed through still vivid in mind have little difficulty in conjuring up very graphic picture of what must be state of affair aboard longboat under same circumstance of course there be possibility that more fortunate than have be seen party rescued by passing ship failing that felt that dared not entertain slightest hope that still survived good end however be to be served by speculating upon possibility of disaster to friend therefore proceeded to get meal a soon a have straightened up matter a far a be possible while ate drank discussed important question of what must do next recent experience have be of such character a to convince that prospect of reaching rio before stock of provision must be consumed if ever be exceedingly slight on other hand have already have ocular demonstration of fact that be not far from track of south bound craft therefore eventually arrived unanimously at conclusion that taking thing into consideration best thing must do be to cruise to northward in hope that within next few day must be fortunate enough to fall in with vessel skipper of must be humane enough to pick up perhaps land at nearest port be so near sunset before sea moderated sufficiently to enable again to make sail that ultimately determined to remain a be riding to sea anchor night in order that hand might have opportunity to secure good night rest before resuming battle with wind sea for after now that have definitely abandoned idea of attempting to make rio indeed part of south american coast did not greatly matter whether be under way not ship be just a likely to come along find where then be a anywhere else although have resolved to take night rest before resuming struggle of course intended to keep anchor watch of one hand who must look after weather boat also otherwise maintain sharp lookout so that in event of sail heaving in sight must not be permitted to slip past without effort on part to intercept night passed uneventfully wind sea gradually moderating through hour of darkness until by dawn of following day have so far gone down that must once more make sail upon gig with perfect safety be true that there be still rather heavy swell running even be fast diminishing there be sea to speak of wind being of strength known to sailor a royal breeze be to say wind of so moderate force that ship of ordinary size must show royal to sailmaker watch ended few minute after sunrise when called rest of first business be to wash sleep out of eye by dipping head into bucket of clear sparkling salt water dipped up from over side after proceeded to perform toilet a well a very limited resource permitted next thing in order being breakfast while be being prepared preparation consisting merely in apportioning to individual of just proper allowance of food simpson shinned up to masthead to take look round horizon thus enable to get earliest possible intimation of approach of ship must one chance to be in neighbourhood man have scarcely reached perch after be only about six foot above head when stood up when emitted joyous yell of sail ho hurrah bully here come pretty nigh straight down for if eye of mine ai deceivin ' of what do make out to be sail demanded ca tell yet sir answered simpson a can see just at present be head of well may be royal may be head of to'garns l of schooner be inclined to think be schooner because look sharp clear like a though be so very far off yes reckon that there blessed bit of white ai much more 'n ten mile away how doe bear asked dead to wind'ard a ever can be be cheering reply headin ' for just a straight a can come hurrah buckos there be mistake about time be boun ' to pick up unless happens to be of there puddin ' headed portugees what seem to believe in pickin ' up pore shipwrecked mariner sail ended with sudden note of disgust in voice portugee portugee will pick up will see to said will not give chance to refuse will just lie doggo where be until be within mile two of then will up lug run aboard whether people like not ay ay be sort mr temple agreed boatswain no more slippin past wavin ' hand for if want to pick up will just have to make 'em be have have enough of boat sailin ' to last for rest of bloomin ' life enough of sleepin ' on thwart too mean to sleep in dry fo ' cbele to night in spite of portugee swine in creation right simpson hailed have better come down now get breakfast by time that have finished yonder craft will be visible to of then will be able to judge what be best to be done made good hearty breakfast that morning eating drinking little more than strict allowance be afraid for seemed to be possessed of same undoubted conviction that with appearance of stranger to windward trouble be now over that therefore necessity to husband limited resource carefully no longer existed strange sail appeared to be fairly fast craft for before have quite finished breakfast head of canvas appeared above horizon to even though be still sitting upon thwart immediately brought cunningham telescope to bear upon first glimpse caught of through lens satisfied that be small vessel quickness violence of movement for be rolling heavily bearing unmistakable evidence of fact ten minute later discovered to be topsail schooner rigged be evidently making utmost of fair wind for have topmast lower studdingsails set on side be coming dead down wind direct for waited patiently where be until have risen hull up revealing through telescope a very handsome smart looking little schooner with very white sail looked a though made of cotton canvas then got sea anchor inboard cast oar adrift in readiness for instant use must need got under way working boat to fro in short tack immediately athwart schooner hawse while simpson stood on thwart to windward waving rag to attract attention boatswain meanwhile keeping telescope steadfastly bearing upon approaching craft have just tacked for second time when murdock with eye still glued to telescope shouted see see there be couple of chap standin by starboard cathead lookin ' at under sharp of hand now one of have turned round be looking aft be reportin ' of to hofficer of watch be can see hollerin ' with one hand to side of mouth while p'ints with other yes now there be chap runnin ' for'ard to join first two will be mate reckon p'rhaps skipper now third man lookin ' at too keep on wavin ' sail let there be mistake about what want third man runnin ' aft again be goin ' to call old man reckon pause of about minute ensued then boatswain resumed ai be gone aft to get glass yes that be now be bringin ' to bear upon wave sail wave skowbank for be worth yes be hurrah be right bully be not agoin ' to leave behind be chap of right sort be see that mr temple there be in stuns'ls be agoin ' to shorten sail round to to pick up seem to be thunderin short handed will be past away to loo'ard long afore can get stuns'ls in better bear up run down afore have sir so be not to keep ' suggestion be good one for have at least two studdingsails set on starboard side to take in before must round to from rate at be getting first in must see that a murdock have said little vessel must run past before must get in other so put up helm bore away easing off sheet when be running off square before wind began to edge boat gradually in toward line of schooner course by manoeuvre gave little more time to shorten sail since be still about mile ahead of be now travelling in same direction a although schooner be fast overhauling by time that be abreast of only about hundred foot distant starboard studdingsails be in be ready to round to then man came to rail hailed boat ahoy shouted guess be shipwrecked ai want to be picked up ay ay sir answered be so may run alongside sure replied heartily will come to wind on starboard tack when can pas under starn come alongside at lee gangway waved hand by way of thanks to show understood let run sheet of lug to allow to draw ahead take room to round to presently eased down helm brought schooner to wind keeping yard square hauling jib sheet over to windward to check little vessel way be thus afforded excellent view of craft little beauty be a clean built finely modelled a yacht for indeed might easily have be mistaken except for fact that sail be not big enough be painted black from rail to copper with bust of woman painted white for figurehead name martha brown with word baltimore port of registry painted in white letter on stern appeared to be in little more than deep ballast trim began to wonder whither be bound even before got alongside getting alongside required little management for there be fair amount of swell running schooner be rolling heavily managed right be met at gangway upon boarding little vessel by individual who have hailed be typical yankee tall thin somewhat cadaverous looking a to feature with clean shaven upper lip short goatee beard light hair slightly touched with grey worn so long that came down over collar of coat be of faded blue cloth adorned with brass button trouser be braced up high enough to reveal ankle wore pair of ancient red morocco slipper upon otherwise naked foot head be adorned with peakless cap of what looked like wolfskin fitted with pair of flap to tie down over ear now fastened together at crown although man presented distinctly quaint ensemble there be genial kindly twinkle in eye that caused to take to on spot a extended hand said with slight drawl strong yankee accent walcome stranger to marthy brown guess have be havin ' rough time by look of how long now have ye be knockin about in boat be fifth day in mr er er answered reckon be gropin around after name mister interrupted be ephraim brown very ginerally razeed down to eph by friend be master owner of here schooner named a'ter old woman away back to baltimore guess name be mark temple hastened to reply companion be respectively mr edward cunningham late cuddy passenger aboard british barque zenobia of vessel be one of apprentice william murdock boatswain joseph parson carpenter james simpson sailmaker of same ship be downright glad to meet replied mr ephraim brown shaking hand round again with much cordiality then stepped to taffrail looked down at gig have be passed astern guess be very tidy lookin ' boat of yourn there seem to be nothin ' partic'lar matter with reckon be quite worth hoistin ' in ai mister remarked yes indeed be replied have brought safely through pretty heavy weather must be very sorry to see cast adrift cast adrift nothin ' ai old eph brown way retorted skipper briskly be very heavy on contrary be exceedingly light boat when empty replied ah remarked interlocutor then guess will have stuff stock of provision reckon out of then will unship lee gangway run inboard fisherman fashion will be quicker than riggin ' tackle be in almighty big hurry faced forward hailed couple of men sam pete lay aft here lend hand to get stuff out of boat there be need to trouble people captain interrupted will empty ourselves in brace of shake murdock chip just jump down into gig pas thing out of haul close up under counter will pas down rope end over taffrail to sling to yes guess will do trick agreed skipper sam pete continued turning to two men who still lingered turn to unship lee gangway ready to run boat inboard when be cleared will stow right side up alongside of longboat quarter of hour later saw gig hauled inboard snugly stowed after martha brown be kept away upon course studdingsails be rehoisted boatswain carpenter sailmaker lending hand while cunningham remained aft chatting with new friend a last rope be belayed skipper stepped to skylight peered down through then turned struck eight bell almost immediately afterward lad emerged from cabin companion went forward to little galley presently reappeared bearing large covered dish in one hand capacious coffee pot in other aha exclaimed brown smacking lip in anticipation breakfast guess smell good now reckon that 'uns have be upon pretty short common last few day will be in good shape to enj ' square meal guess two will have to mess in cabin along o ' hand for'ard will look a'ter rest of crowd at skipper invitation cunningham forthwith followed below to exceeding small very comfortable cabin upon tiny table of be set out quite unexpectedly enticing meal to brown helped with most hospitable liberality for little while ate drank in silence presently when have taken keen edge off appetite kindly host asked for detail of circumstance under have come to be knocking about in mid ocean in open boat waal will be sugared ejaculated after have related to in detail incident connected with seizure of zenobia by crew under leadership of bainbridge if beat everything say that skunk mean to set up in business a pirate be here barque of yourn armed do mount gun because if how do crowd of tough reckon be goin ' to hold up rob ship shrugged shoulder have slightest notion replied knowing bainbridge so well a do have doubt that have scheme of sort in head waal agreed skipper if be pretty cute may p'rhaps bluff skipper two guess will very soon be euchred man o ' war will nab afore can say jack robinson now continued about 'uns from thing said while be spinnin ' that yarn of mutiny seemed to get sort of notion that 'd like to put ye ashore a soon a possible be that idee precisely said mr cunningham here naturally wish to return to england with a little delay a may be a for be equally anxious because until can get into touch with owner of zenobia be placed by in ship be losing time see commented skipper meditatively yes reckon kinder understand situation by by did say just now that be purty good navigator did only fancy remember having exactly said such thing replied possibly may have implied a much anyhow think be justified in saying that be navigator enough to take ship from one part of world to other ah returned skipper have idee 'd understood a much now then just listen to guess ca put ye ashore until arrives at punta arena away down there in magellan strait because solid fact be that be in most tarnation fired hurry to get into pacific of course will be very willin ' to tranship ye into homeward bounder if happens to fall in with one really want to go have be thinkin ' matter over bit while have be talkin ' have proposition to make maybe will suit ye just a well a goin ' back to old country s'pose have noticed have got nary mate with well confessed to tell truth have be wondering how be have not yet seen have' seen because guess ai here to see remarked skipper be unfort'nit in matter o mate trip continued reg'lar mate what always sail with be nevvy abr'be brown a slick youngster a ever wish to see met with accident day before sailed trod on banana peel fell awk'ardly broke right leg have to go to hospital have to look round in hurry for somebody to take place got chap looked right have be to sea above forty eight hour when made bad break got so tarnation drunk must get out of bunk for night day a'ter that kept on soakin ' on sly though where got liquor from must find out to save life until thing come to pas that if have be be in such tarnation hurry have put in somewhere fired wisht have now did end of be that went crazy jumped overboard be drowned one dark night when 'd be out just three week now proposition be look real smart be good navigator while be short of mate if care to accept position will sign ye on at same rate of pay namely thirty dollar month that other chap be gettin ' now what d say even know yet where be bound for what be probable duration of voyage objected naturally must like to know particular before binding sure agreed skipper in nowise offended at apparent hesitation well then continued be boun ' for certain spot in pacific for certain very partic'lar reason if agree to sign on will tell ye reason just exactly where spot be if sign on wo matter to where be goin ' what be out after be one of reason for here v'yage t'other be to trade off lot of truck what have got down below for sandalwood when have got full cargo of wood propose to go on to canton sell buy tea with proceeds said tea to be sold in due course at new york where v'yage will end reckon that trip will run into of eight nine month jolly fine trip will be remarked cunningham wish have chance temple must take like shot say remarked skipper eyeing cunningham earnestly then see ai sailor observed be very true returned cunningham by profession be civil engineer be also keen yachtsman know something more than rudiment of navigation of course added hastily have not qualification must fit for berth that be offering to temple n o reckon not agreed skipper meditatively still p'rhaps might be able to find use for ye if ye cared to come along upon such term a must see way to offer ye well remarked cunningham with laugh can discus later on if temple accepts offer meanwhile have be thinking rapidly there be very especial reason why must return to england at once for have relative to be anxious over disappearance only individual who be in least interested in being late father trustee to whom must write from punta arena then voyage of martha brown a sketched by skipper rather appealed to sandalwood collecting meant call at several of south sea island south sea island romance be synonymous term with at time also pay be good exceptionally good for such berth a of mate of ninety ton schooner although must probably sacrifice indenture be matter gave very little concern altogether felt very strongly disposed to close with brown offer only really serious obstacle in way being fact that felt have duty to perform to three seaman who have formed part of little company in gig first rate fellow be three of knowing vocation to smallest detail thoroughly at home aboard ship in blue water though ashore be a guileless helpless a babe ready to fall easy prey to first land shark got scent of if must be sure of arranging at punta arena for conveyance to england either a shipwrecked seaman otherwise thus discharging responsibility so far a be concerned must not hesitate for moment decided to put matter to skipper did so there then ah said be goin ' to speak to about there men of yourn d think 'd be inclined to sign on with for here v'yage really know in least replied regarding with astonishment if like will be like see interrupted doubt observing look of surprise there be six hand in here schooner fo ' cbele three to watch when shipped reckoned that with mate cook cabin boy there 'd be plenty of for work 'd have to do just when be startin ' be actually castin ' off warp at time letter be handed to that bein ' busy just then put into pocket forgot about until couple of day a'terwards when 'd cleared cape henry be fairly out to sea then while be goin ' through pocket huntin ' for something else come across here letter opened tell mister that there be news in that made sit up feel mighty anxious of sudden to get away round to pacific a quick a possible made feel too that wisht have three four more men along so if chap be willin ' to sign on with will be glad to have 'em pay well be good men tell say twenty month glanced forward saw that three of men be on deck smoking chatting with two hand who with man at wheel constituted watch be on deck see said if like will mention proposal to see how take will take very kindly if will mister answered skipper without more ado beckoned to join in waist where laid skipper offer before while old man cunningham remained chatting animatedly together close by companion where much of foregoing conversation have taken place upon adjournment from breakfast table soon found that with careless happy go lucky temperament of british merchant sailor three men be perfectly willing to ship for voyage about have already heard something from forecastle hand with whom have be fraternising especially when told have be offered position of mate felt strongly disposed to accept accordingly led aft there then informed skipper that accepted offer without further ado went below signed article when after signing returned to deck three english seaman have gone forward cunningham came up to said laughingly will be interested to learn temple that worthy friend here captain brown have also offered post have accepted a nearly a can define position be that of honorary second mate carry with pay in lieu of be to be perfectly free to leave schooner whenever please be to live in cabin receive cabin ration obtain free of cost entirely new outfit of clothes from slop chest what do think of bargain consider very fair one said with perhaps slight advantage in favour of skipper for although of course must doubtless do perfectly well without grub new rig out will not cost very much in return for will get a long a choose to remain with ability to sleep in night with perfectly easy mind for can assure captain here turned to individual who be standing by intently listening to be said that although be not professional seaman be quite sailor enough to take care of schooner during watch also be man of intellect education well read musical with inexhaustible fund of intensely interesting conversation so think captain brown will find in very agreeable companion ay ay have just hit temple cut in skipper be just what thought when be listenin ' to two feller talkin ' at breakfast time say to myself now here be two chap with speech manner of gentlefolk chap a can hold own with anybody when come to talkin ' yet be sailor too at least one of 'em be if eph brown what have never have more eddication than what must pick up must only persuade two to jine yer in here v'yage 'd have such chance a have never have before to learn gentlefolk manner to talk proper ginerally to comport in fashion a 'd make dear old marthy fit to bust with pride to see hear ye when ye get back home again bepecially a hope to strike rich trip ' so there be gent can call cap'n a often a like sound good make feel a though be punkins otherwise 'd like to talk to behave to just a if be eq'als whenever hear makin ' bad slip up in matter of language will take very kindly of ye if will just pull up with round turn p'int out where have gone wrong be rather amusing proposal certainly for shipmaster to make to officer old fellow be so transparently frank in recognising shortcoming so earnestly anxious to have remedied that cunningham entered quite heartily into spirit of thing readily undertook to do everything lay in power to polish up manner speech in readiness for surprise proposed to spring upon dear old marthy upon return to baltimore chapter six skipper brown relates remarkable story now gent said skipper when have satisfactorily arranged important rather delicate matter referring to improvement of speech deportment be sorter hankerin ' to have talk with about there letter be tellin ' of while ago letter be handed to just a be makin ' start from baltimore that forgot about until be fairly out to sea here letter told stop bit if want to understand thing properly surely do guess will have to give whole history of from very beginnin ' along about three month ago just after 'd got home from last v'yage happened to have bit of business to attend to called for trip over to new york when 'd got through with what have to do fancy took to stay over for day two have look round not havin ' be in new york for quite number of year before will understand while be doin ' lookin ' around must need go nosin ' like fool down into bowery down there run up agin ragged skeleton look hard in face hail with hello eph brown what cheer blamed if ai very chap that have be most wantin ' to see ' guess be pretty well struck of heap for did reckernise chap from adam noticed be that did seem to have ' have bath since mother give one a baby that be dressed in clo'es ought by right to have belonged to scarecrow that be that thin cadaverous might have just escaped from morgue that breath be reekin ' of cheap whisky now who in tom hawkins may be ' say for see feller knowed name right yet seein ' where be what man looked like sorter suspicioned that be exactly square be tryin ' to get at what ' say d 'ye mean to say a ye remember abe johnson what used to play with yer in old day when be boy together away in dear old nantucket nantucket will understand gent bein ' place where be born say be cold solid truth if be really abe johnson will remember name of few people in nantucket few of thing that done together where f ' r instance did live when knew ' well told where lived give name of lot of people

struck for ten dollar be right away down on luck said guess be speakin ' truth if look went for anything now abe never have amounted to much when knew be just low down ornery cuss way that looked at be al'ays bit tender hearted sorter pitied feller so a'ter passed over ten spot to took into restyrong filled up with good square meal while be eatin told long yarn about what 'd be doin how 'd tried fust one thing then have finally took to sea seemed that bad luck have follered there for 'd ended up by bein shipwrecked upon one of uncharted reef that run up agin sometimes in pacific bein ' only survivor out of whole crowd if be tellin ' truth must have ' have pretty rough time on reef for described a bein a bare a back of hand with nothin ' to eat bird egg clam only small tricklin stream of brackish scarcely drinkable water to quench thirst with be on that there reef five solid month afore whaler comed along seein ' signal took off later transferred to ship brought home now when abe have got far with yarn begun to get mysterious sunk voice to whisper asked if must trust told that best knew whether must not that anyway if thing be secret did want to hear anything about ah ' say there be fortune in fortune for of eph if can only trust ' well say a told ye before be for to decide if be agoin ' to trust get along with trustin ' for reckon have have about enough of 'ere place like look of folk see around not little bit be growin sorter keen to get out of ' right ' say let git ' so got made way to central park where found seat in quiet secluded spot sat down there a'ter sayin ' a 'd got secret that must share with somebody if be to get good out of be only reely honest feller knowed abe up told how a'ter 'd built bit of raft out of of wreckage of ship so must go off fishin ' in one day happened to hit upon big bed of pearl oyster thousan million of 'em sorter guessed what be when first set eye on a looked down through clear green water tried to get down to 'em by divin ' that be' good water be too deep good five fathom said there be over then there be shark about too so unlaid bit o rope from wreckage knocked nail out o ' o ' timber have druv ashore fixed up sorter small grapple with went gropin ' out on here oyster bed thing be of much account accordin ' to what abe said first 'd got to git just so over oyster afore 'd take holt then when 'd hooked one a often a not blamed thing 'd let go agin afore got oyster up out o ' water consequently come to with gropin ' only managed to land four oyster altogether out of four two have pearl in one bein a big a small marble while others be little 'uns three of 'bout size of cherry stone well took care of there pearl managed to bring home with then betead of takin ' of 'em to respectable jeweller must need try to trade off to chinaman of course can guess what happened chink purtended that be game to buy took abe to house leastways chink said be doped abe stole pearl vamoosed then few day a'terwards along come when abe reckernised made up mind in minute what 'd do first of all offered to sell secret of whereabouts of oyster bed for fifty thousand dollar only fifty thousand mind yer nothin ' bare word for that there be so much a single oyster in place got up to go away leave then asked if be game to go share with to give secret to go out to pacific fish up pearl two of to divide equally when got back home again well that be somethin ' more like business proposition after lot o ' talk agreed give latitood longitood of place right there afore left givin ' hundred dollar on account to carry along bit until must get job then went back home to baltimore began to figure upon best way to work scheme be' rich enough to make trip purely a speculation so at last hit upon sandalwood idea reckon will pay expense of v'yage return profit even if find nary pearl although have very good notion that be where abe said be next thing did be to get few p'ints upon in out of sandalwood tradin when 'd done started out to get stock of notion overhaul schooner make ready for v'yage look about for crew of men must be sure must play trick after 'd got hold of pearl sailed from baltimore day a'ter christmas a be castin ' off here letter told ye about be handed aboard when come to open d 'ye think be news in reckon will never guess have got cousin 'way over in nantucket be pretty well to do findin ' runnin ' bit short o money when come to fittin ' out schooner went over to told about abe pearl asked to lend thousand dollar to leave with old marthy to keep goin ' while be away know let have dollar straight away well here letter be from what said be that be writin ' in hurry to tell that 'd just heard quite by accident that abe be dead died in hospital in new york havin ' be run over fatally injured by express wagon two day a'ter 'd left be where trouble come in afore died sent post haste for brother in law abner slocum to go to to oncet a have somethin ' most terrible partic'lar to tell abner went although cousin know what abe told guess have somethin ' to do with pearl because when abner got back after buryin ' abe went to work in most tremenjous hurry to get schooner kingfisher ready for sea observin ' greatest secrecy about refusin ' to say what hurry be where be boun ' to be layin ' in big stock of provision water people got talkin ' about be how cousin got to hear what be goin ' on did get to hear of until just at very last be on day that kingfisher went to sea be two day before christmas so see abner slocum be in such tarnation hurry to git away that must even wait to spend christmas with wife kiddy now what d 'ye make of yarn well said cunningham be bound to admit captain that look very much a though friend abe finding upon deathbed have sent for brother in law divulged to secret of oyster bed probably when found dying realised that must derive personal benefit from discovery wished that wealth must go to own family be how figure out agreed skipper reckon that claim just a good a abner abe havin entered into business agreement with besides be a though abner 'd make good use of money when 'd got know abner slocum through through tell gent that be out out very worst character in nantucket real downright hard case well everything be bad if happens to get o pearl will just drink to death in three month most likely kill wife into bargain then in case said seems to that will be great deal better that must not have of well be just view of too agreed skipper guess be goin ' to do level best to get hold of 'em continued reckon that abe must have told that 'd parted with secret to be fittin ' out to go in search of there oyster be reason why be so all fired anxious to get to sea before a matter o ' fact did sailed three clear day ahead of must have ' be just about off cape henry when cleared so be race between two schooner will get there fust barrin ' accident reckon be goin ' to be neck neck one for kingfisher smartest schooner sailin ' out o nantucket although abner slocum such downright bad man ' will say for there ai better seaman sailin under old glory than what be now gent here be idee be agoin ' to carry on night day to get to there spot in pacific where pearl be when get there be goin to scrape up a many oyster a ever can lay hand on when have got have realised upon will look upon half of proceeds a belongin ' to abe bein ' dead heir mean to take partic'ler care let heir be who may that skunk abner penny of money if turn out that abner child be heir then be goin to app'int trustee to look a'ter money for 'em until a'ter abner dead then can have bravo captain exclaimed cunningham patting skipper approvingly on back most wise honourable decision to have arrived at call so far a be concerned will do can to help to carry out by way how do propose to obtain oyster when arrive at spot where according to friend abe be to be found how do intend to get repeated skipper why with trawl of course have got specially strong trawlin ' gear aboard made o ' purpose for job see commented cunningham did not occur to to get diving gear suppose well no did be fact answered skipper guess will find that trawl will work all right added cheerfully yes doubt agreed cunningham of course added diving system must have worked very much more rapidly because see if have happened to posse set of diving gear must have anchored schooner right over bed sent diver down with two large sack net while filled one must have hauled up other emptied into bin barrel ranged round deck in readiness to be conveyed ashore emptied after day work on bed be over in manner must have secured several thousand of oyster daily ay reckon must guess will have to be content to work with trawl seein ' that have divin ' gear diver aboard replied skipper rather regretfully well be not quite so sure about observed cunningham thoughtfully have germ of idea in head will see if can not develop do happen to have rubber hose on board sure replied skipper got hundred foot of brand new hose for washin ' deck with be bit extravagant know 'low will pay in long run most certainly will very handsomely too if can put idea into shape have used hose at yet asked cunningham used mornin ' since left baltimore replied skipper then let earnestly beg not to use more just for present at least entreated engineer just a say answered skipper cheerfully have got old canvas hose stowed away somewhere will have routed out right agreed cunningham while be keeping watch on deck will think over scheme of mine must rather like to get better of man what be name oh yes slocum yes be right assented skipper look here if there scheme of yourn have to do with divin ' mister who be goin ' to do divin know nothin ' about do remarked cunningham cheerfully will do diving if can only work out idea have come to believe can from point conversation drifted away into generality finally skipper went below leaving in charge of deck of forenoon watch later on brown informed that late mate cabin be entirely at service while cunningham be inducted into small spare stateroom be in use a sort of extra sail room skipper ordered to be cleared out for engineer accommodation also appeared that when late mate went overboard left behind very fine sextant skipper have purchased at auction of effect of deceased instrument allowed to use new arrival aboard martha brown shook down into position with degree of promptitude excited liveliest admiration of skipper be shrewd old fellow however for first two day after arrival remained on deck day be frequently up down during night frankly confessing that be anxious to observe manner in new officer performed duty after that announced intention to sleep in night laughingly declaring that a be now employing two mate saw reason why must not leave to do work take ease like gentleman be good enough to express complete satisfaction with ability a navigator opened eye in astonishment when saw be not content with mere daily observation of meridian altitude of sun used a well such comparatively intricate problem a of double altitude lunars altitude of star great circle sailing what gratified most of think be fact that before have be aboard two day have got simpson sailmaker at work upon enormous jack yard gaff topsail for use in light wind only gaff topsail that schooner have hitherto possessed being trumpery little jib headed affair must carry in quite strong breeze also caused set of preventer backstay to be fitted enabled to carry amount of canvas in breeze must otherwise have be impossible certainly did carry on in manner sometimes made old man gasp with astonishment for hitherto have be in habit of sailing schooner in very jog trot fashion now handled a must have done racer be surprising to see how day after day mileage increased how rapidly track on chart stretched southward skipper in groping cautious way have fully intended to make sure of position by heading for sighting falklands before attempting to make strait told regarded that a utterly useless waste of time worked out great circle track direct for cape virgin at entrance to strait to mingled consternation delight if cast schooner away between said guess will get to there oyster bank early enough to clean out before kingfisher arrives for smart seaman a slocum think reckon ai patch on for carryin ' on for first three four day after arrival on board martha brown cunningham devoted energy entirely to task of qualifying to take charge of watch looking after ship generally polishing up somewhat rusty seamanship very quickly settled into place then whenever have spare moment got to work with pencil paper making sketch calculation then one evening in second dog watch brought to sheet of paper on have sketched outline of human figure first showed then producing tape measure desired to measure very accurately jotting down upon diagram several measurement a called out then day two afterwards found busily at work with quantity of light thin iron rod have routed out from among ship store rod cut up into carefully measured length welded riveted together with aid of portable forge have rigged up on lee side of fore deck until in course of week have constructed dozen light strong skeleton frame having tried proved to satisfaction procured empty oak barrel taking carefully to piece set carpenter to work to saw cut out carefully plane up number of thin strip from stave then when have got a many of strip a required have small hole bored in in certain position by mean of quantity of fine wire proceeded to bind carefully strongly to skeleton frame have previously made when have done that to amazement calmly proceeded to induct into with assistance then saw that whole affair constituted complete body armour of kind helmet even then have idea of what be driving at until condescended to explain said be foundation of diving suit will be complete when have covered with double thickness of well oiled canvas framework of thin rod will keep water pressure off body batten will support outer covering of canvas prevent from bursting will see that by arrangement have adopted secure ample flexibility for purpose then a soon a arrive at destination intend to have one of screw deck light bodily removed temporarily fixed in helmet will enable to see what be doing when under water of course will need weight to hold down air will come down to through rubber deck hose one end of will be let into back of helmet while other will be firmly secured to portion of schooner where will be out of way of course will be very rough ready makeshift affair believe will prove fairly efficient for purpose cunningham next business be to cut out have sewn together for single garment combined function of stocking trouser shirt be made of double thickness of stout canvas thickness being well coated on side with two coat of boiled oil be weird looking garment a be intended to fit on outside armour arrangement called diving suit be merely intended to exclude water when be finished fitted saw that must serve purpose perfectly well there seemed to be reason why must not be able to work in at bottom of sea perfectly well completed whole affair by firmly attaching one end of rubber hose pipe to back of helmet made cape virgin on day at hour almost minute have predicted to intense admiration delight of skipper reached punta arena in strait of magellan on afternoon of same day here came to anchor brown cunningham went ashore skipper business being to arrange for refilling of water tank supply of quantity of fresh meat cunningham just to take look round stretch long leg bit mine to report seizure of zenobia by bainbridge crew to post to owner letter upon same subject have prepared at leisure first enquiry be a to whether kingfisher have passed brown delight be great when learned that thus far nothing have be seen of left punta arena shortly after noon on day following that of arrival still with sign of kingfisher being lucky enough to get fine little slant of wind safely accomplished dangerous passage entered pacific on evening of succeeding day slant of wind held long enough to enable to gain offing of trifle over hundred mile then died away left becalmed rolling gunwale under on long pacific swell yes there must be doubt that martha brown knew how to roll be first experience of in flat calm heavy swell have not hastily rigged rolling tackle verily believe that must have rolled mast out of even skipper proud a be of felt obliged to make sort of apology for wound up by saying day smarty will come along invent way of turnin ' here rollin ' to account a mean of propulsion then will see that builder will fashion ship upon model of marthy eh what be just say again captain remarked cunningham who being second dog watch happened to be on deck skipper said again y e e agreed cunningham thoughtfully y e e must wonder walked away contemplatively now must be so very powerful surprised if be to turn out to be smarty just mentioned observed skipper jerking thumb toward where cunningham stood gazing abstractedly over taffrail with foot wide apart hand locked behind balancing to violent movement of little vessel possibly agreed cunningham be of very inventive turn of mind to convert rolling motion of ship into forward movement be pretty tall order must probably require exceedingly complicated machinery idea be by mean new believe several inventor have have turn at nothing practical seems to have come of a yet nothing further be said upon subject just then calm continuing night next day several time caught cunningham with paper before pencil in hand sketching calculating when next day also proved calm observation showed that have not progressed couple of mile upon journey skipper again addressed cunningham upon subject asking half jestingly if have not yet be able to devise scheme to turn eternal rolling to account oh yes answered cunningham dare say must rig up sort of arrangement if be worth while must be rather cumbersome contrivance to ship unship must not recommend unless there be likely to be much of sort of thing between here destination well said skipper reckon may depend pretty certainly upon at least fortnight of cabes afore arrive at there oyster bed 'd be worth whole lot to to get there fortnight ahead of kingfisher what be thing like have invented mister must knock up out o ' stuff a have got aboard oh yes answered cunningham have kept strictly in mind capability in preparation of sketch must easily devise much better more efficient concern be sure must be quite useless to because have material skilled labour aboard to produce continued producing pencil paper beginning to sketch rapidly think might manage to knock together contrivance of sort there must be two of understand one on side of ship represents stout timber frame must be secured in place by short length of chain bowsed taut by tackle so that must remain rigidly in position must reach from rail down to about three foot below surface of water outrigger arrangement must be about nine foot long will serve a attachment for what may call fin made of flexible planking securely fixed at fore end to outrigger quite free to move at other end now fin being submerged when frame be fixed in place will be acted upon by pressure of water a ship roll will bend alternately upward downward at angle effect being that time ship roll bent fin will force backward considerable quantity of water what be same thing will have tendency to thrust ship forward at rate estimate at well say about three knot per hour three knot hour repeated skipper very much be thought maybe that 'd be able to fix up somethin ' 'd shove along at about ten twelve knot cunningham laughed a shook head come come captain protested be reasonable to get ten twelve knot out of schooner must require steam engine of eighty to hundred horse power ay admitted skipper rather unwillingly s'pose must three knot hour be in round figure seventy mile from noon to noon that for say fourteen day be how much nine hundred eighty mile call thousand answered cunningham thousand mile jings mount up when come to look at way averred skipper look here mister continued after thinking for minute how long do reckon must take to fix up concarn of yours oh not very long answered cunningham very roughest of workmanship must do so long a be strong dare say chip must put together in well say four day four day repeated skipper four day then reckon better go ahead straight away turn out a quick a ever can for here ca be look a though meant to last goodish while yet glass be high steady with upward tendency if anything see sign of wind anywheres about within hour cunningham chip be hard at work upon contrivance for circumventing cabes before knocking off time have got on deck timber required of sawn to proper length next day saw completion of cutting sawing planing then came fresh westerly breeze enabled to lay up within about two point of course for next five day during cunningham completed work bolting on of fin must be done in about ten minute then wind gradually veered until be not only enabled to lay course have couple of point free when wind being light big jack yard gaff topsail came into play with magnificent effect pushing little hooker along at about six knot when for must scarcely have done four finally fell calm again schooner lost steerage way altogether there be again sign that calm be likely to be prolonged in fact be in latitude of doldrums calm occur just to north south of trade wind where a on line calm sometimes last for week at stretch be therefore excellent opportunity to test cunningham contrivance accordingly proceeded to bolt up fix in position be rather awkward cumbersome arrangement demanding united strength of hand to get over side took full hour to get part fixed firmly to cunningham satisfaction have not be in position five minute before saw that be going to prove success for not only did serve to steady little vessel ease rolling to considerable extent immediately began to gather way within hour be slipping along through water at rate of shade over four knot by log skipper be enchanted furl everything mr temple said head due no'th will just meander along now under bare pole until run into south east trade when once hit will be right need start tack sheet again until reach oyster bed chapter seven pearl oyster bed caught south east trade wind next day very light at first gradually freshening a ran farther into then a soon a found fairly in grip of true breeze with water rippling blue crisply about got schooner under canvas once more hoisted fin inboard bore away upon west course with starboard studdingsails big gaff topsail set dragging like team of cart horse week of sort of thing carried to calm belt under line here once more brought fin into action using for three whole day trifle over before touched southernmost fringe of north east trade when again went bowling along under plain sail being a much a must conveniently show to beam wind finally on certain morning immediately after breakfast climbed to topgallant yard armed with cunningham telescope have borrowed for occasion looking straight ahead saw just where have expected to see namely fifteen mile beyond jibboom end patch of white water three mile in length stretching north south right athwart schooner hawse be coral reef upon if skipper friend abe johnson have spoken truth that worthy have suffered shipwreck followed by horror of complete solitude for five solid month two mile beyond lay according to abe rich pearl oyster bed be real object of martha brown visit to lonesome spot in heart of pacific see anything mr temple hailed skipper from quarterdeck in voice tense with excitement ay ay sir replied be there right enough a plain a mud in wine glass about fifteen mile off stretching right athwart hawse have better luff point sir go round northern extremity luff p'int be answered skipper directing helmsman then a schooner came to new course how be that mr temple excellent sir replied will just nicely clear northern end of reef if be kept at d 'ye see anything else besides reef mr temple asked skipper anything mean in shape of schooner for instance nothing at sir answered be right then answered skipper in tone of exuberant satisfaction guess need to stay up there no longer do ye slung telescope round neck by strap then swinging off yard slid down to deck hand over hand by way of topgallant backstay walking aft joining skipper cunningham a soon a foot touched plank so reef there right be remarked brown a joined pair returned telescope with thanks to lawful owner there ai chance of mistake s'pose chance at replied confidently be there a plain a nose on one face if remember told yesterday that provided breeze held must be at anchor in lagoon by noon to day so will ay ay answered brown remember sayin ' so did doubt word not for second for be navigator mistake never knowed better be just little bit afeard abe might have ' be playin ' on else that rigger might have ' got bit mixed reckon be square deal since say that reef there what do look like from aloft present precise appearance that described to said bare reef almost awash with not thing upon except few bird must just make out circling in air above ay that will be sure enough agreed brown remember abe speakin ' about bird egg clam that knocked off rock fish two that managed to catch later on be that pore feller have to eat for five everlastin month raw at be just five bell when weathered northern extremity of reef bore away to look for entrance to lagoon be then aloft again for sake of more extended view obtainable from height of topgallant yard a swept past reef looked down upon thought have never seen more ghastly place for solitary human being to be cast away upon be composed apparently of nothing coral upon everlasting surf be gradually casting up deposit of sand when dry wind be a gradually distributing over surface here there observed dark patch took to be seaweed partly buried in sand there be tolerably well defined tide mark consisting apparently of more seaweed flotsam of various kind cast up by surf most remarkable thing about island be multitude of bird gull principally there be thousand of in air about reef many more thousand of sitting on reef time be doubt coming when guano of bird dead body refuse of food mingling agglomerating with sand rotting seaweed must form extraordinarily rich soil upon few coconut drifting across illimitable ocean must be cast up by surf becoming buried must sprout throw out root shoot become tree a have happened in case of so many others of pacific island at moment there be not green thing upon atoll a whole be almost perfectly circular in shape having diameter of about four mile for purpose of description may be spoken of a consisting of three part namely island lagoon encircling reef island being dry be of course highest part of atoll measured about three quarter mile long be crescent shaped being about three eighth of mile wide in middle tapering off north south in form of cusp of crescent moon from extremity of two cusp there swept away encircling reef enclosed lagoon in very perfect natural breakwater having inevitable opening a nearly a might be in middle just opposite widest part of island although have spoken of island a being highest part must not be supposed that even rose considerable height above level of ocean highest point a subsequently ascertained being only bare six foot above water surface be fortunate enough to catch glimpse of passage through reef almost immediately after going aloft therefore have difficulty in hitting off conning schooner from crosstrees took through without hitch anchor plunging into placid water of lagoon few minute after skipper have struck six bell well gent brown remarked rubbing hand a having be forward to supervise mooring of ship in absence aloft came aft joined cunningham while crew took to rigging went aloft to furl canvas here be at last ne'er sign of kingfisher anywhere about did ye happen to notice anything at like h'yster bank anywhere near while be aloft mr temple yes sir did answered took good look round while be coming in noticed distinct discoloration of water about mile out a dead to leeward of island a can possibly be have doubt will find to be shoal of friend spoke there be thing noticed while be aloft will take opportunity of mentioning island be literally covered with bird sir unfortunate a be necessity be afraid that very first task must be to kill one of kill off bird mr temple echoed skipper in tone of mingled surprise indignation why what harm be adoin ' none at at present sir by way how do propose to obtain pearl hope to procure from oyster in yonder bed well answered skipper have in mind to take schooner out to bed mornin anchor right on top of then thought of lowerin ' boat a oyster come up dischargin ' into boat one boat at time until have got fair cargo a'ter that boat will be sent ashore in charge of say two men number boat will be loadin while number be goin ' ashore comin ' back when oyster be took ashore plan be to spread out on island let rot in sun ah yes now see what mean about blamed bird will just go for rottin ' oyster ' play very ole gooseberry with be that what mean precisely said will attack decaying oyster will probably lose about three fourth of pearl ay see see murmured old man seems most tarnation pity continued regretfully guess will have to do lose most o ' pearl will be endless job too to say nothing of pity of to kill off thousand of bird remarked cunningham perhaps after may not be necessary to resort to such extreme measure a have firearm on board captain bet have ammunition too answered skipper with grin catch old eph brown venturin ' property on expedition like here among savage too when get away down among island a'ter that there sandalwood without bringin ' along mean to defend got dozen musket six shot gun down below reckon can get lot out in ten minute then said cunningham will tell what will do captain if be agreeable let temple have couple of shot gun with moderate quantity of ammunition will go ashore shoot sufficient number of bird to make thoroughly afraid of anything resembling human figure then when have done that will rig up scarecrow on leeward extremity of island where suppose will deposit oyster to undergo process of decay see how act before attempt anything in nature of actual wholesale slaughter yes assented skipper eagerly guess that plan well worth tryin be much obliged to ye for thinkin ' of want death of more o bird laid to door than what there be actooal need for for be purty creeturs when said done god made 'em same made be afeard that few of will have to die so job might a well be done at once will go down below get shot gun mr temple might a well go ashore directly after dinner accordingly a soon a midday dinner be over gig gig be hoisted out cunningham with two hand for crew with shot gun together with double pocketful of cartridge went ashore to perform exceedingly unpleasant necessary task of frightening bird so effectually that must not be likely to interfere to very great extent with pearling operation at last moment just before shoving off from schooner side cunningham shouted to cook to pas down into boat biggest basket that must find doctor did with result that when landed on island carried with basket capable of holding quite one hundred gull egg have already decided that southern extremity of island be proper place upon to deposit oyster when obtained because by placing there exceedingly offensive odour must be generated by process of decay must be carried away by wind over open sea while by anchoring schooner a far to windward a possible might hope to escape in very great measure if not altogether annoyance of smell therefore upon landing started operation at south end of island by driving bird away from there task be by mean so easy a have anticipated for so extraordinarily tame be bird that positively refused to rise at approach actually permitting to be caught neck to be wrung rather than take trouble to get out of way certainly resisted actual capture most vigorously fighting with beak wing many sharp peck severe blow did receive within first ten minute of operation must not take to flight make slightest attempt of kind to avoid consequently at length very much against will be obliged to open fire upon be not until creature saw struggle heard piteous cry of wounded among that at length began to grasp fact that be enemy dangerous even then be not until have killed three hundred of that seemed to have fully learned lesson took to flight at approach while wretched work of slaughter be proceeding two men with basket followed in footstep collected egg from abandoned nest choosing cleanest a being most likely to be fresh so upon return to schooner night cook got to work hand supped sumptuously upon boiled fried gull egg while in cabin regaled upon savoury omelette followed by pancake after supper cunningham with old discarded suit of clothes belonging to skipper rigged up most realistic scarecrow ready for transportation to shore first thing next morning be astir at daybreak next day while hand under skipper supervision hoisted out longboat jollyboat passed astern ready for towing then proceeded to wash down deck cunningham took gig carefully depositing scarecrow in sternsheets pulled ashore set up figure bird taking to air with loud plaintive cry moment that stepped ashore then having set up figure represented man carrying gun returned to schooner observing with satisfaction a did so that bird seemed indisposed to settle again after wheeling in air over island for time winged way out to sea by time that got back to schooner breakfast be ready hand be at once piped to meal regardless of hour word at same time being passed that everybody must be expected on deck again within twenty minute such warning be needed for forecastle hand by time knew a well a afterguard what have come to lonesome spot for be a eager a not only to see how adventure must pan out to use own expression also to gain utmost possible advantage over kingfisher people whom regarded a must be lawless poacher upon own private property therefore when of cabin returned to deck after hasty meal have bolted in le than quarter of hour hand be on deck ready waiting for order accordingly sooner did skipper poke head out of companion bellow order to loose fore aft canvas than group on forecastle split up into section one section actually running aft to cast loose mainsail while second attacked foresail third laid out to loose jib fourth last proceeded to fix lever of patent windlass to heave in slack of cable quarter of hour sufficed to get canvas set anchor broken out of sand then a schooner paid off filled cunningham proceeded to get diving gear on deck to make ready for great experiment while sprang into fore rigging made way aloft to topsail yard from to con schooner out through reef in first place afterwards to look out for oyster bed must not possibly have have finer day for beginning of operation for sky be clear rich deep blue dappled here there at interval with small patch of trade cloud looked like bit of cotton wool drifting solemnly athwart azure while trade wind be blowing very moderately there be sea to speak of have scarcely got comfortably settled upon topsail yard when skipper hailed from where stood aft close alongside helmsman tawps ' l yard there shouted s'pose happen to see nothin ' of that there blamed kingfisher anywhere about do ye mr temple sent gaze slowly searchingly right round entire rim of horizon air be so crystal clear that glass be needed to aid eye have there be a much a three four foot of royal masthead showing above horizon must not have failed to detect there be nothing horizon be absolutely bare in direction so reported skipper waved hand by way of reply forthwith turned attention to business in hand be that of conning schooner through passage in reef twenty minute later be outside rising falling easily upon long pacific swell moment that be prudent for to do so starboarded helm trifle kept away for slightly discoloured patch of water seemed to mark position of shoal upon expected to find boundless wealth of extensive bed of pearl oyster spoken of by departed abe ten minute sufficed to run down to moment that reached saw that have not come upon wild goose chase oyster be there all right thousand million of showing up a light brown patch nearly ten acre in extent clearly distinguishable through crystal clear water allowed schooner to run to about very centre of patch then shouted for anchor to be let go meanwhile halyard have be let run two three minute earlier canvas be rolled up anyhow everybody from skipper to cabin boy seeming to be suddenly seized with perfect delirium of excitement a for went down on deck by way of backstay at once proceeded to lend cunningham hand to get into makeshift diving rig be very carefully overhauling while be doing four of hand came along with twenty five foot ladder heavily weighted at bottom with pig of iron ballast cunningham have caused to be constructed launched over side allowing to hang plumb up down well secured just abaft main rigging be for cunningham to descend by upon looking over side saw that reached to within about four foot of surface of oyster bed getting of cunningham into suit arranging of preliminary such a rigging of derrick wherewith to hoist to surface net of oyster after cunningham have filled hauling of longboat alongside to receive first load so on kept busy for full half hour during skipper paced to fro urging to hurry gnawing finger nail to quick in excitement impatience at length everything be ready even to shovel cunningham be to use for shovelling oyster into net with upper end of air hose securely made fast to main rigging close to where stood with signal line coiled in hand ready for paying out with stout sword bayonet girt about waist a defence against possible attack of prowling shark amateur diver be assisted to climb rail get foot upon topmost rung of ladder after be left to own device have taken precaution to send good man aloft in boatswain chair bent to end of gaff topsail halyard to keep lookout for shark have reported none in sight therefore hoped that must not suffer very serious interruption from cunningham went over side with utmost confidence keeping eye on a cautiously descended ladder rung by rung paying out signal line in such manner a always to maintain very light strain upon at length saw step off bottom rung of ladder gingerly lower to surface of oyster bed having reached gave single tug of signal line to indicate that be all right then after pausing for moment apparently to take good look round cast off shovel from end of line by have be lowered proceeded methodically to shovel oyster just a came into one of net have also be lowered within reach ten minute of steady work now ensued at end of gave signal to hoist away up came first spoil probably about five hundred oyster be swung over longboat emptied into second net having meanwhile be lowered down to diver now there occurred somewhat diverting episode for sooner be first net load of oyster discharged into longboat than skipper unable longer to endure suspense scrambled over side armed with formidable jack knife leaping down into boat seized oyster proceeded to force open with blade of knife doubt fully expecting to find at least one pearl of price in ala poor man be doomed to disappointment for there be sign vestige of pearl in fish save lovely iridescent lining of two shell second attempt fared better disappointed seeker flung shell far from with muttered something sounded not unlike imprecation good man be not to be so easily put off third oyster be seized savagely wrenched open time three diminutive seed pearl rewarded perseverance yet still be not satisfied fourth oyster be opened proved blank fifth be seized a two shell be forced apart magnificent pearl be revealed together with six eight much smaller one shout of triumph apprised of fact that at last search have proved successful next moment up came skipper face aflame with delight excitement to show sundry what pearl looked like when fresh taken from parent fish meanwhile process of filling hoisting emptying net went steadily on for best part of hour then cunningham signalled that be coming to surface three thousand oyster having by time be secured when cunningham presently appeared glass of helmet be unscrewed informed that makeshift suit be perfectly watertight answered purpose even better than have dared to expect that have come up simply because felt fatigued with unaccustomed work needed little rest skipper thought good opportunity to change boat so sent away longboat with load in charge of couple of men giving instruction how to dispose of oyster gig be hauled up alongside in place then boatswain who have along manifested utmost interest in diving question volunteered to change place with cunningham do spell of shovelling engineer explained that must take turn below quite easily proposed a amendment that boatswain must take on afternoon shift being arranged again descended resumed operation then in due course there came brief respite while everybody went to dinner hour being allowed for meal at expiration of time operation went on uninterruptedly until about hour before sunset when be perforce obliged to cease work in order to get schooner back into lagoon before nightfall have done not at badly for have kept rough very rough account of number of oyster have be brought to surface day not counting of course just estimating number have come up in net when came to total up found that unless calculation be long way out must have secured at least twenty five thousand oyster a reward for day work by mean ended with mooring of schooner in lagoon for when be done there still remained oyster to be laid out in row upon southern extremity of island soon found that landing laying of out be much more lengthy process than getting of up from sea bottom very fortunately for have arrived at island when moon be four day old in exquisitely clear atmosphere moon of even age affords very useful amount of light of availed to empty boat make ready for next day before finally knocking off work next day be with rather notable exception just repetition of day have preceded weather be a fine matter worked even more smoothly for almost hour revealed to little improvement might be made in method of work promptly adopted thus for example boatswain having proved to be quite expert diver be arranged that cunningham must work spell spell about man working two hour then taking two hour complete rest on second day upon bank cunningham boatswain have be down once dinner hour have arrived passed cunningham be down again working with tremendous energy for friendly rivalry have already arisen between boatswain a to who must send up most oyster while stood in main chain tending signal line intently watching toiling figure diligently shovelling oyster away down below in cool green shadow of schooner hull a on previous day have man aloft for express purpose of keeping lookout for shark time hailed reply be that there be shark in sight suddenly a stood watching cunningham great greyish brown object slid lazily along beneath paused immediately above toiling diver single glance sufficed to identify a shark full twenty foot in length instantly sent down pre arranged danger signal while man at masthead yelled shark ho right over diver sang out to two men who be in boat receiving oyster a came up to seize couple of oar violently splash surface of water with in hope that sound must drive brute away for after shark voracious a be be timid creature easily frightened by sudden unaccustomed noise attempt met with at least partial success for shark instantly darted away few yard a suddenly turned apparently quite undismayed by splashing slowly came back meanwhile however cunningham have dropped shovel having drawn sword bayonet with be armed stood quite quietly on defensive alertly on watch evidently shark did not quite know what to make of strange creature on sea bottom for now began to swim rapidly to fro making short tack way of few yard only eyeing cunningham intently while then before must do anything in nature of intervention brute suddenly wheeled made dash straight for engineer so lightning swift be onslaught that only thing distinctly saw be quick whisk of creature tail a turned sudden dart of great body followed by equally sudden writhing movement then in instant great fish appeared to be enveloped in cloud of red in almost disappeared next thing distinctly realised be that be gone while red cloud slowly dissipating cunningham be presently revealed in very act of recovering shovel for purpose of resuming work signalled to to come up at once replied with vigorous negative next moment be hard at work again minute two later man aloft hailed guess mr cunningham have give that there shark gruel for there be away out there on starboard quarter in dyin flurry sure enough there brute be on surface about hundred fifty yard away twisting splashing in midst of boil of pink foam few minute later struggle ceased altogether monster floated quiescent awash dead one of great pectoral fin narrow strip of white belly just showing above surface be terribly afraid that smell of blood of dead carcass must attract other shark to neighbourhood so further imperil cunningham safety for shark be reputed to posse extraordinarily keen scent nothing of kind happened dead shark slowly drifted away be finally lost sight of finished day work without further interruption thus matter went steadily on for fortnight by time have accumulated three hundred eighty thousand oyster have laid out upon island to undergo process of decay in scorching ray of sun that be undergoing that process at very rapid rate olfactory nerve soon informed for odour of became perceptible a early a fourth day while by end of fortnight be so strong a to be scarcely endurable even on oyster bank be about mile to leeward of island although by berthing schooner night right up in weather corner of lagoon managed to avoid getting more than occasional whiff of during hour devoted to rest by end of fortnight however discovered that even accumulation of wealth by scooping up pearl oyster from bottom of sea may become monotonous after while especially when accumulation be for somebody else benefit therefore with one accord petitioned old man brown to give change of occupation by allowing to amuse searching for pearl among rotting fish now covered considerable portion of leeward half of island brown gladly jumped at proposal for be day growing more anxious lest kingfisher crew of tough must heave in sight become troublesome be more than willing to make sure of such spoil a have already accumulated therefore on certain morning instead of getting schooner under way proceeding to oyster bank a usual longboat be hauled alongside attired in very oldest clothes armed with ship bucket provided with plentiful supply of disinfectant cloth to fasten over mouth nostril upon reaching field of action hand of except cook cabin boy got into pulled away for shore air be literally darkened by immense number of bird have returned to island attracted by odour after having be driven off soon saw that few of bolder of have summoned up courage to settle among oyster despite scarecrow have set up took to flight immediately upon approach hovered over day uttering melancholy cry with such persistency creating such volume of sound that must scarcely hear own voice however be there not to talk to work upon stepping ashore first thing did after securing boat be to fill bucket with clean salt water in to wash deposit pearl that might find next swathed mouth nostril with disinfecting cloth then told off by skipper of took row of decaying fish proceeded to search carefully putrid matter for what many people regard a most lovely gem in world there be need for to dilate upon disagreeable not to say disgusting nature of task upon now found engaged may safely be left to imagination of reader will content with merely placing upon record fact that be infinitely worse than even cunningham have anticipated believed that have gauged objectionable character of work pretty accurately so far at least a be concerned soon forgot sickeningly offensive nature of work in interest attaching to for have not be five minute engaged upon when came upon most superb pearl perfectly globular in shape with exquisite sheeny lustre peculiar to gem of be termed first water a nearly a might be inch in diameter find a be more than enough to make forget disagreeableness of work upon be engaged to stimulate curiosity to highest pitch accordingly proceeded with zest within hour have secured round dozen of good sized pearl although none of approached first in size together with sufficient quantity of smaller pearl to fill about one third of ordinary half pint tumbler be first hour of mine exceptionally fortunate one for when knocked off work at end of day total find amounted to le than one hundred seven pearl ranging in size from inch in diameter up to monster measured just over inch quarter while of smaller gem have more than sufficient to fill two tumbler when came to compare note together upon return on board found that be by mean most fortunate one of party skipper total of three of forecastle hand considerably exceeding mine in quantity chapter eight kingfisher of nantucket be on third day of repulsive work among decaying oyster that expected happened be assiduously at work a usual groping with finger among rotting fish for sudden sensation of hardness proclaimed presence of gem when one of party straightening up for moment to take kink out of backbone let out sudden yell of sail ho where away demanded skipper starting to foot staring about in moment hand of be standing up following old man example there be need for reply to skipper question for have to look to see stranger instantly topsail schooner about five mile distant coming up from southward close hauled under press of sail brown stood staring intently at for full minute more then shouted yes be gol darned kingfisher right enough ne'er doubt of hand to boat let get off to marthy must be bit surprised if slocum crowd try to make trouble when find here before why do think so captain demanded cunningham surely there be enough oyster here for of be there well yes reckon there be agreed brown somewhat doubtfully guess slocum wo think so will want whole blamed lot thought rather good remembering a did that previous to arrival before knew how extensive be bed skipper have be straining nerve to reach island before rival with avowed intention of sweeping shoal clean if must before arrival of kingfisher said nothing however seizing bucket containing pearl have gathered during morning hastened away with others toward where longboat be moored moment that last man be in cast off threw out oar gave way for own vessel for stranger be coming up hand over fist brown be very anxious to be on board before arrival of kingfisher in order that might be fully prepared for eventuality reached martha few minute before stranger hove in stay to fetch passage through reef brown at once went below taking with couple of hand routed out arm ammunition chest served out to man gun brace of colt revolver cutlas together with liberal supply of ammunition for firearm at same time instructing to load weapon have ready for instant use to keep out of sight until became apparent that must be required by time that preparation be complete stranger now identifiable beyond question a kingfisher since carried name legibly painted in white letter upon head board have passed through reef taking in canvas a came be steering for berth about cable length from where martha lay few minute later put down helm came head to wind presently let go anchor meanwhile skipper cunningham have be diligently taking stock of through glass with object of ascertaining how many hand carried agreed that there be eight in sight counting also cook steward gave complement of ten told against fourteen of fact caused skipper to chuckle with satisfaction that be not to be kept long in suspense with regard to intention of newcomer soon became sufficiently evident for kingfisher have scarcely swung to anchor when dory be launched with three people in two at oar third sitting in sternsheets came pulling toward martha brown five minute later little craft swept up alongside one of people hospitably dropped rope end into to hang on by man in sternsheets long angular big boned individual about six foot three inch in height apparently about thirty four year of age with thick thatch of reddish brown hair equally thick beard moustache of same colour attired despite intense heat in heavy pilot cloth jacket trouser blue worsted fur cap sea boot reaching above knee uncoiling long limb rose in boat with nimbleness strangely at variance with ungainly appearance climbed side swung in over low rail flung quick enquiring glance round deck mornin ' remarked briefly in surly tone of voice to skipper cunningham a stepped forward to meet see here schooner marthy brown o baltimore o ' 'uns be cap'n of be answered old man stepping forward name of ephraim brown here be first officer mr mark temple be

have took liberty to come aboard ship to ask what happens to be doin here if ai presumin ' too much may ask what business be of your'n cap'n eh um slocum demanded brown blandly cert'nly may retorted slocum with elaborate politeness however vanished next instant wo take second to answer ye continued truculently be business o ' mine because 'ere island everything in sea for three mile round happens to belong to left by deceased brother in law abr'be johnson want wo have hear wo have nobody trespassin ' on property so sooner 'uns git better will be for party now hope understan there be thing by

year so in sing sing want to be hard upon nobody so if will just hand over to pearl that have poached be agreeable to let ye go free say nothin more about say ejaculated brown apparently overwhelmed by such royal clemency well then guess stop minute sure be very near forgettin ' something say that here island yours eh well then s'pose have got title deed to prove eh title deed be began slocum with ugly snarl then pulled up sharp sure have to hum answered natchrally did bring sich vallyable paper along with for fear of losin 'em then again did expect to find nobody here to dispute title see said brown see be solid fact what do see be somethin ' like here be cruisin ' in pacific in here schooner o ' mine one day sight here island come in to have look at lower boat pull ashore what do find find that place be uninhabited with nary sign that anybody ever set eye on before anyway be uninhabited be mile mile away from other land therefore belong to nobody accordin'ly take possession of so see cap'n be wrong about bein ' your'n be mine if be measly cantankerous 'd prob'ly order to take schooner outer harbour at once ai that sorter man be lib'ral free handed to fault ai greedy grab not by long chalk so may stay in here harbour o ' mine so long a have mind to understan ' ai none of yer to go ashore without leave ' oh shuck interrupted slocum in sudden fury what d 'ye mean by givin ' that sort o ' mush tell ye that island be mine mean to have mean to have pearl that have poached too look ' e here mister if ai out o ' sight before will will yes will what demanded skipper calmly seeing that other hesitated why will will blow blamed schooner hand of to blaze exploded slocum will eh retorted brown slipping right hand casually into jacket pocket then hand up skunk hand up look spry about by living jingo will shoot up with 'em say ah be better good deal a slocum slowly reluctantly raised hand above head in response to skipper command emphasised by levelled revolver old man have produced so rapidly that be quite like conjuring trick now mr temple continued brown addressing keeping eye unwaveringly upon prisoner just go to rail persuade two in dory to come up on deck persuade with yer gun if ca do other way guess will have to go on usin ' force now that cantankerous cuss have obliged to begin mr cunnin'ham be good enough to pas word for carpenter to lay aft wi ' three set of iron here say monkey faced old pirate whatcher givin ' whatcher mean by callin ' for iron mean ter say be goin ' to make prisoner of do yer demanded slocum dropping hand in fury hand up snapped skipper quick a lightning then a slocum threw up again replied not goin ' to make prisoner of ye eh bet sure be then hull of crowd since have come here spoilin ' for trouble want trouble ai that sorter man so be goin ' to keep safe in iron until have finished business here a'ter will release ye can do what yer like fust thing will do when release be to blow blamed head off shoulder ye fired pirate snapped slocum viciously put man in iron ordered brown a carpenter came along next minute slocum be fettered chip be overhauling to make sure that have concealed weapon about meanwhile have succeeded in persuading two men who constituted crew of dory to leave boat come up on deck too be promptly clapped in iron thus already have in power three of kingfisher complement of ten men told leaving seven a opposed to own fourteen take away confine 'em below in fore peak ordered brown when be done guess there be sense in makin ' two bite at cherry observed skipper ca spare time to fool around watchin ' feller so have longboat hauled alongside let hand except cook cabin boy take gun cutlass get down into will just meander across take that there kingfisher right away so savin ' heap o ' trouble in long run while be doing that doctor boy will stay here keep eye on chap down below so said so done secured possession of kingfisher without difficulty for although crew guessed errand moment that saw coming must not very well help such weapon a nantucket craft be provided with being stowed away locked up in slocum own cabin where crew must not get at except by breaking down door apart from that have stomach for fighting in absence of slocum surrendered immediately upon being ordered to do so although must be confessed with not too good grace having thus secured possession of kingfisher next thing that did be to give fifty fathom of cable so that must ride easily without being watched in weather that be likely to have after crew having previously be searched deprived of everything must by chance be utilised a weapon be ordered down into longboat taken aboard martha clapped in iron put down below into fore peak along with slocum two men out of dory one of own men being detailed day afterwards to mount guard over while rest of resumed operation ashore cost three week of strenuous work to complete examination of extract pearl from oyster that have taken fortnight to fish up from bottom of sea when have finished even skipper confessed satisfied so great have be success yet although brown be so far satisfied that be content to leave remainder of oyster to slocum must not bring to leave behind empty shell from have extracted pearl pearl shell informed be worth so many dollar forget how many per ton in new york must pay well to take in that have discarding equal weight of ballast carry there task of cleaning carrying on board storing shell including turning out of cargo discharge of ballast to make room for occupied fortnight consequently by time that be done be ready to sail again have be close upon two month at island then upon certain lovely morning loosed set canvas hove short after crew of kingfisher slocum included be brought up on deck ordered over side into longboat transferred to own vessel one man being released from iron a soon a transfer have be effected in order that in turn might release others while be being done longboat returned to martha brown be hoisted in after tripped anchor hove up to bow stood out to sea ensuing three month be more le pleasantly uneventfully spent in cruising hither thither among various group of island seeking sandalwood of native proving exceedingly friendly agreeable to deal with while others be very much reverse by end of time have accumulated very fair quantity of wood brown have arrived at conclusion one more call must about suffice to complete cargo question then arose be where must that call be made for have pretty well completed round of island exhausted capability of supply sandalwood happening to be rather scarce that year while demand for have be unusually brisk frequent experience of ours being that other trader have be beforehand with have taken that islander have for disposal finally while ashore one day on island of tahiti skipper happened to overhear two men discussing sandalwood together one of whom remarked to other that there be still wood to be obtained at island of roua poua one of marquesas group two hour later be under weigh bound for same island now at time marquesas native bore somewhat shady character being said of that be rather inclined to be treacherous when opportunity to be so be afforded therefore when on fourth day out from tahiti sighted roua poua approached island with due precaution man of being fully armed with order to use weapon freely upon slightest provocation be dusk when arrived let go anchor under lee of island by skipper order sail be merely hauled down brailed up a case might be ready for setting again at moment notice while twenty five fathom shackle of cable be kept just inside hawse pipe with pin loosened ready to be knocked out instantly in case must become necessary to slip anchor have scarcely splashed into placid water of bay when a in case of most of other island visited schooner be surrounded by round dozen more canoe manned by from two to five men anxious to be allowed to come alongside barter fruit fish have brought off from shore appeared to be fine stalwart fellow be unarmed so far a must see skipper must not allow of to come alongside that night returned good humouredly enough to shore after have received permission to come off again next morning strict anchor watch be maintained that night canoe came near did anything occur to lead to suppose that native meditated treachery toward when again came off at daylight on following morning although there be something like thirty canoe surrounding schooner manned a before by from two to five men made attempt to force way alongside lay off at distance of two three fathom men holding up ware for inspection shouting merit in singular pidgin pass for english among polynesian when at length brown selected particular canoe assortment of fruit in appeared to be of temptingly varied character ordered owner to come alongside rest instead of exhibiting anger jealousy simply pelted fortunate competitor with good natured chaff taking to paddle headed for shore well knowing that crew of so small craft a martha brown must have custom to spare for more than one well laden canoe even when selected canoe came alongside only two out of crew of four offered to board other two remaining in canoe to pas up a ordered by owner various commodity have for sale commodity by way consisted of fruit of various description egg chicken of astounding skinniness half grown porker price demanded in what skipper termed truck be so ridiculously low that in course of hour lively bargaining completely emptied canoe of content when at bargaining be concluded savage salesman be about to depart turned to skipper asked in particularly good english stop here long cap'n what business be that of your'n sonny retorted brown suspicion suddenly awakened again name oahika not sonny ' cap'n returned savage if schooner stop here oahika like come off day bring plenty fine fruit fresh fis chicken egg oh that be game be observed brown reassured want app'intment of bumboat man in or'nary to here schooner eh oahika reply consisted merely of good humoured grin exhibited remarkably fine set of teeth deeply stained with betel nut probably comprehension of old man brown question be of slenderest skipper however accepted grin a affirmative graciously remarked very well then can come off again to morrow see if want anything else say next time that brings off chicken let be chicken not livin ' skelintons sabby again oahika smiled smile of man who wish to convey impression that sabbys perfectly while in reality doe nothing of kind be right then continued brown now can git away ashore agin a fast a like for be goin ' to be busy here native who probably comprehended skipper gesture better than did word at once turned made toward rail be recalled by brown who enquired in offhand casual sort of way say oah what be name happen to have sandalwood ashore there s'pose sandalwood repeated savage think man got leetle want sandalwood cap'n well guess must do with little if there be goin cheap returned skipper like ask man come see cap'n demanded oahika well yes guess may replied skipper ask to come off to morrow mornin ' bringin ' wood with 'em tell that if be willin ' to let go cheap will buy off 'em savage intimated in own peculiar fashion that must afford much pleasure to perform trifling service for esteemed friend patron then took leave grinning with apparent satisfaction at result of morning work skipper stood watching progress of canoe until have nearly reached shore then turned to remarked guess there be be mistake somewhere about here marquesas native seem to to be so very partic'lar treacherous how do strike why said have be amusing by very closely watching two who be aboard be bound to admit that behaviour seemed quite unexceptionable mean continued noticing slightly puzzled look on companion face seemed to behave pretty much like native of most of other island have visited except that did not attempt to steal anything yep guess noticed that too observed skipper well continued will just go on keepin ' eye open for bit reckon upon findin up agin anything so very serious in here island brown have given chocolate coloured visitor to understand that be to have busy day aboard schooner a matter of fact that statement be merely attempt to bluff native bluffing having latterly become almost instinctive act with skipper however although have nothing very particular to do at least made show of great industry easing up overhauling rigging renewing chafing mat so on brown notion being to convey to native idea that have called in to overhaul refit rather than that be in quest of sandalwood by ruse think hoped to get wood at somewhat cheaper rate than usual on following morning oahika crew came off to again bringing more fruit small quantity of vegetable about dozen egg two animated barn door skeleton skipper positively refused to purchase at price with came four other canoe of have eight ten stick of sandalwood in hullo exclaimed skipper when saw display what in nation do mean by bringin ' off scrap be to show sort o ' stuff that have to sell wonder hi to oahika what have feller brought off wood for sandalwood explained savage want sell dem wood sell ejaculated skipper sell why there ai enough wood there to light fire with be that that have got because there ai enough there to make worth while to open out truck ' must give one bandanner handkercher for whole measly lot oahika conferred with friend for while then turned to skipper man say explained that dem wood got cut plenty more yonder pointing generally toward shore say s'pose want more wood go behore show dem how much want man cut for well be jiggered exclaimed skipper explosively if 'd have ' knowed that few twig be that lazy skunk have got cut d think 'd have ' brought marthy way out of road to buy sirree not by jugful continued wrath subsiding a rapidly a have blazed up seein ' that be here s'pose best thing for to do will be to go ashore have look at there wood see if kin strike bargain on 't event if do will be able to choose best wood have 'nstead of buyin ' just blamed stuff that like to bring off to do think will be wise to trust ashore alone with fellow asked must remember that have seen very little of thus far will be well to keep in mind too fact that have rather unenviable reputation for treachery why not order so many canoe load of wood from let go at well guess not answered skipper if do that will work off worst stuff on will just have to take go without reckon will go ashore pick own wood then will know that be gettin full vally for money wo go alone guess will take two hand with will go fully armed believe in takin ' unnecessary risk agreed there be sense in sort of thing who will take with must care to have mr cunningham with guess not answered brown with decision will take mr cunnin'ham one o ' foremast hand with will stay here mr temple look a'ter ship guess will go right now then will be able to get back in time for dinner now let see will have mr cunnin'ham for one a said yes joe maybury will do very well for t'other just give two instruction mr temple will ye will be ready to go in ten minute guess will go in jollyboat found cunningham explained situation to be naturally delighted at idea of having run ashore warned to keep weather eye lifting to take couple of fully loaded revolver with a well a plenty of cartridge cutlas then found maybury gave similar instruction winding up by telling off three more men to go in jollyboat bring back a soon a have landed passenger ten minute later little expedition started stood watched a pulled away for beach accompanied by five canoe have come off to hour earlier a drew in toward shore perceived with momentary qualm of uneasiness that considerable number of native be turning out to meet upon bringing ship telescope to bear upon beach uneasiness be to considerable extent dissipated for then saw that crowd be largely composed of woman child while so far a must see none of men carried anything resembling weapon also be unable to detect sign of hostility excitement on face of native on contrary appeared to be smiling with utmost good humour a cunningham stepped out of boat saw one cafe au lait coloured young minx dart forward laughingly throw garland of gay tinted flower round neck screech of delight with achievement be greeted reached ear even where be good half mile from beach laughing shouting crowd then closed in upon newcomer once again became trifle anxious presently caught glimpse of cunningham smiling countenance in midst of crowd minute two later skipper bodyguard emerged accompanied by sandalwood merchant walked off up footpath vanished among tree within fifty yard of shore then to annoyance native gathered round boat crew instead of returning forthwith a have instructed to do laid in oar stepped out of on to sand proceeded interestedly to inspect various article savage seemed to be urging to purchase a continued to watch through glass saw first one of men then emerge from crowd go to boat carefully deposit something probably curio of kind in sternsheets then rejoin laughing gesticulating throng went on for something like twenty minute by end of time patience be quite exhausted directed one of hand to get out ensign bend on to main signal halyard while went below to get gun intending to hoist ensign at same time fire gun in air a signal of recall to recalcitrant boat crew when returned on deck with loaded weapon be just in time to see entire crowd retiring up pathway leaving boat abandoned on shore with about foot of forefoot hauled up on beach painter made fast to one of stretcher have be thrust like peg for about length into sand man who be standing by to hoist ensign grinned a caught eye guess three joker have toddled off up to village said have doubt did not like appearance of thing at former suspicion rushed back with redoubled force hoist away ensign said curtly a man began to pull upon halyard lifted gun to shoulder pointing well out to seaward pulled trigger by time that smoke cleared away not native be to be seen chapter nine treachery first feeling be one of simple annoyance with three men who constituted boat crew because have permitted to be cajoled into visiting village leaving boat unprotected upon beach instead of returning to ship immediately after landing skipper a have instructed to do when full hour have elapsed with sign of return of truant annoyance began to give place to feeling of rapidly growing anxiety when hour grew to two with still sign of absentee anxiety merged into feeling of downright alarm nay more than alarm into conviction that something very serious have happened now found in exceedingly awkward predicament for while felt that something ought to be done must not for life of decide what that something must be two alternative suggested one being to arm hand to teeth launch gig go ashore to investigate while other be to remain aboard prepare schooner in possible way to repel attack at same time to have everything ready for flight at moment notice if need be former be undoubtedly proper thing to do if one be to act upon assumption that native have seized white men who have landed be holding a prisoner assumption be scarcely justified by reputation marquesas native have earned for story in circulation with regard to being to effect that be custom promptly to kill eat unfortunate white who chanced to fall into hand if six men who have be decoyed ashore morning be already dead nothing be to be gained by landing remainder of martha crew except infliction upon native of sharp punishment at considerable amount of risk to ourselves of further loss in pitched battle must assuredly ensue also there be possibility nay more very strong probability that while be busily engaged on shore in attempt to administer salutary chastisement for betrayal of shipmate party of native might board unprotected schooner slip cable run ashore then where must be with mean of retreat excepting boat must doubtless also be seized if must only get hold of native ascertain from what have become of absentee must know what to do for if missing men be merely prisoner must be fully justified in taking risk of attempting to rescue if on other hand be already dead question of punishment might very well be left until more fitting moment now there be not solitary native to be seen anywhere in opinion be decidedly bad sign arrival of noon by hour skipper fully expected to be back aboard ship be not found still undecided upon question of landing have so far made up mind have determined to arm hand put schooner into a efficient state of defence a possible accordingly gave order to have arm ammunition chest brought on deck instructed man there be only eight of told now to arm with cutlas brace of fully loaded revolver also to have loaded gun where must put hand upon at moment notice next caused fore aft canvas to be loosed downhauls cast off halyard ready for hoisting away at moment notice when order have be duly executed seemed to that have done everything be possible yet schooner be still in very defenceless condition so far a resisting simultaneous attack of several hundred determined native be concerned might empty firearm upon if shot told be most unlikely in excitement attendant upon attack must kill wound precisely fifty six of after eight of must be fighting hand to hand with remainder who must outnumber by at least twenty to one probably twice that number what chance must have under such condition a absolutely none at if now be possible to raise schooner bulwark to render unclimbable in way a considered thought of trawl net skipper have brought along for purpose of dredging up pearl oyster occurred to instantly decided that might with little ingenuity be converted into excellent boarding netting be made of extra stout hemp line to resist cutting action of oyster shell over be proposed to be dragged also to bring up good heavy load without bursting at once recognised that if there be enough of to trice up round schooner believed there be might serve to keep native off deck long enough to enable to give so severe punishing a to cool ardour effectually ultimately beat off idea be too good not to be utilised at once gave instruction to have net immediately routed out brought on deck be big heavy affair took eight of best part of hour to clear out of sail room get on deck when at length have done so at once saw that with certain amount of cutting contriving might be made to serve new purpose very excellently forthwith hand of fell upon by eight bell in afternoon watch have converted into exceedingly efficient boarding net then triced up felt that at last be ready for whatever fate native might have in store for meanwhile jollyboat still lay abandoned upon beach sign of crew of skipper two companion have be seen have strictest scrutiny with aid of ship telescope revealed indication of native ashore in fact so far a appearance alone be concerned island might have be uninhabited continued absence of shipmate now prolonged far beyond reasonable limit left doubt in of mind that something very seriously wrong have happened to for circumstance that be in complete ignorance a to what that happening really be hope that of at least might still be alive must at once have got schooner under way gone to sea to do be impossible while fate be still in doubt for not even to ensure own safety against attack that be convinced be impending must do must amount to abandonment of possibly living white men to mercy of savage with tricing up securing of boarding netting preparation for defence of schooner be completed to best of ability now remained be for to sit down passively await event in present case meant attack by savage at moment after darkness have fallen sufficiently to conceal movement that might be a fully prepared a possible gave instruction for advancement of supper hour so that might partake of meal while there be still light enough to enable to see surroundings after busied about general straightening up of deck removal of unnecessary hamper in order that if fight must might at least fight with clear deck fortunately for night fell fine clear with brilliant starlight enabled to see round ship for distance of about couple of hundred yard inshore of shadow of island lay jet black upon surface of water completely hiding evidence of movement in direction even when attempted to probe blackness with night glass therefore be obliged to trust quite a much to ear a to eye for warning of approach of enemy even did not help much for island be small one thunder of surf upon weather shore borne to with almost startling distinctness mingled with sough of wind among tree lap of ripple alongside making with combination of sound that effectually screened such movement a launching of canoe distant dip of paddle foresaw that be likely to be wakeful night for for with heavy load of responsibility upon young shoulder must not possibly have slept even upon bed of down therefore instructed men to bring bed on deck snatch such rest a might come to while kept lookout also made point of striking ship bell regularly half hour in faint hope that if savage must be brought to realise that be upon alert might after decide not to risk attack with incredible slowness laggard moment passed second dog watch came to end then still more slowly a seemed to impatience first one then two three four so on up to eight bell of first watch be tolled out still there be sign of enemy while be continuously padding round deck in pair of old felt soled slipper effectually silenced footstep upon planking pausing for moment at half dozen step to peer anxiously in vain into shadow of island for indication of movement finally four bell of middle watch arrived passage be duly recorded by stroke of ship bell meanwhile stress of day anxiety combined with continuous monotonous perambulation of deck doubt assisted by soft coolness of offshore breeze laden with odour of earth vegetation constant booming sound of distant surf be beginning to tell upon jarred nerve have become steady breathing have become deep regular limb be growing weary eyelid began occasionally to droop in short be beginning to feel fatigued in need of sleep then be evidently moment at to attempt to snatch little rest be debating within of men must call to relieve rather of must best trust to keep alert lookout when fancied caught just for instant out of corner of eye faint silvery gleam a of phosphorescence of disturbed water deep in heart of darkest shadow in direction of beach looked more closely presently saw again time quite distinctly rippling moon like gleam of water disturbed a might be by launching of boat canoe yes there be mistake about there be undoubtedly movement of sort in there even a came to conclusion saw thing repeated twice thrice five six time with space of few yard between be enough at last savage be on move in moment fatigue fell from like garment be once again incarnation of alertness without making sound glided along deck in old soft slipper laying hand lightly upon sleeper shoulder murmured in ear enemy be under way go to station a noiselessly a possible taking gun with fire until give word by time have awakened little band have seen man at proper station have become perfectly apparent that eight canoe be stealing slowly out toward from beach for although be still enveloped in deep shadow be being paddled so cautiously that not faintest suspicion of sound must be heard be possible for to see distinctly in midst of blackness eight separate point of disturbance indicated by short wavering line of phosphorescent light marking slight ripple created by gentle passage of object through water in addition to occasional small luminous swirl indicated stealthy dip of paddle in water at infrequent interval excessive caution with be making approach seemed to suggest intention on part of savage to get a near a possible to schooner unobserved with probably quick dash at end to cover last hundred foot so of water crouching low behind bulwark levelling ship night glass over rail kept instrument slowly sweeping athwart advancing line of craft at length saw eight large canoe gradually take shape a drew imperceptibly out of heart of deepest shadow endeavoured to count number of occupant soon found to be impossible in dim light made rough guess however came to conclusion that there be at least twenty in canoe be evident therefore that despite superiority in matter of weapon there be desperate struggle in store for waited patiently until canoe have approached near enough to enable to distinguish loom of with unaided eye then springing up on wheel grating suddenly hailed canoe ahoy keep off there if attempt to come nearer will open fire upon complete cessation of paddling immediately followed hail possibly savage be trifle chagrined to discover that be on alert perhaps did not fully understand what have said although did not believe that for most of south sea native knew enough of english to enable englishman to make understood be that a may paused long enough to enable to call to little band of defender final instruction fire lad said until can see mark distinctly then aim carefully make shot tell much will depend upon effect of first volley must therefore make a deadly a possible low murmur of comprehension arose from scanty crew ranged at wide interval along schooner port rail that being side native be approaching before anything more must be said loud shout in voice tone of seemed somehow familiar to arose from one of canoe be instantly answered by yell that from volume of sound must have emanated from throat of nearly quite two hundred savage then without further attempt at concealment whole host of paddle suddenly dashed into water lashing into long swirling line of luminous foam with loud cry of mutual encouragement from occupant eight big canoe surged forward came rushing through water at schooner keep cool men shouted above din pick mark aim into thick of load fire a many time a can before can get alongside forthwith led off with shot aimed straight at centre of dark mass represented nearest canoe at moment distant about two hundred fifty yard aim be true bullet must have found double mark for two distinct shriek responded bare moment before ragged volley of seven shot rang out from rest of defender more shriek followed discharge did not stop rush of canoe now came sweeping toward like so many steamer meanwhile be busily engaged in slipping cartridge into breach of piece calculating upon being able to get in two more shot before savage arrived alongside so a matter of fact did a also did of others with disastrous result for savage if shriek followed upon discharge be to be accepted a criterion apart from that there be noticeable wavering hesitation on part of crew of two three of canoe after third discharge hesitation be only momentary then rascal gripped courage afresh drove canoe alongside four dashing up on port side remaining four essaying to board to starboard when canoe be within about four five fathom of schooner side with good way upon savage suddenly laid in paddle rising to foot hurled heavy shower of spear at one of flew harmlessly over head luckily for then heavy night air suddenly became vibrant with medley of harsh discordant sound compounded of yell shriek of savage fierce ejaculation of own people quick snapping explosion of revolver gasping groan of wounded a native swarmed up low side suddenly found confronted by barrier of improvised boarding net through mesh of lad pointed revolver thrust furiously with cutlass while savage unavailingly strove to tear stout strand apart make opening through to pas thrust at in turn with spear suddenly in dim starlight a be busily reloading revolver saw cook emerge from galley with what looked like bucket in hand with quick twirl seemed to throw content of bucket through net just where savage be crowding thickest on other side of next instant there arose more than usually piercing chorus of shriek while great bulk of savage at particular point appeared to melt away suddenly heard heavy impact of number of body falling headlong into canoe alongside doctor paused moment apparently to note effect of experiment then hastily returned to galley presently emerging again repeating former tactic with similar result subsequently learned that when became known that attack of savage might be certainly looked for cook have lighted rousing fire in galley filled copper with mixture of slush salt water brought whole to boil so arranging matter that mixture be in state of furious ebullition by time savage arrived alongside wherever black pressed thickest most determinedly there cooky intervened with bucketful of scalding stuff very effectively distributed over naked body of round dozen so of assailant by giving bucket neat twirl at instant of discharge despite effective aid thus rendered matter be on whole going rather badly for for two american forecastle hand be by time down transfixed by spear pinned to deck while sailmaker be punctured bleeding freely sail having received bad prick in left shoulder while spear have passed completely through fleshy part of right thigh in addition to party of savage by concentrating effort upon one particular spot have contrived to make hole in net be rapidly enlarging of last fact be happily unaware a indeed be of critical character of situation generally for be forward where murdock ex boatswain of zenobia be in charge that matter be going so badly while aft where be be doing pretty well murdock be not sort of man to be discouraged because for moment happened to be getting worst of on contrary be just that state of thing stirred to extra effort did so now perceiving that unless something be done to prevent effectively savage must soon force way through net thereafter make short work of hand of murdock set wit going presently thought out plan immediately proceeded to put into operation seizing half empty case of revolver ammunition broke open about dozen cartridge arranged powder in little heap at bottom of case burying one end of length of extemporised fuse in heap then piled cartridge on top of heap placed case on windlass bitt ignited free end of fuse rushed aft yelling to to throw flat upon face a did so so urgent be call that instinctively obeyed there lay for perhaps ten fifteen second while savage seeing weak point suddenly deserted swarmed about in greatly augmented number finally enlarging hole in net to extent at length be big enough to permit passage of man when one after began to force way through be at precise moment that spark of burning fuse reached powder of course instantly blew up igniting hundred so of cartridge remained in case scattering bullet in in direction there be quick flash of ignited powder immediately followed by cracker like report of exploding cartridge horrible chorus of yell shriek of wounded men then sudden complete silence for space of perhaps dozen breath then came renewed groan outcry a injured men felt first smart of wound followed by sudden wailing cry with one accord panic stricken savage flung back into canoe seized paddle headed for shore in frantic haste being presently sped upon way by bullet poured into midst a long a remained in sight then not until then laid aside weapon mopped perspiration powder grime from streaming brow bound up other wound went forward to inspect result of murdock little experiment have be exceedingly effective for scattered round spot where explosion have occurred found le than nineteen savage of whom eleven be dead five be more le severely wounded three appeared to be only stunned three promptly proceeded to bind hand foot during operation discovered that one of trio be none other than friend oahika bumboat man in or'nary a skipper have styled be especially glad that particular rascal have fallen into hand for during progress of fight have frequently caught sight of by light afforded by flash of revolver have noticed that be taking exceptionally prominent part in proceeding while one two circumstance have also noticed led to suspect that might possibly be person of importance among native of roua poua now a with assistance of three lantern proceeded with investigation really desperate character of struggle in have so recently be engaged began to be borne in upon for in addition to nineteen who have fallen victim to boatswain contrivance found scattered about ship twenty six dead thirty three more le wounded native while others with whom shark be already busy be floating in water near ship a for ourselves have lost two foremast hand of american while remainder of with solitary exception of cook have scratch to show own sailmaker being fortunately only wound must be reasonably termed serious while even be of comparatively little moment provided that gangrene did not supervene now native having be beaten off next task be to straighten up after fight beginning be made by throwing dead except own two overboard where shark might be safely trusted to see to speedy disposal then overhauled wounded savage such of a have received only trifling hurt might therefore perhaps yet give trouble if be not careful bound securely while others laid out on deck then proceeded to doctor up a well a mean very limited surgical knowledge permitted be while be thus busily engaged that boatswain happening to straighten back for moment cast alert glance across water toward shore suddenly stood rigid staring then remarked to in low tone of voice just look over there for minute mr temple ai that canoe somethin ' headin ' way looked in direction indicated at once sighted small shapeless blot of deeper blackness in shadow enshrouded whole of west side of island if be canoe be certainly very small craft moreover be not coming from direction of beach from point apparently about mile to north of stood watching for full minute more then caught now familiar phosphorescent gleam of water indicated presence of moving object yes said certainly be canoe murdock seems to be only very small affair such a need give very serious amount of anxiety will keep eye upon for minute two see what be after perhaps be messenger from native coming off to treat with for surrender of wounded hope may be because then will perhaps learn what have become of skipper rest of missing men a canoe continued to approach observed certain eccentricity in behaviour for instead of progressing in straight line course be decided zigzag now heading one way now to extent of about four point of compass still looked a though be aiming for schooner for general direction of approach be toward procured night glass brought to bear upon be then able to distinguish that be indeed exceedingly diminutive craft containing only one figure who seemed to be sitting in stern be paddling somewhat awkwardly first on one side of then on other probably accounted for eccentricity of movement furthermore a continued to watch certain suggestion of familiarity grew upon in connection with appearance action of paddling figure finally when canoe have approached to within about hundred fathom of schooner put down glass hailed canoe ahoy what canoe be that hillo be that temple came reply in cunningham well known voice ay ay replied be right enough glad be to see that be right do happen to know anything about skipper got here in bottom of canoe be reply poor old chap be rather badly hurt be afraid con found canoe why wo wretched thing go straight be because understand how to handle expect replied do know anything about three men who took ashore yesterday answered cunningham did return to ship did not be very much afraid that will never set eye upon again phew whistled cunningham be bad news although be not very greatly surprised to hear after way that beggar ashore behaved hillo what be why say temple there be dead native floating about out here what be meaning of that mean that determined attempt to capture schooner be made about two hour ago be very near being successful said do mean to say that did not hear rumpus not sound of answered cunningham of course may be accounted for by one can talk about later just heave rope end there be good chap say how be going to get skipper up on deck be rather badly hurt ca manage without assistance be afraid canoe be by time close aboard of few second later be brought alongside with aid of line hove to cunningham then dropped lightly over side into to see what must be done to help brown who time have remained perfectly silent found propped up in eye of little craft when stooped over saw that eye be closed a though slept according to cunningham be not sleep be insensibility resulting from blow on head with heavy club in case poor old fellow be obviously quite unable to help therefore took rope end have thrown to cunningham made standing bowline in end of passed under skipper arm then sang out to on deck to hoist away gently while cunningham helped by lifting thus presently managed to get brown first on deck then down into own stateroom where cunningham who claimed to posse certain amateurish skill knowledge in medicine surgery at once took in hand while returned to deck assisted others in task of straightening up generally by time have finished young dawn be paling eastern sky island from being mere shapeless black shadow have changed to deep neutral tinted almost black silhouette a clear sharp of outline a though have be cut out of paper equally dark reflection trembling on surface of water coming going almost a far out a where schooner lay at anchor then even a stood watching pallor brightened to clear pale tint of purest primrose presently flushed into warm delicate orange hue long shaft of white light shot straight up toward zenith instant later topmast branch of tree crowned island became edged with thin hair line of burning gold spread with marvellous rapidity north south until limb trunk glowed with finally level beam of golden light flashed through dense clump of foliage crowned highest point of island next instant same clump became swallowed up lost in great dazzling palpitating blaze of golden light be body of rising sun colour of island changed from neutral tint to deep sepia from to innumerable subtle tone of olive green a light grew stronger mass of foliage separated from other became distinct until shape of became perfectly defined took proper place in picture while magical colour change be in progress deep shadow marked junction of land water dissolved until beach once more emerged into view with jollyboat still hauled up on where have be left on previous day round about to left right eight big canoe undoubtedly have be used in attack upon schooner few hour earlier while still stood gazing entranced at beauty of new day cunningham emerged from companion way joined well said will be glad to hear that think will pull poor old skipper through after started to give thorough overhaul a soon a left found that murdering thief of native have literally cracked poor old chap skull for also found that tiny splinter of bone have be driven inward upon brain by force of blow splinter succeeded in extracting with result that emerged from state of coma after have properly dressed wound went to sleep chapter ten lose skipper be delighted to hear said for have paid dearly enough already for folly in coming to island without being called upon to pay additional penalty of poor old chap life have lost two of number in attack upon ship while three hand who took ashore yesterday be missing by by where be maybury dead poor chap be sorry to say murdered by treacherous scoundrel of native answered cunningham way of be when landed be immediately surrounded by mob of black just for moment have shadowy suspicion that thing be not quite that ought to be a looked round saw that native be unarmed moreover be smiling apparently in best of temper indeed one of girl flung garland of flower round neck a joke sign of goodwill did quite know so took for granted that be friendly disposed got laughing joking together then skipper maybury gradually worked way through crowd accompanied by men who have wood to sell walked up through village seemed to be inhabited chiefly by naked little piccaninny playing in sand with dog woman village be about quarter of mile in length beyond there be about twenty acre of cleared ground planted with manioc cassava corn fruit tree principally banana beyond be virgin forest toward made way entering followed bush path for about quarter of mile until reached small open space have scarcely entered when three pretended sandalwood merchant simultaneously turned upon uttering terrific yell seized of by arm tried to confine behind back taken unawares though be struggled fiercely to throw off particular assailant beggar be big sinewy chap with muscle like steel ere must wrench clear about dozen other black sprang into enclosure evidently in response to shout raised by captor before well knew what be happening found upon ground with three four savage sitting upon while others be binding hand foot while be still struggling heard pop of revolver twice report being so close together that knew at once must have come from different weapon next instant heard dull crack groan fall of two heavy body upon dry leaf twig carpeted floor of open space where struggle have taken place then when captor have effectually secured limb raised to foot saw skipper lying face downward about yard away with head bare small stream of blood trickling from clotting among grey hair while close to lay maybury on back quite dead with long spear driven right through heart black turned skipper over examined closely then finding that be not dead held sort of consultation in own language purport of of course must not gather end of be that hoisted of upon shoulder carried back to village thrust into one of hut where lay untended for remainder of day practically whole of last night then time about small hour think must have be girl who proved to be same who have flung garland of flower round neck stole into hut a silently a ghost laid finger upon lip to indicate suppose be not to talk deftly proceeded to cast adrift bond after proceeded vigorously to chafe ankle wrist in order to restore circulation have be practically suspended by tightness with ligature have be bound look here temple if must ever chance to have enemy have fancy to torture just bind wrist ankle tightly together leave for few hour be well when feeling have come back into limb bit must move without screaming girl produced food drink although in least know what be ate drank freely then in curious pidgin ' lingo that people use when conversing with white men girl gave to understand that life that of skipper be in greatest jeopardy that if did not want particularly to die must buck up save skipper then taking command bade lift old man by shoulder while took foot in fashion slipped out of hut seeing nobody made way slowly through wood until emerged upon little beach just on other side of headland then drew out from among bush small canoe in bottom of helped to place skipper after with warning to to be exceedingly careful to make noise handed paddle thrust canoe afloat vanished well be now may a well pitch yarn of share of night doings if one may venture to judge by appearance seem to have have fairly lively time out here have can assure said then proceeded to give cunningham detailed account of have happened during absence of skipper have scarcely finished when cabin boy came up with intimation that breakfast be ready in cabin accordingly went below seated ourselves fell to did not dally long over meal for there be still plenty to be done thought about before returning to deck remarked to cunningham must like to look in see how skipper be getting on entered stateroom together to surprise found that old chap be awake seemingly feeling not very much worse for hard knock on head have received indeed wanted to turn out dress go on deck cunningham who have assumed role of surgeon must not hear of such thing must not even permit brown to leave bunk so a compromise just have to sit down spin whole yarn of adventure over again to poor old fellow seemed very much cut up when learned that have lost six men of compatriot of too bitterly reproached for having come to island at of course comforted a well a must by pointing out to that happening be due not so much to want of precaution on part a to exceeding guile of native then led conversation round to prisoner asked what proposed to do with cunningham be for taking law into own hand inflicting upon salutary lesson by hanging one of at yardarm for of people who have be murdered brown must not hear of be three still discussing matter when cabin boy came down with message from murdock to say that large canoe have just be launched from beach be heading for schooner must be pleased to go on deck of course instantly obeyed call for first idea be that attack be possibly impending when got on deck found that canoe although large one be manned by only four native who be approaching very slowly apparently with considerable amount of trepidation that large palm leaf be conspicuously displayed in bow of craft latter being a interpreted intended to serve purpose of flag of truce naturally at once assumed weapon saw that firearm be fully loaded placed handy for use lest further treachery must be contemplated then hailed canoe informed occupant that if have anything to say to might approach within easy speaking distance that be not to attempt to come alongside without permission that if such attempt be made must at once be fired upon that there might be misunderstanding upon point flourished loaded gun in sight to show that be quite prepared to carry out threat slowly hesitatingly canoe continued to approach schooner until have arrived within about twenty fathom of then crew backed water brought craft to standstill short consultation among next followed then one of number rose to foot hailed master shouted got three man ashore belong man got belong yes replied have eight of people on board here be white men unhurt be answer get hurt leettle bit not much black man along not hurt eh three of be unhurt others be wounded so can walk what for not bring off white man with demanded adopting peculiar mode of speech under mistaken impression must thus make better understood white man can walk too answered interlocutor suppose want bring off give eight black fellow belong eh so be exchange of prisoner that have come off to negotiate appeared well be more than willing to make exchange did not care to appear too eager so temporised by enquiring a to nature extent of white men hurt must not must not reply in manner be perfectly intelligible to matter seemed to be approaching deadlock when one of canoe men started to foot in eager impatient manner asked master suppose got oahika aboard eh enquiry went good way toward confirming opinion that rascal be person of importance yes replied got oahika right not hurt one little bit then with vague idea of trying effect of bluff continued great blackguard scoundrel attack schooner last night kill two white man by by hang up there until go dead pointed to schooner lower yardarm yell of anguish immediately followed announcement of mine fully confirming in belief that oahika be likely to prove valuable asset if properly manipulated next moment however one of men jumped up shouted mine believe got oahika suppose yes show eh murdock simpson shouted just hoist that swab oahika up on foot take to rail so that fellow in canoe may see be done moment that fellow head shoulder appeared above top of schooner low bulwark loud howl arose from crew of canoe who incontinently flung down on knee began to kow tow energetically be quickly interrupted by oahika who shouted angrily at then a soon a have secured attention proceeded to gabble to long string of what seemed to be instruction in language quite unintelligible to when have finished occupant of canoe waved hand a if to indicate that understood then seized paddle began to sweep canoe head round toward shore sudden change of front rather puzzled did not quite know what to make of might mean anything thought among other thing might mean that oahika have given instruction to muster available fighting man in village island renew attack upon schooner so hailed hastily departing canoe hillo there canoe ahoy where be going what be about to do men ceased paddling for moment one of flourished hand toward island get back along ashore plenty quick bring three man belong then give oahika eh announced bring three white man then will see retorted listen if bring more of own men with will shoot oahika dead sabby threat uttered upon spur of moment seemed to disconcert very decidedly for remained inactive staring other in face also seemed to disconcert oahika for sooner have finished speaking than began to shout long string of further direction to canoe men replied from time to time by waving hand finally brought communication to end with few word from intonation of voice might have be injunction to men to hurry up away canoe sped toward shore a soon a have gone went down below reported to skipper who now seemed to be not quite so well a have be hour earlier be naturally very pleased to learn that three men whom have believed to be dead be still alive instructed to make best term must for ransom a soon a have secured possession of boat to get schooner under way proceed to sea without further delay canoe have be gone about three quarter of hour when watching shore through ship telescope perceived slight stir upon beach presently became aware that small party of native have gathered about jollyboat pushed off from beach making fast painter to stern of canoe then other native appeared bearing in grass hammock three missing seaman who be laid in sternsheets of jollyboat finally canoe be manned apparently by same four native who have previously come off in headed for schooner whereupon gave order for windlass to be manned cable to be hove short ready for tripping anchor at moment notice be done by time canoe be once more within hailing distance cable be so taut up down single additional revolution of windlass barrel must break out anchor free from ground now came really difficult part of negotiation with savage for being superlatively unscrupulous deceitful naturally suspected of being same must not come alongside render up possession of jollyboat three wounded seaman whom carried until on part have released oahika flatly refused to do feeling that a likely a not must play scurvy trick a soon a have recovered possession of man who now very strongly suspected be paramount chief of island if not at least chief of very considerable importance argued stipulated made counter stipulation to purpose finally once more arrived at deadlock of course might very easily have settled matter by shooting four native in canoe must have be act of very blackest treachery be strongly of opinion that be just such treacherous conduct on part of certain unscrupulous white men have made native of of polynesian island cruel treacherous wretch that have become therefore once more resorted to bluff by hailing saying that unless came alongside at once surrendered possession of boat in must get schooner under way proceed to sea taking oahika rest of prisoner with to make threat more effective turned away gave order to man windlass be enough with first clank of windlass pawl oahika who have thus far taken part in second palaver let out yell at men in canoe caused to surrender instantly at discretion rush craft up alongside schooner now determined upon bold thing roua poua savage have caused vast amount of trouble loss through be short handed to extent of le than six men felt that for sake of own satisfaction self respect must get something though be ever so little back out of therefore since white men be armed therefore in position to take good care of ourselves a soon a tackle be hooked into jollyboat ringbolts ordered four savage in canoe to leave come on deck to help to hoist in boat did in state of most abject fear trembling then sent for'ard to windlass to assist in breaking out anchor be not until schooner be actually adrift that permitted to begin transfer of wounded from martha deck to canoe displayed remarkably little consideration for comfort wellbeing of comrade in performance of duty indeed have always be of opinion have be foolish enough to liberate oahika before others have be transhipped canoemen must have incontinently made off at top speed for shore leaving others sound wounded alike upon hand at mercy be careful to keep oahika until last be not until schooner be fairly under way heading out to sea cast adrift permitted to go over side did in splutter of mingled wrath fear pouring out long string of what be probably native curse a seized steering paddle violently thrust canoe off schooner side by midday be bowling merrily away to westward under rag that must set roua poua have sunk out of sight beneath eastern horizon long before however in fact moment that be safely aboard comfortably bestowed in bunk cunningham have taken three wounded seaman in hand when have done that must for came up on deck reported to be afraid said that there be not much hope for three with jerk of thumb in direction of forecastle sullivan halpin have have skull cracked by blow inflicted with war club case be very similar to of skipper worse while poor glenn have le than eleven spear wound in body though none of be very serious in heat make terribly afraid of gangrene however have done can for at present must just hope for best glenn tell that after skipper have left native came swarming round exciting curiosity by exhibiting curio of various kind for sale barter rather at ridiculously cheap price so enticing away from beach toward village where be informed really valuable article might be seen then when arrived at village be suddenly set upon before have time to draw weapon overpowered confined in hut where be left day yesterday last night without food water with injury untended be afraid there be not much hope for poor fellow be bad news so very bad indeed that felt duty to go forthwith to skipper report matter to ask for instruction own idea being that ought to head for samoa tonga group procure properly qualified medical assistance with a little delay a possible when got down below began to talk to old man soon found that be for inscrutable reason utterly opposed to such idea must not give reason positively forbade to do a have suggested instructing instead to work out great circle track to canton to get ship upon proper course at once a seemed to be in full possession of faculty to know quite well what be talking about have alternative to obey indeed so far a saving three men in forecastle be concerned might a well have be heading for canton a anywhere else for halpin glenn died within couple of hour of other same night while sullivan lingered only twenty six hour longer looked forward to speedy pleasant run to canton for reckoned upon carrying trade with practically way be unfortunate for after fine run of nine day to northward westward ran into belt of equatorial calm in latitude degree south for fully three week thereafter encountered such extraordinary weather that dared not ship fin from fear of having carried away of badly straining schooner for instead of long spell of calm one usually expects in latitude quiet weather generally lasted hour two then be succeeded by such furious squall for most part must hing run before under bare pole perhaps most exasperating part of be that squall blew mostly from westward nearly dead in teeth so that be only toward tail end of just when be dying out that be able to bring little hooker to wind for hour so make few mile of northing when be not blowing with hurricane strength be usually just opposite flat calm with black lowering overcast sky moist steamy overpowering heat heavy storm of thunder lightning torrential downpour of tepid rain by way enabled to re fill water tank cask waterspout ad libitum constantly threatening with destruction be month to day from date of departure from roua poua when at length cleared calm belt got first breath of north east trade in latitude degree minute north longitude degree minute west having be driven back almost a far east a christmas island by baffling wind furious squall with have be obliged to contend brought dangerous marwill group right athwart track therefore poor old skipper being still unwell quite unfit for duty decided to make good stretch to northward say a far a latitude degree north before bearing up for canton by doing must have clear sea before for remainder of trip have spoken of skipper a being unwell quite unfit for duty that scarcely conveys correct impression of condition fact be that be well enough to be up about on deck be constantly worried with headache of most distracting kind what be still worse intellect seemed to be failing suffered from frequent total lapse of memory stopping short in midst of conversation simply because forgot in moment what be talking about be subject from time to time to hallucination when must assure with utmost gravity that be king of england taking holiday incognito re incarnation of morgan pirate something else equally ridiculous while at other time must be perfectly rational for first two three week while symptom be in process of development caused cunningham very considerable amount of anxiety for be constantly dreading new departure must render dangerous to to others at length a be unable to detect such tendency grew easier in mind just allowing to wander about ship at own sweet will amuse by giving most extraordinary order nobody ever even pretended to carry out came to conclusion that be suffering from obscure form of concussion of brain from hoped might be relieved upon arrival at hong kong where expected to obtain efficient surgical assistance that meanwhile be in very serious danger a event proved however be woefully mistaken have made a much northing a deemed necessary be bowling along upon west west course reeling off ten knot per hour with flying kite abroad fine north east breeze over starboard quarter when about four bell in first watch skipper came up on deck complaining that found impossible to sleep in consequence of extreme heat of cabin night be brilliantly starlit air so clear that must have easily distinguished sail at distance of two mile have there be owe to see light be not strong enough to enable clearly to distinguish brown feature even when be standing beside while cabin lamp be turned low so that there be not much light coming through skylight when old fellow fell into step by side began to talk quite rationally about heat below impossibility of sleeping gratification at fine breeze have fallen in with so on be completely thrown off guard for appeared to be in precisely condition have often previously seen in when have talked rationally enough for time taken little walk a be doing at moment then suddenly forgetting what be conversing about gone below slept for several hour at once a be walking to fro between main rigging wheel grating old fellow halted pulled off cap extracted big bandana handkerchief from proceeded to mop head face from a in own case perspiration be freely pouring great snake ejaculated be hot mistake sweat pourin ' out o ' like water outen sponge guess be what be makin ' so all fired thirsty where be water cask be boun ' to have drink tongue so dry be rattlin ' agin teeth ca ye hear where be that there scuttle butt say better not drink direct from cask sir said for cunningham have strongly urged to drink nothing filtered water even that with dash of lime juice in during extreme heat filter stand on sideboard there be opened bottle of lime juice in rack above will find very much cooler more refreshing than water from scuttle butt that stuff be really not fit to drink be so tarnation thirsty must have drink insisted 'd rather drink outer cask than go below why man alive that there cabin be like oven oh said glancing hastily round noting that weather seemed fine settled if be will very soon slip down fetch up drink bring to anchor here on wheel grating sir while go below will be back in brace of shake just keep eye on chip whispered to carpenter who be at wheel will not be gone more than minute right be sir responded carpenter turning quid in mouth a skipper obediently seated on wheel grating while made rush for companion turned up cabin lamp procured tumbler be in act of measuring out liberal dose of lime juice when carpenter voice suddenly upraised in accent of panic man overboard man overboard shouted mr temple come on deck sir skipper be throwed over lee rail flinging down tumbler bottle of lime juice mounted companion ladder in two jump nearly dashing brain out against slide in haste stared stupidly about for moment being more than half stunned then a pulled together heard chip repeating parrot wise just laid han upon rail swung clean overboard like boy jumpin ' gate down helm man down helm round to roared rushing to main rigging let go lee brace began to drag frantically upon weather one in ineffectual effort to back topsail then remembered that weather studdingsails be set being reminded thereof in fact by snapping of topmast studdingsail boom a schooner with helm hard lee rushed furiously up into wind topgallantsail topsail squaresail flew aback broken spar began to thresh spitefully against fore rigging in fresh breeze saw at once have made mess of thing to purpose also stood to make far worse mess of if be not careful for amount of sail schooner must carry while running off wind be altogether too much for when brought to be now lying over with lee rail buried with possibility that mast might go over side at moment if be not relieved in one way a for saving skipper be impossible for a have forgotten for moment be now owing to loss of six of foremast men short handed must not possibly launch boat until schooner be snugged down by time have done that must be mile away from spot where skipper have gone overboard without certain definite knowledge a to precise direction in to look for therefore circumstance coming to mind in flash jumped to wheel helped chip to put hard up again luckily managing to get little hooker before wind once more with further damage than loss of studdingsail boom splitting of lower studdingsail chapter eleven wreck of martha brown last fatality have rather curious result that of entire crew who left baltimore in martha brown only cook cabin boy now survived remainder of existing crew consisting of cunningham boatswain carpenter sailmaker of zenobia also resulted in destiny of ship aboard interest of poor old ephraim brown widow suddenly falling into inexperienced hand being case decided to consult with cunningham at once a to proper step to be taken under circumstance although own view of matter be perfectly clear decided view stated briefly amounted to obvious duty be to do very best possibly must for mr brown that knowing quite clearly what skipper intention be must not do better than carry out in entirety be in form laid matter before cunningham asking to give opinion upon requesting to suggest better course if must think of one fully agreed with that schooner being practically full of sandalwood being also within three week sail of canton must not do better than proceed to destination dispose of cargo invest proceeds in tea then be guided by circumstance rather state of market a to whether must take tea to europe america ultimately returning to baltimore there rendering account of stewardship upon understanding being arrived at voyage to canton be continued be on afternoon of third day following suicide of skipper that trade wind up to then have be blowing with usual steadiness began to weaken upon consulting barometer found that mercury be falling rather rapidly at same time became aware that aspect of firmament be undergoing subtle change clear brilliant blue of sky gradually fading to colourless pallor a though succession of veil of white gauze be being drawn across while cloud sailing up out of north east paused in flight began to bank up in south west quarter change continued throughout afternoon result being that sun gradually became blotted out be entirely obscured about hour half before time of sunset with disappearance of sun wind sank until died away altogether schooner lost steerage way while heaven assumed dark lowering appearance atmosphere became close suffocating so oppressively hot that even thinnest lightest of clothing be almost unendurable burden article be dispensed with must be discarded without outraging decency although wind have completely died away swell did not diminish on contrary seemed if anything to increase for schooner rolled plunged most outrageously shipping water over rail bow even taffrail water seeming to heap up suddenly fall aboard in most extraordinary unexpected manner be evident that change of weather be impending a mercury clearly indicated that change must be for worse caused schooner to be stripped just before darkness set in leaving only reefed foresail fore staysail set under short canvas believed must not come to much harm let impending weather be what might quarter of hour after time of sunset darkness be so intense that for practical purpose might a well have be blind for at distance of ten twelve foot from illuminated cabin skylight be literally impossible to see one hand when held close before one eye while between darkness violently uneasy motion of little hooker be positively dangerous to attempt to move about deck a for staying below be out of question for cabin be like so many oven therefore after supper be over cunningham returned to deck seating on wheel grating beside lashed wheel chatted together while engineer smoked pipe after pipe happened to be eight hour in night therefore since be hopeless to think of sleeping in bunk on hot breathless night stretched out on wheel grating shortly after eight bell of second dog watch be soon fast asleep despite hardness of bed while cunningham sat near keeping such lookout a be possible under circumstance be seven bell within hour of midnight when cunningham awoke sorry to disturb before time old chap apologised have be hoping that might not be necessary to awake until eight bell just look at sky what on earth doe mean what be going to happen have started up broad awake instant that cunningham hand touched shoulder have at once become conscious of very extraordinary portentous aspect of sky be therefore quite unnecessary for to ask what meant when soon after expiration of second dog watch have stretched out fallen asleep on wheel grating darkness have be a opaque a of egypt when moses stretched forth hand there be thick darkness in land for space of three day during egyptian saw not one neither rose from place now moment opened eye saw that plunging schooner restless heaving surface of ocean overarching dome of sky packed with enormous mass of slowly working cloud be suffused with ruddy light such a might be emitted by volcano in furious eruption yet flaming crater be anywhere visible did light flicker wax wane a must have done have issued from such source be perfectly steady after have gazed upon for time must come to other conclusion than that emanated from cloud glowed with colour of iron heated to low red heat have never before beheld such weird awe inspiring spectacle a gazed upon memory came to that have somewhere read of something similar also remembered that have be described a precursor of hurricane similar atmospheric convulsion be afraid mean heavy blow hurricane typhoon a call in sea said be very glad that called for will take hint have schooner battened down forthwith also be first time have ever witnessed phenomenon must not have missed on account might a well turn in now if care to do so added for see be not far off eight bell will not attempt to sleep again thanks no not if know answered cunningham like have never seen anything of kind before intend to see can of now have opportunity began more than hour ago ruddy glare growing out of inky blackness so subtly imperceptibly that be difficult to say precisely when began became conscious of when got up to strike six bell then brightened so rapidly seemed so altogether unnatural that at length began to feel jumpy about decided that time have arrived when ought to be called quite right agreed well if wo turn in perhaps will be good enough to keep lookout here while go for'ard see to battening down there be not much to be done little need doing might a well be done at once therewith left staggered along squirming deck to forecastle head where chip sail be perched upon windlass bitt out of way of water be constantly slopping in over one bow other talking together in low pitched murmur staring

cover have be specially made to fit when be done set scanty crew to work lending hand to secure galley boat with extra lashing so that might not be washed away when have finished cook entered galley shut in to finish night there a happened be none too soon in completion of preparation for scarcely have finished when ruddy glow in sky began to die out again a did so first of scuffling puff of chip have spoken came whining moaning across surface of ocean from south west filling scanty spread of canvas with resounding clap then passing away toward north east track across glistening surface of ocean being marked by dimming blur like catspaw swept down toward touched for instant be gone again occurred seven eight time at decreasing interval succeeding rush of air being of few second longer duration than preceding one coming with greater strength spite thus enabling at last to get steerage way upon schooner partially turn stern toward point from expected outfly to come when presently came roaring howling screaming down upon with medley of sound a might be expected from legion of unchained fury port quarter be turned towards with schooner in motion paying off before yet even so swooped down upon with such appalling violence that little vessel careened until lee sheer pole be buried water be up to coaming of main hatch with way on helm hard up after canvas set hurricane dragging at stout foresail must not help paying off after long minute of heart racking suspense during momentarily expected to keel up with suddenly righted went flying away dead before wind with water boiling under bow up to level of head board one of martha brown good point be that steered a handily a little boat therefore have difficulty in keeping dead before wind without assistance although cunningham stood by to lend hand must chance to need help also water apart from boiling foam into surface be scourged by hurricane be perfectly smooth smallest suggestion of wave crest being instantly seized by wind swept away to leeward in form of fine salt rain indeed air be so full of spindrift scudwater believed even have be daylight must not have seen farther than about two at most three length from ship a be with outfly of hurricane weird unnatural ruddy light of have spoken almost immediately died out from sky leaving night a pitch dark a before save for ghostly gleam of phosphorescent light arose from storm swept ocean gave water a far a must be seen appearance a if moonlight be shining up through when have be scudding for full quarter of hour before raving screaming howling fury of wind began momentarily to expect look for indication that worst be over to hope that wind must moderate sufficiently to allow to heave schooner to before sea must acquire height weight enough to render operation dangerous for now mile that ran be carrying just so much farther from destination a time went on gale instead of moderating seemed to increase in strength until began to wonder how much longer hemp pine canvas must endure terrific strain to foremast rigging reefed foresail be exposed still although mast be bowed forward in curve seemed to have approached perilously near to breaking point although shroud backstay be strained until be hard a iron bar everything be so far holding splendidly schooner be rushing along at speed be firmly persuaded have never before approached at length after have be at wheel nearly three hour cunningham insisted on relieving to speak truth be more than glad to accept offer for notwithstanding that be by time blowing harder than ever that wind continued to scoop up water in such vast quantity that air be thick with salt rain high unpleasantly steep sea have gradually risen chasing schooner constantly threatening to poop broach to so that at length in order to escape one fate other became necessary to keep wheel perpetually in motion now to port anon to starboard couple of hour of kind of work combined with heavy strain upon one nerve be enough pretty well to tire out strongest moreover be drenched to skin therefore gladly made way for cunningham having first gone forward directed murdock to go aft stand by wheel so that might be at hand in event of cunningham needing assistance returned aft finding necessary by way to go down on hand knee literally crawl along deck in order to make headway against buffeting of wind went below to cabin where proceeded to strip off wet clothes subject to vigorous towelling preparatory to donning dry rig mackintosh taking time over operation have proceeded so far a to have donned dry undervest pair of thin duck trouser having rolled leg of up to knee be in act of unhooking long mackintosh coat from peg when terrific shock hurled violently against cabin bulkhead next instant deafening medley of sound compounded chiefly of crash of breaking spar wild yell of cunningham murdock seething smash of perfect mountain of water on deck splintering of glass in cabin skylight pouring of deluge of water down into cabin smote upon ear partially stunned by violence with have be dashed against bulkhead made immediate effort to rise remained passively where have fallen stupidly striving to realise what have happened until tremendous upheaval of schooner hull by be hove completely over on beam end rush of water half filled cabin awoke to consciousness that catastrophe of sort have overtaken scrambled awkwardly with difficulty to foot pulling up by mean of knob of drawer under standing bedplace when furious shock again upset fell squatting into water violently surging to fro athwart cabin by time however full consciousness of serious character of situation have come to a schooner be again hove up almost on to opposite beam end let go hold of drawer knob went swirling out through stateroom door lifted fairly off foot by rush of water found swimming for life in main cabin in midst of squadron of cushion have floated be flung off top of cabin locker then mountainous sea swooped down upon overwhelmed hapless schooner deluge poured into cabin through smashed skylight companion have not backwash of water just then swept into companion way stranded on ladder so must grasp handrail must certainly have be drowned for second downpour filled cabin to level of beam a pulled up secured footing on companion ladder felt hull of schooner again soaring aloft up up until seemed to excited imagination a though little craft be being hove right up among cloud at same time being capsized then came thundering crash of mountain of water upon deck accompanied by sound of rending woodwork a companion cover parted company be swept away whole niagara of water poured down through opening upon devoted head a clung to handrail with grip of drowning man schooner struck third time with such terrific violence fully expected hull to go to piece about ear stanchly built little hooker still held together although knew that bottom must be stove in like cracked egg shell presently when felt must not hold breath for second found head once more above water saw dimly close above hole in deck where companion cover have once be moment have again found footing on ladder bruised over aching in joint of body crawled out on deck whether be that eye have at last adjusted to darkness that darkness be le profound than have be know not a emerged from companion way secured footing on deck became aware that must dimly perceive immediate surroundings first object to catch eye be stump of mainmast within few foot of spot where be standing instinct of self preservation at once prompted to make dash at fling arm round in order might not be swept away by next sea must break aboard a stood there gasping for breath staring about discovered must not only dimly perceive immediate surroundings that entire hull of schooner be visible a shapeless black patch in midst of madly leaping chaos of swirling foam gleamed ghostly white in light of own phosphorescence be still blowing a furiously a ever air be thick with spindrift scudwater blotted out everything outside radius of thirty fathom on side schooner now seemed to be in comparatively smooth water be not long in guessing at reason for glancing to windward must dimly see few fathom away great wall of spouting leaping white breaker evidently marking position of reef upon have struck so violently over now seemed to have beaten for there be further shock imperfectly a must distinguish object in darkness must still see enough to convince that schooner be complete wreck full of water for mast be over starboard side still attached to hull by rigging while scrap of bulwark boat galley in fact everything above level of deck be swept away single glance sufficed to grasp detail then turned gaze inboard again wondering whether of others have survived that awful passage across reef a did so sound of someone vomiting close at hand reached ear who be demanded looking in direction from sound proceeded a spoke figure uphove from among raffle of port main rigging lay athwart deck voice recognised a cunningham responded that temple asked ugh ouch ow by piper be awful seem to have swallowed pacific ocean ow ugh aw say old chap auch where dickens be what have happened eh where be will be hanged if know responded for about here must be open water according to chart be for have just beaten over reef in probability smashed bottom of poor little hooker to matchwood in process now best can hope be that there be land of sort close under lee for if there be be in very pretty pickle have seen anything of others yes answered cunningham murdock be here be afraid be badly hurt poor chap if not killed outright when schooner struck be swept for'ard by first sea broke aboard next thing knew when water have gone be be clinging to rigging here with one hand have hold of somebody leg with other that somebody being murdock be still be insensible be afraid must have be violently dashed against of wreckage so lost time in making fast to first loose rope end must find say if schooner bottom be stove a say suppose will sink in few minute wo sink with hold full of sandalwood not much retorted still hope there be land not far away for have fancy for washing about pacific on crazy waterlogged hulk be condition of martha brown at moment where be chip sail boy be afraid will never again set eye upon poor cooky for be in galley see be gone together with everything else be on deck yes said cunningham went think with first sea broke aboard when struck reef know what have become of others seem to remember having seen two figure emerge from companion way while be busy with murdock here know what became of wonder whether must do anything for boatswain sea be no longer breaking aboard yes of course said where be can at least discover whether not be alive here be among raffle answered cunningham first thing suppose will be to get clear of then well be afraid be about that can do for at present said a moved across sluggishly rolling deck toward cunningham stooped beside at direction lifted tangle of rigging beneath boatswain be lying while proceeded to cast off lashing have saved inert body from being washed overboard then between dragged man out to clear spot on deck where cunningham knelt supporting head shoulder while tore open front of thin vest laid hand upon broad hairy chest heart be beating although feebly yet a cunningham continued to support man in sitting position beat gradually became stronger presently with groan consciousness returned heaving over on side with ejaculation poor murdock began to vomit violently a cunningham have done having evidently like swallowed great quantity of salt water for perhaps five minute paroxysm continued with severity then having rid of most of salt water man between groan began to ask where be then a memory returned informed that have received violent blow on top of head have knocked sens out of fortunately there be wound after while boatswain be able to sit up unassisted with back against stump of mainmast then having placed in tolerably comfortable position be free again to take cognisance of thing in general when became aware of fact that schooner although still rolling heavily with movement of water about have taken ground upon looking away to leeward thought must perceive through flying spindrift against darkness of sky darker shadow must scarcely be anything else than land when next turned to murdock to enquire whether there be anything more that must do for found that have fallen asleep be perhaps best thing must have happened to therefore left to finish nap fell to pacing weather side of deck between main rigging taffrail comparing note a to experience while be still thus engaged became aware of two thing first of be that gale be breaking while second be that dawn be at hand for far away to leeward of sky be paling down to certain point beneath shadow lay a dark a ever be assuming even a stood certain definiteness of shape ultimately resolving into outline of what seemed distant hill with deeper shadow between ourselves in turn developed into low bush crowned cliff out of base of sandy beach presently grew a light gathered strength then quite suddenly cloud to windward overhead broke up into detached mass between few star twinkled transiently before vanished in fast growing light of new day cloud mass drove away to leeward disappeared revealing sky of deepest richest ultramarine softening away down in eastern quarter to tone of palest most delicate primrose against outline of distant hill stood out sharp a though cut out of paper so deeply purple a to be almost black then light coming so swiftly that eye scarcely found time to note multitudinous change of tint accompanying sky behind hill flushed from palest primrose to rich glowing amber few evanescent shred of cloud midway between horizon zenith blushed rosy red at being caught unawares by sun first ray then vanished pencil dipped in burning gold outlined crest of distant hill for few second then upper edge of sun disk palpitating with living light floated up into view beyond ridge of hill in instant whole scene save beach still lay in shadow of cliff became picture of brilliant dazzling light colour to seaward about two mile distant be creaming surf sparkling diamond like a plunged down upon reef over have driven then leaped spouted thirty foot high into clear air before wind caught tore into mist while shoreward there stretched line of curving sandy beach about mile in length forming part of shore of willow bay into have driven wherein schooner now lay stranded beach be distant about cable length from be backed by rocky cliff averaging about fifty foot in height crowned by growth of low scrub over top of appeared what now seemed to be low flat topped hill distant perhaps three mile inland beach immediately to leeward of schooner be strewed with fragment of wreckage among recognised galley fragment of boat what gave greatest satisfaction of be to see two apparently inanimate figure of carpenter sailmaker rise slowly to foot walk down to water edge stare intently in direction under sharp of hand then wave hand frantically in response to waving a recognised fact that be aboard wreck for present at event safe then put hand trumpet wise to mouth evidently hailed roar crash of surf on reef be so deafening that be impossible for to catch word of what said recognising presently turned walked up sand until came to dry spot where sat down with obvious intention of awaiting event a for cunningham must hing abide in patience where be until surf upon beach must moderate sufficiently to render safe for to swim ashore wreck being swept so clean that without breaking up deck there be not fragment of timber left out of to construct raft chapter twelve island by time sun have be risen about hour cunningham became aware that needed something more than mere shipwreck to rob of appetite for found rapidly developing good wholesome hunger ala there be mean of appeasing for schooner be full of water everything in nature of provision be quite un get at able must therefore be obliged to wait for meal until must get ashore decided must scarcely be until afternoon if even then soon came to conclusion that companion ashore be in like case with ourselves so far at least a hunger be concerned for about hour later saw rise to foot point first to mouth then to top of cliff presently proceed to cliff foot evidently in search of spot at might be climbed although viewed from wreck cliff appeared to be quite vertical soon found such spot for a watched began to ascend cliff zigzagging to right left apparently following something by courtesy might be called path for walked rather than climbed reaching top in about five minute then with wave of hand to turned into bush disappeared returning about hour afterwards with what a held up for to see looked like small bunch of banana meanwhile gale having broken wind rapidly dropped until about midday fell stark calm be not until nearly sunset that surf on beach have abated sufficiently to render at safe for to attempt swim from wreck to shore by time be so ravenously hungry that be prepared to take appreciable amount of risk if by doing so must procure wherewithal to appease craving for food while waiting for sea to go down employed time usefully in cutting rigging by broken mast remained attached to wreck thus giving wreckage chance to drive ashore upon beach where must eventually want at length however when sun have dropped to within fifteen degree of western horizon be shining full into bay where wreck lay sea have so far gone down surf on beach have so far abated a to render possible for to land without incurring much risk of injury to limb therefore awoke murdock who have passed most of day in sleep finding in pretty good form after long rest forthwith proceeded to make attempt distance have to traverse be mere trifle of about fifty fathom thereabouts did perfectly well until reached inner line of breaker there a luck must have something went wrong with boatswain without saying word to of suddenly flung up hand disappeared at precise moment when comber have in grip be about to fling up on beach when consequently be most necessary that of must be perfectly free to look after fortunately however be swimming close together a murdock disappeared cunningham with one accord dived made grab at catching just a breaker curled over broke hurling forward in smothering swirl of foam next instant be being rolled over over upon sand then a came to rest dug toe finger of disengaged hand deep into sand ready for backwash while a afterward appeared cunningham did same after severe struggle of few second duration water receded leaving stranded gasping for breath when chip sail who have be on watch rushed down into water in obedience to gasped request from seized boatswain insensible body dragged up out of reach of next breaker while cunningham scrambled to foot staggered after once ashore boatswain soon recovered from fainting fit whatever have be whereupon seated ourselves in circle upon sand feasted upon banana afterwards slaking thirst at little runnel of deliciously cool sweet water that carpenter have discovered earlier in day trickling out of cliff at great distance from point at wreck have come ashore while be eating carpenter informed that sailmaker have be stretched out upon schooner cabin locker fast asleep when struck upon reef for first time awakened by violence of shock crash of falling mast have leaped to foot scarcely knowing what did rushed up on deck only to be swept overboard next instant by heavy sea broke over ship of knew at moment what have befallen other from what told be evident that same sea washed overboard swept schooner deck of everything carried away bulwark for when fighting for breath rose to surface of found close to mass of floating wreckage to clung desperately so be eventually flung up on beach with life so nearly battered out of that be just a much a of must do to crawl far enough up beach to get beyond reach of deadly backwash when collapsed so lay senseless until be revived by ray of morning sun there be however two still missing namely cook cabin boy former of found quite dead shut up in stranded galley exactly what became of cabin boy never knew for never found trace of alive dead buried body of cook same evening in sand using fragment of splintered planking wherewith to dig grave after flung down upon dry sand above high water mark completely worn out slept soundly until following morning awoke shortly after sunrise to find weather gloriously fine trade wind again blowing briskly to very great surprise wreck few yard from shore in very little over two foot of water single glance around at greatly altered appearance of beach a compared with what have seen of on previous day sufficed to explain apparent mystery tide have something to do with of course for chanced that schooner have come ashore on very top of highest spring tide be perfectly evident that apart from water in bay have be piled up to quite unusual height by gale hence when storm have subsided ocean have once more found normal level wreck be left little short of high dry be quite stroke of good luck for for subsequently discovered that range of tide in particular part of ocean be so exceedingly small that even at high water be able to wade right out to wreck while wreckage have be cast ashore on previous day be now lying high dry far up beach quite beyond reach of ordinary tide be thus saved vast amount of trouble for although when began salvage operation be still necessary to do certain amount of rafting in order to convey heavy article ashore light article such a must carry must be taken thither by simple process of lowering over side to one of companion who then carried ashore in arm on shoulder there be one two matter demanding immediate attention first being breakfast while next be settlement of very important question whether not island happened to posse other inhabitant than ourselves incidentally if so what must be attitude toward last be matter of most vital importance to for experience gained during collection of cargo of sandalwood be that while native of certain of island be gentle kindly disposed toward stranger perfectly harmless of others be exceedingly jealous suspicious fierce treacherous bloodthirsty in case actually cannibal of course if must so chance that have be cast away upon island inhabited by native possessing last named characteristic prospect of ultimate escape with life be what poor old skipper brown must have designated a purty slim until point must be determined behoved to be exceedingly careful therefore after discussing matter at sort of council of war be decided that important a might be to explore island ascertain capability limitation without delay be still more important urgent to provide with mean of self defence accordingly while chip sail again undertook to climb cliff procure banana for breakfast cunningham accompanied by boatswain who seemed after good night rest to be little worse for happening of previous day agreed to wade off board wreck with view of securing such weapon ammunition a be come at able have not be spoiled by sea water arm chest although actually under water be secured without difficulty carried ashore together with several bottle of oil be able to rescue from lazarette done cunningham set to work immediately after breakfast thoroughly to dry clean oil weapon put in perfect working order although such ammunition a have be able to find be completely ruined by sea water seemed to remember having heard late skipper say that there be reserve stock packed in waterproof zinc lined case stowed away somewhere in ship therefore while cunningham be engaged upon task of cleaning arm other three men went aboard wreck proceeded systematically to salve entire content of lazarette with result before day work be ended have found case yielding le than one thousand round of gun ammunition two thousand revolver cartridge of proved to be in perfect condition be thus pretty well provided with mean of self defence given something in nature of fairly strong defensive position ought to be able to render reasonably good account of next thing to be done be to find defensive position following day be therefore devoted to thorough exploration of island by entire party expedition setting out immediately after breakfast of being armed with cutlas gun brace of revolver with good supply of cartridge in pocket thus far have observed nothing indicating that island be inhabited by others than must be remembered that schooner have be wrecked in bay hemmed in on land side by cliff hitherto farthest excursion have be to top of cliff just few yard inland be necessary to enable to procure banana from tree growing right up to cliff edge remainder of island be therefore so far terra incognita to might for aught that must tell to contrary be swarming with savage therefore decided to proceed with caution keeping close together to scale cliff proved very easy matter for carpenter sailmaker have on first day ashore found what might be termed sort of natural stairway zigzagging up consisting of series of rock projection ledge up down be possible to pas with little difficulty served purpose admirably having climbed stairway found at top of cliff confronted by dense undergrowth of jungle consisting for most part of inextricable tangle of tough creeper interspersed with shrub tree of various kind many of seemed to be fruit bearer among recognised plantain banana custard apple loquat granadilla guava pawpaw others with none of be acquainted fruit however be very plentiful very fine most of tree being so completely smothered with creeper that must get sun air room enough to grow properly pushed through brake for about mile working steadily uphill time frequently being compelled to cut way for ourselves with cutlass finally emerging upon kind of ridge bare of scrub richly carpeted with guinea grass with few tall tree of various kind scattered here there about although ridge plateau be comparatively open view be still exceedingly circumscribed for be hemmed in on hand by bush belt seemed completely to cover entire island except plateau upon stood bald summit of curious looking hill mountain about two mile distant summit of hill appeared to be flat estimated to be about three thousand foot higher than ridge upon be then standing promised to afford perfect view of whole island therefore a day be still young at once decided to make way to survey domain from crest of ridge upon stood appeared to lead straight toward mountain moreover be not nearly so densely overgrown a be lower ground progress therefore be tolerably rapid in course of hour found clear of bush standing upon lower slope of mountain then knew that towering mass in front of must be nothing else than volcano dormant extinct for there be sign of smoke rising from summit although nature of soil around consisting a did of pumice stone scoria ancient lava left doubt a to character of mountain now began really difficult part of task although ground be entirely bare of vegetation surface be so exceedingly rough broken so loose that progress be very slow becoming more so with forward step for while lower slope of mountain be of quite easy grade rapidly steepened a advanced until last five hundred foot so approached so nearly to perpendicular at length further progress seemed to be impossible must only advance yard two at time climbing upon hand knee with short spell of rest between spurt when at length about midday finally reached summit be unanimously agreed that toil be amply rewarded for entire island lay stretched out at foot like map with mile after mile of blue foam flecked ocean reaching far away to horizon on hand while away in south western quarter hundred mile distant perhaps there appeared faint film of misty blue indicated presence of other land last be much too distant to interest in way be own particular domain that absorbed attention first thing that observed about be that length ran practically east west be of very irregular shape most graphic way of describing being perhaps to say that in general outline somewhat resembled rather acute angled triangle with two large piece bitten out of near base one bite having be taken out of north side while other larger have removed south west angle formed bay in lay wreck acute angle pointed toward east side of triangle be much twisted broken mountain upon summit of stood occupied middle of eastern half of island proved to be a have anticipated crater of apparently extinct volcano interior of crater be elliptical in shape about mile long by mile wide be funnel like opening about five thousand foot deep with practically perpendicular side resembled a much a anything enormous well for there be water at bottom of though probably of great depth also at bottom round edge of water for distance up side there be enormous quantity of what judged to be sulphur top edge of crater from below presented appearance of flat topped hill be about thirty foot wide tolerably level therefore have difficulty in walking right round so obtaining complete view of entire island be everywhere covered with verdure save immediately round base of volcano although outline of island be very irregular there be only two indentation worthy of name of bay in namely one in wreck lay at once decided to name south west bay at north west extremity of island named north bay two bay be only portion of coastline possessing anything in nature of beach that fact once established knew that if native existed anywhere on island must find trace of on one other of bay have already learned that there be none on shore of south west bay now carefully examining other bay must see trace of canoe on beach hut along margin must detect slightest sign of smoke wreath in direction therefore finally came to conclusion that excepting island be without inhabitant one source of anxiety be thereupon removed from mind standing upon edge of crater looking westward obtained perfect view of whole of western half of island including bay looking down upon land below from great height a now did be able to form very accurate idea of origin at once judged to be volcanic entire island in fact be evidently summit of volcano projecting above surface of ocean two bay above referred to having evidently be at one time two crater vent for internal fire since be encircled by reef have appearance of having be at one time part of lip of respective crater a stood up there studying conformation general appearance of island fell to discussing future prospect soon arrived at conclusion situated just where island happened to be far away from regular ship track very existence apparently unknown since be not marked upon chart might be month even year before must be rescued by being taken off by ship that therefore wisest course must be first to save everything possible from wreck then carefully break up using timber to build sort of craft to convey back to civilisation must at event keep busy mind occupied giving object in life something to strive for think about achieve thus preserve from falling into low despondent frame of mind if in end ship must happen to appear take off why so much better while if nothing of kind occurred must in due time be able to effect own escape cunningham be particularly enthusiastic over scheme yacht designing appeared be hobby of promised that if must only give free hand must design something must not only be fairly easy to build must also be safe comfortable quite capable of conveying to part of world might choose a destination struck a far too ambitious project for five men to undertake when later on again discussed matter with chart of pacific before discovered that sandwich island nearest civilised land lay fourteen hundred mile distant changed opinion have already done one ocean trip in open boat have desire to attempt on way back to beach abreast wreck now constituted temporary home took look at north bay with a place of residence instantly became violently enamoured because in first place be open to north east trade wind be therefore far cooler more pleasant than beach of south west bay shut in a latter be under lee of high cliff opposed to afternoon sun next there be little stream of delicious fresh water falling over low cliff into small rock basin affording ideal freshwater bath next discovered fine large perfectly dry cave close to shore with entrance so narrow that constituted of perfect rock fortress lastly large varied assortment of very fine fruit tree be discovered growing quite close to beach only needing to be cleared of undergrowth to make splendid orchard one drawback to bay be that be about two mile distant from wreck near must of necessity be obliged to establish shipyard many advantage so far outweighed that took possession of cave there then slept in night now ensued particularly busy time for for when came to consider situation found that there be several matter demanding attention be of so urgent character that be rather difficult for to determine offhand must be first to receive for to begin with be agreed that unless something quite unforeseen unexpected in nature of call at island by ship must occur in meantime must be prepared for sojourn of at least year in present quarter of course meant that must be obliged to give serious consideration to question of maintenance of health in turn meant that must carefully regulate diet alter a much a possible not depending too much upon fruit varying by frequent change to fish only possible alternative soon discovered that in order to catch fish a well a for many other purpose be not only very desirable also almost imperatively necessary that must have something in nature of boat of course remained to be built then there be salvage of everything contained in wreck of schooner including timber metal of be built to say nothing of certain gardening operation projected by murdock with object of improving quality of fruit growing in immediate vicinity of cave cultivation of certain vegetable sundry other scheme having for object betterment of condition during period of sojourn upon island murdock hobby happening to be gardening a cunningham happened to be yacht designing a often happens when men take up useful occupation a amusement soon proved to be exceptionally skilful in matter relating to respective hobby therefore while chip sail went strenuously to work upon operation of salving everything that must find aboard wreck boatswain with assistance of poor cooky fire shovel few other iron implement converted into tool devoted to production of fruit vegetable garden in immediate neighbourhood of cave dwelling clearing away scrub grew around choked two dozen fruit tree digging hoeing up soil planting therein potato onion bean that must find for among cook store aboard ship while be busy in manner described cunningham rescued few sheet of paper lead pencil from skipper cabin carefully dried former sharpened latter with empty packing case for table scale constructed with assistance of carpenter two foot rule assiduously devoted to task of designing what called catamaran for immediate use then small schooner by mean of be eventually to make escape from island return to civilisation catamaran struck a being particularly simple ingenious affair of many merit consisting in fact that needed mould for construction that must be built of fragment of wreckage be too short too much splintered damaged to be of use in construction of schooner that needed very elaborate working shaping consisted essentially of two oblong tank box thirty foot long by two foot wide by two foot six inch deep box be not unlike thames fishing punt in shape although be proportionately much narrower deeper bottom of be perfectly flat transversely also longitudinally except at end where curved up gradually in semi parabola until met gunwale two box punt having be decked over made perfectly watertight be then joined together with space of eight foot between by stout beam over after part of be laid schooner wheel grating to serve purpose of deck broad bladed steering paddle be fitted securely into grommet attached to aftermost beam punt be simply rigged with enormous lateen sail made out of schooner tattered foresail there have nondescript kind of craft thirty foot long by twelve foot beam drawing only about eight inch of water when light on even keel buoyant unsinkable uncapsizable when came to try developed speed under sail be positively astounding went to windward like racing cutter be wet of course particularly when driven hard to windward in such climate a now enjoyed to be drenched with salt water be pleasure rather than otherwise regarded a drawback be not worth moment consideration took month almost to day to build rig complete after first trial of almost invariably used to go to fro between two bay although trip by water be about seven mile in length a compared with short cut of two mile overland yet did way in little over hour while sail home in evening after hard day work be much more exhilarating mode of travelling of two what perhaps gratified a much a anything in connection with construction of exceedingly useful craft be that in building have not be obliged to touch schooner at have drawn for material entirely upon loose wreckage of bulwark so on that have found strewn about beach on day after wreck together with four stout sapling cut down to serve a beam found to be exceedingly tough in many respect to resemble elm while carpenter boatswain sail have be strenuously at work upon construction of catamaran cunningham have be quite a industriously employed upon design for proposed schooner working alone day after day in cave dwelling round at north bay evolving half breadth body plan midship section buttock line water line diagonal rest of ruling in rubbing out again calculating altering modifying patiently labouring to get several drawing to agree accurately with other resolutely refusing to be satisfied until have got everything exactly to liking at length be able to display to not altogether without pride completed draught of a pretty little ship a think ever set eye upon have taken a foundation of design shape of zenobia gig in have made memorable atlantic voyage out of have be taken by poor old skipper brown fine little craft having produced profound impression upon in consequence of splendid quality a sea boat have exhibited new craft be of course to be much bigger than gig for be not only to be completely decked from stem to stern be to be sufficiently roomy in interior to enable to perform voyage of over thousand mile with very fair measure of comfort principal dimension therefore be forty foot on water line by ten foot beam in order to provide reasonable amount of headroom below a also to make weatherly be considerably deeper in proportion than gig much sharper in floor providing with plenty of power for size by mean of must be enabled to make good way even in heavy head sea bow be almost exact reproduction of of gig rather long overhanging with plenty of flare to lift over head sea be provided with even longer counter gave after body remarkably smooth easy delivery while for rest water line be almost of racing yacht so concluded must be exceedingly nimble under canvas altogether be immensely pleased with not little impressed by cunningham effort must not help reminding others that be one thing to draught smart little vessel on paper quite to build with such resource a have at disposal chip however who of course knew must have known more about such matter than of rest of while not exactly pooh poohing reminder be confident that a expressed be men enough to bring scheme to fruition with assertion be obliged by mean unwillingly to rest satisfied meanwhile however great deal still remained to be done before must start work upon new schooner for although have by time salved everything from wreck be astonishing how much what wide variety of thing found in still remained to be broken up agreed that must be next job chapter thirteen two important event occur may be thought that there be little nothing of interest to be found in operation of breaking up wreck of ship who have assisted in such operation can testify most strongly to contrary for when work be undertaken a undertook to break up wreck of martha brown be to say carefully taking apart plank by plank beam by beam exactly reversing in fact several process by be put together there be plenty of interest instruction to be found in observing numberless ingenious device have be resorted to by shipwright to join together several member of hull in such manner a to ensure maximum of strength so when once joined together strain short of involving absolute destruction of material must be capable of pulling apart again who have be aboard schooner during time of passage across reef have experienced in own person terrific violence of shock to have then be subjected be amazed that have not be shattered like egg shell when later on came to dismember be still more amazed to find how little damage comparatively speaking have sustained while passing through fearful ordeal on reef what extraordinary exertion be needed to wrench several part asunder detailed description of varied scheme to be obliged to resort in order to effect purpose must be of interest to general reader will therefore content with bare statement that cost six week of hardest labour ever performed in life to reduce martha brown to component part to stack material upon beach in readiness for use in construction of new schooner in fairness to however must be said that during part of time there be only four of engaged upon work cunningham being busy upon calculation of stability relative position of centre of gravity metacentre of new schooner know not what beside in connection with determination of amount of ballast must be needed position of mast area proportion of several sail for now that engineer be fairly mounted upon new hobby there be possibility of dragging out of saddle have several novel theory be anxious to test be resolutely determined that new schooner must be a nearly perfect a skill must make therefore simply scoffed at when pointed out that time be flying indignantly demanded to be told what mattered few day more le in comparison with importance of matter with be dealing returned to figure with renewed zest thing come to end sooner later day at length arrived when cunningham completed final calculation drew last line carefully rolled up completed drawing to await moment when must be called for upon beginning of important task of laying keel of new schooner now if have succeeded in portraying anything like true picture of life upon island reader will have gathered impression after first day following wreck be constantly in condition of breathless activity due to fact that there be so many matter of apparently paramount importance clamouring for instant attention at beginning at least strove to attend to several matter at same time doing first little to then little to other according to what believed at moment to be most pressing state of affair prevailed with until have salved everything possible from wreck until have built catamaran after felt that might with advantage adopt sort of system in arrangement of work now among number of thing that desired to do have postponed in favour of other matter have seemed more pressingly urgent be exploration of cave cave be situated only thirty yard from beach in north bay in heart of steeply rising acclivity gradually merged in plateau constituting western extremity of island be only by merest accident that have discovered existence of cavern on day when undertook exploration of island although there be doubt that must have found sooner later for entrance be so small that only one person must pas through at time even then only in crouching position be latter circumstance at first so strongly commended place to a residence for be in fact quite stronghold in way being capable of defence for practically unlimited period by single armed man once past low narrow opening however one found in quite spacious chamber of roughly circular shape thirty foot in diameter by about twelve foot high with perfectly smooth dry sandy floor rendering cave most comfortable place of abode a discovered when have taken up quarter in thereafter have be so strenuously busy that with exception of cunningham have used cave merely a sleeping place while engineer absorbed in drawing calculation have never thought of exploring cave examining extent resting satisfied with knowledge that place be amply large enough for requirement while situation of island rendered presence of wild animal noxious reptile within impossibility so absorbed in various occupation have allowed matter to go on from day to day recognising in abstract sort of fashion fact that must be no more than act of common prudence to examine cavern daily postponing examination until more convenient season thus matter have be allowed to slide until day finally arrived when cunningham reached end of labour rather earlier than have anticipated having put away paper suddenly bethought that here at last be opportunity to give interior of cavern thorough overhaul accordingly provided with abundant supply of dry branch to serve a torch lighted one of proceeded forthwith to investigate with result about hour later startled by unexpectedly emerging from behind thick clump of bush on beach of south west bay frantically waving lighted torch in hand under influence of such violent excitement that when dropped work ran to to learn what be matter found to intent purpose incoherent for moment hurrah chap hurrah yelled waving flaming torch above head a advanced to meet be lot of lucky dog eh cheer beggar cheer split throat who must be shipwrecked if must meet with slice of luck a ours by george say temple kick old chap will ye just to convince that be awake steady man steady returned seizing by shoulder giving good shaking what in world be matter with what be excitement about mean to say that there be ship in sight standing in for island do ship retorted in accent of ineffable contempt not much there be be something infinitely better than that be son that when leave island do so a little bunch of bloated plutocrat millionaire boy millionaire millionaire ejaculated what on earth doe man mean what be driving at cunningham ca pull together tell in plain english what have happened know exclaimed parson with sudden illumination have found buried treasure ai that mr cunnin'ham ay answered cunningham be right in way chip certainly be pirate hoard have found chest heaped high with cup candlestick of gold silver jewelled weapon overflowing with necklace bracelet ring torn from person of shrieking woman be something far better than that be gold mine in heart of yonder hill gold mine returned in accent of deep disappointment surely be nothing to get into such tremendous state of excitement about have tool with to work tool repeated cunningham with withering scorn have tool will need see produced from pocket nodule of dull reddish yellow colour of irregular shape about size of small egg picked out of soil with finger there be plenty more where came from took nugget in hand examined curiously there be nothing very remarkable about excepting weight be very great for object of size be gold without doubt have seen examined gold nugget before must not be deceived where did find asked a passed thing on to murdock for inspection in cave rather in passage leading from to beach answered cunningham who have by time regained composure see continued way of be have finished calculation drawing finished rather earlier to day than expected thought that a have hour two to spare might a well employ time in giving cavern thorough overhaul accordingly provided with dry branch to serve a torch lighted up proceeded to look round then found that a have more than once suspected there be opening at back end of cavern giving access to chamber almost a large a one occupy while beyond again there be other passage chamber seven of latter in communicating with other ending in long tortuous cleft forming passage lead out there behind bush be last chamber of one nearest in direction be marvel unlike others rock chamber one about be now speaking be great hollow in what appears to be fault ' of stiff clay man alive that clay be a thick with gold nugget a pudding be thick with plum there must be more than hundredweight of nugget actually in sight protruding from wall floor of chamber one of may be picked out with other tool than man finger so what there be hidden just waiting to be dug out heaven only know there must be ton upon ton of come see for yourselves never mind about work for rest of day come look at fortune be not day that will see such sight give word well of course will guess that did not need second invitation there be five men cast away upon uncharted island in mid pacific far from usual ship track hope of rescue consisting in possibility that might be taken off sooner later by stray whaler failing that of effecting escape eventually in craft to be built by provided that must prove possessed of requisite skill to build out of material at disposal at moment under circumstance gold be just about a valueless to a pebble on beach yet such be magic of word that sooner be gold mentioned than incontinently dropped tool quite forgetting that might be fate never to escape at from island eagerly followed cunningham consumed with impatience to view wonderful find of wonderful in truth be way to be through what cunningham have aptly described a cleft outer extremity of be in face of cliff so completely concealed from beach by clump of bush that might never have be discovered except by merest accident cleft be exceedingly tortuous a to direction narrow so low that in place be necessary to go down upon hand knee to effect passage full of awkward unexpected projection rough uneven of floor with here there little pool of water have dripped from roof side traversed about mile of then suddenly emerged into great shapeless hollow in what appeared to be wide stratum of stiff brown clay sandwiched between two almost vertical layer of sandstone seemed to have be turned over during tremendous natural convulsion perhaps when island be hove up above surface of sea what cunningham have said respecting abundance of gold be strictly literally true nugget be a thickly arranged proportionately a raisin in christmas pudding there be hundred of in sight singly at distance apart of not much more than foot in little group of dozen more almost touching other within two minute dug out with finger only nugget shaped somewhat like potato a big a orange dislodging of revealed sticking in clay behind naturally with one accord went to work picking out nugget using bare finger only while who happened to have knife about used in course of hour have picked out a many nugget a must dispose about person then lessening number of torch warned that be high time to beat retreat labour seemed to have produced visible effect for where have removed one nugget have a rule disclosed estimated that during short hour of have collected average of about seven pound weight of gold now for day two after discovery threatened to be most serious misfortune for ability to acquire large quantity of gold at mere cost of exertion necessary to pick out of soil appealed so strongly to boatswain carpenter sailmaker during two day immediately following cunningham sensational announcement absolutely refused to do work except dig out nugget of gold more gathered more eager did appear to be to gather more at end of time fact that cunningham have steadfastly refrained from display of anxiety to share in good fortune having on contrary pursued task of breaking up wreck together with reiterated insistance on greater importance of work upon be engaged steadied bit by end of second day detected sign that sharp edge of enthusiasm have worn off that be once more beginning to think then cunningham proceeded to remind of fact to at outset stubbornly refused to listen namely that knew where gold be must get at time matter most vitally concerned be to get schooner built in water a quickly a possible so must become necessary for to quit island in haste might have mean to do so three recalcitrants came to see at last persuaded thereto perhaps by rather exaggerated attitude of indifference to gold on part of cunningham equally exaggerated anxiety to push on with schooner with ultimate result on morning of third day rather shamefacedly announced readiness to turn to again accompanied to south west bay what put finishing touch to matter be cunningham audacious proposal to ballast schooner entirely with gold sail in direct home to england idea very strongly appealed to somewhat crude imagination especially when engineer took sheet of paper proved to by figure that if must obtain gold enough to carry out plan value of equally divided among five of must enable to bank upward of million if judiciously invested must provide with income of somewhere about two thousand pound sterling per month such figure a naturally appealed to men whose income hitherto have amounted to about five pound per month be immediately on fire to build schooner if only to see how much gold must be induced to carry a ballast have there be shipwright in party must probably have be intensely amused at lightheartedness assured confidence with approached task of building schooner small certainly complete in respect out of timber planking of dismembered martha brown believe that anyone excepting have slightest suspicion of difficulty that be so cheerfully facing by time that have got keel block laid be preparing to shape put together keel began to dawn upon that have undertaken distinctly formidable task one in might very easily fail must once permit to become discouraged indeed getting out of keel be in work of such difficulty chip more than once threw down tool pronounced task impossible demanding revision simplification of design cunningham be deeply in love with design have worked out with so much care so indeed be therefore resolutely resisted parson demand insisted that be needed be patience resolution to take necessary pain in end got own way work proceeded proceeded with what to be painful slowness there being day occasionally on embryo ship presented precisely same appearance when knocked off work in evening that have done when started in morning whole day having be consumed in cutting out putting together several piece of timber be subsequently to be worked into hull nevertheless patience perseverance worked wonder by by after have be steadily at work for close upon six month day came when be able to stand gaze admiringly at completed skeleton of a smart little vessel a ever set eye upon if possessed fault in eye be that presented altogether too smart appearance being in model nothing le than exceedingly beautiful little yacht according to merchant seaman view of matter forty foot yacht be not precisely kind of craft best adapted to navigate thousand of mile of ocean lay between ourselves home yet when cunningham challenged to point out what regarded a fault be met at turn by argument seemed quite unanswerable so at last be driven to take refuge in adage that proof of pudding be in eating to acknowledge that if vessel only behaved half a well a designer asserted must must be more than satisfied now although there be five of young in very pink of condition engaged upon work of building schooner there be time when united strength of hand scarcely sufficed to accomplish particular task such a setting up of pair of frame bending fastening of stringer consequently welcomed almost literally with open arm arrival of two able bodied assistant who came to under somewhat singular circumstance from day of wreck when found castaway up to moment when a have said above be able to gaze upon complete skeleton of new schooner have enjoyed uninterrupted continuance of perfect weather few day after date referred to trade wind died away indication pointed toward approach of hurricane indeed be allowed barely sufficient time to make everything about shipyard secure when anticipation be realised by outburst of hurricane if be not a violent a one have shipwrecked be more than sufficiently so to compel completely to suspend building operation for two whole day spent in cavern diligently systematically digging for gold under direction supervision of cunningham may a well mention here that result of two day labour demonstrated that have be lucky enough to stumble upon what be probably most fabulously rich pocket of gold nugget have ever be discovered by man gale broke time during night of second day when awoke turned out on following morning weather have reverted to normal delightful condition only heavy south westerly sea remained a evidence of what have be think have already mentioned that be habit to proceed to fro between north south west bay in catamaran in preference to tramping two mile overland in tropical heat on particular day walked being of opinion that be hardly desirable to expose catamaran to strain of trip round end of island in so steep heavy sea knocking off work at usual time climbed cliff proceeded to walk back to north bay across plateau boatswain carpenter sailmaker leading way while cunningham followed about hundred yard behind distance be more than sufficient to allow trio to get out of sight ahead of a cunningham sauntered along very slowly have expectation of seeing anything more of murdock companion until arrival at cave consequently be little surprised upon emerging from jungle to find three seaman standing in open upon highest point of plateau gazing intently to seaward what be murdock shouted a hastened step to join anything in sight why yes mr temple answered boatswain facing round toward there be something floatin ' about couple o ' mile off there that look like boat with people in boat ejaculated where away show come here sir stand where be replied murdock then a took up position on spot indicated man placed behind proceeded to point over shoulder see that there low bush yonder mr temple just in line with finger demanded very well then just run eye along about p'int maybe little more to west'ard there d see sir ah now be vanished again in trough keep eye gazin ' in direction will there be again see sir ay do said a caught momentary glimpse of small dark object appeared for moment hovering on crest of sea then sank out of sight again a murdock have said certainly presented very much appearance of small boat drifting slowly away toward south west before freshening trade wind although glimpse have caught have be momentary thought have detected appearance of what might very well be crouching human figure sitting in presently got sight of thing impression that be indeed boat possibly canoe with one more person in be so greatly strengthened that determined there then to investigate really believe be right murdock said at event look so much like boat with people in that certainly ought to satisfy so come along one of will take catamaran go off to if really be boat there be people in be very evident that be too utterly exhausted to make island if miss will inevitably perish come along have not moment to waste if be to save daylight with one accord of companion stepped forward eager to accompany moment that there be question of saving life needed only one man chose murdock a being smartest seaman strongest man among without further ado took to heel raced to beach shouting over shoulder to cunningham to stay where be guide by signalling with hand direction in must steer a have said have not moment to waste for sun disk be even then within finger breadth of horizon darkness followed sunset with amazing swiftness in latitude murdock therefore ran at utmost speed to beach cast adrift catamaran sprang aboard thrust head offshore then threw upon halyard mast headed yard when seized steering paddle headed craft for opening between breaker on reef while murdock stationed beside with hand shielding eye a stared seaward anxiously watching for first glimpse of object of be in pursuit for moment however effort be useless a knew for object have be so far to westward when last seen that must not hope to sight until be fairly beyond limit of bay when at length happened upper edge of sun disk be just visible above western horizon sinking beneath at precise moment when catamaran shot through opening between two formidable wall of breaker be dashing into spray thirty foot high a hurled upon lava reef boat whatever be ought now to be within range of vision murdock intently scrutinised darkening sea ahead for sign of in vain then turned glance shoreward saw cunningham standing on verge of bluff vigorously waving to keep away put up hellum bit sir admonished with eye still upon cunningham then steady a saw engineer fling hand above head almost at same instant caught faintest glimpse imaginable of small dark spot appearing for moment in ghostly fashion against creaming head of distant breaker just clear of lower end of lateen yard there be exclaimed a spoke star glimmered out of deepening blue almost immediately above spot where object have appeared where away sir demanded boatswain again peering ahead under sharp of hand do see that star responded pointing with disengaged hand well be about point to westward there be again straight ahead see sir see answered murdock steady a go mr temple be bound to pick up thought so too although darkness be falling about with rapidity of sea fog gathering still star be splendid guide steering by caught two three additional glimpse of object before darkness completely enveloped moreover catamaran be slashing along at racing speed smothering with spray time hit crest of wave now chief fear be that same spray might so effectually conceal surroundings at precise moment when most needed to see namely when be surmounting comber that might unwittingly overshoot mark therefore at very brief interval admonished murdock to keep eye skinned at same time keeping a sharp lookout a must estimated that with breeze then blowing ought to cover distance between object in about six seven minute after clearing reef have mean of judging time except by guesswork out there in darkness be on tenterhook lest must miss thing stand too far out when chance must be against picking up on return journey therefore at last feeling that must be pretty close to object of quest sent murdock forward believing that must have better chance of picking up from there than by standing alongside although figure must greatly obscure own view accordingly boatswain went right forward into very eye of catamaran where must be clear of heaviest of flying spray have scarcely taken station when without looking round suddenly shouted there be sir keep away will be on to hard up sir so steady now hard down shake will do sir keep at luff bit yet sir so steady dashing aft boatswain snatched up small coil of line that have made ready for purpose hurled recklessly at dark mass at moment came sliding close past what have be lee side before luffed catamaran into wind heard splashing clatter of boot a landed upon certain object sounded like loose paddle lying washing about in bottom of canoe for such now saw craft to be saw stoop a though making fast rope have taken with then shouted fast sir let go off put up helm of catamaran a fell off began to gather fresh way murdock hauled prize up alongside scrambled out of snubbing towline to length of about two fathom be canoe sir reported a rose to foot beside there be people aboard native four five sh 'd say though did stop to count 'em be blest if know whether be alive dead think there must be life in one of at least for when jumped into stumbled over one thought heard groan well said hope have be in time to save poor beggar suspect that belong to island be visible from crater about hundred mile to south west of that be caught in gale blown out to sea if so have be at sea three whole night two day drenched time with flying spray buffeted with wind labouring hard while to keep cockleshell of craft afloat islander be not very tough when come to facing prolonged exposure of kind got catamaran round headed for island with canoe in carpenter having be thoughtful enough to light fire on beach to serve a guide to quarter of hour later be ashore again with cunningham chip sail tenderly lifting five native out of half swamped canoe laying on sand close to fire while murdock secured catamaran by time that have done cunningham have got to work upon new arrival in two of whom found sign of life while other three pronounced doubtful then under direction took body proceeded vigorously to chafe slap with bare hand varying treatment with occasional attempt to administer little stimulant with object of restoring suspended circulation of blood eventually not to dwell at unnecessary length upon episode succeeded in restoring two of remaining three defied utmost effort although worked at until late into night then having bountifully fed two survivor left to dispose of a must for night retired to cavern chapter fourteen mokalua vati when turned out on following morning two resuscitated savage be nowhere to be seen body of three dead have also vanished glance in direction of beach showed that be still somewhere on island for canoe lay hauled up on sand alongside catamaran where have left on previous night print of naked foot on sand indicated that have made three four journey to eastern extremity of bay therefore concluded that two be performing obsequies of departed companion made endeavour to discover whereabouts taking for granted that must reappear when have disposed of dead to satisfaction while be partaking of breakfast big cloud of smoke arose from wood situated at eastern extremity of bay causing to surmise that dead be at moment undergoing process of cremation made attempt to investigate leaving savage to own device for day proceeding to shipyard a usual immediately after breakfast shortly after midday two savage hove in sight making way down cliff path to shipyard having evidently followed path over plateau have beaten in frequent passage to fro between two bay displayed fear of approaching without slightest hesitation exhibiting more curiosity than native with whom have thus far be brought into contact seemed to be filled with astonishment at whiteness of skin when following usual custom discarded scanty clothing plunged into sea for few minute before partaking of midday meal did not appear to be able to understand how be that while face neck hand arm be almost a dark a own skin remaining portion of body ordinarily protected from sun by clothing must be so very much lighter be not oppressed by feeling of false modesty bashfulness examined minutely at close quarter jabbering together with utmost animation while lightly running finger over arm neck with apparent purpose of finding join in differently coloured portion of skin be very well of course sufficiently amusing to concerned now that two savage have come to quite intended to make use of allow to work for living therefore a soon a have resumed clothing murdock undertook task of making known intention wish to dusky friend way did be amusing enough in common with others of kind have repeatedly be brought into contact with foreigner of various nationality civilised savage have one simple method of communicating with method be firmly convinced must be efficacious in exact proportion to measure of intelligence possessed by person with whom desired to communicate that method be to speak to stranger in broken english for example proposed to set two native to task of collecting fuel for purpose of cooking fish chip sail be about to catch for midday meal by going offshore short distance in catamaran way did be something like turning to two native poked first one then other on naked chest with forefinger to secure attention then proceeded to remark with much flourishing of hand now then johnnie jim come along wi gather firewood savvy to native naturally responded with blank stare of non comprehension gradually merging into broad smile then seeing that first attempt have not be exactly success boatswain proceeded upon usual line assuming aspect of intense earnestness holding forefinger up before continued now lookee here coffee coloured sweep wantee come alonga catchee plenty wood for makee fire cookee fis ' two men be goin ' for catchee now then d 'ye savvy that intonation of concluding word doubt conveyed to mind of hearer idea that be asking question for two savage turned to other exchanged few word then elder with broad smile pointed first to uttered word mokalua easily understood must be name then to companion pronouncing word vati be a certainly name of other so evident be even murdock understood proud of quick comprehension hastened to display cleverness by prodding first native in chest remarking ay ay be easy enough to understand name mokalua yours turning to other be vati that be right can see that will soon get to understand other now then mokalua vati let have try wantee plenty much firewood so two come helpy gatheree comprenny further blank look from native at boatswain lost patience clutching mokalua by wrist while seized unhappy vati by shoulder violently swung round with face toward cliff exclaimed savagely here come along o ' two be like monkey can understand wo for fear o ' bein ' put to work get over quite so easily a son have have that trick tried on before did come off ai comin ' off now have got to work for livin ' while be on here hisland forget ca understand language ca ye well can speak language with boot saw that time have arrived for to interfere murdock be rapidly working up into rage when be angry be little apt to be violent also be exceptionally powerful man while two native whom held in grasp be still weak from semi starvation long exposure be beginning to look rather frightened now did not want to be frightened wanted to win confidence so stepped forward gently removed boatswain grasp from person of prisoner saying there will do murdock get excited man because two bronze image can not understand can not understand know so be quits will just have to be patient with treat kindly have doubt that in due time will learn to understand what want to do then turning to two wide eyed savage trusting that must at least understand intonation of voice patted good naturedly on shoulder said in english of course be right be afraid of will not hurt be quite good natured chap want to go with to wood yonder so run along first pointed to jungle then to murdock patted encouragingly on back finally waved hand toward cliff be tolerably successful in general sort of way be at once evident for expression of mingled fear savagery on mokalua feature at once vanished giving place to smile nodded head pointed to murdock vati waved hand toward wood said few quick word to companion at once set off at brisk walk toward cliff path accompanied by two others trio returning about twenty minute later with abundant supply of dry twig branch with at once proceeded to build constituent of fire be evident from action quick earnest interchange of remark that two be exceedingly curious a to how be going to set light to wood now that have looked on with most absorbed interest while cunningham took little dry moss in hand focused sun ray upon with burning glass afterwards fanning into flame by gently whirling in air will not readily forget amazement when moss burst into flame cunningham thrust into heart of heap of stick when cunningham made to return lens to pocket mokalua held out hand said something readily understood to be request that might be permitted to look at when engineer handed over to native first examined with wondering eye turning about in hand holding up becoming quite eloquent in expression of amazement when quick eye detected inverted image of landscape seen through then after one two futile attempt succeeded in focusing ray of sun upon naked arm giving little yelp a felt sting of heat finally with laugh handed lens back to cunningham there be covetous look in eye a did so caused to utter word of warning to engineer lest must awake fine morning discover that burning glass have mysteriously vanished in such manner to accompaniment of quite number of amusing little incident did mokalua vati become member of small community glad enough be to have for awkwardness inconvenience arising from inability to understand other speech soon passed away two savage manifesting extraordinary aptitude to adapt to situation equally extraordinary facility in comprehension of what be required of so that rapidly became of very material value to catching more fish than party must consume gathering firewood for teaching new method of cooking assisting in more laborious portion of shipyard work thus by time have be with three four month began to wonder how have ever contrived to rub along at without one fault be ineradicable propensity to steal anything everything that must lay hand upon especially nail will be understood be of very considerable value to situated a then be most serious peccadillo one have most disastrous result be theft of brace of revolver number of cartridge have occasion to make use of firearm until two savage have be with about five month then on certain day made disagreeable discovery that south west bay have be invaded by school of seven eight orca killer whale most voracious ferocious creature swim sea being even more terrible than white shark although not quite so big a be when first became aware of presence of tiger of sea in bay be not greatly concerned being under impression that theirs be only flying visit that must disappear in course of hour so be more seen when on following day be seen to be still present when further chose to amuse by snatching fish off hook came to conclusion that be time to declare war upon orca for so long a remained in bay might not dare to bathe accordingly armed with revolver put boarding pike cutlas into hand of of savage went out in catamaran to attack drive away orca very fierce desperate battle have with too for proved to be full of fight charging catamaran with evident intention of destroying during two hour that fight raged experienced several exceedingly narrow escape from destruction by wounded cetacean though drove off at last after killing two while survivor be so desperately wounded that doubt died very shortly after reaching open ocean most important point however in connection with incident be that two savage then saw revolver used for first time flash report above undoubted fact that in mysterious fashion be able to wound even to kill at distance of spear cast absolutely fascinated nothing must satisfy that must posse revolver apiece very next day stole brace together with fifty cartridge having watched intently thus acquired smattering of knowledge of how to use weapon took to wood where later on heard popping away in most reckless fashion that of course be offence must never do to overlook therefore sallied forth captured culprit took revolver half dozen so remaining cartridge from having first read severe lecture one of many such upon heinousness of stealing endeavoured to create lasting impression upon mind by inflicting upon severe rope ending four day later found that canoe together with several small article cunningham burning glass among number have vanished now be likely enough to prove very serious matter for for several important reason in first place mokalua vati have proved to be individual possessed of quite considerable amount of intelligence for savage have spent five month with during have come to know island intimately doubtless have perceived among other thing that be capable of supporting five hundred fellow savage in what to must be condition of ease affluence also knew that there be five of possessing several thing to represented such incalculable wealth that effort on part to acquire must be regarded a too great therefore at once jumped to conclusion animated by deep sense of resentment at indignity have inflicted upon by flogging possibly also spurred on by overpowering cupidity have determined to risk very life in attempt to return to own island there to report that have seen learned during sojourn with with object of stirring up fellow islander to organise expedition against strongly impressed with conviction that be really what have happened sailmaker hastened to stock catamaran with provision water enough to last for four day forthwith proceeded to sea heading in direction of island lay to leeward of in hope of overtaking two savage before must arrive at destination inducing by persuasion by force to return with be fully justified in hoping that must be successful for catamaran be wonderfully speedy craft especially before wind calculated that savage must scarcely average more than four knot per hour paddling in open sea even with wind in favour while catamaran must do ten easily consequently must cover in ten hour distance must need twenty five hour to traverse since must probably not have more than nine hour start of ought to catch long before must arrive at island be about eight o'clock in morning when started moment that be clear of reef bore up dead before wind thereafter be necessary be to keep catamaran running straight before took for granted that fugitive like must avail of direction of wind a guide consequently assumed that be somewhere probably about thirty six mile directly ahead of when bore away very simple calculation enabled to determine that if data happened to be correct ought to overtake canoe about two o'clock in afternoon therefore for first four hour of pursuit troubled only to maintain a straight course a possible at end of time however about midday by time own island be out of sight astern while other have not yet hove up above horizon deemed advisable to take look round accordingly turning over steering paddle to simpson shinned up to catamaran masthead remained there for fully five minute intently scrutinising surface of sea in direction range of vision at elevation covering circle of about nine mile radius there be nothing in sight at be in nowise surprised a estimated that canoe be still about twelve mile ahead of calculated however that be gaining upon at rate of about six mile hour in case ought to be on horizon verge in course of half hour therefore at expiration of time again went aloft be just trifle disappointed to find horizon still bare however be quite certain that run of half hour must suffice to bring into view therefore at one o'clock again ascended to masthead quite prepared to see directly ahead again be disappointed for horizon be bare in direction save for fact that a straight ahead of a though have seen be steering for while there be delicate blue shape instantly recognised a upper part of island that have seen from lip of crater on own island be decidedly nonplussed at fact that fugitive be still invisible knew not how to account for true sea be trifle heavy for navigation in so frail craft a small canoe yet two savage be expert in handling of such craft be therefore scarcely likely that have met with mishap of description indeed be needed to ensure perfect safety be to keep canoe dead before sea must go along without shipping drop of water even comparatively inexpert a be must not have hesitated to undertake such voyage under influence of so powerful inducement a suspected to animate two native there be one other possible explanation of thought a stood up there on swaying yard be that fugitive might have secured piece of canvas material of kind out of have manufactured sail in case speed must doubt be considerably higher than have estimated calculation must need revision considerably perturbed at thought descended to deck mentioned matter to simpson who agreed with that be quite possible dark friend might have taken precaution to provide with sail when have made up mind to return to own island for have not allowed time before departure to overhaul belonging in detail ascertain precise extent of depredation even if have not stolen of canvas be past master of art of mat making might easily have plaited for sail of fine grass must answer purpose almost a well a one made of canvas if have done that what must speed probably be canoe be only small craft of about twenty four foot long by about four foot beam with two men in must probably run before wind sea at speed of about six half knot then still allowing to have have nine hour start of came to disconcerting conclusion at precise moment when be discussing question must be within ten mile of destination while still have run of fifty mile before in case of course be hopeless for to dream of overtaking nevertheless did not intend to abandon chase until have fully satisfied that fugitive have made good escape therefore continued to stand on hour after hour until by time that sun be within hour of setting have brought strange island hull up on horizon ahead have satisfied ourselves that there be canoe between be considerably more extensive island than own being about twenty mile long from north to south somewhat rugged of surface with plenty of tree dotted about here there wide patch of cleared ground in between upon crop of various kind seemed to be growing rose rather steeply from water surface to height of fifty sixty foot then went sweeping grandly away to right left in constantly steepening slope culminated in lofty isolated peak occupying practically centre of island when have run in close enough to note detail brought wind over catamaran port quarter headed so a to pas to southward of island being determined now that have come so far to sail right round see a much a must of sun be just dipping beneath horizon when having brought most southerly extremity of island square upon starboard beam two mile distant shifted helm jibing over brought wind on starboard quarter hauling up to northward westward to skirt lee side of island course soon brought in under lee of land into smooth water when maintaining offing of about two mile that might not be becalmed so invite risk of capture by dash of canoe from shore quietly coasted along lee side of island now discovered to be roughly crescent shaped in plan with deep indentation on west side protected by barrier reef thus forming magnificent natural harbour eight mile long from north to south by about six mile wide from east to west fine sandy beach skirted whole margin of indentation scattered along at brief interval caught sight of ten twelve little village of palm leaf hut nestling in midst of luxuriant coconut grove land behind soaring steeply away to summit of cone abreast of village beach be dotted with canoe of be big enough to carry forty fifty men nowhere did see sign of canoe of be in pursuit ultimately be driven to conclusion that have made run across under sail have secured sufficiently long start to enable to make good escape be about four bell in first watch when ran out from under lee of island once more felt full strength of trade wind in interim have freshened up until be now blowing single reefed topsail breeze at once catamaran began to deluge with spray a brought close to wind started on long beat back to own island now became necessary for to use little discretion lest must miss island altogether for be far below horizon have chronometer sextant to help to find again all knew a to position being that lay about hundred mile dead to windward therefore held on upon starboard tack until midnight thereafter tacked four hour knowing that by following plan must be certain to pick up sooner later so did catching first glimpse of shortly after nine o'clock next morning when hove into view above horizon broad on port bow rising little higher a brought abeam then gradually sinking again a swung aft to port quarter a soon a sank out of sight hove catamaran about when quickly reappeared rising steadily above horizon time showing much higher more clearly before began to sink again finally about six o'clock just before sunset slid into north bay once more beached catamaran much to relief of companion who be beginning to grow somewhat anxious a to how queer shaped craft must stand continuous strain of beating to windward for many hour at stretch against strong wind heavy sea now that pursuit be over have failed be together again began to realise a discussed incident just what flight of two native meant to meant several thing one of spelt d n g e r to in big black letter danger of most imminent deadly kind danger be liable now to swoop down upon at moment if caught unprepared simply to wipe out of existence in word meant that if two fugitive have succeeded in reaching own island a have only too much reason to believe be case be liable at moment to invasion in force from fellow islander if must not repel invasion better still effect own escape before happened must hope for nothing short of annihilation long anxiously discussed question night decision at finally arrived be that if mokalua vati have indeed reached own island must probably take at least week to gain ear of chief tell story of own sojourn with stir up to condition of cupidity a must induce to undertake expedition against when have accomplished so much must probably take week to organise expedition get across to possibly even longer if trade wind continued to blow strongly considered therefore that have about fortnight in to complete preparation question then arose whether preparation must be of defensive character whether by working hard must complete schooner ballast get into water leave island before expected invasion took place common sense pointed to latter alternative a by far wiser of two only difficulty be that be by mean sure that must accomplish fortunately for although have put most implicit faith in fidelity of mokalua vati have never allowed to become aware of existence of subterranean passage from dwelling cave to south west bay therefore if worst must come to worst be attacked before be ready to leave island might doubt barricade into cavern make good stand there perhaps even defend schooner from destruction so long a cartridge held out if invader must once succeed in effecting landing upon island must almost to dead certainty prevent from completing preparation launching schooner getting away in finally matter seemed to resolve into fight against time aim being to complete schooner sail in for home before savage must arrive upon scene in accordance with arrangement then proceeded with several labour commencing work day moment that there be light enough to see what be about working steadily on until must see no longer encouraged by thought although calculation seemed to indicate possibility of attack within about fortnight of flight of two native force of circumstance might perhaps afford still longer time in to complete task with passage of day began to realise work a hard a might must need nearly double time believed have at disposal if be to finish work a ought to be finished for while schooner hull be complete deck be only partially laid that task have to be completed together with deck fitting such a companion way fore scuttle seam must be properly caulked paid mast stepped rigged sail finished bent interior fitting such a bunk locker shelf so on fixed water cask stowed filled ballast stowed provision collected put on board little craft generally completed in readiness for sea true many of job be trivial did not need much time to attend to in aggregate presented quite formidable appearance lastly most formidable of there remained launching way to finish cradle to build wedging up to be done taken altogether task seemed to be impossible one only hope lay in chance that savage neighbour must so far resemble mokalua vati in character that must proceed with preparation for invasion regarded a inevitable with same placid deliberation absence of haste have be such strongly marked characteristic of two fugitive yet must not do to count upon therefore a soon a fully realised impossibility of completing schooner getting away in within fortnight so far modified plan a to devote certain amount of time to putting of cavern into condition of defence fortunately for be very simple matter for savage knew of only one entrance to cavern namely that in north bay be so exceedingly small that might easily be blocked from inside with few large stone a luck must have stone admirably adapted for purpose existed in cavern only needed moving forward close to entrance after a tested by experiment five minute work must suffice to block opening so effectually that nothing le than powder charge must ever clear accordingly divided weapon ammunition into two equal part one of part put aboard schooner while other deposited in mouth of cavern then having secured ourselves a far a be possible against attack returned to work upon schooner with redoubled energy dawn of twenty third day after flight of mokalua vati found in high feather for strenuous labour of preceding three week have brought to point that few hour further work must see completion of task further work required being needed to finish cradle wedge up preparatory to launching have be working systematically attending first to matter be most urgent with result that schooner be now finished ready for sea with ballast consisting entirely of a much gold in nugget a cunningham calculation showed must possibly carry properly stowed water cask stowed filled provision on board mast stepped rigged sail bent in short everything completed except fitting equipment of cabin that decided must be done a easily after little ship have be launched a while remained on stock on particular morning then be a have said in high feather for awoke with comfortable assurance that barring accident schooner must be safely afloat before again lay down to rest now although have be working so strenuously during past three week have not omitted to take proper precaution against surprise on part of native most important of precaution consisting in visit of one of to summit of crater first thing morning from commanding elevation sea to south west be carefully scanned with aid of cunningham telescope in search of expected flotilla of canoe same precaution be observed last thing before nightfall decided must sea prove to be clear on occasion there be not much risk of being surprised during of interval between on particular morning before referred to chanced to be turn to make journey up mountain therefore taking telescope in case from rock projection in cavern be recognised resting place bidding companion au revoir started out on three half mile walk to summit while others hurried down to beach getting aboard catamaran made sail for south west bay where shipyard be situated now whole distance from cavern to summit of crater be uphill day in addition to being brilliantly fine be excessively hot for trade wind have softened down on preceding day be now blowing only very moderate breeze therefore did not greatly hurry for way lay practically for whole distance to foot of crater through jungle where although be sheltered to great extent from ray of sun be also shielded from wind before have travelled mile be perspiring profusely hot a be while walking through jungle be hotter still when at length emerged from shelter upon bare hillside have sooner climbed above level of vegetation be able to look over top of than flung down upon big block of lava took off hat proceeded to wipe away perspiration be by time streaming down forehead into eye half blinding be while be thus engaged happened to allow gaze to wander away out over surface of water in south westerly direction then saw sight caused to spring to foot with smothered exclamation for far out upon sun flecked blue of gently ruffled ocean caught glimpse of first one then small dark dot of emitted frequent sparkling flash instantly identified a sunlight striking upon wet blade of swiftly wielded paddle with anxious haste gripped telescope case swung round withdrew telescope raised to eye focused there magnified into unmistakable distinctness by powerful lens saw le than ten canoe paddling straight for island only eight mile distant from west point a have named headland projected into ocean between north south west bay be head on to therefore must not very well judge what size might be knew that must be fairly big craft carrying considerable number of men judging by multitudinous number of flash sparkled from paddle a swung rhythmically into out of water be keeping line too for whole ten swung up into view together on crest of sea then disappeared again in trough with almost mathematical regularity precision without doubt anticipated invasion of island by savage be about to take place equally without doubt too invader must gain footing upon territory before be prepared to quit unless plan must be devised whereby advance might be delayed for two three hour a thought flashed through mind anxiously scanned surface of ocean for other canoe must find only ten have originally counted then without wasting time in ascending to summit of crater set off at run raced at utmost speed way back to cavern be downhill way despite intense heat think be more than twenty minute in covering distance once inside cavern provided with sufficient number of torch for purpose lighted dozen of to enable to see what be about then proceeded to block entrance securely from inside with stone have already provided for express purpose done opened case of ammunition kept stored in cavern loaded gun brace of revolver thrust latter in belt crammed pocket bosom of shirt with cartridge seizing torch hurried away through tunnel to shipyard in south west bay where found companion strenuously at work upon completion of cradle blissfully ignorant of fact that savage be at moment within dozen mile of glanced at with somewhat startled expression a dashed down beach toward with gun in hand revolver in belt face streaming with perspiration cunningham shouted hillo old chap be hot look a though have be hurrying what be up surely mean to say that savage be coming interrupted be just what do mean to say then be within dozen mile of at moment ten big canoe load of will be ashore here about ear in two hour from now unless can devise mean of preventing how be getting on chip how long will be before be ready to wedge up not for three four hour yet be afraid answered carpenter pausing in work to consider matter see have good deal to do yet afore can finish here cradle wood bein ' nothin odds end like be comin ' bit awk'ard just so quite understand cut in upon explanation well carry on man stop instant ca afford to waste so much a single second just now do best can with resource at command work a never worked before a for be going to take out catamaran to meet beggar see if ca hamper bit prevent from landing here in bay have blocked cavern entrance at other end so wo matter much where land so long a come ashore here that must be prevented at cost will want one hand with to sail catamaran while do fighting now who can best be spared why think be most useless member of party began cunningham interrupted emphatically engineering knowledge must come in very usefully in helping chip to use up odds end of timber to best advantage in completing cradle be man for simpson so jump now get aboard schooner open box of ammunition bring a many cartridge a can carry also gun in case anything go wrong with one then join aboard catamaran now so long chap be off do level best to finish off wedge up a soon a possible will do what can to hinder savage keep from landing here goodbye so saying turned ran toward spot where catamaran lay with bow hauled up on beach chapter fifteen escape by skin of teeth in few minute sail joined with extra gun biscuit tin full of cartridge between got catamaran afloat swung round with bow pointing seaward jumped aboard then while seized steering paddle simpson sprang to main halyard hoisted big lateen sail at once filled when gathered headway began to draw away from shore heading about south west out of bay a soon a sail be fully set halyard belayed sail came aft took helm while gave spare gun overhaul before loading a drew out from under lee of island began to feel true breeze became apparent that be fast freshening up again for must see head of sea bursting into little patch of white froth here there at be profoundly grateful for felt that fresh breeze dead in teeth be likely to hamper progress of savage quite a much a must hope to do minute of delay now be worth gold mine to that advance of savage be indeed being retarded by rapidly freshening breeze soon became apparent for be fully three mile offshore when at length made out canoe about two mile to leeward of heading straight in for island running rapidly down toward soon neared sufficiently to enable to see that be big lumping craft about sixty foot long by six seven foot beam canoe being manned by about fifty savage mother son of whom be wielding short broad bladed paddle a though life depended upon yet canoe be not making very much headway for be unwieldy looking craft with long high peaked overhanging bow stern seemed to catch hold good deal of wind making paddling of to windward especially against heavy head sea exceedingly hard work to do anything really effective with craft especially to make good shooting in heavy sea be running be necessary to get to close quarter with therefore directed simpson to haul up two three point to northward intention being to pas flotilla on port beam come to wind a soon a have passed cross stern raking a passed then follow maintaining steady fire way crowding up to northward a much a possible so that might not land in south west bay approach be greeted with yell of defiance from crowded canoe many of occupant of dropped paddle sprang to foot hurled long spear at a swept past at distance of two hundred yard from nearest canoe be expert in hurling of spear savage be part of plan to run risk of getting simpson hurt two of against five hundred left room for quixotic display of daring be careful to keep beyond range of spear one of dropped harmlessly into water at varying distance from nearest of falling short by about thirty forty fathom if be anxious that of must be hurt be also anxious to avoid hurting savage a far a might be object being not so much to destroy a to prevent from landing on island if possible thought that might perhaps be done savage compelled to retreat by drilling canoe so full of bullet hole at least of must sink when remainder must become so crowded that must be found impossible to continue paddling to windward for took for granted that if one two of canoe sank crew must be picked up by rest of course there be risk that in endeavouring to sink canoe might wound even kill few savage be lookout not mine therefore when antagonist opened ball by casting spear at retaliated by seizing gun aiming at water line of nearest canoe expecting bullet to pas right through leaving two hole must admit quite quantity of water unless savage happened to posse mean to plug shot went true for a smoke blew away saw small white puncture show in bottom of canoe for instant before be hidden by roll of craft loud yell of astonishment greeted first essay showing that particular savage have never before have experience of firearm yell be not wholly result of astonishment for saw native clap hand to leg shrewdly guessed that bullet have punctured a well a canoe have time to drop discharged gun seize loaded one fire second shot before be fairly past that particular craft that second shot be le successful than first for missed canoe however caught native who sprang convulsively to foot hand clutching head a wheeling half round staggered backward tumbled head over heel into sea naturally expected that friend must stop endeavour to pick up not bit of merely uttered yell apparently of encouragement to other drove paddle into water with increased energy gun being now empty signed simpson to come to wind luff athwart stern of flotilla while busied upon recharging of piece by time that be done be on starboard quarter of most southerly of canoe immediately proceeded to test skill upon making short tack across stern fired dozen bullet into one of hit five out of six wounding disabling one more of occupant a well a drilling hole in canoe with result that began to drop astern of others crew of be exerting to very utmost having apparently come to conclusion that sooner must reach island better must be for wherefore attacked next canoe in like manner now be le careful than before in matter of hurting occupant for began to dawn upon that savage have notion of standing by to help disabled consort do what must must not possibly prevent of at least from effecting landing therefore business must be to see that a few of a possible must set foot on island incidentally found that by persistently attacking southernmost canoe be slowly surely effecting one part of purpose by causing whole flotilla to edge slowly away to northward thus diverting from purpose that might have have of landing in south west bay then plan suggested to saw that savage be either destitute of mean to plug bullet hole in canoe have not wit enough to make use of canoe appeared to carry several large calabash bowl be used a balers plan therefore be to shoot promptly at man whom saw attempting to bale leaky canoe with result that particular canoe happened to be attacking gradually filled ultimately swamped leaving crew to cling helplessly to a floated full to gunwale to strike out for island now three mile distant since fellow swam like seal there be doubt that must ultimately reach unless shark happened to encounter on way did not allow probability of ultimate arrival on island to worry much for felt tolerably certain that before must happen must have made good escape if indeed be going to escape at effective antagonist be now reduced to eight canoe crew who be hanging together a much a possible for mutual protection be making poor headway against steadily increasing wind sea if must hinder still further so much better most obvious way to do be to weaken crew by wounding a many a possible therefore now resumed original tactic of tacking to fro athwart stern raking a passed soon found be very excellent plan for not infrequently happened that by mode of attack be able to make one bullet do double in case even treble duty result being that by time that drew up abreast of island entire fleet be in such difficulty that be scarcely able to make headway at two of canoe indeed being so seriously crippled that at last notwithstanding close proximity to island be actually compelled to bear up run away to leeward again while of be swamped leaving five out of original ten still to contend with now trouble began in earnest for so desperate be savage rendered by merciless persecution to have compelled in self defence to subject that made most strenuous effort to get into south west bay indeed be not until bore up took extreme risk of running down one canoe be finally able to turn from purpose ultimately after running fight if so one sided affair must be so called four of contrived to weather north west cape effect landing in north bay then after chasing right into bay keeping up brisk fire upon until landed to number of about one hundred twenty vanished into wood in catamaran bore up headed out to sea again made best of way back to south west bay shipyard hoping that upon arrival must find schooner afloat for have be gone fully four hour to intense disappointment when entered bay there be schooner still high dry upon stock with chip boatswain cunningham busily engaged in turning over small pile of lumber still remained from dismembered wreck of martha presently one of looked up saw coming apparently reported fact to others for cunningham at once straightened up came down to water edge to meet well temple exclaimed a catamaran grounded stepped ashore how have thing gone with have managed to beat off friend enemy have not answered just trifle sourly be afraid hundred more of have landed round there in north bay may confidently expect visit from within next half hour what mischief have fellow be up to time fully expected to find schooner afloat under way only awaiting return to be off what have be doing playing poker what now dear chap go turn rusty a well a rest of there be knowing what may happen for let tell be just a savage a bear with sore head remonstrated cunningham continued have not be playing poker hunt slipper even kiss in ring to put plainly have be trying to do impossible long short of be temple that have used up last scrap of available timber there still remains good half hour work to be done on cradle before dare start to wedge up have be nailing plugging bit together working in to best of ability until last nail be expended now seem to be at standstill will be shot if know how be going to get over difficulty what do mean to tell that after getting a far a that be brought to standstill for sake of few piece of timber demanded how much do require oh very little be answer few foot ten fifteen foot of three inch stuff must serve mischief of be that have got even remains of wreck will not yield inch then said remains be to break into catamaran take out of a much a be required have served turn will not require more if can get schooner into water kick kick hard shouted cunningham in ecstasy of delight a smote blow between shoulder made stagger catamaran continued of course oh what lot of fool be not to have thought of before suddenly bethinking if have must have be of use for have be available now however in ten minute will rip enough stuff out of to finish job know exactly where to find kind of stuff want chip ahoy bring tool down to catamaran son be going to break up carpenter flung hand aloft in joyous intimation that understood at once made dash for tool while simpson wended way to schooner to see how thing looked in direction also to forage for morsel of food for have eaten nothing since breakfast be feeling pretty hungry single glance at cradle when wedged up must lift schooner off keel block throw weight upon launching way sufficed to reveal pitiful strait to chip have latterly be reduced for worked into there be scrap of wood le than foot in length fastened to other piece of similar size with nail plug presenting most flimsy unsatisfactory appearance when came to look more closely saw that only unsatisfactory part of work be appearance be not nearly so flimsy a at first sight have appeared to be chip have evidently fully realised responsibility have taken care let material be what might there must be nothing faulty about workmanship saw also that given necessary amount of material must be able to finish work in very short time boatswain routed out food for while simpson sat down to eat drink murdock upon instruction went down to catamaran carpenter cunningham have already attacked brought away from two gun ammunition remained from engagement with savage when have performed errand bade get aboard schooner rout out few extra gun further supply of ammunition load weapon then station in bow a lookout with special instruction to keep wary eye upon neighbouring cliff report very first indication of approach of enemy boatswain have scarcely be on lookout matter of twenty minute when hailed mr temple shouted wish 'd come up here sir for minute bring that there glass of mr cunnin'ham along with ye there be some'at up there on top o cliff ca rightly make out 'd like to come have look at accordingly up went with cunningham telescope still slung over shoulder joined murdock where stood right in eye of schooner peering intently at particular spot on top of cliff now then said withdrawing telescope from case where be mysterious something that ca make out ye see that there big tree with thick knobbly lookin ' trunk up there sir demanded pointing well just to nor'ard of there be bush with lot of white flower upon see that replied that did very well continued companion two three time have seemed to see somethin ' movin among there white flower ca be quite yes be right see there be something somebody there interrupted having brought glass to bear upon spot while murdock be speaking ah now have lost again continued be certain saw dark face peering through branch here let have gun if there be really anybody there will give scare if nothing worse so saying took loaded gun keeping eye firmly fixed on spot stretched prone on deck with barrel of weapon resting upon rail of schooner very low bulwark sighting piece carefully brought to bear immediately on spot where thought have seen face then waited patiently for reappearance minute after minute passed nothing appeared presently cunningham carpenter came up beach staggering under load of timber promised to be amply sufficient for need began to think must have be mistaken be about to lay aside gun descend to beach again when boatswain who have taken glass from have be intently peering through murmured there 't be again mr temple stop minute be gone 'tai have ye got piece bearin ' dead upon spot sir answered that have then stand by when give word just press trigger sir please wait bit ah there be fire on instant pressed trigger a smoke cleared away thought saw slight momentary disturbance of foliage about spot at have aimed then be still again got sir a sure a egg be young chicken exclaimed murdock still peering through glass if did actooaly get amended give scare that wo forget in blue moon will just slip up there mr temple see if can find anything certainly not replied severely can not afford to take risk besides what doe matter remain here reload that gun keep glass maintain bright lookout if see savage attempting to sneak down upon beach shoot without hesitation what be chiefly afraid of be that will muster up there in force attempt to overwhelm with rush be going below to lend others hand found cunningham parson simpson working at high pressure under bow for have of course heard shot did not need to be told that indicated presence of enemy though whether in force only in form of scout none of must tell fact that even one of savage have already made way across to side of island be spur enough to energy now worked a probably none of have ever worked before in endeavour to complete cradle wedge up launch schooner before enemy must muster courage enough to charge home upon if thing a last must happen must only mean loss of few life by savage nothing must possibly save have be down on beach about five minute when slight hissing sound reached ear next moment long triple barbed exceedingly formidable looking spear struck sand remained quivering there within about ten foot of at same instant murdock shouted from above mr temple mr temple sir wish 'd come up here take place be musterin up there on top o ' cliff can see movin ' about among bush ai ne'er good enough shot for job have told off for if shoot miss once twice will rush a sure a be alive sir while if two three of 'em be bowled over might hold back bit give more time come quick sir if please believe be gettin ready for rush there be sound sense in what boatswain said be not good enough shot quite cool enough in handling of firearm to stop rush therefore determined to act on suggestion only cunningham be quite a good shot a if not better therefore turned to cunningham said hear what murdock say be right be crack shot of party so please go up relieve at once before come down get to bring up gun from below entire stock of cartridge make load weapon place handy for go at once please remember must shoot to kill dear chap began cunningham then cut short go at once sir exclaimed sharply be time for arguing please remember command here right be old chap understand replied went without further ado a turned to leave spear came whizzing through air stuck in sand exactly where have be standing second earlier matter be beginning to look serious for if savage have among a certainly have men capable of hurling spear from top of cliff a far a schooner one other of might be hurt even killed at moment couple of minute passed heard voice of cunningham murdock a talked together overhead showing that engineer have taken up post simpson be holding piece of timber in position while parson secured when suddenly saw tall savage step boldly out from among bush on top of cliff poising long spear in hand gave weapon preliminary jerk a though to test balance then flung high above head in act of casting be about to shout to cunningham calling attention to fellow when gun cracked sharply out overhead savage spun round upon heel staggered backward fell crashing in among bush good shot shouted say cunningham keep murdock up there with to reload can do very well without down here all right came answer will if be sure that need ah by jove there be of cunningham shot took fellow in leg for saw clap hand to right one just above knee go limping away out of sight apparently savage believed that discharge of weapon left temporarily harmless for man instantly sprang into view hurriedly poised spear cunningham be too quick for for too dropped lay still then lay perdu for few minute during at work upon cradle put in splendid work suddenly with final tap of hammer chip sprang back tossed tool in air cleverly catching by handle a fell finished yelled on note of exultation now mr temple simpson get maul let wedge up will have to be rather rough ready job be afraid once weight of be off block on to way need trouble much now if mr cunnin'ham can spare bobeun will be useful to come along sail will take starboard side while mr temple murdock take port will see get finished first hailed cunningham asking if must spare murdock replied that be at moment reloading whole battery of gun after must send down presently murdock came now then boatswain said wedge up ' be word so take maul strike with chip mate think can beat will show thing two now then strike forthwith air began to resound with blow of iron on wood a with more le dexterous stroke drove wedge home one pair after in about ten minute met under little vessel counter work completed savage evidently suspected that matter be approaching crisis possibly idea be suggested to by carpenter triumphant yell of finished upon completion of cradle for during momentous ten minute several of have made desperate effort to transfix with spear a have now adopted plan of making attempt in group of dozen more to of whom be manifestly impossible for cunningham to attend at same moment four at work under schooner bottom have have two three exceedingly narrow escape now mr temple exclaimed carpenter excitedly will just take look fore aft under bottom to make sure that be clear everywhere when sing out clear will rest please jump aboard stand by to cover with rifle protect from rush while knock away spur shore launch little hooker might drop few rope end over side especially over bow for to swing aboard by a soon a start to run down way if bronze coloured skowbanks up on cliff there try to run in upon with spear while be down under give toko for if be hurted afore spur shore be knocked away may have lot of trouble yet ah blest if did think so a cunningham shot cracked out thrice two native tumbled headlong down face of cliff while third hurriedly scrambled back to cover be guessin ' that if look sharp will get away from 'em a'ter so please keep keen eye on sir ay ay chip will answered now get along with inspection man a lively a please for see sign of movement among up there simpson to sailmaker jump aboard lend mr cunningham hand to reload gun when have done that drop few rope end over side for chip to climb aboard by by time have finished speaking carpenter have crept in under schooner bottom be hastily yet carefully assuring that vessel keel have be everywhere lifted clear of keel block le than three minute sufficed to complete examination when shouted signal clear immediately began to pound upon heel of spur shore with maul while murdock made dash for ladder afforded access to schooner deck be clear that savage have by time gained tolerably accurate conception of what be about have begun to realise unless acted at once be likely to slip through hand after for sooner did boatswain jump for ladder than set up fierce yell about hundred of broke cover began to scramble down cliff face shouting encouragement to other a swung sprang from one projection to tossing spear war club down to beach beneath in order that might have use of hand during hurried descent naturally expected that cunningham must open fire upon forthwith did not for be at moment busily reloading discharged weapon moreover appeared that have better plan at moment savage be moving so rapidly so erratically a swung down cliff face accurate shooting must have be exceedingly difficult instant that first native reached beach paused for second to seize club handful of spear from have be cast down from summit of cliff engineer lying prone on deck with weapon resting on low rail of schooner bulwark covered next instant shot rang out man toppled over mortally hit then cunningham passed empty weapon back to simpson receiving loaded one in stead in like manner bowled over second third of savage who reached beach must not last long a must easily see upon reaching side for savage be now swarming down cliff so rapidly in such number that be impossible to load gun quickly enough to cope with a murdock dashed forward joined other two in eye of schooner saw that about dozen of savage have reached beach unhurt be at instant gathering together to make combined rush now lad said be where revolver be going to come in useful wait until arrive within twenty yard of then open upon with barker get excited fire wild do must make shot tell hurrah hearties there go spur shore a heard clatter down felt sudden tremor thrill through schooner now look out here come watch for men who pause to hurl spear do best to bowl over be moving lad be moving hurrah minute will be afloat now look out give bean here come yes be coming with vengeance not only dozen who formed a be vanguard of rush twenty thirty more who in course of few second have flung down from rock to soft yielding sand below while others be following down cliff face at breakneck speed came running leaping down beach in pursuit of now fast moving schooner man grasping single spear in right hand three four more war club in left whole of yelling like demon at moment chip appeared under bow sight of be greeted by savage with howl of exultation for seemed to think that since be down on sand have in power carpenter knew perfectly well what be about a stem of gliding schooner slid past made spring at wire bobstay caught first with one hand then with other pulled up flung leg over then rapidly hauled up to bowsprit end reached just a schooner plunged into water swung astride spar so worked way inboard be touch go with for moment showed about dozen of leading native pulled up short prepared to hurl spear at be convinced that for hot revolver fire instantly opened upon daring savage bowling three of over so seriously disconcerting aim of others that missed master chip must even at last moment have lost number of mess with plunge of schooner into water danger be over for little craft held way in most wonderful fashion making so long stern board into water of bay that shot far beyond extreme range of savage spear before finally came to rest meanwhile canvas be loose ready for setting therefore moment felt to be water borne dashed aft to tiller at same time shouting to others to man foresail fore staysail halyard hoist away by time foresail be hoisted vessel be beginning to lose sternway whereupon jammed tiller hard over to port thus canted with head to northward caused head sail to fill whereupon quickly gathered headway when putting helm hard up headed out to sea while others proceeded to set jib mainsail within ten minute of first plunge into water little nautilus a named be clear of reef fairly in open sea there be several trifling job that must have preferred to finish off before proceeding to sea several article that must fain have carried away from island with have be afforded opportunity presence of savage of course precluded therefore moment that be under way clear of western extremity of island flattened in sheet fore aft proceeded to northward close hauled on starboard tack on way to honolulu be to be first port of call naturally first most engrossing question claiming attention be that of behaviour of little ship have not be under way quarter of hour before be agreed that far exceeded most sanguine expectation be magnificent little sea boat riding long pacific surge a buoyantly a gull very stiff under canvas extraordinarily fast weatherly only thing caused concern be that found be leaking to somewhat alarming extent be quite prepared for a have be standing so long on hot beach that plank have shrunk somewhat opening seam took up however during course of night after keeping busy at pump for first three four hour of voyage after have further trouble with island be mere faint blue smudge on horizon astern when sun when down on evening of eventful day on ninth morning following safely arrived at honolulu here thanks to cunningham hundred forty sovereign have contrived to hold on to through vicissitude of fortune found possessed of money enough to carry round horn a far a baltimore where have decided to call on way home remained in honolulu four day making arrangement for long adventurous voyage round southern extremity of great american continent then gaily started disregarding
