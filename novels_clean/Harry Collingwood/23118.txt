well known footstep ascending stair there be not former light hearted spring in murray be coming upstairs slowly heavily like man carrying ponderous burden dick heaved sharp sigh a murmured to luck

there be already sign that boy be beginning to lose hope wish to heaven there be something must do for unfortunately have not particle of influence be absolutely powerless at moment door of little room opened murray stood framed in opening looking at friend with expression in weariness disappointment certain suggestion of relief be curiously blended if dick penryn be what people be in habit of calling giant then murray frobisher must only be considered gigantic standing fully six foot four inch in boot broad in proportion weighing fully sixteen stone with dark olive complexion bronzed almost to shade of arab by exposure to weather with clean shaven cheek lip close cropped wavy black hair man be truly magnificent specimen of humanity compelling attention of with whom came in contact so be back at last murray shouted penryn leaping out of chair speaking more cheerfully than felt that occasion warranted come inside man come inside stand there in doorway letting in draught goodness know be cold enough without a murray closed door behind slowly pulled forward chair to fire proceeded what be news to day old man luck of sort have be usual style of thing offer service have declined with without thanks well answered murray in deep bass tone stretching out half frozen hand to blaze hardly know what to think about to day certainly have be little different from usual run of thing not very much during whole of morning for better part of afternoon luck be dead against a usual then about four o'clock there came just one little ray of light to brighten darkness capital broke in dick cheerfully little help know straw show way wind blow rest of tell about ray of light of yours well answered frobisher with wry smile know that be very much of ray after will tell happened have be running up down office stair from before nine o'clock until about three in afternoon without result became heartily sick of just by way of change made up mind to take run down to dock see whether there be anything doing there got down at about three thirty feeling pretty hungry for have have nothing to eat since breakfast went into small place within hail of dock gate asked for bread cheese beer landlady kindly old soul seeing suppose that looked cold a though must do with rest showed into little sanctum labelled captain room where be glad to see there blazed fine big fire before stood two three very cosy looking arm chair throwing into one began to discus frugal luncheon with considerable appetite have nearly finished when door opened in came most curious looking little man have ever set eye on that be seaman be perfectly apparent to meanest intelligence at once set down a first officer a call nowadays perhaps even skipper of tramp steamer be certainly not more than five foot in height breadth of shoulder depth of chest be so enormous a to amount literally to deformity must judge that strength must be herculean a novelist say be bronzed to colour of deep mahogany have heavy black moustache beard grew right up to eye deep set black a brilliant a diamond added to wore gold ear ring altogether be a like conception of one of pirate of old about whom used to read in young day a man possibly must be from moment man entered room began to feel deeply interested in must scarcely refrain from staring at openly here ' said to be personality man who have knocked about world during most of life man who have seen thing done thing of probably must not bear too close scrutiny ' for gave impression of being person who must make good stanch friend who must prove to be thoroughly bad dangerous enemy apparently be bit surprised to find anybody else in captain sanctum at time of day after first hasty glance seemed a though too be taking more than usual interest in humble servant for time raised eye to take quiet look at found black glittering orb fixed on with curious unblinking stare that may have noticed among certain specie of bird seriously dick can tell that kept staring business up so long be beginning to feel quite uncomfortable have made up mind to finish meal a soon a possible continue journey down to dock when heard give vent to kind of grunt might have expressed satisfaction dissatisfaction disgust other feeling for aught must judge then taking eye off curious customer tugged bell ordered servant to bring glass of rum hot ' bit of cold meat bread from when arrived began to make meal eating a though be first time have touched food for several day indeed ate so fast so wolfishly that by time have finished own meal have rung bell for bill piratical friend be also pushing away plate with sigh of satisfaction asking for bill reckoning having be paid be on point of leaving room when stranger whose name afterwards learned be drake quite appropriate name thought for such freebooter looking character put out great hairy paw a though to prevent remarked in deep rumbling voice one moment young gentleman unless be in great hurry 'd like to have word two with ' naturally dick be little astonished proceeded murray must confess that have become vastly interested in little man a offer of employment sometimes come from most unlikely source like drowning man clutching at straw determined to hear what have to say possibly might lead to something in case felt must do harm by listening to think can spare few minute remarked what be wish to see about ' be seaman be ' said answering question with yes replied be ' navy man too unless be much mistaken ' be next remark well ' said rather hesitatingly be navy man lieutenant not so very long ago have misfortune to lose ship under circumstance for must say in justice to myself think be hardly to blame however member of court martial took different view of case be to put bluntly dismissed service since then have be looking out for other employment something in own line if possible if not then anything can lay hand on so far be sorry to say have met with nothing rebuff nobody on face of earth appears to need man with qualification just now ' have have ' chuckled little man rubbing hand gleefully just a thought when first set eye on here say to be seaman sure enough must tell at first glance navy man too by way carry no longer in service by general er um not on active duty at moment mean to say ' ended rather lamely with apologetic cough felt going red round ear dick might have be inclined to be angry have anyone else spoken thus there be something about little pirate assured did not in least intend to be offensive so only laughed rather ruefully if out of work condition be so apparent a to be noted by even common seaman be wonder told that so often came out of private office with word nothing to suit be afraid mr frobisher ' ringing in ear well ' said granted that be ex naval officer looking for job what bearing have that upon business with for suppose must have idea that can do business together since started conversation what bearing ' repeated well will just tell a happens be looking at moment for exactly man a appear to be name drake captain john drake of tramp steamer quernmore two thousand five hundred sixty ton register to be exact from what have just said think must make pretty good shot at tally must be very far wrong if said that be ex lieutenant murray frobisher ' on contrary answered must have hit bull eye dead in centre be certain of ' smiled again say more emphatically than ever that be very man be looking for if will take chair pull up to fire will take other will have bit of palaver ' having seated comfortably drake at once proceeded may tell mr frobisher that for past twenty year have be captain of same steamer trading between eastern port while a be first time have be back to old england during whole of period think be very far wrong in saying know a much about east a man living perhaps good deal more there be not very much going on out there that know about sometimes even get to know about thing before begin to happen be able to make plan put little money in pocket thereby be one of occasion upon have managed to get wind of something in advance in case also can see way to making quite nice little pile of money first of however must ask to pledge word that if after have told plan feel inclined to come in with will hing to upset plan in way gave required promise perhaps just little too readily drake resumed story so happens that last port of call be well small seaport in korea while there heard news that made sit up take notice a yankee say seems that for time past government of korea have be playing very hanky panky game taxing people until burden have become unbearable punishing smallest offence with death by torture confiscating good money of man who dared to allow few more luxury than neighbour in short playing very mischief round naturally even mildest mannered worm will turn under too much of kind of thing average korean be anything mild mannered so that little while ago party of official decided that have have quite enough of proceeded quietly methodically to foment rebellion against government when left korea thing be very nearly ripe for outbreak must have be suicidal folly for rebel to have attempted anything of kind without proper arm to back up for korean soldiery be naturally on side from draw pay be to say side of government also happen to be particularly well armed just now be therefore necessary for must be rebel to procure weapon before successful revolt must be undertaken one day be interviewed by one of official on subject of supplying rebel army with modern rifle to make rather long story short upshot of interview be be commissioned to supply rebel with one hundred thousand rifle with necessary ammunition at price if venture be successful will make possible for to give up sea altogether live ashore at ease ' yes yes interrupted rather impatiently be interesting enough in way captain fail to see where concern ' be just coming to ' returned drake when interrupted be unfortunate enough to lose chief officer overboard in hurricane in indian ocean on way home circumstance upset plan very considerably for be fine seaman have be with many year knew little way in order to bring off venture successfully must replace for there will be difficult dangerous work ahead need man a much like old chief a possible man who be willing to go anywhere do anything man who have brain to organise muscle courage to keep own end up in fight have often heard of mr frobisher a being just that kind of man followed whole account of misfortune proceeding of court martial in newspaper when learned that have dismissed from service considered most shocking error of judgment told that have be in employ must not have be so harshly treated must have liked at time to make try to secure service have own chief officer with then consequently have nothing to offer now thing be different need employment need service be prepared to pay well for give share of profit one of condition attaching to contract be that deliver rifle ammunition into hand of rebel officer at at small town considerable distance inland from coast a can not leave ship duty of conveying cargo inland must devolve upon be where dangerous part of business come in will make allowance therefore in rate of pay propose to offer if will join to get down to hard fact will give forty pound month from day sign on with until leave ship on return to england until leave out in east if care to do that there be plenty of chance for such man a out there in addition agree to give share of one twentieth of profit estimate must amount to about twenty thousand pound sterling therefore one thousand pound over above pay will be share of enterprise now have said have to say have put proposition before have told that be likely to be profitable dangerous what do say to joining a chief officer tell dick be too amazed to reply for few moment brain be in such whirl that must presently say be must think thing over meet again at same place to morrow to give reply money part of business naturally appeal very strongly to one amount seems almost too good to be true there must be at least six month pay at forty pound month thousand on top of if expedition must prove successful so that being well must have little capital in hand to work with at end of time might be able so to invest a to make independent for remainder of life of anything like experience of past year on other hand be inclined to look little doubtfully upon gun running smuggling business be utterly at variance with navy tradition must rather starve than set hand to anything have even appearance of being in least degree dishonest still be bound to say that from can learn look a though korean rebel have genuine grievance that country might be better for drastic change of government so that be really very undecided what to do dick one thing be certain must get employment of kind if be seriously of opinion can accept drake offer without soiling hand will most certainly do so have considered matter pretty thoroughly on way home to tell truth have almost persuaded may accept dick penryn who during narrative have be leaning back in chair smoking listening attentively took pipe from mouth tapped ash out slowly thoughtfully against bar of grate sat up straight then after lengthy pause delivered judgment well murray said have listened most attentively to yarn have be trying to look at matter from unprejudiced independent standpoint of course a very truthfully say anything in nature of gun running smuggling be totally opposed to navy tradition at same time be unfortunately no longer in navy to intent purpose be now private individual at liberty to take up calling profession trade care to term that offer chance to make living employment of sort certainly must have so long a employment be honest might almost say in particular case so long a be not dishonest think will be wise to take first thing that offer have be out of harness for over year now ready cash must be running pretty low must think besides be first offer have come way since left navy if accept while have opportunity may perhaps be year more before be given chance personally see anything wrong with drake proposal be purely business enterprise certain folk require certain good drake contract to supply in order to carry out agreement need help be willing to pay very handsomely for so advice to son be that take what be offered be thankful of course need not say that if arm have be intended for country at war likely at time to be at war with england thing must be absolutely impossible for to contemplate for moment a thing be well have hesitation in saying that under similar circumstance conscience must not worry very much at very clear definite expression of opinion frobisher anxious expression vanished have evidently be little afraid that friend might not look altogether favourably on scheme be not so deeply in love with that must have felt inclined to follow up have dick voted against pronounced of too shady character for gentleman to meddle with since dick view coincided so completely with own felt that there must be no longer room for hesitation be glad indeed to hear say that dick exclaimed jumping up decides absolutely tomorrow will run down to dock see drake on board quernmore instead of waiting to meet at hotel a have arranged tell have decided to accept offer must go down to night if be not so late for now have made up mind must feel pretty bad if meanwhile happened to meet someone else who have not so many scruple a who needed job badly enough to accept opening on spot without taking time to think over however think drake will interview anybody else until have have answer for certainly seemed anxious enough to secure particular service so will hope for best leave thing in hand of fate now dick went on passing hand across forehead have have long tiring day have rather bad headache into bargain so if mind think will toddle up to bed get to sleep for want to be up early in morning good night old man good night murray hearty replied friend hope will sleep well have pleasant dream ought to after piece of good luck by way when doe drake want to go aboard oh to be sure quite forgot to mention that told that if decided to join must require to be on board a soon a possibly must indeed hinted that if must make convenient to turn up tomorrow evening sleep aboard ship must be more than pleased see have cargo pretty nearly loaded hope to be able to get away at midday day after to morrow so sooner be on board sooner will be able to take of worry trouble work off shoulder great scot exclaimed dick jumping up want to join a soon a why fully expected that must be leaving under week at least so to night will be last sleep in old bed for month to come at rate for want to make place home again a soon a ever return make most of therefore know where may have to lie in what queer place may have to sleep before get back well suppose will see in morning at breakfast at rate will be back here after have interviewed drake in order to pack trap say good bye so on yes will see at breakfast dick will be back a soon a possible after have seen skipper to pack to say good bye by gad dick went on with little burst of emotion be more than sorry to have to leave have be mighty good chum to a long a live will never forget kindness wish to goodness be coming along too so do old chap answered penryn gripping friend hand a to goodness kindness ' to rest of why be rot know man must do same for pal not man dick returned murray soberly if only knew there be not great many of sort knocking about nowadays good night again old chap frobisher slept well be not visited by dream sweet otherwise be sometimes told that dream be sent to a warning a forerunner of event be to happen to in future if be really true seems strange that murray sleep must have be so deep dreamless for have that young man be able to foresee one half of strange terrible adventure be in store for be scarcely to be doubted that must in spite of long period of unemployment have gladly allowed captain drake to take somebody else in place notwithstanding offer of forty pound month salary thousand pound bonus at successful termination of venture chapter two eastward ho so soundly dreamlessly did frobisher sleep that did not wake until clear note of dressing bugle solemn farce dick insisted upon servant performing when ashore have almost finished ringing through little cottage punctually at be old marine who acted a dick servant when be ashore a general housekeeper caretaker when be afloat sounded bugle a signal to master that be time to turn out neighbour in house round about who by way referred to penryn a very eccentric young man have come to look upon instrument somewhat in light of town clock so much so that several of set watch by one old gentleman be in habit of leaving front door sprinting for eight fifteen train to town punctually upon first note frobisher sat up in bed with yawn be half way to bath room before be sufficiently wideawake to recollect that morning be different from three hundred sixty five odd preceding morning a remembered that at last have secured offer of regular profitable employment although not quite along line have hoped for let out whoop of rejoicing that made cottage ring having completed toilet frobisher came downstairs whistling to find penryn standing in front of fire warming coat tail sniffing hungrily while from direction of kitchen came certain savoury smell beorning murray beorning dick be response what be for breakfast morning know answered friend smell like egg bacon steak mushroom chop kidney on toast hope so at rate for be hungry morning feel quite ready for snack snack laughed frobisher be what have just mentioned idea of snack sound to more like menu of aldermanic banquet by way did know parcel postman have arrived yet be early be oh replied dick turning rather red thought 'd put away postman have be be just something went out for early morning for oh for friend of mine sorry old man said murray did mean to be inquisitive by way be there train to town somewhere about nine half past must like to catch if there be one at nine twenty three answered dick will catch easily now here be tom with breakfast bring to anchor let begin be a hungry a hunter how about rather better than usual morning laughed frobisher little hope be splendid thing for giving one appetite with remark young men fell to with will meal finished frobisher hurried off to catch train travelled up to london crossed city took train down to dock arrived there enquired whereabouts of steamer quernmore over there sir policeman told pointing to spot about two hundred yard distant thither young man made way halting presently at shore end of gangway leading on to steamer to take good look at craft be to be floating home for so long period certainly told if one might judge by appearance captain drake have ample justification for being proud of steamer for be a pretty model of craft a frobisher for long experience have ever set eye on indeed one must almost have be excused for assuming for size might have be private yacht at period of existence flush decked with graceful curving run clipper bow with gilt figure head long overhanging counter hull painted particularly pleasing shade of dark green down to within couple of foot of water line polished black below made picture completely satisfying to eye of most exacting critic be rigged a topsail schooner funnel be tall oval shaped cream coloured indeed anything le like traditional tramp steamer more resembling gentleman yacht must have be difficult to find by look of too thought frobisher must be able to show pretty fair turn of speed if be put to sixteen knot at least young lieutenant judged idea occurred to that possibly time in future life of crew might depend upon few extra knot of appeared capable however must not do to stand there admiring ship business before pleasure young man reminded involuntarily straightening up a though about to board man of war frobisher marched across gangway asked first seaman met whether captain drake be aboard be in chart house at moment sir answered man will take to minute later frobisher found ducking head in order to get in through low chart house door way hillo be already be exclaimed drake looking up from chart over be poring did expect to see until afternoon sit down make comfortable hope have come to tell that be to be shipmate for cruise added eagerly if ca persuade to come in with will be obliged to sail shorthanded for have time to do more looking round now then can make mind easy laughed frobisher to tell simple truth believe have practically made up mind to sail with before said good bye to yesterday yes be coming skipper hope for sake that voyage will turn out a successfully a desire good man heartily ejaculated skipper thrusting out hand be best news have heard for long while now where be dunnage will show room can settle down right away dunnage be down yet skipper replied frobisher smiling came down just to tell have decided intending to go back fetch trap afternoon drake looked rather blank at hearing be pity remarked thoughtfully half to then addressing frobisher well trot away back get down here a quickly a can will ye certain event have happened since saw yesterday that make anxious to leave at very earliest moment possible have already made arrangement to clear directly after have seen afternoon will be off at once skipper returned frobisher be back again not later than one o'clock young man darted out of chart house across gangway out of dock premise like sprinter leaving drake staring open mouthed after certainly can take hint quicker than man have ever met said worthy a resumed study of chart two hour later frobisher be back in kingston have packed belonging be saying good bye to old friend dick penryn of men felt very happy at parting after manner of kind tried to conceal real feeling by exaggerated show of indifference thus be that farewell be brief almost to curtness to point be only a frobisher be actually on door step dick pushed into friend hand parcel same parcel have caught frobisher eye that morning be heavy recipient must not guess even remotely a to content thanked dick heartily tucked package under arm got into cab have be sent for one last firm hand grip two rather husky good bye now that actual moment for parting have come pair be separated one bound for far mysterious east other to return in few day to ship have come to look upon a real home be with few minute in hand that frobisher leapt out of cab at dock gate collected few belonging paid cabby with customary swiftness of movement turned started to trot quickly through gate towards quernmore a did so collided violently with man causing to sit down suddenly on hard cobble while frobisher dropped one of portmanteau fat policeman on duty at entrance chuckled loudly frobisher laughed picked up bag a murmured apology victim on cobble appeared to be saying unpleasant thing venomously in language quite unfamiliar to young lieutenant who knew good many caused to pause instant look at man be brown rather yellow man for moment frobisher took for chinaman second glance convinced latter that did not belong to nation to japanese although be undoubtedly of eastern extraction murray have time to waste in conjecture however with hearty english sorry old man proceeded to quernmore where drake conducted to state room frobisher must have left unpacking until evening gone on duty at once drake informed that there be need cargo be aboard crew specially selected men be in forecastle there be nothing to be done until three o'clock when drake must get paper tug must arrive to help out of dock frobisher therefore unpacked stowed thing away afterwards getting into first officer uniform have be hastily adapted from own old navy outfit by removal of shoulder strap executive curl from gold stripe on sleeve then proceeded to examine parcel placed in hand by dick penryn removing brown paper found square polished mahogany box fastened by two hook a well a by lock key upon opening lid gave cry of pleasure surprise inside be pair of most business like large calibre blued revolver carrying heavy cartridge serviceable weapon indeed capable of dropping man in track at distance of hundred yard in addition to weapon there be cavity beneath tray in rested fitted up to contain exactly one hundred round of ammunition be deadly looking blunt nosed bullet in brass cartridge case have made parcel so heavy with eye snapping with gratification frobisher locked away case in drawer went out on deck to find drake a emerged from companion way saw that tug be already alongside immediately ran up on to bridge so a to be ready to carry out order drake might have for appeared that skipper intended to work ship out of dock entirely with own hand so frobisher have few minute in to look round take in for last time for several month at rate intimate sight around quernmore be now slowly passing out between pierheads frobisher be keeping sharp look out to see that none of crew attempted pierhead jump when happened to catch sight of late acquaintance of collision man be standing at extreme end of pier leaning against bollard observing quernmore crew with scrutiny so close a to be little suspicious murray half turned to point out to drake need not have troubled to do so however for at once perceived that skipper be already aware of man presence if look went for anything too drake be intensely annoyed thought at once occurred to frobisher that presence of yellow man might possibly have have something to do with drake sudden resolution to leave during early afternoon said nothing however at moment continued to stare at easterner a long a must see clearly in order to impress man appearance feature indelibly on memory for presentiment have just seized that man be in strange way bound up with own fate that be destined to meet again under far different circumstance from under have come together shortly before at dock gate have not much time opportunity however to dwell at length upon such matter for quarter of hour later tug have cast off pilot have taken charge quernmore under own steam be proceeding rapidly down winding traffic laden river be passing gravesend when drake suddenly turned to frobisher remarked say mr frobisher did happen to notice yellow skinned chap standing on pierhead a left dock why yes replied frobisher be second time 'd seen first time cannoned into at dock gate a be coming aboard sent spinning must have heard remark made though did understand word said guessed what meant by expression believe if have be for bobby at gate fellow must have tried to knife although running down be quite accident saw hand fly to waist belt did stay to argue with did like look of fellow little bit have sort of presentiment that have not seen last of seemed to be taking lot of interest in quernmore of what nationality do suppose to be man answered drake have caused heap of anxiety ever since started loading cargo have be on watch day day will wager counted chest case that took aboard feel convinced in own mind that be korean spy if so may be in for lot of trouble when arrive out there for can easily cable even get there before by catching fast mail boat tell candidly be not very comfortable about business will be glad to get out of english water too for be not quite a clear a must like to be concerning law in bearing on case of sort fancy that british government have power to stop delay if korean friend chooses to represent in proper quarter be carrying arm to rebel arrayed against lawful sovereign if news must by mean leak out said frobisher think there be doubt that will be delayed if not stopped altogether for england doe not want quarrel on hand with anybody just now however insignificant may be so have better keep weather eye lifting be prepared for eventuality by time cleared mouth of river dropped pilot however darkness have long since fallen drake hoped that with dawn of morrow must be far enough down channel to be clear of danger of recall overhauling to end shaped course must carry well over toward french coast determining to run down on side of channel so avoid if possible prowling english cruiser be well for that did so for on following morning happening to take glance astern through glass frobisher caught sight about eight mile distant of small gunboat coming along in wake at top speed flying signal of sort ex naval officer shrewdly suspected to be summons to heave to though craft be too far away for signal to be plainly read at once informed drake who promptly went down to engine room gave chief engineer few private instruction with result presently dense volume of smoke began to pour out of quernmore funnel speed quickened up until frobisher judged to be doing quite sixteen knot then drake took turn at watching war ship astern when soon became evident that even if be not increasing distance quernmore be at least holding own that be apparent to commander of gunboat be demonstrated shortly afterwards when puff of white smoke broke out from bow distant boom of gun floated down to feared a much exclaimed drake uneasily believe will get clear unless fellow firing brings cruiser out from plymouth to stop brightening up little fancy be too far over toward french side for anything of sort so if can only keep ahead think will pull out safely gunboat continued firing after time began to send solid shot after flying quernmore a stronger hint to heave to gun be not powerful enough for range shot dropped harmlessly into water far away astern be still in sight when darkness fell have lost ground badly during day when following morning dawned be out of sight below horizon be only attempt made to stop drake in english water be shortly afterward safely in bay of biscay there be need to describe in detail voyage to east since be entirely uneventful stopped at port said to coal coaled again at colombo hongkong then headed straight for korean coast drake frobisher having taken particular notice of po liner have left england day after steamed out of colombo harbour just a quernmore be entering did observe fashionably dressed yellow skinned gentleman on board liner who treated to such close scrutiny through pair of field glass have for moment forgotten about korean friend of dock in case must hardly have expected to find on first class promenade deck of crack ocean liner be just two month after leaving london when late one afternoon drake pointed ahead to north indicating what at first sight appeared to be belt of cloud right down upon horizon ah remarked frobisher following direction of skipper outstretched finger be nearly at destination be quelpart island take ought to anchor off fusan then about time to morrow eh skipper drake turned regarded officer solemnly then slowly lowered right eyelid will pas fusan about time mr frobisher said stop there fusan be port according to ship paper happen to remember actual destination be small harbour about two hundred mile north of that must never be able to get cargo unloaded at fusan much le into rebel hand sam riek be goal quite small unimportant place right on coast there be good sheltered anchorage there if have luck deserve will be able to unload stuff without fear of interruption ah remarked frobisher relapsed into deep thought on evening of second day following quernmore be close in under land just a sun be setting behind korean hill anchor plashed down from bow voyage be at end quernmore have reached destination done part now be for murray frobisher to carry out other half of drake contract place cargo in hand of rebel at spot week journey more up country must must not be able to do more important still from own personal point of view must be able to get back to ship with whole skin time alone must show chapter three up country sooner have anchor splashed into water than captain drake gave order for ship lantern to be lighted of slung in rigging while others be to be placed at interval along bulwark block tackle be then made fast to end of fore main boom boom be triced up at angle to serve a derrick hatch cover be stripped off be to be case of hand working night to get cargo ashore for now that ship have arrived in korean water consequently in zone of danger drake be eagerness to get contract completed to collect payment to clear off out of harm way with steamer still in own hand for be own property to lose must mean ruin for owner arrangement have long since be made between drake frobisher a to method of procedure upon arrival at destination mere fact at last moment point of disembarkation of cargo have be changed to sam riek made difference in plan have be agreed between drake official negotiating for rebel that latter must not put in appearance at point of debarkation because of possibility thing might at critical moment go wrong that englishman must land arm in own boat convey up country at own risk to place now transpired be called yong wol in department of kang won situated on river han here be to be handed over to rebel representative escort after must be conveyed by water to environs of seoul where in probability must in first instance be used arrangement must necessitate journey across entire peninsula of korea to land arm on west coast where government troop be mostly posted must have be simply courting disaster on east coast there be only few scattered outpost of troop inhabitant be hand in glove with rebel although none of have a yet actually implicated inhabitant of sam riek in particular must be relied upon not to offer opposition to landing to inform government authority of what be in wind when therefore about nine o'clock night at time deck be packed with case have be got up from below in readiness to be sent ashore in boat there came from look out whom drake a precautionary measure have posted in foretop hail of ho boat ahoy what do want man on deck jumped a though have be shot so little be interruption of sort expected drake frobisher darted to side together a though moved by same impulse leant over bulwark peering into darkness listening intently for sound of oar must enable to discover whereabouts of approaching craft whoever occupant of boat might be be evidently enemy spy for hardly have challenge left seaman mouth when reply came out of darkness in thin high pitched timid voice alightee alightee only who mischief may only ' be growled drake who have be very considerably startled therefore felt rather annoyed with sh sh mastel urged voice makee not so muchee shout vely dangelous thlow lope so climb up got big piecee news for mastel sound of muffled oar be again heard time evidently close to ship h be muttered drake under breath to frobisher much like look of seems a though something have miscarried for fellow to come out here at time of night with big piecee news suppose there be doubt beggar really have message of sort for so will have to let come aboard if try hanky panky trick will send over side in double quick time to feed shark ca afford to have venture miss fire now jones open gangway throw rope over side added turning to one of seaman stand by to hit hit hard if everything be not exactly a must be rope be allowed to slide over side through open entry port moment later began to quiver a occupant of boat left craft proceeded to scramble up hand over hand presently there appeared on deck little thin wizened man who might have be age over sixty be clothed in nothing length of brown cotton material swathed round body round upper part of leg end being drawn up between thigh so a to form kind of rough apology for pair of knickerbockers lower limb foot be bare on head wore one of high broad brimmed conical hat be so common among korean well exclaimed drake sharply a peculiar looking individual reached deck stood staring round what dickens d want who be ye what be name name ling wong mastel replied korean come flom excellency kyong bah at yong wol phew whistled drake turning to frobisher kyong bah be man negotiated with about cargo what be in wind wonder yes go on added to ling impatiently what

think get safe thlough if vely quick caleful tell say must hully ol be caught be over week ago groaned drake what chance have think mr frobisher of getting cargo safely through now oh exclaimed frobisher cheerfully seeing that drake be inclined to take dismal view of thing if can get ashore uninterfered with will engage to deliver to kyong bah whatever johnny name be safely enough nil desperandum know skipper be latin for never know what can do till try ' latin chap certainly did know how to say lot in few word did mr frobisher remarked drake little more cheerfully do really think can get through if get arm safely ashore sure of answered frobisher with good deal more confidence than really felt will take chap a guide collect sufficient cart mule at sam riek to take whole lot at one trip then get man ling to show bypath over hill government troop be not likely to take understood to say that there be good road from yong wol to sam riek if know anything of oriental troop will take if then take route will have pleasure of seeing fellow sitting on haunch in sam riek waiting for to unload cargo into lap while will be travelling way under heavy press of canvas conveying consignment on way to proper owner savvee drake brought hand down on frobisher shoulder by great horn spoon mr frobisher exclaimed know what must have done without be hundred plan if can only get safely away before troop appear will engage so to arrange matter that will believe cargo to be still in ship will keep busy long enough to allow to carry out part without interference of course lot will depend upon extent to people of sam riek dislike government if be really on side of rebel will keep mum about stuff being already ashore if there be traitor among first thing will do will be to curry favour by setting troop after one time yes be so agreed frobisher stroking chin still be only way out can see sooner get cargo ashore test scheme for ourselves better think right answered drake come along boy to listening crew have heard what be be said so see have got to hurry jones take fellow ling down below lock up somewhere until mr frobisher be ready for be not taking risk trip then when have done take few of hand swing eery one of boat over into water have enough case on deck now to begin taking of ashore encouraged by captain frobisher of whom worked a hard a harder than of seaman men buckled to again in earnest soon chest case be leaping up out of hold on to deck off deck into boat so ashore at very satisfactory rate of progress night work went swiftly steadily on well into following morning with only few minute break for meal frobisher went ashore early in morning with one of load taking ling with a interpreter in order to make arrangement for transport of cargo also to try to discover if there be a yet sign of arrival of troop villager proved only too glad of chance to hire out cart animal after lengthy ride along yong wol road on horse have borrowed frobisher satisfied that thus far at rate there be sign of troop in neighbourhood by time got back to ship last of case be just being placed on deck two more trip of little fleet of quernmore boat must see whole of cargo safely ashore frobisher therefore ran down to cabin throwing off uniform dressed in pair of khaki coloured riding breech have brought out with from england thick soled brown boot good leather legging old norfolk jacket completed outfit so far a outer garb be concerned when have donned old somewhat battered still serviceable topi helmet relic of more prosperous day have fastened round leather belt bandolier combined filled with cartridge attached to one of penryn revolver in leather holster must have be rather difficult to recognise in erstwhile smart spruce murray frobisher rather resembled south african transport rider in state of disrepair of so truculent appearance that might have be expected to put to flight with ease singlehanded considerable detachment of korean soldiery slipped second revolver into one of side pocket of jacket extra supply of cartridge into other pocket then ran up on deck ready to start on perilous journey into interior by time have said good bye to skipper have received instruction with regard to collection of purchase money sundry other matter last of cargo have be sent ashore drake own gig be waiting at foot of accommodation ladder to take young man to landing place a be on point of descending side ladder drake asked to wait moment ran down below reappearing few second later with serviceable ship cutlas in hand belted round frobisher waist revolver be very well in way remarked little skipper sometimes man be too busy fighting to have time to reload then be very glad to have yard of good stout steel in fist take along with mr frobisher if there must happen to be scrap feel sure will find mighty handy avoid fight if can of course a charlie dickens say in play of jim penman once in fight so carry that enemy will be sorry for ' good bye boy take care of with laughing reply frobisher clasped drake hand once more ran lightly down ladder into boat fifteen minute later found safely ashore boat pulled back to ship where remainder of small fleet be already being hoisted up to davit be alone in strange land charged with dangerous mission with white man to share burden with only one man ling who have even nodding acquaintance with english language escort there be none in usual sense of word for driver of cart containing arm ammunition chest although armed with old fashioned muzzle loading musket out of date halberd in case bow arrow must not possibly be relied upon to put up sort of fight in event of encounter with regular korean soldiery only person beside who be armed with modern weapon be interpreter ling who carried fairly recent reliable marlin repeating rifle holding eight cartridge be ammunition have so that if trouble arose must not be relied upon very far having reached village frobisher took ling with went off to see that cart be properly loaded mule driver at station to astonishment found that in spite of proverbial slackness of korean everything be in readiness only word be necessary to enable caravan to start during previous visit to shore have done little exploration have quite made up mind road to take in order to avoid troop coming from yong wol provided of course that came by direct route so did not waste time after last look round to see that everything be satisfactory commanded ling to set caravan in motion remaining behind until last cart have left village in order to make sure at last moment none of driver must shirk risk try to desert there be attempt of kind however korean mule driver appeared absolutely apathetic indifferent to possible danger be being well paid for trouble sufficient unto day be evidently motto satisfied therefore that there be nothing to fear in respect frobisher mounted elderly steed have managed to purchase at about ten time proper value rode to head of column where found ling already fast asleep on back of mule have elected to ride so long column be at last fairly started on perilous hundred mile journey into interior of korea journey involved negotiation of heavy ill made road fording of deep swift river stream most difficult of passage of range of lofty hill on other side of town of yong wol destination be situated for long time until in fact caravan disappeared from view among tree captain drake watched through telescope when finally last cart disappeared in forest man whom frobisher have once called little pirate be not ashamed to follow example of illustrious namesake of immortal memory went down to cabin remained there for minute actually praying for safe return of man to whom have grown to be very sincerely attached friend murray frobisher be about three o'clock in afternoon when caravan got away from sam riek urge command even implore a might frobisher be quite unable to get expedition farther than ten mile from coast before darkness fell became necessary to camp for night suitable place for encampment be eventually found on open level strip of ground by side of considerable stream about mile ahead distance frobisher be compelled to force driver to traverse almost at muzzle of pistol managed however to convince dull witted korean that half mile must not kill about seven o'clock party pulled up at spot selected couple of cart contained provision on top of frobisher have placed bundle containing tent blanket for personal use pitched tent spread blanket on ground then before allowing men to prepare supper ordered that vehicle must be formed into circle with own tent in centre shaft of being run in under hind wheel of one in front so a to form fairly effective barricade must at least prevent camp being rushed without warning must attack be made by enemy also took care that mule be picketed within enclosure so formed so that might not stray away be stolen finally told off dozen of best armed most resolute looking men under command of ling to act a sentry in different watch during first half of night resolving to keep watch during second period during there be most likelihood of danger arrangement having be made frobisher served out ration to men partook of own supper leaving strict order with ling that be to be called at midnight went to tent rolled up in blanket laid cutlas revolver beside be soon asleep did not know how long have be sleeping when suddenly awoke with sense of danger oppression strong upon like most men who pas life at sea in uncivilised part of world seemed to be possessed of sixth sense always gave warning when there be peril at hand be sense now brought broad awake in instant with ear straining to catch least sound eye peering through darkness to catch first glimpse of intruder like wise man refrained from making slightest sound might betray whereabouts to prowling assassin slowly very carefully disengaged arm from blanket reached out for one of revolver with in hand felt much more comfortable fully prepared for eventuality then sitting up carefully frobisher again listened intently for sound might tell position of danger if strain ear a might must catch not slightest suggestion of warning there be however certain faint peculiar odour in tent felt sure proceeded neither from canvas from blanket very faint indeed be must perhaps have be quite imperceptible to anybody with le keen olfactory sense than frobisher possessed be there same felt that must very much like to identify determine origin be not unpleasant indeed suggestion be of pleasant perfume perfume have often smelt before what that perfume be must not for life of recall just at moment one thing be certain however be that there have be no such odour in tent when went to sleep must therefore have be brought in by somebody since then now nobody have business there unless be ling come to wake ling must must have stood at entrance called at most if calling have not aroused have come boldly in shaken there be sound however in tent therefore intruder if there be one have legitimate business there more frobisher thought about matter more certain became that be not a must be therefore very slowly very silently divested of blanket leaving in bundle on ground with revolver still grasped tightly in hand started to crawl noiselessly toward open flap of tent located by seeing glimmer of star shining through at same time took care to keep close to side of tent wall so a to avoid if possible colliding with supposed unknown visitor odour be much more pungent now frobisher knew that in few second must recognise for what be surely thought there be suggestion of oiliness about then in moment knew strange perfume be that of sandalwood oil instantly realised what circumstance meant there be human being in tent somebody who have planned murder robbery man have oiled so that if intended victim happened to be awake grappled with must be able to twist loose escape frobisher be by mean easily flurried when realised that be alone in dark tent with desperate man seeking life that be possibly within arm reach of fellow at moment that in second might feel long keen blade sliding in between rib be only with difficulty that restrained from firing off six chamber of revolver into darkness in hope that one of bullet might find billet then at very moment when felt that nerve must bear strain no longer spell be broken suddenly there came long hissing breath close beside immediately afterward terrific thud a something frobisher must easily guess what be driven with deadly force into heap of blanket close beside with tremendous bound young englishman leaped forward dropping revolver a did so grappled with intruder man have be prepared for mishap by oiling body twisted squirmed like eel so slippery be skin that frobisher with tremendous strength recognised that must not hold therefore gripped fellow wrist a firmly a must with left hand drew back clenched right fist for knock out blow before must deliver received fearful kick in stomach from one of man foot luckily be bare must have be killed doubled up like jack knife involuntarily loosening grip on other wrist in instant man have gained door of tent be lost in darkness while poor frobisher lay upon ground gasping be fully ten minute before have so far recovered a to be able to stand upright a soon a strength returned struck match lighted lantern by light examined pile of blanket have formed bed a expected found pinned to ground by long wavy bladed knife very similar in appearance to malay kris have be driven into earth up to very hilt by blow must assuredly have killed have continued to slumber for five minute frobisher drew out knife tried to remember whether have ever seen before whether have observed in possession of of men composing caravan must not remember having seen knife of kind in hand of of driver therefore threw aside cautiously opened flap of tent to see whether there be mischief going on outside be silent must see of shadowy form of men on guard be then half past eleven a found by looking at watch too late to go to sleep again even if felt inclined precisely hour later figure appeared at door of tent voice observed quietly time to wake up mastel tellee wake one piecee time twelluf twelluf now welly sleepy be ling chapter four betrayed frobisher scrutinised korean face closely there be shadow of change in oriental impassivity for that man bearing betrayed might never have moved from post since camp have be pitched yet young englishman must not rid of suspicion that ling be not exactly what appeared to be moreover now that man be standing inside tent frobisher again became conscious of faint suggestion of odour of sandal wood oil however must not in way suit plan to betray suspicion of korean at present therefore merely contented with remarking quietly very well ling have better get to sleep so a to be rested by morning will wake a soon a be time to break camp be stirring by way fancied heard someone prowling about tent hour ago suppose did not notice anything out of common must have reported to at once eh undelstand anything outel le common mastel what mastel mean enquired ling almond shaped eye opening in apparent puzzlement mean replied frobisher rather testily for now felt almost convinced that fellow be trying to hoodwink that suppose be quite sure that spy one belonging to enemy in fact approached entered camp while be asleep be on guard oh exclaimed ling face breaking out into smile undelstand now mastel nobody not come neal camp if anyone have come must be dead by now shoot stlangel quick without ask question right answered frobisher permitting to be almost persuaded against better judgment that man be honest so absolutely child like bland be manner get away to own quarter secure a much sleep a possibly can for have long march before to morrow turned away to show ling that presence be no longer required at moment of turning must almost have sworn that caught sight of ling lip parted in sardonic smile frobisher wheeled again immediately when once more looked at man korean face be a indifferently emotionless a though carved from stone murray be compelled to acknowledge that expression thought have noticed must have be due to flickering shadow cast by lantern that carried in hand thus dismissed ling trotted off threw down beside inner wheel of one of cart covered face with fold of ample cloak be to outward appearance fast asleep on instant frobisher after regarding recumbent form for long minute more silently tiptoed away to post of observation having reached extinguished lantern making sure first of that match be ready to hand in pocket so that light might not prove convenient target for prowling sharpshooter of enemy remained motionless in one position for at least hour then beginning to feel trifle cramped from spell of inactivity made up mind to traverse sleeping camp in order to assure fully that be a must be leaving lantern behind made way slowly silently by dim light of star round sleeping bivouac be not until have completed entire circumference of circle be back again at starting point that occurred to that have not particularly noticed ling who of course ought to have be lying asleep where frobisher have left at once englishman dormant suspicion again awoke into full activity lighting lantern proceeded to repeat investigation going round in opposite direction time sure enough when came to place where have left ling lying spot be vacant ling have disappeared now what in world be explanation of frobisher asked testily be certain there be something fishy about fellow must give trifle to be able to discover what game be that be playing where in name of fortune have got to now wonder a thought passed through mind heard sudden suspicious sound right on other side of camp idea conveyed to be that man have tripped fallen over something suggestion be strengthened when immediately afterward certain low muttered word in korean tongue sounded remarkably like string of hearty expletive issued from same quarter voice be undoubtedly that of ling frobisher whipped revolver out of pocket leapt like deer in direction of sound arriving on spot just in time to discover ling sitting upright on dewy grass alternately rubbing head shin englishman stood looking down at other for few moment in brief interval found time to notice that foot be soiled plastered with fresh clay have certainly not be on when frobisher have left hour previously be also certain that must not have accumulated that clay within confines of camp for space where wagon have be drawn up be carpeted entirely with grass there be vestige of clay anywhere within circle frobisher therefore felt more convinced than ever that ling be something very different from what represented to be well ling remarked sternly after pause during korean have be vigorously rubbing what be happened to where have be what have be doing a spoke brought right hand slightly forward so that ray of light from lantern carried fell upon gleaming barrel of revolver ling observed motion shrank back guiltily oh mastel quavered thinkee heal sound ovel hele fol too flightened to sleep come hele to see what mattel what kind of sound did think heard queried frobisher looking man square in eye ling tried to return gaze failed almond shaped eye met other for few second then turned ground ward believe heal someone moving ovel hele replied so came see if anybody tly to get in then what did fall over asked frobisher go look see if anybody hiding outside camp explained ling glibly fall ovel shaft of calt coming back see clealy without lanteln continued volubly if believed heard movement said frobisher why did come tell instead of going besides seems strange that who ought to have be sleepy after spell of duty must have noticed suspicious sound while who be wideawake heard nothing undelstand mastel said ling regarding frobisher with blank stare scoundrel retorted frobisher angrily only understand just what suit however understand fine fellow went on bringing revolver into full view shaking in front of now thoroughly frightened korean if find that have be up to trick will shoot a sure a name what be so have better be very careful do understand very well then get over to place lie down mark let catch slinking about camp more to night savvee savvee plenty mastel replied ling gathering up hobbling away added other word in own language in tone sounded anything reassuring a frobisher be totally unfamiliar with korean tongue be compelled to let matter pas unnoticed remainder of night slipped away without interruption shortly after incident above referred to frobisher noticed that star be becoming obscured about two o'clock in morning rain began to fall softly at first then increasing in volume until in hour after beginning seemed a though very bottom have fallen out of heaven thus allowed water pent up there to fall upon earth in overwhelming cataract one by one a became chilled by wet sleeper awoke crawled drowsily either into beneath cart soon frobisher be only human being in sight anywhere in camp be quickly drenched to skin realising how excellent screen for rushing camp downpour must make remained at post shivering with cold for rest of night by time that morning dawned be feeling weary wretched a soon however a first hint of dawn paled eastern sky rain ceased a suddenly a have begun frobisher aroused ling gave order to call men to breakfast so early start might be made when frobisher poked head under hood of cart where korean have taken refuge from rain somehow very strongly suspected that individual have be awake sitting up at moment of approach yet be obliged to shake man vigorously for full minute before must be made to comprehend that be time to bestir a soon a ling permitted to realise fact however sprang from cart with admirable assumption of briskness soon have mule driver at work preparing breakfast inspanning wet wretched looking mule even took trouble to light fire prepare cup of hot tea for mastel for drenched shivering young englishman felt sincerely grateful young man have taken only single sip however when detected very peculiar taste in liquid spat mouthful out on to ground with exclamation of disgust happening to glance upward at moment caught sight of ling regarding with peculiar expression in hate cunning satisfaction be curiously mingled frobisher must scarcely repress anger a realised meaning of malignant glare not content with having attempted to murder by mean of knife during night scoundrel be now trying to put end to by mean of poison powerful very painful poison too surmised frobisher if might judge by burning biting sensation tingled on throat lip tongue be not be policy however to let ling see that be suspected otherwise man might become desperate adopt still more strenuous measure might be difficult if not impossible to frustrate therefore forcing back word of indignation accusation leapt to lip making strong effort to command voice so that might not quiver remarked quietly hi ling tea be very strong have forgotten to put in sugar suppose there be be there ling repressed smile dived under one of cart hood presently reappeared with few lump of required sweetening frobisher calmly dropped into cup stirring round so a to dissolve completely then set cup down beside a though to let liquid cool watched ling keenly until wily oriental be looking way when quickly capsized content of cup on to grass where liquid be immediately absorbed by damp earth when ling returned for cup frobisher observed closely must not avoid noticing expression of satisfaction even man usual impassivity failed to suppress completely frobisher be by time quite convinced that ling be traitor either belonging to in pay of government party began to wonder whether after man have spoken truth when have affirmed that korean troop be approaching to capture caravan along yong wol road might not very reverse be fact troop be hiding in ambush along very road that be about to traverse frobisher be almost inclined to take risk of altering course of caravan in order to regain main road few second consideration caused to abandon idea there be le than four road to yong wol including customary route englishman have only selected one be on at last moment before starting after arrival of ling from ship in fact so that unless ling have arranged to have messenger waiting for ashore have found mean to communicate with frobisher must scarcely believe possible route be taking must hardly have leaked out therefore made up mind to stand by original plan men having finished meal gave order for caravan to proceed leading way keeping sharp look out for sign of treachery on part of korean be short distance to bank of stream previously mentioned crossed route of caravan when arrived there disagreeable surprise be in store for leader heavy rain of previous night have swollen river to extent that instead of placid willow stream little exceeding in size mere brook be now roaring foaming torrent rising higher higher minute there be knowing how long might be before water must subside to normal level frobisher consequently realised with dismay that might be compelled to stay where be for several day allowing enemy ample time to arrive on spot capture caravan evidently told must never do to be delayed by obstacle how be to overcome be question ling demanded how long will be before water will go low enough to allow to cross korean shrugged shoulder know mastel said pelhaps by to night pelhaps not fol week no can hing can only stop hele believe that for minute man retorted frobisher tartly for annoyed to observe calm satisfaction with korean regarded situation have got to get across do hear be going to do so make up mind to if have to drown man of caravan too added be going to manage somehow so understand now that have told tell in return whether there be other place beside where can cross mastel said ling othel place only place anywhele can closs hele mastel can see fol himselluf well said frobisher determinedly if be only place be where cross river be rising very rapidly longer delay worse will be see therefore that there be time to waste be going to ride in to find how deep water be what be more friend be coming with a spoke young sailor grasped bridle of ling mule dug heel into own animal side together englishman now thoroughly frightened korean descended steep bank plunged into river not until be actually in water did frobisher realise how deep how swift be current yet horse seemed to betray uneasiness river deepened only very slightly a pushed forward therefore grasped korean bridle more firmly took own bridle between teeth so a to have one hand free drew foot out of stirrup in order to get clear of horse if animal be washed off foot brought open hand down with resounding smack upon brute hind quarter with snort beast plunged forward with rush mule following reluctantly after with ling clinging desperately to neck fortunately water remained willow adventurous englishman be just congratulating on getting safely across without mishap when there came despairing shriek from ling bridle be wrenched from frobisher hand wheeled in saddle in nick of time to see ling mule lose footing sink back into swirling torrent flinging shrieking korean off back into water man immediately disappeared from view be visible of being hand arm waving frantically to fro clutching helplessly at empty air evidently mule have planted foot in hole stumbled be swept off narrow ford into deep water unless something be done quickly looked a though ling be in danger of being drowned korean have twice attempted to take frobisher life must have be far more convenient safer a regarded for leader of expedition to have let man drown that leader be englishman with englishman tradition behind must not stand idly by see fellow creature perish however well deserving of fate man might be so without moment hesitation frobisher dragged horse head round by main force urged by voice heel hand off causeway into flood headed downstream after ling who have by time risen to surface be yelling madly for mercy help sailor soon perceived that if pursued present tactic korean must be swept away drowned before being overtaken so casting eye keenly about frobisher picked out spot little distance lower down where bank appeared slightly le steep than elsewhere urged animal in direction presently be fortunate enough to feel solid ground under horse foot few moment later be safely ashore riding hard along bank parallel with stream by time ling have swallowed considerable quantity of water lung be already half full be evident therefore that in few minute fellow must sink for last time frobisher be now abreast of few second later sighted low place in bank where must re enter stream urging animal to top speed in moment be plunging down bank into water plunge submerged horse rider for moment when frobisher head again appeared saw ling body swirling past in strongest part of current moment frobisher have drawn man to hoisting head clear of water on to peak of saddle in front of then steered horse to bank be fortunate enough to be able to regain solid ground without further mishap lowered ling carefully to ground dismounted after securing horse by bridle to convenient tree set about task of restoring half drowned korean to consciousness frobisher have have good deal of first aid experience during period of service in navy therefore knew exactly what to do laying korean flat on back knelt on ground astride of body seized ling wrist in hand then proceeded to move man arm slowly backward forward from position right above head forward to side of body then back again thus actually pumping air forcibly into lung after few minute of treatment ling began to show sign of returning life before long opened eye coughed chokingly then rolled over on side vomiting up water have swallowed coughing out of lung a well then frobisher completed work of restoration by administering sip two of brandy from cup belonging to emergency flask few more moment later ling be able to stagger to foot then not until then did korean appear to recover full faculty recognise who be that have saved from watery grave korean licked dry lip carefully avoiding looking rescuer in face stammered out kind of thanks to master for saving life frobisher observing man manner became more than ever convinced that there be treachery in wind determined to be thoroughly on guard day night there be time to think about such matter just now river be rising higher moment if cart be to be got safely across without loss of men mule cargo be necessary to set thing in motion immediately on opposite bank of stream be now collected of sam riek driver who have run along so a to be in at death a fully expected frobisher sharply ordered back to post telling to get caravan in motion prepare to cross men have seen leader negotiate ford in safety so be not quite so timid a might have be expected a heavily laden cart formed kind of anchorage support to mule driver young man soon have satisfaction of seeing entire caravan safely on desired side without loss when immediately got procession once more in motion toward yong wol during whole of day travelled along jungle road with thick solid greenery hemming in on side sun pouring down upon like flame ling marched along silent morose never speaking word unless frobisher actually addressed ordered to translate command to men be with unfeigned thankfulness just a sun be about to set young man saw not far ahead of small clearing somewhat similar to one where have camped on previous evening determined to spend night there cart be drawn up in precisely similar formation supper be cooked by time that be disposed of hand be more than ready to seek couch frobisher have already pitched tent have just entered to get cutlas second revolver when ling came up to keep filst watch mastel same a last night remarked ingratiatingly frobisher looked fixedly at for few moment ling lowered eye man answered englishman keep first watch to night kept yesterday keep to day now run away get rest ling expect need after experience morning ling gritted teeth under long scanty moustache arrangement must not suit plan at why must not eccentric westerner be consistent wondered englishman kept second watch yesterday ling have fully expected that must do same again while now lathel watch filst mastel pleaded sleepy sleep now mastel look out look here man exclaimed frobisher wrathfully who be master here just understand a will save trouble in future when tell to do thing just remember that have got to do do at once now get away to wherever be going to lie down will call when be time for to go on duty not word off go without more palaver for moment seemed a though ling intended to disobey then englishman great stature commanding presence have effect slunk off lay down under one of wagon not to sleep simply lay there leaning on elbow regarding frobisher with malignant expression about couple of hour later after darkness have fallen upon camp for considerable time rest of men be asleep began to listen for something frobisher must have be intensely interested must have glanced into ling mind read what be working there about ten o'clock frobisher began to feel so drowsy that although have made round only hour previously determined to repeat in order to avoid falling asleep at post so taking up lantern cautiously feeling way to avoid stepping on slumbering form of of men began again to make circuit of camp ling have be in place apparently sound asleep when frobisher have passed hour previously when young man now directed light of lantern under ling cart saw that fellow be no longer there hurried survey of camp soon convinced that korean be nowhere within circle of cart must therefore be outside frobisher argued if outside where what doing there must be one answer to question so without moment hesitation frobisher set to work to arouse slumbering korean afterwards herding in front of until have all collected together in little knot in centre of camp next endeavoured in pidgin english to make comprehend situation a presented to unfortunately be men who have seldom never come in contact with white people soon saw that did not understand word be saying be compelled therefore to fall back upon sign after time began to comprehend dimly what be that leader be trying to tell when at length have succeeded in impressing upon fact that camp be in imminent danger took four of number to one of cart unloaded one of chest of rifle one of ammunition broke open distributed weapon quantity of ammunition to korean at same time carefully instructing by repeated action how to load fire rifle luckily men be quick to learn appeared delighted with weapon seemed to look upon a present fully realised that however willing might be must scarcely be able to hold out long against regular troop even though latter be poorly trained especially if troop must appear a might be fully expected in overwhelming number be duty however to protect property committed to charge a long a must there be always possibility that rebel at yong wol might come part of way to meet that sound of firing might bring to assistance therefore selected rifle for stuffed quantity of ammunition into breech pocket pocket of coat being full of revolver cartridge then went round placing small force of twenty men in most sheltered advantageous position must arrange after there be nothing to be done to keep sharp look out await development be not long in coming frobisher have barely found time to get men to place to arm having previously enjoined strict silence by sign again of course when straining ear caught slight rustling sound in jungle close at hand be sound of bush fern shrub being cautiously pushed aside sound of stealthy approach of considerable body of men soon became abundantly evident that camp be entirely surrounded that be to be attacked from side at once frobisher flitted hither thither silently peering into jungle from between cart underneath wheel be presently able by dim light of star to distinguish that whole bush be in barely perceptible motion attacker be at very edge of evidently only waiting for command to commence operation englishman therefore determined by being first to secure advantage of surprise at shouted word korean discharged rifle into jungle at point blank range reloading on instant while frobisher heightened effect by selecting spot where must already see glint of rifle barrel in starlight discharging six chamber of revolver in direction effect upon attacker must have be considerable for immediately following discharge there arose tremendous outburst of shriek yell groan shouted order cry of encouragement frobisher saw several form leap out of bush go crashing to earth in clearing have just time to re load revolver before surrounding bush burst into perfect tempest of flame lead indicating that government troop must be present in force one of sam riek men right at elbow uttered pitiful cry clutched frenziedly at breast from blood be spouting dropped to ground chest torn to piece by five charge of pot leg stout nail have struck at same moment while groan scream from various part of enclosure showed that little force have suffered pretty severely men be now however re loading firing a rapidly a must independently of other not knowing language found impossible to control sufficiently to make fire only at word of command realised that at rate at be firing enormous wastage be taking place be powerless must only hope that result must justify expenditure attacker presently lighted large fire at edge of clearing that might have light to fight by what with ruddy flickering of flame incessant flashing of rifle running crouching form of troop desperate energy with defender fought scene be fit subject for brush of wiertz verestchagin men on side be falling fast frobisher be half blinded by blood from wound in forehead inflicted by ricochetting slug bullet presently began to realise despite stubborn resistance of men government troop be slowly surely closing in on that end must not be very long delayed fought a englishman fight doing a much execution a four of men must not be everywhere at once although rushed here there encouraging urging defender to fresh effort grimy bleeding powder stained did best to obey pelting rain of lead be rapidly reducing number a fire slackened for want of men troop edged in ever closer closer until at sudden shouted word of command surged forward stormed enclosure carrying by sheer weight of number sam riek men be slaughtered like sheep frobisher found surrounded by at least dozen men shooting stabbing at until seemed miraculous that still survived laid about desperately many man of enemy went down under terrific sweep of cutlas revolver have emptied long ago save for single shot be hoarding against special emergency fight must not last much longer foe pressed so closely about that frobisher must no longer freely swing cutlas while blood running down into eye half blinded out of corner of one eye however suddenly caught sight of heap of cartridge that have emptied on ground for men to help from foe have driven almost on top of pile seeing that there be possible escape young englishman determined to sell life dearly with cutlas hand warded off blow be raining upon head with other fired last chamber of revolver right into middle of heap of ammunition next instant there shot forth dazzling burst of flame accompanied by crackling report for brief instant frobisher have confused vision of torn writhing limb body then something struck sharply there be sound a of roaring tumbling thundering water in ear knew more chapter five on river when frobisher recovered consciousness became aware of most excruciating pain in head left side so extreme be suffering that must scarcely restrain groan to add to discomfort be in complete darkness furthermore be being jolted shaken about in most agonising manner sick faint with pain be several minute before be able to recall what have happened to then remembered last scene of fight when in hope of destroying a many of foe a possible have discharged revolver into heap of ammunition there must recollected have be hundred of round of cartridge lying loose within very few foot of be doubtless bullet from one of have struck in side felt pretty sure shattered one more of rib a for pain in head be of course accounted for by stroke have received across forehead early in fight put up hand to aching brow discovered to surprise that have be carefully bandaged that wound have evidently be cleansed for hair be still damp there be clotted blood adhering to also found upon further investigation that jacket have be removed that body have be strapped up with rough wrapping appeared probable therefore that captor have received order to capture alive if possible otherwise knowing a did usual method adopted by chinese korean toward wounded prisoner felt tolerably certain that must have be barbarously destroyed while still unconscious particularly a have be direct mean of bringing dreadful death upon so many of assailant a thought of must only come to one conclusion have be kept alive in order that upon arrival at head quarter might be examined by torture if necessary a to extent of knowledge of plot against government a to existence of other scheme for bringing arm into country now have intention of being submitted to diabolically ingenious torment practised by korean executioner important thing therefore be to contrive if possible to escape while there be yet time before thinking about escape be absolutely necessary that must discover own whereabouts number of men by whom be at present guarded be now entirely unarmed having doubt dropped cutlas one of revolver at time when have be struck down while second revolver have be in side pocket of coat have probably be discovered seized when jacket be stripped off by individual who have attended to wound in side with great effort wrench caused to bite lip to bleeding point to keep back groan frobisher contrived to raise to sitting posture then discovered that be in closed litter of sort palanquin must tell by short jerky motion be being borne over very rough ground feeling cautiously around in faint hope that jacket might have be thrown into palanquin with perhaps revolver still in pocket frobisher finger encountered one of curtain gradually gathering up be presently able to pull aside sufficiently to enable to see out be still dark star be shining brightly thin slice of moon have risen just clear of treetop bordered jungle so that young englishman be able to make out surroundings with comparative ease marching alongside palanquin on side at distance of few foot only so narrow be jungle path be line of government troop weapon consisting of flint lock match lock halberd old muzzle loader in few case modern breechloader sloped over shoulder while close beside litter little in advance so that frobisher be unable to see man face walked officer with drawn two handed chinese sword in hand be evidently quite prepared to cut prisoner down without parley must make slightest attempt at escape beside walked man whom frobisher have difficulty in recognising a ling be by mean grieved to observe that korean have also suffered damage for ling head be roughly bandaged right arm hung down limp useless while walked with limp proved have received injury to leg a well cautious glance rearward through open curtain disclosed fact that caravan of cart be coming along in rear escorted by few file of troop there be nothing to be seen of unfortunate sam riek driver frobisher be forced to conclusion that rather than encumber with other prisoner soldier have simply shot down butchered few who might have remained alive after capture of encampment having thus discovered be possible at moment frobisher closed curtain again threw back in litter trifle relieved by few breath of fresh air determined to sleep if must so that might sooner recover strength be fit to attempt escape must chance occur a painfully twisted body round so a to lie on back thus take a much weight a possible off broken rib became aware of something hard in hip pocket thrusting in hand brought out little travelling flask of brandy have used to revive ling very morning how little have thought when did so that next occasion on be to use must find prisoner in hand of barbarous soldiery on way have not shadow of doubt to imprisonment only too probably revolting lingering death at end of however a told be not dead yet very far from indeed while there be life there be always hope so took good long pull at flask felt so much benefited restored thereby that very few minute afterward fell into doze although not exactly amounting to complete unconsciousness yet served to mitigate to considerable extent pain from be suffering mercifully prevented mind from dwelling unduly upon horrid possibility of future before finally fell into deep refreshing sleep when awoke be broad daylight atmosphere be perceptibly cooler together with fact that palanquin be frequently tilted to considerable angle that bearer seemed to be finding difficulty in retaining footing convinced that must be descending other side of range of hill knew must have have to cross if have be allowed to continue journey to yong wol felt pretty certain that yong wol be not objective of party since have be informed of presence of caravan must naturally also have be told that rebel force awaited arrival there must of course take particular care to avoid encounter especially if be known that rebel be there in force be just noon by frobisher watch have be allowed to retain have escaped notice of captor when regained level ground hour so later company came to halt litter be set down hand a frobisher must see by looking through curtain prepared to make meal be by time beginning to suffer very severely from thirst have about made up mind to call for ling order to bring water when individual softly pulled curtain aside stood looking down at prisoner with expression on face that frobisher found difficult to fathom then seeing that englishman be conscious ling remarked glad see mastel open eye again thinkee once that mastel killed dead be fault of yours be not treacherous rascal returned frobisher so savagely that korean involuntarily stepped backward pace if ever get out of can get hand on will make sorry for betrayal of ah mastel exclaimed ling glancing apprehensively over shoulder speak so loud listen when save life molning wish velly much that must wain dale not then too late ling nevel folget kindness of mastel tly to savee if can to do must pletend velly glad caught pletend velly angly against allee same not so leally do allee can fol on qt despite anger pain frobisher must scarcely refrain from smiling at quaint pidgin english especially phrase qt man have evidently picked up from englishman of seemed quite proud sternly repressed inclination looked keenly at ling to ascertain if must whether man be really in earnest in saying that must help if must korean now bore scrutiny boldly did not lower eye from expression of face frobisher felt almost convinced that ling meant what said if fellow must be relied upon implicitly must be simply invaluable might be mean of getting frobisher out of clutch of korean whereas without assistance escape seemed almost beyond bound of possibility be therefore in gentler voice that englishman said very well ling will believe what be more if prove true to help to effect escape will see that be given reward such a have never before dreamed of if want to prove that be in earnest for goodness ' sake bring water plenty of be nearly dying of thirst after anxious glance round a though feared that even at distance be conversation might have be overheard ling turned away with heavy scowl on face presumably to give correct colour to proposed part with admirable assumption of indifference went toward place where soldier be already partaking of simple meal of boiled rice thin kind of soup washed down by copious draught of raki strong pungent spirit distilled from rice here picked up empty cooking pot washed out in little brook by side of be encamped filled with water then sauntered back to frobisher with dashing down on ground so violently that at least content be spilt did not greatly matter however since there be still sufficient left for englishman requirement effect of action be good if there be one man among who appeared to hate despise englishman more thoroughly than others that man be ling frobisher must scarcely bring to believe even after ling assurance that feeling be not genuine so excellent be man acting if acting be much refreshed by water frobisher be able to swallow little of rice korean officer brought to on fibre mat immediately felt benefited by with cessation of jarring movement of litter too pain of wound became considerably le acute altogether be soon feeling much stronger better same decided that must be wise policy on part to feign continuance of extreme weakness pain for time longer in order to throw enemy off guard naturally must not be likely to watch so closely if believed to be too feeble too seriously injured to be capable of making attempt at escape perhaps before long favourable opportunity might present soldier did not linger very long over meal caravan be soon in motion again frobisher observed that time course be almost parallel with hill instead of leaving directly behind be therefore now certain that be going to avoid yong wol consequently there must be little chance of rescue by rebel frobisher hoped that by keeping ear open might be able to gain idea a to place be making for little later by hearing constant repetition of certain name came to conclusion that be bound for place called chhung ju though where be situated even whether be really name of place must not be at certain shortly after nightfall of third day after crossing hill entered walled town of size situated on river ling contrived opportunity to inform frobisher that name of place be indeed chhungju that river be branch tributary of river han also stated that news have be brought by government spy that rebel at yong wol have somehow obtained knowledge of capture of caravan that have rapidly collected force with object of starting in pursuit of party for purpose of recovering arm ammunition before must be delivered to authority in seoul rebel reported ling be only twenty four hour journey behind a must be quite possible for to cut off troop by making direct for capital commander of present force have determined to remain few hour in chhung ju in order to rest men then to transfer whole party cargo to boat barge so proceed down river han a far a yo ju there river must be left must proceed by road to su won so to port of asan where there be enough korean troop to enable two party combined to keep rebel at bay until reinforcement must arrive from seoul accordingly frobisher be not at surprised when at midnight palanquin bearer arrived at house where have be confined under guard made sign for to step into litter did so affecting great debility pain be soon being carried at rapid rate through narrow evil smelling street strewn with garbage putrefying carcass of dog cat rat down to bamboo wharf where force be to embark several barge equipped with large square sail made of matting must be dimly made out by starlight riding in mid stream in cargo have be placed while two large flat bottomed boat be moored alongside landing ready for conveyance of men great haste be displayed in getting troop on board rather surprised frobisher until under cover of shadow cast by one of sail ling found time to whisper that rebel have made forced march be even then close to town spy in service of government have brought news hour previously time have be lost in arranging to beat immediate retreat northern gate have be shut barricaded so a to delay pursuit a long a possible commander of force have already begun to sink remainder of craft lying in river that might not be used by rebel frobisher be watching process of sinking one of when suddenly became aware of commotion in distance gradually becoming louder more insistent until recognised for what be clatter tramp shouting of large body of men in moment air be vibrant with shouted order warning instruction men who have be told off to sink river boat be instantly recalled little fleet hastily pushed off got under way at precise moment that rebel reached northern gate finding shut proceeded to attempt to batter down frobisher lying in palanquin listened to tumult with feeling of utmost joy relief there be plenty of boat still uninjured afloat in stream if pursuer must break down gate quickly enough secure remaining craft come in pursuit be quite on card that must be rescued thus avoid making acquaintance with torture chamber idea of persistently haunted korean officer be clearly man of considerable courage resource for in face of sudden new danger remained perfectly cool giving order clearly concisely before favouring slant of wind little fleet drew away in good order from shore began to glide quickly downstream before wind current looking behind for be placed in high stern of one of boat where view be unimpeded frobisher saw glimmer of light spring up from direction of gate presently brightened to lurid glare a wind fanned flame unable to batter down stout gate a quickly a desired pursuer have evidently collected quantity of combustible have started to burn down few minute later yell of triumph floating down wind indicated that have succeeded in attempt that have entered town must therefore be now only matter of minute before discovered that prey have escaped by skin of teeth unless rebel be content to leave matter at juncture must soon secure possession of remaining boat start down river in pursuit officer in command of government troop be evidently fully alive to danger of situation for continually shouted order exhortation for speed to various boat comprising little squadron presently frobisher observed that finding progress unsatisfactory crew have got out long oar customarily used for forcing craft upstream against current be employing a sweep with additional power boat began to slide through water more rapidly frobisher began to fear that unless pursuer be very quick indeed must fail to overtake even now by time however must plainly perceive flicker of torch moving about wharf pier of chhung ju presently few of same light appeared on bosom of river rebel have evidently rowed out in small boat be towing barge left anchored in mid stream to shore moment before sharp bend in river shut off view of town englishman saw to great satisfaction dark loom of matting sail a pursuing force drew away from bank be now race of korean against korean remained to see party must win troop with prisoner captured arm ammunition have managed to secure nearly hour start what with wind current sweep be making downstream toward main channel of river at speed of about four knot hour of course a soon a main stream of han be entered current must become stronger must sweep along still more rapidly also fleet arriving first in river must obtain advantage of increased rapidity might very easily be out of sight before pursuer arrived there if happened be not unlikely that latter might abandon chase a hopeless soon became evident however that rebel be not going to be thrown off so easily for a fleet emerged upon broad bosom of han began to turn westward perceived that pursuing squadron be not very long distance behind be undoubtedly overhauling rapidly be at first at loss to understand how must be few minute later quick ear caught certain sound floating down breeze steady monotonous throbbing sound something like ah have now must be possible yes undoubtedly be throbbing of machinery quick muffled puffing of exhaust steam evidently rebel have discovered something that troop have overlooked small steamer pinnace have promptly raised steam in probably by firing up with plenty of oil wood so a to obtain power quickly be utilising craft to tow squadron downstream when once boat have be put in motion must be much quicker method of progression than use of sail sweep alone in case rebel be quickly overhauling before hour have passed frobisher continuing to watch race with absorbed interest saw streak of flame cut rearward darkness almost immediately heard vicious hum close above head followed shortly afterwards by whiplike crack of distant report be well within range then be clear that pursuer must be armed with modern rifle for smooth bore must not have sent bullet nearly so far there be instantly outburst of excitement among soldier musket rifle be hastily unslung loaded sharp fire be opened over stern of various craft apparently only very few of weapon employed be equal to range for frobisher must distinctly see that missile be falling short by little spirt of foam shone white in moonlight where bullet struck water ricochetted off moment later much bigger flash burst from bow of little steamer must now be plainly made out a small craft driven by screw have appearance of launch might have at one time belonged to battleship next moment perfect storm of bullet came hurtling close overhead thing be beginning to get rather too warm for prisoner where be felt especially a certain scream cry from about indicated that volley have be excellently directed therefore determined to seek shelter without further delay for have wish to be killed by own party hastily dragged into shelter of lighter low bulwark soldier encouraged by officer responded gamely to attack upon opened well sustained fire on opponent who by now have drawn within range even of musket from new position frobisher must see splinter flying aboard several of pursuing boat while occasional yell scream showed that at least of korean bullet be finding billet several stark motionless form lying about deck of lighter showed superior marksmanship weapon of rebel latter be now beginning to steal up alongside though about hundred yard still separated combatant firing became general on side indeed so determined persistent be fusillade that there be continuous roar rattle of sound while silvery sheen of moonlit night be reddened by glare of rifle flash before coming to east frobisher have believed in common with many other people that korean be cowardly effeminate race always more eager to avoid than to engage in conflict race brought about end by cunning treachery rather than by force of arm whatever characteristic of nation a whole might be must not fail to admire vigour energy with side be conducting already sanguinary little battle on water of han to ensure that there must be lack of ammunition soldier have adopted same expedient a frobisher at camp have opened up several of captured case of ammunition have thrown content into one big heap in middle of lighter deck so that man might more easily help prisoner congratulated that be at distance from pile for have desire to repeat experience of few day previously two squadron be soon running downstream level with other steam pinnace having reduced speed so that might not pas korean fleet be gradually edging closer still closer together a did so volley of musketry became ever fiercer fiercer until air fairly vibrated with sound threaded with shriek groan of wounded dying scattered everywhere about deck must be seen form of men who have be struck down splintered chipped deck be already deeply stained with blood although action be general throughout two fleet appeared a though hottest part of fire be being directed against particular boat in young englishman lay prisoner frobisher soon found that at such close range position under lee of low bulwark be anything secure since nickel jacketed bullet rebel be using be already drilling hole clean through thick planking passing out through opposite bulwark therefore again painfully removed taking up new position with back against stout mast of barge with between point from volley be coming from new position made fresh survey of surroundings assured that if matter went on like much longer there must be none left alive on board to defend craft capture must be certain rubbed hand with satisfaction at thought perhaps hour might see safely aboard rebel squadron where meanwhile wondered be ling if be really sincere in desire to show gratitude time be at hand for to do so number of able bodied men on board be growing le moment if ling must only be persuaded to bring englishman two revolver loaded korean might be able to obtain possession of craft steer over to shelter of other squadron ala frobisher have not far to look in order to discover whereabouts of man be thinking of ling be close at hand reclining in half sitting posture with back against bulwark hand be spread open on deck musket having fallen from nerveless finger head be tilted back until high conical hat have fallen off there plainly visible in moonshine be great patch of coagulating blood on throat showing where bullet have drilled clean through neck ling must never speak again in world career whether for good for evil be closed for ever be useless therefore for frobisher to look for help in direction so if be to escape at have only to rely upon unfortunately be still much too weak from effect of wound to be able to deal with situation singlehanded there be a yet quite enough of barge men remaining alive to overpower murder in moment if be foolish enough to attempt such thing at instant there occurred fresh outburst of firing from korean boat followed second later by loud booming report in direction of rebel squadron caused very atmosphere to vibrate barge to quiver a though have struck rock frobisher painfully hauled to foot staggered to bulwark to ascertain what have happened sufficiently disheartening spectacle met eye several shot from last volley have evidently penetrated plating of steam launch boiler causing to explode blowing frail side of little craft asunder killing nearly man of crew englishman be just in time to see disappear below surface of river in great cloud of steam to hear shriek of wounded dying people a engulfing water swirled about cry of execration from rebel exultant shout of korean realised that last hope of escape be slipping away from thrown into confusion by loss of steamer entire rebel fleet came to standstill involuntarily brought to anchor by sunken launch rested on river bottom still attached to hawser by squadron be being towed a hawser happened to consist of chain cable instead of rope a have be made fast with complicated system of hitch that might not slip be likely to be time before must be cast off boat set free to pursue once more troop be not to escape without further punishment after maddened by sudden wreckage of hope rebel again seized rifle poured concentrated fire into nearest vessel of enemy chanced to be boat containing frobisher fortune being last in line that parting volley did more damage than have be sustained during whole of fight aim be good bullet swept deck of barge like tempest of hail sending man who be not under cover into eternity once again also folly of leaving loose pile of ammunition exposed be demonstrated for penetrating thin bulwark a though be so much paper several of shot ploughed into heap of cartridge exploding scattering death mutilation round when smoke of explosion cleared away be seen that there be scarcely dozen men left alive if boat next in line have not very promptly responded to frenzied hail of survivor at once put back to take on board with prisoner man must have be lost for have scarcely transferred to deck of other craft before frobisher barge with large hole blown in bottom by explosion heeled over sank taking dead wounded to bottom with fight be now virtually over only few more long distance shot be exchanged before korean fleet be out of range leaving rebel squadron behind in state of hopeless confusion late same afternoon town of yo ju be reached men cargo be disembarked without sign of reappearance of rebel in fact latter have given up chase thoroughly disheartened after destruction of steamer have reconciled to loss of arm fortunately for englishman drake have not be paid in advance money be therefore still intact available for purchase of consignment so with true oriental submission to fate retraced step to yong wol subsequently sent messenger to drake informing that convoy have be attacked overpowered whole of cargo captured young white man in command slain made prisoner frobisher very much alive still weak from wound arrived in due time at asan closely guarded by file of soldiery be carried direct to fort at mouth of river here be immediately haled before officer in command of garrison closely questioned through interpreter a to connection with matter of bringing arm to rebel have already foreseen that must happen have decided upon line of conduct so steadfastly refused to supply required information even when threatened with naked sword official in towering rage drew flashed before eye seeing that demonstration produced effect upon intrepid young englishman sung wan for so officer be named gave few curt order to men who be guarding frobisher be hurried from room conducted down several long gloomy corridor finally thrust into large cell a soon a eye became accustomed to semi darkness must see be furnished with several instrument of horribly suggestive character did not take man of intelligence long to realise that have at last made acquaintance of supremely diabolic institution korean torture chamber chapter six in prison cell by jove exclaimed prisoner to a eye gradually took in dreadful surroundings be sadly afraid that mean end of murray frobisher mighty unpleasant end promise to be escape possible went on carefully making tour of apartment at interval tapping on wall with iron tool have picked up in endeavour to obtain idea of thickness so to judge a to possibility of digging out if be left alone long enough result be disheartening to say least of spot where tapped gave back dull solid sound indicating that wall be quite unusually thick that escape by mean of excavation anything of kind be absolutely out of question room be somewhat peculiarly shaped being evidently situated in one of angle of fort wall containing thick oaken iron studded door through have be thrust be evidently enormously thick while chamber be fifteen foot wide by about thirty five foot long end wall opposite door being curved somewhat in form of ellipse meeting in blunt angle exactly opposite door high up in angle about eight foot above floor be small iron barred window might for bar have be large enough to permit of egress of man of ordinary size total height of chamber be about ten foot wall be almost entirely covered with weird terrible looking instrument of frobisher recognised through having read about in book of others must not possibly guess use shape form be however so dreadfully suggestive that felt to be mercy that be ignorant of more subtle refined form of oriental torture otherwise must soon lose reason in contemplation of frightful us to instrument must be put also strewn about floor in such profusion a to leave little room for anything else be larger implement whose use frobisher be fortunately unable to guess at while in two corner of room there be pile of variously shaped knife sword guessed torturer be wont to employ in discharge of ghastly business among recognised long razor edged weapon used for administering terrible death of thousand cut also sword with saw instead of smooth edge big broad bladed keen knife short heavy sword used upon victim who be lucky enough to be sentenced to quick death by beheading to frobisher seemed that merely to immure prisoner in such ghastly museum be in act of torture might easily drive le well balanced man than mad within very few hour one thing rather astonished be fact of sword being left lying loose in cell surely rather than submit to tender mercy of korean torturer prisoner however weak timid must arm with one of die fighting even put end to own existence rather than have life wrung from inch by inch minute by minute in agony indescribable at rate did not take frobisher moment to determine that when end must come must take long weapon used for thousand cut standing in middle of chamber where must have clear sweep for sword fight enemy to death strode over to corner drew weapon have selected out of scabbard have long handle permitting two hand to be employed blade be made of very highly tempered steel a stiff springless a english razor a keen be about four foot in length quite two inch wide steel at back be fully quarter of inch thick there be very slight curve in blade point be sharply curved round similar to point found on old japanese sword in hand of powerful man like must undoubtedly prove very terrible weapon indeed be so heavy that frobisher wondered how must be possible with so ponderous blade to carry out particular form of execution for be designed must serve purpose admirably sailor told sheathed weapon placed at far end of chamber where might be ready to hand if necessity arose for to use next step in examination of cell be to get glimpse if possible out of little window high up in wall to learn something concerning whereabouts of prison how be situated then in somewhat improbable event of opportunity offering for escape must not be handicapped by ignorance with regard to surroundings to end hunted about for something wherewith to construct platform presently managed to collect together pile of instrument piece of ancient furniture odds end of lumber piled together enabled assisted by great height to bring eye to level of bottom of window having climbed up using great care not to upset pile in so doing frobisher seized iron grating protecting window thus supporting in position looked out narrow a be window on inside view young englishman be able to obtain from be quite extensive for embrasure formed opening be splayed widely outward on side in manner frequently seen in old english castle in construction of arrow slit in wall first thing noticed be that have be correct in estimation of thickness of wall be at least six foot thick there be therefore hope whatever of being able to break out through fort be situated on right bank of river judging from open country in neighbourhood must be at little distance from town of asan indeed a frobisher afterwards ascertained building be situated on small peninsula of land jutting out into prince jerome gulf be therefore nearly four mile distant from town window embraced view of part of gulf including entrance strip of jungle clad country running right down to water edge while beyond two point outlook be restricted by outer edge of splay in window be built from same cause also frobisher be unable to see ground close enough to wall to judge whether fort be surrounded by moat dry ditch of description although from general appearance of thing surmised that be by estimating angle at line of sight be cut off by outer edge of sill calculated that must be confined in room situated on second story of fort that there must consequently be considerable drop from bottom of window to ground without taking into consideration probable existence of ditch of fifteen twenty foot deep running round base of wall in case even if iron bar must by mean be removed did not appear a though must be possible for to squeeze big body through opening so question of depth of drop outside be hardly worth worrying about one only mean of egress seemed to be door by have entered to that now turned attention with view of ascertaining whether hope lay in direction a have be mentioned door be constructed of timber very much resembling oak inner surface be reinforced by stout iron strap three four inch wide at least inch thick extending across whole width of door round head of bolt studded at interval along whole length of strap indicated that similar iron band existed on other side of door that strap inside outside of there be le than seven pair be connected together thus clearly indicating immense strength of door be thus hopeless to think of cutting way out through only manner in must be passed be by opening in usual manner frobisher therefore set to work to examine lock to discover whether there existed possibility of picking be old fashioned piece of mechanism luckily iron case be on inside of door great keyhole being placed near centre now for piece of stout wire stouter better young englishman proceeded at once to hunt about among various machine instrument in dim corner of chamber in search of what required for time be unsuccessful have reluctantly arrived at conclusion that search must end in failure when eye happened to fall upon very thing needed standing at far end of apartment in part of enclosed by circular portion of wall be sinister looking machine to gearing of one of handle be attached short piece of iron rod thought might disengage without much difficulty forthwith applied to task with such success hour later found in possession of what required true be somewhat stouter than must have be for purpose be one of occasion upon found exceptional strength very useful after few experiment succeeded in bending to shape wanted be experimenting with bent rod in lock when fortunately quick ear caught sound of footstep hurrying down stone flagged corridor toward cell snatching wire out of lock hastily dropped into nearest available place of concealment sauntered toward opposite side of chamber there must be time knew to take down redistribute pile of article have used to enable to look out of window so be compelled to leave a be trusting that in dim light visitor whoever might be must not particularly notice arrangement moment later there be sound of key rattling outside lock clicked loudly door opened closed behind man carrying lamp set down on floor just inside room after carefully locking door again thought instantly flashed through frobisher mind that perhaps after there must be need for to go on with manufacture of skeleton key for be not actual key of door in room at very moment true be in possession of man unless happened to posse fire arm must be queer indeed if desperate prisoner must not overpower tie up somehow secure key to obtain liberty frobisher eye glistened at thought muscle braced for spring at critical moment idea occurred to that other be in power anyhow that must secure key later on just a well a now that meanwhile before acted hastily might be well to hear whether fellow have anything to say perhaps be official come to set at liberty perhaps well must wait little at event see what development ensued having locked door pocketed key visitor picked up lantern advanced into room holding light high glancing keenly round until eye fell upon frobisher whereupon gave short grunt of satisfaction hung lantern on convenient peg by additional light thus afforded englishman be able to examine visitor more closely to estimate chance of success if thing came to rough tumble fight for possession of key stranger be tall almost a tall a frobisher not nearly so heavily built appeared to be about fifty five to sixty year of age so that young englishman did not anticipate serious difficulty in mastering be very richly dressed in garment of fine silk elaborately decorated with embroidery wore round neck heavy gold chain centre of be studded with single enormous ruby a head covering wore round chinese cap be ornamented by single magnificent peacock feather fastened to cap by brooch of solid gold set with huge ruby man whole appearance be indeed imposing magnificent in extreme frobisher instantly guessed that be in presence of very important official indeed man told must surely not be korean korean ever attained to such commanding stature korean have ever be known to display so haughty bearing so dominant personality a eye slowly travelled from detail of man costume to face prisoner recognised that visitor be indeed not korean chinaman chinaman of highest grade too without doubt mandarin there be mistaking thin ascetic high bred face prominent cheek bone almond shaped eye long scanty moustache scarcely concealed strong resolute looking lip of be however rather too thin lending expression of cruelty relentlessness of purpose be anything reassuring to prisoner for few moment two men stood gazing at one taking other measure then chinaman spoke using excellent english be governor of fortress of asan began coldly have just be informed of presence here must have be brought before on arrival chanced to be hour of afternoon rest who what be name be murray frobisher answered englishman be formerly lieutenant in british navy have exclaimed governor say formerly ' take then that be no longer in country service that be not known to government that have turned gun runner in order to supply arm to rebel against lawful sovereign be correct in supposition answered frobisher tax with gun running plead guilty to charge certainly be bringing arm to rebel a term conscience be quite clear upon point be well known that korean government have be treating subject in most outrageous manner if of with more pluck than rest have made up mind to put end to such tyranny more power to say may somebody else be more fortunate than in providing with weapon wherewith to uphold liberty rid of ruler who be oppressing chinaman looked at frobisher for moment then gave vent to harsh sneering laugh well spoken young friend mocked have told something wanted to know now perhaps will answer few more question must very strongly advise to do so since may save good deal of inconvenience will say may ask what please retorted frobisher promise to answer will ask question nevertheless said governor if will not speak now other mean of obtaining reply can doubtless be found first of what ship brought arm who be captain what quantity of arm ammunition did consignment consist of have be lost in transit understand finally how many more shipload be being sent out here from country frobisher laughed made reply did hear demanded governor there be deadly menace in voice quite distinctly answered frobisher coolly surely can not have already forgotten that gave to understand clearly scarcely minute ago will tell nothing when say thing mean soh remarked chinaman well will have to night to think matter over if have not altered that stubborn mind of yours by morning will make acquaintance of of little plaything indicating various machine instrument with delicate long taloned finger there be here be probably new to in place understand use well will leave lantern so that may study carefully during night decide what prefer to do with ironical bow governor then turned toward door finger seeking pocket where have placed key be moment for frobisher have be waiting with spring hurled at retreating figure of governor that individual be not to be caught so easily must have glimpsed prisoner face out of corner of eye a turned for be round again in moment dodging englishman furious leap thrust hand inside jacket before frobisher must get to grip with found confronted with muzzle of heavy revolver pointing straight at governor forefinger already crooked round pressing trigger not time friend smiled governor sardonically one step farther shoot to wound painfully do want immediate taste of what be in store for to morrow leaving sentence unfinished chinaman slowly backed to door leaving frobisher glowering helplessly in middle of room with back against door pistol still levelled governor felt behind inserted key turned lock then with one swift movement be outside door slammed key grated prisoner be alone once more well murmured half amused despite anger disappointment rascal be too smart for that time here lifted executioner sword from place in corner thing will be little different to morrow if man be foolish enough to trust here again alone frobisher waited until sound of visitor footstep have died away along corridor then congratulating upon fact that worthy have left light behind re possessed of piece of iron rod with assistance of lantern set to work upon lock again in hope that might be able to complete skeleton key let out before governor returned to carry out threat be more difficult matter than have anticipated after about two hour of ineffective tinkering be compelled to acknowledge defeated with bitter objurgation flung useless twisted rod into corner not being able to find anything else must serve purpose made up mind that must have to await development rely upon own strength of arm to get out whenever governor somebody else must visit cell meanwhile if be to be in good form for possibly strenuous morrow be necessary that must sleep seeing that nobody have thought worth while to provide with food so unsheathing sword with help of proposed to effect deliverance flung down at far end of chamber laying weapon beside have scarcely touched floor before be fast asleep have be more worn out weary than have at suspected seemed a though have just closed eye when be awakened by thundering crash of sound apparently close at hand chamber in be confined quivered perceptibly with shock while right upon heel of concussion came noise of distant explosion heavy gun by jingo ejaculated frobisher springing to foot fired be using place a target shot must have struck close outside here what be in wind now wonder anyway if be attacking fort must in certain way be friend of mine for be certainly enemy of enemy within wall pound away boy exclaimed cheerfully apostrophising unseen gunner pound away if kill first may perhaps make exit for through wall at moment heard sound of voice raised in alarm shouting of order indication of suddenly awakened thoroughly alarmed garrison men be rushing about here there rattle of arm sounded distantly through iron bound door presently from battlement apparently directly over head there boomed forth crash of korean garrison answering gun followed almost immediately afterwards by still tremendous shock accompanied by rumble rattle of falling masonry a shot from attacking force struck full upon fortress wall time seemingly just above foeman gunner seemed to have waited for flash of gun on battlement aimed for appeared to be making pretty good practice young englishman looked at watch have somehow escaped finger of captor have kept wound regularly found to astonishment that be close on half past four o'clock in morning that therefore daylight must not be very far distant must not be long before must climb up to perch at window see who attacker be meanwhile explosion have increased from exchange of single shot to general cannonade on side now very atmosphere be vibrating with deafening concussion a gun on battlement roared heavy conical shot from attacking party plunged against thick masonry of wall toppling down great mass of stone mortar debris at hit gunner be evidently directing fire mostly on portion of building wherein frobisher be confined told that must require little more of attention before wall became so shattered that shot must come plunging right into cell began to speculate on must then happen first whether must be blown to piece smashed into shapelessness whether opening must be made by might be enabled to escape if only shot must strike directly upon iron bar of window perhaps must enlarge aperture sufficiently to allow to crawl through looking up at window a idea entered mind saw that sky be already flushed pink knew that there must therefore be light enough outside to enable to see what be going on at once climbed up on pile have collected hauling up to opening looked out at edge of jungle observed dozen big field piece drawn up in line must see gunner busily loading reloading from pile of ammunition placed beside gun while behind on slightly rising ground partly concealed by jungle be possible to make out large body of rifleman who now that light be increasing be preparing to take part in attack there be doubt a to identity of attacker for frobisher must now distinguish several flag similar to flown on boat of rebel squadron few day previously during fight on river particular force have evidently be joined by contingent two combined have decided to make attempt to recapture important cargo now reposed within wall of fortress of asan suddenly a interested englishman watched heard loud shrieking whirring sound somewhat resembling very rapid exhaust from locomotive flash of flame leaped out close alongside one of gun followed by loud explosion great cloud of smoke dust when cloud have cleared away saw that one of besieger gun have be temporarily put clean out of action for right wheel be blown completely away gun be lying on side half buried in sand while a for crew who have be working so far a must ascertain have be blown completely out of existence for there be visible sign of high explosive shell have obviously not come from fort where then have come from what new surprise have fate in store chapter seven saved by hairbreadth furious fusillade directed against fort at once slackened after explosion of shell amongst gun while fire from fort redoubled round of solid shot grape chain shrapnel with withering volley of small arm fire sweeping through rebel rank like hail playing awful havoc among closely packed mass of men only partially concealed by jungle besieger a frobisher have already have opportunity of observing be not easily to be discouraged after first shock of surprise have subsided quickly pulled together again gun crew came leaping out from cover of jungle gathered round wrecked field piece piece of timber empty ammunition box even small branch of tree be secured placed alongside gun several more men seized piece lifted up until be partly supported upon remaining uninjured wheel pile of material have be collected be then built solidly up in place of wrecked wheel fresh gunner began to serve weapon a coolly a though original crew have not be blown into eternity few minute previously there must be doubt that korean rebel be showing to be remarkably brave efficient body of men while wrecked gun be once more being made serviceable englishman observed that two of other gun be being slewed round until muzzle pointed seaward at once surmised that must be direction from that devastating shell have come crane neck a might although must see portion of sheet of water forming prince jerome bay must not see whole of entrance be clear however be therefore obvious that vessel from shot have be fired for vessel must be have contrived to enter bay unobserved must now be cruising about somewhere near south shore frobisher be very anxious to obtain sight of for greatly desired to get idea of what nationality might be might belong to of fleet of various power maintained squadron in chinese water at time might be chinese japanese war vessel man of war must consider at liberty to interfere in event of battle taking place on korean soil if only for protection of foreign inhabitant whose life might be imperilled in consequence of hostility frobisher must not help thinking that captain of man of war be taking matter with rather high hand in deliberately firing on one of party concerned without first offering party opportunity to come to peaceful arrangement such high handed action did not appear like of european naval officer therefore most obvious conclusion be that vessel must be chinese japanese even a frobisher looked however question answered for moving slowly into field of vision there appeared bow of cruiser quite close inshore a gradually revealed whole length gun flashing continuously meanwhile englishman saw that dragon ensign be flying from peak that be therefore chinese man of war china then have at length decided to take hand in game effort be to be directed against rebel knowing a did term of tien tsin convention of between china japan word international complication at once suggested to frobisher mind despite awkwardness of own position must not help rubbing hand gleefully matter be rapidly developing if must escape from present unpleasant predicament there might be excellent chance for to see active service again either in chinese japanese navy cared very little for be what thing must evidently come to sooner later japan be too much interested in korea to permit china to play out own game there alone frobisher have little leisure however for contemplation of possible diplomatic action on part of chinese japanese for have now other thing to engage attention to astonishment a watched saw that ship have just steamed into view be not alone be followed close astern by cruiser of own size class also firing heavily with broadside battery also flying chinese flag third fourth vessel gunboat followed in wake bringing up rear there be three hired transport appeared to be crowded with men so be chance appearance of single cruiser at critical moment be evidently part of preconcerted scheme arrangement previously made between korea china whereby latter country be to lend assistance for crushing of rebellion task korean government have apparently decided to be beyond capability chinese squadron have be steaming exceedingly slowly when have first come into view frobisher must now see from flash of white water under ship stern that engine be being sent astern few second later entire fleet came to anchor cable flying out through hawse pipe with roar be plainly audible at fort four men of war anchored stem stern broadside on to shore while three transport took up berth about mile farther seaward ship being screened from rebel fire by steel hull of men of war fully recovered now from first surprise rebel resumed cannonade most pluckily two of field piece being directed against fleet while remaining four retained original position poured well directed concentrated fire on fort be apparently intention of rebel commander to reduce take possession of fort if must before chinese troop must be enabled to effect landing so that might have shelter behind to hold out until must summon more rebel troop to aid commandant of garrison have evidently intention of letting fort slip through finger now that assistance be so close at hand from what frobisher have already seen of felt sure that visitor of yesterday be exact type of man who must blow building into air with that contained rather than surrender even to overwhelming force gun from battlement crashed out anew although fire be not nearly so accurate a from rebel piece yet in long run weight of metal be bound to tell while shot be solid have not therefore devastating effect of percussion shell fired from war ship began to be apparent that of at least be getting home that effect be already becoming very galling to rebel latter now harassed almost beyond endurance by combined fire of fort ship brought up about midday company of sharpshooter armed with latest breech loader have somehow managed to secure by mean of well directed volley contrived to keep men of fort from gun to extent that fire from that building dwindled almost to nothing so that one more of rebel gun be released to be trained on anchored cruiser when effect of increased cannonade soon became apparent in direction also now again frobisher saw flash of fire leap up on board men of war for appeared that rebel be also possessed of few percussion shell further observed that ten inch gun in bow turret of foremost cruiser have be put out of action entirely thus giving good deal of relief to men who have be exposed to fire weapon have be struck full upon muzzle at precise moment when shell be leaving combined explosion have torn length of about four foot off end of gun have lifted clean out of bearing so that now pointed skyward under side resting on edge of turret threatening to crash down on deck outside at moment ruddy orange tint of light length of shadow told that sun be near setting yet up to time effort have be made to land of men from transport now frobisher observed that boat be being lowered from steamer that soldier be beginning to clamber down into while war ship redoubled fire with evident purpose of putting rebel gun out of action so making easier for troop to effect landing now at length that terrible continuous cannonade began to have effect especially a garrison of fort have begun to imitate rebel tactic be now harassing foe with rifle fire garrison being sheltered by parapet of battlement be able to fire at leisure without much danger to so that although be not such good marksman a opponent mere weight of fire eventually began to tell upon unfortunate men in open who have nothing fringe of jungle to protect field piece have previously be put out of action be now struck second time by fragment of flying shell collapsed once more on to sand so fierce be rifle shell fire be now being directed upon little band of gunner although made most valiant desperate effort to repair damage be driven away from spot time after time be at last compelled to abandon effort then second field piece be blown completely off carriage by one of solid shot from fort few second afterwards third gun be dismounted crew shattered to piece by shell from one of chinese gunboat stubbornly however rebel still clung to position again swinging round two piece with have be playing on ship resumed bombardment of fort in hope of battering in breach through place might be carried by storm compelling surrender before approaching reinforcement must arrive from fleet so absorbed be frobisher in little drama be being enacted before eye that even when muzzle of rebel gun be trained on what appeared to be very window out of be peeping idea never once occurred to that be in position of considerable danger that must be well advised to climb down so that be not until saw flash of flame leap from piece a be fired simultaneously that realised full extent of temerity then even a flung backward off support on be standing there came terrific concussion followed by rumbling roar a avalanche of stone went crashing to ground below while very building massive a be quaked a though whole edifice be on point of crumbling to piece frobisher dazed half stunned by tremendous shock nearly blinded by shower of dust mortar came pouring in upon found lying on back on floor surrounded by pile of instrument machine block of stone other debris until seemed nothing short of miracle that have not be crushed to piece a chanced however have not received so much a scratch found a picked up that nothing worse have befallen than acquisition of sundry fresh bruise a be already mass of contusion from head to foot felt that one two more made very little difference be just about to climb up again to point of vantage for be intensely interested in learning outcome of stubborn little fight by sea shore when happened to glance upward in order to ascertain whether there be more loose block of stone likely to be dislodged fall on a did so caught sight of ray of daylight shining into gloom of prison upon investigation saw that last three shot from rebel gun must have be so well aimed a to have struck practically same spot for sure enough there be ragged hole in wall slightly above window little to left of apparently at junction of ceiling of cell floor of chamber above just big enough for to thrust head through also what be more to point be evident that very little effort must be needed to pull down more of shattered masonry so enlarge hole sufficiently to enable to crawl through decided must be sheer suicide for to attempt to escape at particular juncture mere appearance of head through hole must be enough to attract entire fire of rebel since must naturally take for one of garrison there be also very probable chance of being seen by rifleman on battlement who must be able to pick off with utmost ease a climbed out no must be necessary to delay attempt until after dark trusting that meanwhile everybody in general governor in particular must be much too busy to pay visit of investigation inspect damage done therefore placed at window once more soon saw that even during short interval of absence matter have altered considerably rebel gun have be dismounted leaving only two remaining while of one have have carriage very badly damaged also several more shell from war ship must have fallen among rifleman for dead wounded be now lying scattered about in heap upon sand while fire from men in jungle have dwindled very considerably boat too have by time pushed off from side of transport be heading twelve of altogether crowded with men in three line in line ahead a frobisher must have phrased for shore of leading boat be steam pinnace whose work be to tow rest in bow of pinnace englishman be able to make out small swivel gun with gunner standing by ready to open fire a soon a boat drew within range must not now be long before end came for when once boat have landed troop rebel must be hopelessly outnumbered seemed evident that frobisher hope of being rescued by latter be doomed to disappointment by time dusk have closed down sufficiently to enable frobisher to distinguish train of small spark left behind by fuse of time shell be now bursting thickly over jungle idea of chinese evidently being to drive men concealed there out into open plan succeeded admirably although not quite in manner anticipated frobisher have watched shell after shell fall among brush reed have seen group after group of men come reeling out from cover only to be mowed down by rifle fire from fort when suddenly perceived small tongue of flame shoot upward from seaward corner of jungle corner be unhappily for rebel right to windward of although number of men immediately rushed to spot did in power to trample beat out flame be of avail fire spread with appalling rapidity five minute after incendiary shell have fallen whole of outer edge of jungle be continuous sheet of flame roar of be plainly audible to imprisoned spectator great mass of dense smoke be driven upward forward through jungle presently hidden rebel soldiery came streaming out driven forth by flame smoke so swift have be advance of fire that clothing of of last to escape be actually smouldering darkness be now falling rapidly sorry a felt for rebel in defeat young englishman must not admire weird magnificence of scene displayed before section of thick jungle fully quarter of mile long hundred yard wide be one roaring crackling mass of fire flame be leaping forward at rate of many yard minute while must have attained height of fully thirty foot cloud of dense smoke billowed upward under surface vividly illuminated by ruddy reflection of leaping flame even sea for mile round be brilliantly illuminated by glare three little fleet of boat be now approaching shore with jet of flame spurting from muzzle of swivel gun appeared to be floating in liquid flame here there everywhere must be heard explosion of ammunition a flame reached loose pile of cartridge man have placed beside while firing on fort with continuous flash explosion of shell a plunged into earth black silhouette of men gun upon background of smoke flame deep orange glow of reflected flame in sky scene so indelibly impressed upon frobisher memory that be not likely to forget a long a life fire greatly assisted garrison men in boat for afforded ample light to direct volley accurately also to choose most favourable spot at to effect landing soon became perfectly clear that hope of success on part of rebel be at end yet even now must not admit to much le to enemy that be beaten slewing round two remaining gun collecting scattered sadly depleted force into one compact body abandoned attack on fort directed whole of energy to task of preventing troop from landing from boat enduring persistent volley poured into rank from fort with most stoical resignation gunner pointed elevated piece a coolly a though be firing for practice at target rifleman loaded fired volley at word of command a steadily a accurately a though there be foeman returning fire remotest possibility man of must be shot cut to piece within next quarter of hour have number not be so dreadfully reduced during fierce day struggle be quite possible that might have won after for gun be so well served rifle volley directed with such deadly aim that boat crew be beginning to suffer severely already two of towed boat have be sunk have be cut adrift so that must not delay others so terrible be punishment inflicted by enemy that landing party must not afford to stop to pick up crew bay be known to be swarming with shark be not therefore probable that very many even of unwounded must reach shore alive one of swivel gun too mounted aboard steam launch have be struck hurled overboard by well directed shot frobisher must distinguish many limp lifeless form hanging over boat gunwale with arm trailing helplessly in water chinese be le obstinate determined than opponent have set out with intention of landing meant to carry out resolve three steamer be still puffing bravely onward moment by moment distance between bow beach became le then suddenly high above crackling of flame rattle of rifle fire crashing explosion of gun young englishman heard clear note of bugle pealing out be evidently command to fix bayonet for flash glitter of steel must be seen a chinese drew from scabbard fixed to rifle second call pealed forth towrope be cast off oar splashed into water with wild exulting yell from occupant boat dashed for shore men in hurling into willow water a keel ground into beach now time have plainly come for rebel to make last stand be hemmed in on three side on one side by fire be now raging furiously on opposite side by cannon rifle fire from fort on third by men from ship who be now forming up in line on beach only avenue of escape left to be in direction of town nearly four mile distant if chose to retreat in direction must scarcely avoid being cut to piece by pursuer there seemed therefore to be nothing for to remain where be fight until be overwhelmed by superior number killing a many of enemy a possible before died be evidently what meant to do two remaining field piece be brought close together muzzle pointing seaward ammunition box belonging to to wrecked gun be brought up placed behind then survivor from day long struggle formed up three deep on side of gun first line lying down second kneeling third standing so that rear rank men must not fire into comrade in front when volley firing commenced gunner loaded gun to very muzzle with solid shot case chain grape else must find then took up position behind piece waiting for command to fire for few tense second two body of men remained motionless forming tremendously impressive tableau there be line of uniformed chinese soldiery bayoneted rifle held at charge officer standing in front on flank with drawn sword on other side be little body of rebel smoke grimed blood stained ragged weary with indomitable resolution written over then chinese bugle again sounded officer shouted word of command landing party with wild yell of defiance charged headlong up beach sword bayonet flashing in lurid light of flame have scarcely covered dozen yard when rebel gun crashed out content went hurtling through closely packed rank leaving wide line of dead wounded in track while immediately afterward came rattling report of volley firing a rebel discharged rifle chinese troop seemed to be literally smitten to halt before awful storm almost a though have charged up against solid wall while cry shriek groan uprose into still evening air thrilled frobisher with horror check however be momentary troop instantly rallied before cruel gun even rifle must be reloaded chinese be among rebel cold steel got to work scene of sanguinary relentless hand to hand fighting ensued memory of be to remain with frobisher for many long day before end be reached must no longer bear to look on climbing down from perch seated on floor covered face with hand for ten minute fearful sound continued unabated then silence gradually fell little later moon rose over scene of carnage such a have seldom be witnessed even upon blood stained soil of korea of rebel not single man remained alive so completely overwhelmed be frobisher by horror of what have witnessed that sat motionless so utterly oblivious to surroundings that never heard grating of key in lock of cell door never heard that door open close never knew that be not still alone until happened to glance wearily up beheld governor gazing down at with sardonic smile while two other men with mask over face stood at attention few pace from one of held coil of stout rope in hand frobisher stared at apprehensively be then too late to put into practice resolve of night before sword with have meant to do so much execution be out of reach knew that slightest movement to secure possession of must mean disabling wound from bullet of revolver governor held suggestively in hand must not afford to take risk since with wound chance of escape must be at end although a appearance went chance of escape appeared to be singularly scanty just now prisoner felt instinctively that momentous crisis be at hand well mr frobisher presently exclaimed governor speaking in perfect english have seen fit to change mind since last have pleasure of seeing will of course be aware by time that can not hope for help from friend outside have be very effectually wiped out to last man really think must be well advised to fall in with suggestion sir returned frobisher have already stated final decision amount of argument can bring to bear will make alter resolution may do please since have power assure that will draw information out of very well retorted chinaman have spoken will soon see to what length determination will carry have known many men who at outset seemed to be quite a resolute a have invariably happened that after receiving attention of assistant of mine here indicated masked men in background have come to sens with marvellous swiftness a really need information have asked for in courtesy have option to obtain by only other mean available therefore uttered few rapid sentence in chinese indicating certain machine instrument by pointing at frobisher shrewdly guessed from man action that be instructing assistant to apply form of torture to prisoner young englishman braced for struggle now seemed inevitable chamber be dimly illumined by single lantern unwelcome visitor have brought with by flickering light of dying flame from outside of uncertain light sought to take advantage hoping that might succeed in securing possession of weapon of sort before enemy must divine intention availing of fact that attention of two assistant be momentarily diverted from to governor while latter issued instruction frobisher cautiously edged way toward spot where lay sword have already fixed upon a particularly suitable weapon must need one for purpose of self defence just a be in very act of reaching for weapon governor happened to glance toward evidently guessed what prisoner contemplated promptly levelled revolver a muzzle came up spouted flame frobisher heard bullet sing past ear to flatten against massive stone wall again vicious little weapon be fired at precise instant that chinaman finger pressed trigger frobisher leaned over grasped hilt of sword again bullet missed third time revolver spoke in a many second frobisher arm tingled to elbow a bullet struck blade glanced off steel luckily away from instead of toward body at same instant two assistant recovering from momentary paralysis hurled upon standing where now be close to pile have reared against wall to serve a platform prisoner raised weapon quickly swung over shoulder intending to make sweeping cut at assailant a came on blade came into violent contact with erection behind baulked blow nevertheless be able to bring weapon into position afforded opportunity to receive most eager of adversary upon point with smothered groan man dropped writhing to ground while frobisher hitting out with left fist caught second man fair on point of jaw man went reeling backwards against governor at precise moment when individual again pulled trigger result be miss so utterly exasperated chinaman that hurled revolver at frobisher head incontinently turned fled locking cell door behind with two of foe hors de combat other fled englishman felt to be master of situation keeping eye warily upon prostrate foe lest must be shamming must strive to take unawares young englishman now seized lighted lantern proceeded to hunt for governor revolver presently found thrust into belt after satisfying that still contained two live cartridge next picked up coil of rope bound prostrate man hardly have accomplished business when thought detected sound of voice of governor other footstep approaching outside prison door next instant be sure of voice of stranger be raised a though in anger altercation while of governor be pitched lower in tone seemed to convey idea of expostulation entreaty apology there seemed to be further altercation outside stranger speaking in angry authoritative voice then lock grated harshly a key be inserted turned door flew open man entered dressed in chinese naval uniform what passed for uniform in day closely followed by governor whose countenance betrayed curious mingling of ferocity apprehension anger chapter eight frobisher commission chinese naval officer who frobisher decided be undoubtedly man of high rank very considerable distinction looked keenly about for several minute evidently taking in forming own opinion a to detail of scene met gaze then stared long appraisingly at young englishman who thought detected ghost of smile hovering about new comer mouth a again glanced at form of two assistant turning to governor navy man sharply addressed what seemed to be series of question to governor replied making what frobisher guessed to be long elaborate explanation finally with gesture expressive of anger impatience excited apparently by unsatisfactory character of governor explanation stranger cut short turned to frobisher sir exclaimed touching cap a stepped forward speaking almost a excellent english a governor own permit to introduce be admiral wong lih of imperial chinese navy deeply regret that must have become duty to offer apology on behalf of illustrious master to englishman who have be unfortunate enough to undergo such treatment a have suffered at hand of countryman of mine here turned glowered at governor who bowed deeply probably to hide chagrin annoyance showed only too plainly in yellow face name returned englishman be murray frobisher be time ago lieutenant in british navy came out here for purpose of delivering cargo of arm ammunition to korean rebel at certain korean town owing to treachery of native in employ be betrayed into hand of korean regular troop brought here prisoner situation in found be result of excellency desire to obtain further information respecting rebel arrangement of such information may tell sir posse very little under circumstance must not have felt at liberty to divulge even little must like to add that by mean range on side of rebel for a matter of fact know too little of circumstance of case to judge between government although from what have already seen sympathy such a be be on side of insurgent be in way connected with insurgent force when captured be merely acting part of agent of private individual in convoying that caravan across country of course when attempt be made to take property out of hand have option to try to defend that sir be full truth of matter desire to place under protection a officer of chinese navy may not again be subjected to kind of treatment have suffered since arrival here thank returned officer for voluntary explanation with regard to connection with rebel force explanation may mention differs very considerably from statement made to by excellency here at time that statement be made struck a being somewhat faulty therefore determined to investigate matter for course be now very glad adopted be informed by excellency when enquired whether prisoner be confined here that there be one that be merely undergoing temporary imprisonment a result of being captured in arm so to speak against korean government be not until entered chamber saw what saw dreamed of occurrence of such atrocity a have be practised on again offer most heartfelt apology most cordially accept in spirit in be offered said frobisher extending hand wong lih grasped pressed in friendly fashion then turning to governor admiral icily remarked still in english will detain no longer excellency desire to have little private conversation with gentleman when require attendance again will send for pray leave highness command will be obeyed replied governor bowing with sullen scowl on brow man turned left room giving impression that must gladly have slammed door behind have dared highness thought frobisher to during short pause ensued seem to be suddenly getting among very important personage with big p ' too particular prince must be quite celebrity in own country must judge by behaviour governor seemed to be man of considerable importance thought even have to curl up eat humble pie when man speaks to now mr frobisher continued admiral trust that will excuse claiming attention for few minute longer for must like to have little conversation with appears to be only room in fortress where can talk without being overheard informed just now that be ex naval officer must object to informing of reason why be no longer in service not at replied frobisher thereupon proceeded to give admiral circumstantial account of accident led to dismissal from navy when frobisher have finished recital wong lih pulled long moustache thoughtfully for few moment without speaking then said well mr frobisher be bound to admit that think have be very harshly treated consider that fault lay with at with men who ought to have be on look out aboard steamer ran down there be never question presume a to efficiency a seaman frobisher flushed slightly none sir answered have always be considered quite capable officer believe previous to accident of have spoken skill a seaman be never once called in question be glad to hear be admiral reply for have suggestion to make trust may meet with approval suppose may take for granted that be open to offer of employment in own vocation well returned frobisher hesitatingly scarcely know how to answer question see signed on under under may safely continue mr frobisher smiled admiral everything may say to here will be considered a absolutely private under captain drake of quernmore then frobisher continued although did best to carry out order failed will consequently be very heavy loser failure can not think be considered fault a only signed on for voyage out here suppose may now consider free agent especially a have not yet drawn pay for service feel that be perhaps duty to go back to sam riek to see captain drake explain matter for may be waiting there for expecting return of course know captain drake how must be likely to act under circumstance rejoined wong lih feel sure that by time will have learnt of capture of consignment news travel fast out here know knowing that have fallen into clutch of korean troop will to put bluntly expect never to see alive again must ever have done so for fortunate circumstance of arrival of squadron here on particular day being so occurs to that captain drake must not be at likely to risk long stay at sam riek in very forlorn hope of returning must get away from place a quickly a possible must not be at surprised if vessel be to be found in chemulpo harbour within next few day in case if really wish to communicate with can write letter will engage to get delivered to if ship be still in water how must suit mr frobisher arrangement will suit admirably sir replied frobisher though can not quite see why must not endeavour to rejoin captain drake mentioned however remember something a to being open to accept other employment possibly may have bearing upon matter have everything to do with said admiral a will endeavour to show presently first of must ask to listen to for few minute while try to give insight into trend of recent event out here for unless do so will be unable to understand what be driving at a believe english call pray proceed sir be be reply very well then be of course aware that rebellion have be rife in korea for month past hence endeavour of insurgent to procure arm while korean government have be making effort to put down rebellion without necessity of asking for outside assistance intervention attempt however have not be success for rebel be making headway over country to extent indeed that korean government have at last be obliged to apply to imperial master emperor for assistance application arrived week ago be only few day ago that necessary arrangement must be completed for armed intervention on part be necessary to get together troop transport so on to recall of men of war to act a convoy naturally took time preparation be finally completed however four day ago embarked troop left wei hai wei for port of asan where now be be reported to a being centre of disaffection hotbed of rebellion most certainly never anticipated when left must have pleasure of rescuing fellow sailor from most serious predicament however to continue by convention of at tien tsin between china japan be agreed that must either country have occasion to send armed force into sender must inform other country of circumstance giving full particular of reason strength of force sent other information deemed necessary be done by cable before left wei hai wei japanese reply arrived by cable also before left be curt in tone to degree intimated briefly that japan intended to send guard to seoul for protection of ambassador a though ourselves must not afford necessary protection hinted very strongly that might consider advisable to send armed force of own to see that run away with country presumably little enough will say to cause misgiving on part fact remains that relation between china japan have be very strained for time past council feel that action on part will bring matter to head especially in view of veiled threat that japan may perhaps find necessary to land armed force matter look very ominous mr frobisher in opinion of nearly leading men so be naturally eager so to order thing that if trouble must arise between two country a for one feel certain will will not be entirely unprepared be most unfortunate however that be at present extremely short of naval officer indeed if war be to break out to morrow be absolute certainty that several of men of war must be unable to put to sea for want of capable officer to man crew sufficient have officer surely be not serious sir exclaimed frobisher be indeed sir replied wong lih now will see whither long story of mine be leading why asked if must be ready to accept employment stated very briefly situation be if will agree to proposal can secure for position of captain on board very fine new cruiser of ours at present can not send to sea for reason have just mentioned can not actually make appointment can give passage to wei hai wei whence can easily reach tien tsin where council be now sitting on recommendation there must be hesitation on part about giving post quite reverse indeed there must be unpleasant condition imposed upon must not be required to become chinese subject to do anything in short must affect allegiance to own glorious queen whom may buddha in mercy preserve must be required of must be oath to serve faithfully to best of ability while in chinese service now have said say let have opinion decision for have already spent more time in fortress than must have for moment frobisher remained in deep thought undoubtedly offer of wong lih opened up most rosy vista of future captain of fine new cruiser with prospect of naval war in near future what more must navy man ask for there must be chance in plenty to win honour fame renown name might even go down in history if have luck be tempting bait indeed that wong lih held out being at loose end englishman must have be more le than human if have not jumped at besides why must not own country have rejected service country apparently have need of so why must not sell sword to country there be reason at so far a must see mind be made up in le than minute turning to wong lih held out hand with simple word accept by so doing altered whole course of existence opened up for vista of such dazzling brilliance must have glanced into future even steady somewhat unemotional brain might have be very nearly turned before must be realised be to pas through scene experience be to leave mark indelibly upon admiral returned be grip with great heartiness be rejoiced to learn decision mr frobisher said bowing courteously feel sure will never have cause to regret for man a chinese naval service at present moment offer almost unlimited scope there be reason at why must not in course of few year rise to highest position in urgently need good men just now for be sorry to say that corruption treachery be frightfully prevalent in army navy heart sometimes misgives when think of revelation be bound to be made when come to hand grip with japan a feel confident soon will must not continue in strain will be refusing job with thanks suppose there be nothing to keep here mean will be able to accompany

great pleasure in accepting kind invitation also a have absolutely nothing what stand up in preparation be not likely to occupy much time laughed continued a wong lih turned toward door there be one thing think have forgotten may prove insuperable objection to joining chinese navy be enquired admiral raising eyebrow have practically knowledge of chinese language replied frobisher to be of real use a captain of cruiser seems to that thorough acquaintance with chinese be absolute necessity if be only objection exclaimed wong lih in tone of relief may dismiss at once have not overlooked fact that might be ignorant of chinese will do for exactly what be doing in case of captain foster of battleship chen yuen who be also englishman will provide with efficient interpreter whose sole duty will be to remain constantly at side translate wish command into chinese so see there will be difficulty at on score now if be quite ready will go have time to spare moreover atmosphere of place be anything agreeable a spoke admiral opened heavy door courteously signing to englishman to precede allowed frobisher to pas out into stone flagged corridor thence followed route by englishman have be brought on previous day until came to room in have be cross examined by commandant of fort there found latter with governor several other official of whom respectfully rose to foot upon admiral entrance with somewhat curt gesture wong lih directed to be seated then ensued rather lengthy conversation in chinese principal part of be borne by admiral who seemed to be asking question issuing instruction then rising to foot dismissed little group requested frobisher to follow before leave sir exclaimed englishman suddenly remembering must like to ask favour when be captured by korean troop have in possession pair of rather valuable revolver prize very much apart from intrinsic value from fact that be given by very dear friend feel convinced that officer who seized have not allowed to pas out of hand if happens to be in fort will be very much obliged if will request to return to also if jacket be taken from have be preserved must like to have a well may perhaps be permitted to mention too have not tasted food for fully twenty four hour be feeling need of meal dear sir exclaimed wong lih in tone of genuine concern what can have be thinking of not to have enquired if be hungry only excuse be be so full of matter have just be discussing that first rule of hospitality escaped for moment if will remain here for few minute will myself see food be served to will at same time make enquiry about property if be indeed here will most certainly be returned to will be with again very shortly with word kind hearted admiral left room returning presently with frobisher pistol in one hand jacket in other bringing also welcome information that meal be being hastily prepared must be served with utmost expedition hour later frobisher feeling new man quite again followed wong lih out of fort down to beach where admiral own boat be now waiting to take on board on way thither be necessary to pas over scene of day battle although be night only illumination came from moon lantern admiral coxswain be carrying there be light enough to reveal many of horror of past day fight frobisher be more than glad when blood stained field be left behind came to margin of clean wholesome sea here found officer in command of troop who be to remain in korea to assist government in stamping out rebellion be afterward transpired first of to occupy town of asan operate against insurgent with asan a base until further instruction be received other development arose officer be then waiting to hold short consultation with wong lih with reference to future course of action so that admiral must be in position to report fully to government upon return to china transport have also be fitted up a store ship be to remain behind in prince jerome bay with one of gunboat to protect while two cruiser other gunboat be to proceed to sea immediately general plan of campaign have evidently be already arranged for quarter of hour later officer wong lih saluted other in farewell army man returned to fortress where troop be quartered for remainder of night while admiral entered barge with latest recruit in stern sheet beside be pulled swiftly away to hai yen once on board admiral conducted frobisher to handsomely furnished cabin of be to have exclusive use during voyage also with characteristic kindness presented with complete chinese naval captain suit in perfectly new condition by lucky chance proved to be very passable fit of course frobisher be not a yet entitled to wear wong lih be so certain that proposed appointment must be promptly confirmed that have qualm in donning be by time not very far off daylight frobisher therefore decided that tired though felt must not turn in just yet must wait for sunrise in order to watch squadron get under way wong lih also have intention of retiring during short time still remained before be ready to leave so invited young englishman into own spacious luxuriously fitted quarter in stern of ship where two remained smoking talking drinking coffee until sound of morning gun from fort followed by report of one of twenty four pounder on deck announced that be official sunrise that hour have arrived for to take departure with admiral permission frobisher followed on deck up on to bridge where yeoman of signal be already waiting to hoist necessary flag a signal to other ship to weigh proceed to sea thick greasy column of smoke be rising from funnel of three craft proving to englishman experienced eye that coal be using be quite unsuited to naval requirement while white feather of steam rising from steam pipe showed that there be already full pressure in boiler after comprehensive look round admiral spoke few word to signalman moment later string of parti coloured flag soared aloft to cruiser yard arm instantly shrill clamour of boatswain whistle be heard from ship next followed measured clank clank clank of iron cable a steam capstan got to work began to haul vessel up to anchor for few second clatter subsided a strain of breaking out anchor came upon cable then started again with rush presently dripping mud bedaubed anchor made appearance under bow be catted promptly stowed then slowly at first with gradually increasing speed hat yen screw revolved deck quivered ship began to slide through water bow turning toward entrance of bay a did so other cruiser fell into line astern of flagship with gunboat bringing up rear squadron headed for open sea in line ahead formation sped upon way by salute of fort remaining gunboat to hai yen gun replied wei hai wei be only matter of two hundred mile from asan at midnight squadron found entering chinese harbour where number of twinkling light betrayed presence of other ship belonging to navy anchor be let go just opposite fort frobisher admiral went below to enjoy well earned rest refresh in readiness for duty awaited on following day chapter nine on rock bright early next morning frobisher met wong lih on quarter deck of hai yen admiral announced plan with regard to own affair of englishman mentioned that must be detained for day at wei hai wei making arrangement for repair of ship of have be more le damaged by rebel fire during fight in prince jerome bay getting new ten inch gun mounted in mai yen forward turret to replace one have be dismounted on same occasion estimated must occupy about week when work have be put in hand there be several minor duty in dockyard reckoned must occupy for week making about fortnight before must be able to get away to tien tsin to make report in person must therefore be necessary for to send messenger with dispatch to council giving outline of what have taken place gave choice of accompanying flag lieutenant who be to carry dispatch to tien tsin with letter from to council recommending appointment of remaining in wei hai wei until admiral be ready to go to tien tsin personally present protege to council to frobisher made reply that if suited admiral equally well must much prefer to accompany to tien tsin for be extremely anxious to secure appointment a captain of cruiser knew from what have already learned of chinese officialdom that must have far better chance with wong lih by side a sponsor than must a mere bearer of letter of recommendation from admiral be accordingly so arranged spent intervening time in looking round port arsenal dockyard of wei hai wei picking up information must with regard to chinese naval matter also managing incidentally to acquire small very small smattering of chinese language be afterwards of considerable use to on certain afternoon wong lih drove up to hotel where frobisher be staying announced that duty be now completed that be ready to start for tien tsin there be luckily dispatch boat in harbour have just arrived at wei hai wei from chemulpo on way to tien tsin admiral have decided to take passage in for frobisher englishman therefore have only to pack few belonging have purchased in town five minute later curiously assorted pair be being conveyed in rickshaw drawn by chinese coolie down to dock where san chau dispatch boat be lying voyage from wei hai wei to tien tsin be only short one of three hundred mile course lie across gulf of chi lih notorious for dangerous fog at season of year typhoon at time be liable to spring up with only briefest warning about two hour after have left port be passing bold headland beneath stand city of chi fu began to look a though be in for one of latter wong lih captain of dispatch boat held short consultation a to advisability of running into chi fu harbour for shelter a roadstead be somewhat open be finally agreed to push on at top speed endeavour to get clear of shan tung peninsula miao tao island before storm broke otherwise might find in rather awkward situation steam be therefore ordered for full speed about seventeen knot san chau began to move more rapidly through water at same time altering course so a to pas outside island instead of through chang shan tao channel a have at first be intended sun set luridly in midst of blaze of wild threatening cloud light breeze have so far carried with suddenly died away to nothing leaving surface of sea like sheet of oil through san chau drove bow a through something solid air felt heavy damp so devoid of life that frobisher found difficult to supply lung with sufficient air although weather be intensely cold atmosphere still felt uncomfortably oppressive about two hour later while ship appeared to be steaming through sheet of liquid fire so brilliant be phosphorescence of water there came without slightest warning most dazzling flash of lightning frobisher have ever beheld followed almost on instant by deafening peal of thunder indicating that centre of disturbance be almost immediately overhead so dazzlingly bright be flash almost man on deck instinctively covered eye with hand under impression that have be blinded several second elapsed before of be able to see again distinctly a though that first flash have be signal air at once became full of vivid darting lightning so continuous that almost uninterrupted view of sea from horizon to horizon be possible man on look out in bow be therefore enabled to give timely warning of approach of white capped wall of water of terrible aspect so rapid be rate of travel that steamer skipper have barely time to make few hasty preparation to meet to shout to men on deck to hold on for life when with unearthly howl roar storm be upon wall of water crashed into over san chau with power that made appear a though have struck something solid for few moment frobisher clinging to bridge rail beside captain wong lih must see nothing of deck of ship so deeply be buried in wave wind too wrestled with tore at ventilator awning stanchion boat slung from davit until momentarily expected to see latter torn from lashing blown overboard canvas dodger round navigating bridge have not have time to remove be ripped from seizing blown away to leeward where in glare of lightning showed for few moment like white bird swept away on wing of wind men thus exposed to full fury of blast be obliged to cling to bridge rail for very life to avoid being torn from hold whirled overboard when first lull came muscle felt a though have be stretched on rack so severe have be strain then a though wind have taken breathing space to recover fresh energy hurricane burst upon again almost more furiously if be possible than at first frobisher knew instinctively that so far from making san chau be being driven back over course have just covered at rate of probably five knot hour in spite of fact that engine be going full speed ahead at utmost capacity anxious glance be cast ahead astern ahead to ascertain whether there be sign of typhoon breaking astern in momentary dread of sighting distant loom of land toward a knew be being slowly inexorably driven suddenly skipper who have be peering eagerly to windward under broad of hand turned to wong lih spoke few rapid sentence in chinese at same time pointing in direction towards have be looking admiral eye followed outstretched finger frobisher also glanced in same direction captain have apparently seen believed have seen something strange away to westward moment later frobisher knew what be far away on edge of horizon appeared small spark of light shot rapidly up into sky where hung for few second then burst into mushroom shaped cluster of red star gradually floated downward again fading from view a did so that shouted frobisher excitedly to wong lih be rocket sir there be ship away there have be le fortunate than ourselves be evidently in distress from position must say that have probably be driven on to miao tao rock without doubt returned wong lih be fact of matter there be probably many poor fellow perishing away there almost before eye while be utterly unable to help if vessel have really gone ashore on rock fear that crew be doomed for ship must long survive in weather get telescope added in chinese to quartermaster who happened to be on bridge at moment when man reappeared with glass wong lih brought to bear upon spot where rocket have appeared be easily able to do with assistance of lightning still blazing almost continuously by kin fu tzi exclaimed admiral few second later that craft be very much nearer than thought from appearance of rocket not more than seven mile away at utmost be two masted one funnelled steamer be almost certain be man o ' war now what must be doing just there have japanese sent vessel over here for scouting purpose be one of ship look very much like yet can not be surely ship intend to have mr frobisher chih new cruiser have purchased from great britain only arrived out here few week ago understand what be doing there if be for a told have captain in whole service to whom cared to entrust be one of reason for asking to take service with can not understand at began to gnaw moustache perplexedly perhaps continued may be mistaken must be mistaken can not possibly be chih yuen at moment rocket went soaring up into night sky followed by then distant boom of signal gun came to ear borne on wing of hurricane may spirit of ancestor protect exclaimed wong lih piously ala can hing will be lying fathom deep in gulf by morning a though in answer to admiral prayer so suddenly did change take place there came lull in furious wind three men on bridge be able to spare hand to dash spray from eye before gale struck again time however wild outburst lasted only few minute then ceased a suddenly a before thunder be le loud lightning be far le vivid terrifying then black pall of sky above began to break up into isolated patch few minute later moon star showed intermittently between rift storm be dying away almost a quickly a have sprung up unfortunately a soon a wind dropped sea began to rise until within very short time there be quite heavy swell running captain of dispatch boat lost not instant in heading ship direct for spot from rocket have be seen to rise vessel search light be brought into action skipper told off man to sweep sea ahead with powerful beam so that exact position of wreck might be located at earliest possible moment for during last few minute rocket have be sent up be very sinister sign with cessation of wind heavy sea did not very greatly interfere with san chan speed raced through water on errand of mercy at rate of fully eighteen knot bearing of engine smoking a oil from cup dripped upon heated surface be not more than hour before man at search light found object kept beam playing on be then only few mile ahead stood out great mass of silver in ray of search light against black background of night with sea breaking over through telescope people must be seen running about deck steam be still blowing off through waste pipe so apparently water have not yet reached engine room frobisher noticed that effort be being made to get boat out might be because of heavy sea running at event craft be still above water there be little doubt that crew must be saved even though might not be able to save ship in quarter of hour speed having be meanwhile reduced so a to lessen danger of running aground san chau arrived abreast of other craft proved indeed to be cruiser laid off at distance of about cable length screw revolving slowly so a to keep from drifting down upon wreck then seizing megaphone wong lih hailed asked stranger name man in drenched naval uniform similar to frobisher be wearing leant over rail of navigating bridge gave lengthy reply englishman of course must not understand from expression on admiral face must see that news be not at of satisfactory character when other officer have finished speaking wong lih ground out few tense word sounded suspiciously like chinese execration turning to frobisher exclaimed in tone of deepest annoyance be most unfortunate indeed mr frobisher a almost suspected moment discovered that yonder craft be cruiser be chih ship to intended to be appointed now look where future command lie so surely a admiral ting be out of way something of sort inevitably happens be mandarin again of course who be at bottom of whole trouble fool aboard there who call captain tell that shortly after sailed prince hsi who considers authority on naval matter decided that gun in fore barbette of chi yuen be of too small calibre in absence managed to prevail upon council to send to wei hai wei to be docked have replaced by inch gun twelve inch gun in ship of size man be mad know game intention be to have sold replacing with couple of old out of date happen to know be lying in yard pocketing difference be sort of thing go on in unhappy country time mr frobisher theft bribery corruption manner of petty chicanery especially in matter connected with army navy then expect unfortunate officer to do work with old material that high official have not thought worth while to pilfer be heart breaking there in order to replenish pocket of prince hsi lie one of finest cruiser in navy wrecked likely to be lost entirely if come on to blow again went on still more excitedly will not be lost will get off will go to wei hai wei to be repaired in dock not to have gun exchanged in will remain there highness can look elsewhere for something to fill coffer again seizing megaphone wong lih entered into long conversation with temporary skipper of chih yuen during ascertained that vessel have fortunately struck only very lightly a have be considerably sheltered from sea by part of reef through have somehow managed to blunder before striking have not bumped to extent be making little water be therefore to be hoped that bottom be not so badly injured a wong lih have at first anticipated at rising of tide might be possible with assistance of san chau to get safely off again admiral intimated to captain that must stand by night must commence salvage operation a soon after daylight a state of tide must permit meanwhile steam be to be kept in boiler pump be to be kept going continuously so a to free ship from water by time that morning dawned high tide admiral prince wong lih ascertained from almanack be at about seven thirty on following morning so before daybreak hand be mustered preparation put in hand for running hawser across to chih yuen sea have gone down during night until when first streak of daylight came stealing up out of east be almost a calm a on previous afternoon before storm frobisher be one of first among officer to turn out go up on deck occupied time until breakfast very pleasantly in watching cruiser boat running out kedge anchor everything being then in readiness ship being under full pressure of steam crew went to breakfast directly be disposed of san chau boat be sent across to cruiser with light steel hawser wong lih accompanying in person to see that fool of captain did not make mistake time light hawser having be taken aboard chih towing hawser also of steel be bent on to end still on board dispatch vessel be hauled from through water on board cruiser a soon a be done end of steel hawser on board craft be backed by several thickness of best manila hemp in order to procure necessary elasticity guard against wire rope parting when terrific strain must be put upon after hemp portion of tow rope be secured to bollard on quarter deck of craft slack of hawser attached to kedge anchor be taken up skipper stood by respective engine room telegraph at signal from wong lih san chau went slowly ahead until towing hawser be taut steam be then given to after winch aboard cruiser to kedge hawser be led screw of chih yuen be sent astern at full speed while san chau went ahead with ounce of steam boiler must supply to engine great steel cable vibrated until fairly hummed with strain chih yuen winch bucked kicked until wong lih on cruiser bridge momentarily expected to break away altogether white water foamed roared under vessel quarter a screw whirred round for several minute seemed a though attempt be doomed to failure that cable must part without cruiser budging inch quite suddenly a frobisher watched keeping cruiser mast in line with pinnacle of rock about quarter of mile behind detected slight movement vessel mast appeared to vibrate a though cruiser be pulsing with life then slowly very slowly moved backward until mast pinnacle be little out of line move move shouted waving cap in excitement then like vessel gradually sliding off stock when being launched chih yuen gathered way few moment later slid bodily off rock with plunge caused san chau to roll a though in heavy sea overrunning kedge anchor before momentum must be checked be afloat again however frobisher breathed sigh of thanksgiving have set heart on commanding must have be bitterly disappointed if so fine ship have be lost to navy through despicable cupidity of mandarin incompetence of chinese so called sailor wong lih remained aboard cruiser for hour more until have satisfied that leak resulting from strained buckled plate be not so serious that must easily be kept under by pump then having signalled for first lieutenant of san chau to come aboard take charge of cruiser in place of incompetent captain ordered latter to accompany back to dispatch boat under arrest a preliminary to appearance before court martial at tien tsin on charge of stranding ship wong lih captain having boarded san chau steam be rung for presently two ship proceeded on respective voyage dipping flag to other a parted company be most fortunate that saw rocket last night observed wong lih when frobisher be again standing together on san chau bridge have not happened to be on spot at moment navy must have lost chih yuen without doubt a be fear be rather badly damaged will probably mean few month in dock for before be fit for service again be more deplorable because may need at moment at crisis like vessel count especially in such small navy a posse be afraid will not be joining ship just yet mr frobisher have not least doubt that when reach tien tsin congenial service will be found for will keep occupied until chih yuen be repaired there be plenty of work very few officer to do so need have apprehension on score of non employment thank highness answered frobisher be rejoiced to hear say that for confess felt very sore when saw ship what be intended to be ship cast away on miao tao reef twenty four hour later san chau steamed past taku fort flying admiral flag to announce that wong lih be on board received answered salute from battery shortly afterward anchor be dropped in middle of river opposite handsome city of tien tsin upon frobisher now looked for first time chapter ten pirate lair be about midday when san chau anchored off port of tien tsin wong lih suggested to young protege that must lunch aboard before going ashore to navy building be at time situated in street of many sorrow ill omened name indeed a after event be to prove be nearing completion of meal when there came knock upon cabin door sentry announced that messenger have arrived with letter for highness most honourable admiral prince wong lih admiral opened read wrote brief reply then explained to frobisher that arrival of san chau having be observed own presence on board disclosed by fact of flag flying from fore topmast head council then sitting in debate at navy building have sent to say that must be glad to see on matter of importance a soon a must make convenient to come ashore further development in korea suspect observed admiral frowning pray that open rupture between ourselves japan may occur just yet for be utterly unprepared must put off evil day a long a possible even if have to humble before for month two for must be absolutely suicidal for to engage in war with japan at present moment ship be good men be excellent fighter to outsider must naturally appear that advantage be on side ala men however brave may be can not fight to win under command of inefficient officer with arm ammunition store may fail at moment ah ah feel then said frobisher that war be inevitable be sure of replied admiral perhaps not to day to morrow war there certainly will be before many month be past only wish must bring realisation of fact home to of official who be content to wait wait spending country money if not on personally at rate upon thing on ought not to be spent until time come all too suddenly when will awake to fact that have procrastinated too long that country be at mercy of enemy let hope sir replied frobisher cheerfully for have begun to have quite strong liking for cultured patriotic chinese gentleman sailor be sorry to find taking so pessimistic view of situation that matter be not so bad a imagine that china will issue from coming struggle more powerful than before will indeed hope so said wong lih rising greatly fear that hope will be unfulfilled however end to dismal foreboding of mine mr frobisher be growing old be on account more liable perhaps to look on dark side of thing let go ashore now see what be that council wish to talk about will seize opportunity to introduce to official composing will get commission made out signed so that may be ready for service whenever called upon with word wong lih went up on deck followed by frobisher two men entering san chau gig be pulled ashore frobisher be very favourably impressed by handsome appearance of various public building be quite astonished at size magnificence of devoted to navy department when companion finally halted before wrought iron gate gave admittance to ground surrounding wong lih exhilarated at near prospect of discussion upon favourite subject navy ran up step leading into building with activity of boy in few minute two men found in beautifully furnished antechamber whither have be conducted to wait for summons to present before powerful council frobisher felt just trifle nervous at prospect wong lih countenance be transformed by happy smile while actually sniffed air from time to time like old warhorse scenting battle presently door opposite that by two have entered opened gorgeously dressed attendant stepped up to wong lih saluted saying something at same time in chinese come along young friend smilingly exclaimed admiral a rose to foot moment of ordeal have arrived present bold front boy there be nothing to be nervous about assure led way through door attendant respectfully held open into chamber rather hall so large lofty be where frobisher saw group of chinaman nine in number seated round oval table on quantity of official looking document be lying so far a be possible to tell chinaman age from mere observation be elderly men with exception of one individual who be obviously quite young who be seated at right hand of one who be clearly chief official present be man of perhaps thirty possibly younger still with very yellow skin long very thin drooping moustache brilliant coal black eye deeply sunken in socket out of glared with emotionless steely glitter that reminded frobisher most unpleasantly of snake there be also in something of deadly malevolence that snake eye seem to posse englishman must barely repress shudder of disgust a found eye fixed on for felt a though have suddenly come in contact with noxious reptile a entered council with exception of man just referred to rose bowed solemnly to wong lih who returned bow ceremoniously frobisher be then signed to seat after councillor resumed seat commencing with old man at head of table of member of council in turn questioned wong lih long conversation in chinese ensued frobisher be of course unable to understand occupied with looking round room admiring wonderful carving priceless tapestry on wall be quite taken by surprise when suddenly heard wong lih voice calling name be then introduced to council collectively number of question be put to in english with tongue be beginning to think chinaman must be familiar so many have already encountered who be able to speak almost a fluently a like many of fellow countryman have up to now imagined that chinese be barbarous race knowing nothing of anything happened outside own country apparently soon satisfied examiner a to nautical attainment presently found in possession of parchment set forth fact that murray frobisher be appointed to chinese navy with rank of captain be informed that be to take command of chih yuen a soon a be ready for service again until time be to consider on staff of admiral wong lih who must find employment for in interim after little ceremony further lengthy discussion took place in chinese be not until late in evening that sponsor be able to get away return to ship arrived there proceeded to cabin where wong lih have taken up quarter here frobisher received account of what have occurred at meeting seems announced admiral that dispatch have be received from minister in tokio informing that japanese although have sent escort for minister at seoul have decided to delay for time dispatch of large armed force to korea to await further development be grand news for give little longer in to make preparation minister also advises to be on guard for japan mean to force quarrel sooner later now a regard news have recently be brought that river merchant of hoang ho have be greatly troubled lately by excess of band of pirate who be believed to have head quarter somewhere near place where old bed of river leaf present channel be not far from village of tchen voun hien three hundred mile from here wish to take command of gunboat su chen proceed in to place will investigate matter thoroughly if story be anything approaching truth will hunt down band of pirate destroy head quarter quarter must be shown mr frobisher criminal must be dealt with severely interpreter mentioned to will be attached at once to person will be glad if will enter upon new duty immediately oh by way have also have news of friend captain drake be told of what have happened by survivor from party came round here in quernmore to demand that send expedition to rescue appears to be very much attached to of course be told that course be not to be thought of besides being quite useless appeared to be very much cut up at news so be told accepted contract from navy department for supply of cargo of arm ammunition gun left in ship for england only week before own arrival here when return must not be here will of course inform of rescue so ease mind now captain frobisher have little more to say get away a soon a can crew be already aboard if need store ammunition indent for in usual way will be duly supplied there need not tell british navy man how to do business good bye boy heaven grant safe return concluded affectionately two men clasped hand wong lih buried in mass of paper frobisher departed to bed to refresh in readiness to commence duty early on following morning last thought a dropped off to sleep be that be now captain frobisher of chih yuen that must not be fault if did not make name famous in chinese naval history awoke in morning however utterly unrefreshed for have slept badly vague feeling of foreboding strong presentiment of disaster have oppressed throughout night dream have be haunted by thin yellow face with long attenuated drooping moustache face out of peered pair of eye glowing like flame with hideous possibility of evil shining in black depth face be face of prince hsi youngest member of council splendid keen invigorating air of chinese morning soon blew cobweb away from frobisher brain hour after leaving bed be smiling to at own folly in allowing prince hsi evil countenance to affect to extent a to spoil rest man must help being born with face like perhaps ugly exterior might in reality hide very kind gentle soul by time that frobisher have arrived at wharf where su chen be lying have completely forgotten existence of man with snake eye a afterwards came to call interpreter promised by wong lih have duly presented to frobisher on board san chan that morning englishman very soon began to find man service invaluable with assistance su chen be easily located frobisher at once boarded made known read commission to officer crew through medium of quen lung interpreter very quiet decent set of men seemed to be to appearance gave such information a asked for quickly without hesitation so far a must learn on such brief acquaintance seemed thoroughly conversant with duty made enquiry about amount of water provision be aboard satisfied that there be sufficiency to serve for expedition then went into question of quantity of ammunition remaining on board did not at satisfy requirement for found that although there appeared to be plenty of small arm ammunition there be very little belonging to machine gun gun in battery so taking quen lung with made way to magazine taking requisition book with in pocket be then that obtained first insight into subtle way of chinese naval officialdom knew perfectly well what kind of ammunition required how much of seemed utterly unable to find anybody who possessed necessary authority to issue be sent from one official to of gorgeously dressed very eager to give assistance yet when moment arrived for store to be actually given into hand well be heart broken to give honourable captain so much trouble must be pleased to obtain approval of excellency honourable somebody else whose signature be also needed before ammunition must be removed at last so disgusted did frobisher become at delay prevarication that went back to su chen selected twenty of strongest member of crew took up to magazine with number of hand wagon have collected under much voluble protest en route then having found required pattern of cartridge ordered men to load case on to wagon amid intensely shocked expostulation of outraged official of ordnance department who be quite unaccustomed to fill requisition in le than month several indent be wheeled down to gunboat by chinese sailor who already began to show respect felt for man who knew what wanted got task be finished at last afternoon su chen dipped ensign to san chau on board of admiral wong lih have quarter steamed down river pei ho past taku fort at mouth out into open sea on way to mouth of hoang ho three hundred mile up lay village of tchen voun hien at near pirate lair be said to be situated during hundred mile run across gulf of chi lih frobisher set men to clean ship thoroughly overhaul polish gun make thing in general little more shipshape than have be since time when su chen left builder hand on thames frobisher be fortunate in moment when gunboat arrived off mouth of hoang ho for sea be smooth usually dangerous bar at mouth of river be passed with ease there be many reminder in shape of broken spar in case fragment of hull projecting out of water to show that sea be not always in so gentle mood that many other captain have be le fortunate bar at mouth of hoang ho be indeed one vast graveyard of men ship frobisher anchored few mile up river spent whole day exercising men at cutlas small arm drill to smarten up little prepare a far a possible for cut thrust work felt sure task of exterminating pirate must ultimately involve early on following morning voyage upstream be continued su chen making not more than about six knot hour against strong current result evidently of heavy rain up country for river well named yellow river be thick turbid with mud have be washed off surface of land by flood mile after mile su chen crept along low flat uninteresting bank slipped gradually astern few junk be passed be too far away for frobisher to communicate with a be well in under land while gunboat be obliged on account of draught to keep more le in centre of river one afternoon however there came from man whom frobisher have posted in foretop to give warning of rock shoal shout that there be dismasted junk about mile ahead appeared to be trying to intercept gunboat seemed look out reported to have be on fire a well a having lost mast for must plainly make out through telescope black patch where deck bulwark have be charred there be only two men on deck added men be doing must to attract attention waving something must not quite make out what above head leaping about excitedly there be other dark coloured patch about deck at distance be not possible to say whether be result of fire of something else frobisher however who have carefully listened to report of detail from interpreter have conviction that there have be happening on board that junk other than of mere fire that be shortly to receive evidence with own eye of activity of pirate whom be going to exterminate for felt certain that dark stain be not of fire of blood a soon a unwieldy craft be progressing solely by force of current approached to within quarter of mile of sit chen frobisher rang engine to half speed so that gunboat barely made headway against current thus awaited junk arrival gunboat be skilfully manoeuvred alongside crew with rope grapnel soon secured assisted two men who formed sole complement up on deck here frobisher after giving refreshment of be plainly in great need questioned through interpreter a to cause of present condition be precisely a have expected junk have seemed sailed few day previously from tchen tcheou town about six hundred mile from mouth of river with valuable cargo of sandalwood intended for tien tsin on passing spot where old bed of river used to lie before channel be diverted have be attacked by fewer than five large heavily armed junk crowded with men before crew must even place in position for defence junk have be seized men cut to piece by ruthless pirate two men standing on su chen deck have escaped a by miracle for after taking cargo out of junk throwing dead wounded overboard leader of pirate have indulged humour by binding two survivor laying on deck afterwards firing junk setting adrift men have secured freedom by one of gnawing other bond loose have then managed to extinguish fire must not honourable captain take ship up river wipe pirate out lock stock barrel frobisher informed that such be intention after asking two men whether must accompany a guide receiving assurance that desired nothing better set junk adrift again since be absolutely useless continued journey at nine o'clock next morning one of two new men who have be looking keenly ahead for few moment came up to frobisher pointed out what appeared to be large square stone built castle fort standing distance back from river bank upon top of knoll of rising ground that announced be pirate head quarter there be little bight just at junction of old new channel be there that lie in ambush with junk now sir can perhaps see mast standing up behind low bank yonder frobisher looked counted indeed five mast be then evidently belonging to pirate junk have attacked chinese merchantman on preceding day fort on hill yonder be pirate lair have be specially dispatched from tien tsin to destroy rubbed hand gleefully gave order to clear for action then with telescope fixed unwaveringly on fort leant over bridge rail watching while su chen engine working at full pressure stemmed muddy tide on errand of retribution chapter eleven tchen voun hien su chen be about five mile away when fort first came into view for about quarter of hour steamed ahead without sign of life of alarm becoming perceptible in vicinity of pirate head quarter frobisher be beginning to hope that fortune be so far favouring that perhaps freebooter might have set out on buccaneering expedition inland upon particular morning that might thus be able to land seize destroy junk occupy fort during absence at same time preparing unpleasant little surprise for pirate when returned hope be doomed to disappointment still keeping eye glued to telescope suddenly observed flash puff of white smoke leap out from corner tower of fort few moment later dull boom of fairly heavy gun made heard at same moment tiny ball soared aloft to head of flagstaff on battlement ball presently broke abroad revealed a large yellow flag of triangular shape apex of triangle fly being circular instead of ending in point there be also design of description embroidered on flag in favourite chinese blue what design represented frobisher must not imagine have never beheld anything like in life so turned to quen lung who be a usual standing alongside handing telescope told to take look at piece of bunting say what decoration on flag be intended to represent quen lung obediently placed eyepiece to eye few second later frobisher observed man turn pale stagger backward almost dropping telescope a did so man eye be dilated face turned colour of putty lower lip have dropped hand be trembling a though palsied presently recovered however colour gradually returned to face frobisher asked what ailed oh sir answered turn back turn back before be too late have read design on flag know can never hope to succeed against who fight under fold may not say man who know may tell what character signify men who belong to society fly that ensign have never be conquered not single one among have ever be captured although troop have be sent against time after time one have ever returned alive to tell what happened can only guess have sworn enmity against whole human race number be always being increased by addition of men who have wrong to redress believe to have be injured by fellow be said that always put captive to death in unspeakably horrible manner although witness have ever returned to tell tale be sure that if admiral have known who people be whom want to destroy must never have sent expedition at frobisher looked man up down for few second a though thought that fellow mind have given way then said sternly what child talk be quen lung do hear man speaking be boy frightened by bogy be dreaming about that tell have better return without attacking pirate be most certainly going to attack order be to exterminate whole crew of so will very soon be able to disabuse mind of belief that be invulnerable a seem to suppose say that man have ever escaped there be two men on board now to contradict statement men rescued from junk good man have be listening to old woman tale allowed to frighten will see that will be quite all right a soon a fighting begin will do part a well a best of said in hope of infusing little backbone into man who be shaking like leaf word have effect quen lung be terrified there be doubt of seemed to frobisher that terror arose not so much from fear of pirate a from supernatural power appeared to attribute to well master said resignedly if insist on attacking must will not win know can see without word walked to other side of deck leant over bulwark chin resting on palm of hand staring moodily down into muddy water by time su chen have approached to within distance of about mile from fort small bight in river inside lay five junk frobisher determined to try sighting shot at building to accustom men to changing range therefore ordered men to load four inch gun forward bring to bear on square tower from pirate signal gun have be fired discharge when ready gun be loaded trained gunner laid finger on firing key there be deafening report boat quivered from truck to keelson frobisher watching saw shell strike burst full on centre of tower in ragged hole immediately afterwards appeared good shot ejaculated laying down telescope let try few more of same kind men will soon show fellow that mean business where invulnerability now quen lung eh word be drowned by terrific discharge from fort whole eastern front of seemed to break out into flame smoke while perfect storm of shot shell small arm missile swept ship striking down men ripping up planking bulwark cutting rigging generally doing tremendous amount of damage from over deck came cry groan of wounded men mingled with execration from unwounded who have seen friend shot down frobisher when have wiped blood out of eye have flowed into from small wound on forehead caused by flying splinter be astounded to observe amount of damage number of casualty have resulted from one discharge pirate have somehow managed to get range to nicety shot have come aboard there be le than nine men killed wounded crew of four inch gun be down unconquerable not pirate be certainly marvellously clever gunner weapon must be heavy modern at same moment frobisher observed movement among mast of junk presently to amazement saw that be coming out from behind shelter evidently with intention of fighting from river a well a from shore well must make short work of anyway be only made of wood few well directed shot between wind water must send whole fleet to bottom in short order with end in view ordered gun must be brought to bear to be fired at junk meaning to clear out of way before turning attention entirely to fort for must see that be crowded with men might be rather awkward for ship crew if managed to get alongside gunboat side be low must be easy matter to board from craft standing a high out of water a junk men sprang to post with alacrity soon duel be in full swing junk be like fort very heavily armed much more heavily than frobisher have in least anticipated accurately aimed shot came ripping tearing through su chen wooden bulwark side with terrible effect in addition to solid pirate be using shell air be soon full of flying piece of metal struck men down in direction only inside iron casemates did there seem to be protection from deadly storm there chinese sailor be serving gun coolly with excellent aim shot after shot struck one other of junk frobisher must see actually reel under impact so far shot have be lucky enough to strike below on water line so sink of su chen be now considered quite close enough to fort junk therefore rang for half speed at vessel just held own against current junk having anchored in order to avoid being swept down under su chen gun so battle went grimly forward frobisher soon discovered that big body be being made target for small arm fire be shortly obliged to leave bridge in order to avoid being shot therefore took up post in forward starboard casemate from position must observe enemy at same time encourage crew to greater effort be obliged to do by sign for at beginning of battle quen lung have vanished frobisher be unable to catch glimpse of anywhere have doubtless sought seclusion of cabin in hope that there might find safety oblivious of fact that enemy be using such large powerful gun that wooden side of gunboat offered little more protection than must have obtained out on deck frobisher determined to go find when must spare moment two from matter in hand bring up on deck thus teach by most practical of method how to stand fire without flinching at present however have more than enough to occupy without thinking of quen lung fort have brought gun to bear on su chen directly gunboat became practically stationary a well a junk be making such excellent practice that frobisher at length began to realise that be in very warm corner indeed out of must tax skill to utmost to extricate to say nothing of carrying out expressed intention of destroying pirate stronghold there be of course still time to retire to return to tien tsin bring reinforcement explaining to admiral that one small gunboat be utterly inadequate to undertake so important enterprise a be proving to be must doubtless have be wisest plan particular englishman happened to be one of who know when be beaten mere idea of retreat never so much a entered mind therefore went about from gun to gun cheering encouraging men sometimes training one of weapon while impressing upon crew a well a must by sign necessity for holing sinking junk a speedily a possible so reducing to extent severe gruelling to su chen be being subjected at last constant exhortation began to have effect well directed shell from four inch gun laid a happened by frobisher own hand struck junk at end of line nearest to gunboat full upon water line exploding blew hole in nearly yard square while from interior of smitten junk arose chorus of scream groan yell proving that flying splinter of shell have done other work a well on board su chen saw water pouring into pirate vessel in very cataract heeled farther farther over in le than minute after shell have struck righted for second then plunged below surface carrying with greater portion of crew hurrah boy shouted frobisher be one gone repeat dose with next fellow will soon put whole crowd of out of business rousing cheer with men responded to word must not possibly understand meaning of be sufficiently clear be answered by yell of rage defiance from pirate accompanied by furious bombardment from gun small arm frobisher gazing at havoc caused by discharge body with deck be strewn realised that destruction of one junk have animated pirate to fresh exertion that victory be not yet even half won realising that be imperative to silence fire from junk if success be to be obtained at signed to gunner to load direct piece upon next junk firing together in hope that combined discharge might effect desired result so did missile struck craft almost on same spot few minute later too took crew to bottom leaving only three junk to deal with fort be blazing away merrily doing good deal of damage though not so much a junk gunner on board appeared to be specially trained marksman enthusiasm of chinese sailor at second stroke of luck be immense threw into work with unabated energy despite fact that fully quarter of comrade be lying dead wounded around cry of wounded for water be dreadful despite must be done to help frobisher have already told off a many men a must spare to carry water seemed impossible to quench poor wretch thirst cry be always for more even though have drunk moment previously unwounded men appeared to be quite indifferent however to own comrade suffering own chance of death mutilation went on serving gun a calmly a though be at target practice frobisher realised then a number of white men have realised since that chinese soldier sailor properly trained properly led constitutes of finest fighting material in world that if leader ever arises capable of drilling controlling vast mass of material china contains will be very bad thing indeed for white race properly drilled well trained well armed capably led army of perhaps fifty million fighting men must be invincible invasion of europe by force must not possibly be withstood dreadful day be however far in future let hope frobisher now turned attention to third junk still carrying out plan of sinking one at time determined to lay fire four inch gun again in hope of repeating former successful shot shell cartridge be rammed home breech closed screwed up having trained gun pressed finger to firing key springing back directly afterward to avoid recoil to astonishment there be report weapon did not discharge therefore set pressed key again once more there be result be evidently miss fire young man knew of course sometimes cartridge will hang fire that many gun crew have be blown to piece by prematurely opening breech forgot about now in anxiety unscrewed opened breech piece immediately nothing happened there be mark of percussion pin upon primer of cartridge ammunition have failed to explode hastily calling for cartridge withdrew faulty one thrust in fresh one closing breech repeating first operation again cartridge failed to explode something be seriously wrong somewhere what be powder be faulty damp primer be ineffective be impossible to say without examination cartridge still be tried time result be same until began to feel seriously alarmed encouraged by cessation of fire from su chen junk have redoubled own gunboat be rapidly becoming a riddled a sieve while men be falling fast in direction ship funnel be a full of hole a cullender shroud of foremast be cut to piece on side mainmast have long since be shot away wooden deck house be mere heap of splintered wood while bulwark be in perfectly ruinous condition clearly something must be done done quickly su chen must be sunk beneath foot ordering men to leave four inch for time being to blaze away with smaller piece machine gun frobisher ran below to magazine to try to discover what be wrong found men there passing out shell cartridge quite calmly unaware that there be anything wrong on deck of course taking precaution to examine stuff before sending up hoist frobisher first action when got to magazine be to examine outside of brass case soon saw thought saw what be matter when su chen ammunition have be overhauled at tien tsin cartridge for four inch be one of size of there be shortage frobisher have have fresh supply put on board that fresh supply have observed at time be stencilled with chinese character in red paint while old stock have be stencilled in black now observed that cartridge being passed up carried black stencil be therefore old stuff how old did not care to think at once told men by sign not to send up more black marked cartridge to use only red marked then for second time day received shock four inch gun have be fired more frequently than other gun whole of fresh supply of cartridge of size have be exhausted there be not single charge left how bitterly blamed for not having hove scrap of ship old ammunition overboard filled up entirely with new be time for regret now only thing to do be to rectify matter if possible if not to make best of perhaps might be primer be faulty thought if so situation might yet be saved for there be supply of new primer on board seizing one of case in arm rushed on deck with load there under cover of one of casemates drew load exercising utmost care that powder might not be exposed to flying spark then springing to gun thrust in empty case slammed breech shut pressed key there be loud smacking report little thread of smoke curled up from muzzle of gun primer then be in good order so good heaven must be powder be wrong frobisher felt bead of sweat gather on forehead must make quite sure though running back to casemate snatched handful of powder spread thinly on deck well away from load placed lighted match to there be flame puff of smoke explosion nothing match simply burnt up went out then su chen captain took pinch of stuff between finger put in mouth tasting moment later spat out on deck with cry of horror amazement for what have passed for powder in old cartridge be nothing granulated charcoal then frobisher recollected wong lih accusation of peculation on part of mandarin other high official who filled pocket at expense of country how admiral have said that must be bad thing for china if have to go to war under condition such a then obtained then be one of result of such peculation contractor official have be paid to provide powder have provided charcoal pocketing difference frobisher ground teeth muttered several very bitter thing here be engaged with vastly superior force handicapped most horribly for want of ammunition for possibly rest of supply intended for smaller gun be in same condition what must have happened if have not have forethought to examine superficially content of magazine at tien tsin order fresh supply on own responsibility hardly dared to think there must undoubtedly have be not single cartridge capable of being discharged su chen crew must by time undoubtedly have be prize of pirate that pampered mandarin contractor might have supply of unearned money wherewith to buy luxury that deserved needed be disgraceful there be nothing to be gained by repining reminded fortunately cartridge for smaller gun seemed to be holding out satisfactorily while frobisher have be investigating matter of larger cartridge men have made so good practice with rifle that third junk be already in sinking condition even a looked disappeared like consort to bottom in swirl of broken water dotted with form of struggling pirate one big gun being now useless su chen in very parlous condition be obviously out of question to think of attempting to conclude fight by mean of light gun small arm alone ship must not float long enough for other plan of action must therefore be adopted gave attention to idea for few minute then resolved upon scheme though extremely hazardous seemed to offer best if not only hope of success be case of destroying pirate being destroyed together with crew of two naturally preferred that sufferer must be pirate to explain intention must be necessary however to call in assistance of interpreter otherwise must never hope to make men comprehend exactly what be required hope of success hinged upon therefore went in search of quen lung whom eventually found after prolonged hunt hiding in almost fainting condition underneath bunk in first lieutenant cabin dragged forcibly on deck be obliged to give terrified man stiff dose of raki to bring to condition to understand what be being said to then fellow finally coming in degree to sens frobisher explained to plan of campaign ordered to translate to men there being now two junk left be englishman intention to run su chen up stream in between firing a went then boarding party headed respectively by first lieutenant be to leap on to deck of junk drive crew overboard not below cut cable fire vessel send adrift down stream with current su chen must then be free to turn entire attention to fort must anchor in berth vacated by junk endeavour to silence fire of fort with remaining gun if must be done landing party be to be thrown ashore who must carry with number of powder bag for blowing in gate after idea be to enter fort carry by storm if gun must not be entirely silenced then a much damage a possible be to be done assault be to be attempted in case men signified comprehension of plan with cheer then rifle be loaded bayonet fixed cartridge pouch refilled cutlass brought up from below belted on frobisher gave word su chen went ahead at full speed for junk men on latter at once understood move did utmost to prevent coming off to purpose gunboat crashed in between grapnel be hove aboard junk two party of boarder with frobisher lieutenant at head scrambled up on deck of junk where desperate hand to hand struggle at once commenced pirate knowing that must expect mercy showed none quarter be given on side frobisher at head of men strove to cut way forward driving pirate ahead of overboard soon realised that be going to be exceedingly difficult task desperado be splendidly armed seemed not to know meaning of word fear men found revolver flashing in very face spoke more in world air scintillated with gleam of whirling steel vibrated with hoarse shout of combatant cry of wounded men while to add to horror confusion of scene gun of fort opened fire murderously upon friend foe alike twice pirate have given way slightly time have recovered ground however many of be killed others seemed to appear from nowhere to take place so fight raged with unabated fury frobisher picked out man who appeared to be one of chief made herculean effort to reach time again whirlwind of men swept in between prey so that fellow seemed unapproachable then suddenly there arose roar of exultation from pirate turning frobisher saw other boarding party give way seemingly struck with panic go tumbling back on board su chen defeated frobisher forgetting that must not be understood shouted to men to redouble effort to on gunboat to go back try again there be worse to come englishman be at head of men plying cutlas with terrible effect when felt slight jar looked round just in time to see man on board su chen throw off last grapnel gunboat begin to gather sternway down stream uttered shout of rage strove to hew way to side of junk even a did so realised that be too late there be already fathom of water between junk steamer bitter conclusion be forced home upon that have be deserted by crew left alone with mere handful of men in midst of crowd of howling murderous pirate end of thing for seemed very close at moment chapter twelve pathway of glass desperate a situation undoubtedly be captain frobisher be not man to yield without struggle be cornered knew nothing short of miracle must extricate from position in momentary panic of other boarding party have placed by withdrawal of su chen determined that if be to die must not die alone with resolution renewed fight with even greater desperation than before if be possible so formidable foe did become that for few second pirate in front of wavered broke tall strong figure a advanced bareheaded with set teeth gleaming eye that long ruddily gleaming strip of steel played here there everywhere with swiftness of light made up spectacle sufficiently awe inspiring to terrify man one must have thought many of pirate be almost a big strong a frobisher be thoroughly accustomed to desperate hand to hand fighting hesitation be therefore momentary next instant have closed round like pack of hungry wolf snarling spitting curse at even striving to pull down with hand gaining opportunity of instant breathing space frobisher glanced quickly behind to discover how many of men be left to be horrified to find out of forty men who have followed on to deck of junk ten remained on foot while of ten fully half be bleeding from more le severe wound must quickly put hors de combat there be therefore not smallest possibility of cutting way through dense throng surrounded leaping over side into water a have at first thought of doing there seemed nothing to be done to sell life life of follower a dearly a possible for be quite resolved to die rather than fall alive into hand of pirate having already heard something of tender mercy of chinese to prisoner unhappily for frobisher however be unable to control circumstance not having eye in back of head be unaware of what be happening behind did not know that few second later follower be cut down slain that remained fighting alone without single protector at back with enemy swarming round neither did observe chief whom have be trying to reach unsuccessfully ever since beginning of fight made brief signal to men not to strike consequently be not little astonished when suddenly felt seized round neck body by dozen pair of arm pinioned own left helpless in instant cutlas be wrenched from grasp be hurled to deck where more men immediately flung upon holding firmly down so that found utterly impossible to move limb thereafter business of binding be comparatively easy presently found swathed from head to foot in coil of rope until resembled mummy rather than living man captor then rolled contemptuously out of way against shot riddled bulwark proceeded to take account of casualty where frobisher have made final stand dead lay thickest noticed with grim satisfaction that there be very few wounded men to be seen men have fought well have nothing with to reproach pirate chief scowled heavily a scanned result of fight although have unquestionably paid dearly in men for victory have compunction in ordering more severely wounded to be hove over side probably there be facility for doctoring chief perhaps thought might a well die now a later on so save good deal of trouble in transporting to shore just then other junk bumped heavily alongside men came aboard reporting that craft have be so badly damaged that be in sinking condition indeed crew have hardly transferred before disappeared beneath muddy water fourth junk safely accounted for frobisher comforted with assurance that with sort of luck at su chen ought to be able to make way back to tien tsin short handed though must undoubtedly be once there knew report of failure of expedition must be speedily carried to wong lih provided admiral happened to be still there latter must then be quite certain to send rescue expedition up hoang ho to recover prisoner pirate might have taken to avenge if slain happily for englishman peace of mind did not know that although su chen did eventually reach tien tsin in safety arrived too late to catch admiral who have left to visit of southern chinese port inspect men of war on station be not expected back unless specially sent for for at least couple of month be certain that none of chinese official at tien tsin must consider fact of frobisher capture probable murder at hand of pirate a sufficient to justify exertion of dispatching messenger to recall wong lih even to give news of result of expedition so although did not know there be little prospect of rescue for murray frobisher for time at event business of disposing of dead badly wounded men having be completed pirate chief whose name from number of time word be used when be being addressed frobisher guessed to be ah fu issued few brief order in barbarous sounding up country chinese survivor of fight got up anchor slowly poled junk back to berth behind small headland where fleet have be lying on arrival of su chen observing that in bound condition nobody seemed to consider necessary to stand on guard over being anxious to learn a much a possible respecting present surroundings with view to future escape if be left alive long enough frobisher contrived to bring into kneeling position after have not much difficulty in struggling to foot be thus able to look over side see what be going on by time that have executed manoeuvre junk have left main stream of river have entered bight where pirate fleet be accustomed to be concealed at far end of about quarter of mile from present position frobisher distinguished small wharf two hundred foot in length by about thirty wide standing about eight foot out of water toward junk be being steered be doubt jetty where pirate unloaded loot stolen from captured prize whence took aboard own store of ammunition provision water there be quite number of bamboo thatch hut scattered about at shore end of jetty evidently store house while stream of flashing sparkling crystal clear water tumbling down narrow gully cutting tiny channel for across sand to river be without doubt source of pirate water supply frobisher noticed that at end of jetty number of men from fort have collected apparently awaiting arrival of comrade of maritime department a junk came alongside individual clambered aboard vociferous conversation ensued during fierce glance threatening gesture be directed toward englishman who knew instinctively that new arrival be strongly urging that must be put to death a sort of sacrifice to memory of dead pirate in whose destruction have played so large part indeed seemed at one moment a though be to be slaughtered a stood there bound helpless for new comer surged forward knife sword gleaming in hand pushing junk crew backward until whole crowd have gathered in circle with frobisher in centre frobisher expected death at moment be at loss to understand why junk men seemed reluctant to let others have way seeing that have be eager enough to put end to short time previously presently noticed that ah fu have disappeared from deck guessed that men be merely waiting for to return before allowing people from fort to have way presently pirate chief reappeared be immediately surrounded by eager gesticulating crowd who pointed to frobisher handled blade in sanguinary anticipation holding up hand for silence ah fu said few word to follower produced immediate remarkable effect sheathing weapon broke out into shout of laughter began to discus with one detail of what evidently considered excellent joke frobisher knowing something of chinese pirate idea of amusement felt that must infinitely have preferred being killed on spot to being kept alive to provide sport for barbarian quen lung have certainly be right when have prophesied disaster a result of attacking unconquerable a frobisher afterwards found be indeed name of sect to pirate belonged although what reason man have have for being so sure young englishman be utterly unable to guess matter having evidently be settled entirely to pirate satisfaction frobisher leg be unbound so that must walk closely guarded by two men carrying long broad bladed knife be led down sloping gangway to wharf followed by rest of crowd talking laughing hilariously thence be taken up hill distance of quarter of mile to fort on reaching destination be amazed to note enormous strength of building consequently small amount of damage have be done by fire of gunboat with exception of hole in tower few splintered starred splashing where missile have struck very little actual injury seemed to have be inflicted notwithstanding excellent practice of su chen gunner wall decided must be enormously thick thicker even than of fortress of asan be stout enough to withstand anything le than heavy gun fire be not permitted to examine appearance of building very closely for observing hesitation two guard prodded vindictively with point of knife pushed before through massive stone gateway be protected by strong portcullis at end a well a iron double door between strong enough to turn rifle bullet frobisher now realised that even if have succeeded in sinking junk reaching gate of fort difficulty must only have begun that plan of blowing in gate with powder must have be completely frustrated by existence of outer portcullis men certainly knew how to protect be determined not to be captured if human ingenuity must prevent once inside frobisher found in spacious courtyard round fort be built window of different chamber looked inward thus allowing outer wall to be entirely used for gun embrasure rifle loophole even arrow slit so varied be weapon to be found in robber stronghold still in charge of two guard at command from ah fu prisoner be marched through doorway in wall exactly opposite main gateway be hurried through corridor after corridor of only dimly lighted by small opening in outer wall until became utterly confused lost even remotest idea of bearing after walk of about five minute guard halted before iron bound door upon being opened disclosed flight of step down step be hurried finding when at bottom at entrance to long passage looked a though have be hewn out of solid sandstone for there be joint visible in wall removing lantern from hook one of men lighted journey be continued for quite ten minute in perfectly straight line thus confirming impression that be in underground passage leading from fort to other structure at considerable distance probably constructed to afford mean of escape in extremely unlikely event of fort ever being captured at far end of passage there be several iron bound door circumstance frobisher noted for future reference be through one of middle one that be conducted arriving at once at foot of flight of stair similar to at other end finally at large square stone cell lighted on three side by very small window high up in wall most dismal looking prison there be low plank bench covered with straw presumably intended for bed two stool bucket few article constituting entire content of chamber frobisher arm be now unbound be thrust inside guard holding in readiness to frustrate attempt at escape prisoner be by time far too stiff numb after constriction of rope to make such attempt be a much a must achieve to stagger to apology for bed upon flung at full length be utterly exhausted body have scarcely touched straw before be fast asleep in condition remained for nearly twenty four hour when awoke found that coarse meal have be left for while bucket have be filled with water so made hearty meal then proceeded to examine cell by light of declining sun search however be fruitless there be nothing out of might construct key a have done at window be scarcely six inch square in short escape appeared impossibility now many day dragged out slow length in dreary monotony day after day custodian brought supply of food strangely enough time passed without being subjected to indignity torment for amusement of pirate a have fully expected might be case possibly be absent on foray have postponed entertainment until return might be reason however day slid past without molestation to lengthened into week until by notch scored morning on edge of bed frobisher found that have be just thirteen week in confinement thirteen week so far a must tell attempt have be made by chinese authority to rescue obtain release at rate there have be sound of fighting report of gun from river be being slowly forced to conclusion that very existence have be forgotten else that be thought not worth while to throw away more valuable chinese life in order to effect rescue of so unimportant personage a english mercenary then one morning when frobisher awoke commenced to dress for have made practice of undressing at night that might feel cleaner more refreshed next day discovered to astonishment that boot have mysteriously disappeared during night searched everywhere for be nowhere to be found for reason puzzled to think of satisfactory one foot gear be undoubtedly missing there be end of matter curious happening vexed considerably seemed such idiotic trick to play more thought about matter more convinced became that joke whatever be intended to be have deeper significance than have at first imagined since arrival in china have contrived to acquire fragmentary knowledge of language by mean endeavoured to ascertain from man who nightly brought food reason for apparently senseless prank fellow must not must not understand frobisher be obliged to give up attempt jailer have hitherto be in habit of closing iron bound door behind with slam rattling lock after to make sure that be fastened when brought prisoner food circumstance have come to be so expected by frobisher when on evening of day on boot have disappeared man simply pulled door to gently behind went off about business without even trying lock omission immediately attracted englishman attention man have never before be so careless frobisher must not decide whether have be thinking of something else at moment have succumbed to attack of absent mindedness whether have suddenly recollected something that have forgotten intended to pay visit to cell whichever might be frobisher believed saw in circumstance possibility of escape of instantly determined to avail with stealthy footstep crept across stone flagged floor scarcely daring to breathe lest movement must attract inconvenient person attention have be true heard jailer walk away down corridor perhaps playing stupid joke man have crept back noiselessly be even now outside door listening chuckling to at prisoner foolishness in imagining that must be careless enough to go away leaving door unfastened mere idea caused bead of sweat to start out on frobisher forehead disappointment must be too terrible swiftly pulled together with finger trembled in spite of touched old fashioned latch slowly very slowly raised pulling door gently toward a did so door opened scarcely daring to credit sens frobisher pulled still wider open moment later be able to look out into corridor there be antiquated oil lantern hanging at foot of stone stairway placed there for jailer convenience by light prisoner be able to see that corridor be empty then incident of door be trick after man have really suffered lapse of memory twenty four hour must elapse before returned be absence be discovered latter hoped by time to be far away if must find mode of escaping undetected from building first most serious obstacle in way cell door be overcome now to find whether luck must still hold if must find unguarded gate leading to freedom first of however must have covering for foot knew that must not walk far barefooted over rough ground if pursued under such circumstance capture must be certain speedy therefore removed shirt undervest tearing into strip swathed wrapping round foot somewhat after manner followed by spanish mountaineer done next have to ascertain whether remaining door between freedom be locked unlocked first door came to be one at foot of stair a might have be expected be closed be not locked pirate have clearly pinned faith on stanchness of cell door close to in opposite wall of passage be other door frobisher have observed when being conducted to prison be through one of that must pas if be to escape at passage remembered simply communicated with main building of fort to travel by path be tantamount to running into arm of captor with infinite care tried latch of door on left be locked then turned handle of door on right also be locked heart sank at thought of tremendous amount of labour must be needed to overcome obstacle if be possible to overcome at of be more than doubtful while be considering what to do first eye caught faint glimmer of light shining on something on wall eagerly stretched out hand to a touched heart leaped for object be key obviously key of one of door fitted cautiously into lock of right hand door turned gently with soft click ward fell back door jarred slightly open without wasting moment frobisher pulled wide stepped outside exulting in new found liberty ala exultation be only momentary instant later realised cruel hoax have be played on for extending over distance of many yard in direction be sort of pavement of broken glass pointed keen edged a forest of razor glass have be so firmly fixed in ground that be impossible to remove frobisher instantly realised that escape way be most effectually barred even with strong boot on must have be difficult enough matter to traverse glass strewn patch without cutting one foot to piece with foot merely protected by thin wrapping of wool linen thing be impossibility then be meaning of removal of boot a realised sardonic cruelty of men who must invent device for tormenting prisoner heart almost failed seemed a though be doomed to remain for ever immured in horrible place chapter thirteen pursued by bloodhound with smothered ejaculation of bitter disappointment frobisher recoiled few step in sheer despair bringing up rather sharply against iron plated door through have just emerged next instant realised that be doubly trapped escape be cut off in front of by broken glass have be in such haste to get away from prison that have never thought of removing key from inside of door of taking precaution to prevent door from closing behind cutting off retreat a have done retreat after be once clear of wall have naturally never entered mind now must have be glad enough to have be able to return to cell unobserved must be intensely humiliating to be obliged to wait there in small space between door glass sown path until jailer arrived twenty four hour later to release yet there seemed to be alternative how careless how criminally foolish have be to allow to be trapped by so transparent device thought frobisher ought to have suspected trap directly discovered that boot have be removed might have known that such jailer a be dealing with leave cell door unlatched by accident leave key to open other door hanging on wall in conspicuous place just where escaping prisoner must be most likely to see how pirate must laugh jeer at on morrow when arrived found there shivering with bitter cold of night in climate at time of year mere thought of such humiliation caused frobisher to grit teeth with anger have almost made up mind to chance quick dash across cruel barrier trusting that must not injure so severely a to make escape absolutely impossible when something occurred caused quickly to change mind made shrink back into shadow of door pressing up into one of corner to avoid observation consequent discovery if possible have caught sight of figure of chinaman emerging from shadow of jungle surrounded fort on landward side man figure stood out plain clear cut in moonlight be so bright that frobisher must easily distinguish movement must even see how man be dressed wondered what fellow must be doing there at time of night in part of northern china especially at season men wander about in jungle at night indeed at other time if can help having very natural objection to being caught eaten by prowling hungry tiger be therefore not little strange that man must arrive at fort by way particularly a must be reached much more easily by road pirate have constructed for own convenience must almost appear a though man bad come by route in order to avoid pirate observation longer frobisher considered matter more certain did become that be actually case more wondered what reason might be man have only stood in full view for few brief second just long enough to convince englishman that be real not figment of own heated imagination then have stepped back quickly into shadow of jungle crouching down beside clump of bamboo where be so well concealed from observation that frobisher must just distinguish outline of stooping body indeed have not kept eye on man whole time must have be impossible to detect hiding place so well did colour of clothing blend with vegetation formed background englishman heart began to beat with excitement hope for thousand possibility at once presented to be morally certain that hiding man must have connection with pirate must have come forward boldly demanded admittance if not friend of connected with outlaw must necessarily be opposed to ah if be only possible to attract man attention without also attracting that of pirate escape must be simple matter thought frobisher be already practically a good a outside wall be necessary be that something must be laid down on top of glass over must walk without cutting foot thing be done must be mile beyond possibility of pursuit before morning broke if only preliminary must be put in hand immediately did not take long to decide that must make attempt to attract man attention if latter be friend attempt be crowned with success must be well must be free within hour while if man must after prove to be enemy well might a well be discovered taken back to prison now a wait night in cold one thing be quite certain without outside assistance escape be impossible so decided to put fortune to test risk freedom if not life upon turn of die with idea drew handkerchief from pocket be about to step forward wave when saw movement among clump of bamboo next instant chinaman rose to foot ran like deer toward very part of fort in frobisher cell be situated ran noiselessly on toe bent almost double in effort to make a small a possible did not slacken speed until have reached wall of fort where again crouched down in shadow almost directly under window of frobisher cell about twenty yard away from spot where englishman be concealed latter in face of new move determined to watch few minute longer before revealing kept eye on crouching figure with greatest interest be man going to prove friend foe rescuer must be assassin scarcely latter englishman thought for there seemed something strangely familiar in man movement in whole appearance frobisher experienced sensation of having met seen man somewhere before though under what circumstance must not for life of recall be something of same build a ling ling knew be dead for have seen man body then again might pas at distance for quen lung interpreter from what frobisher have already seen of person did not for moment believe that quen lung be at kind of man to risk skin on midnight excursion to pirate stronghold suddenly frobisher attention be disturbed by sound of very low whistle undoubtedly proceeding from chinaman that whistle be beyond question signal of sort be just a certainly intended for to hesitate longer must have be height of folly for longer delay now greater must be danger of discovery so putting finger in mouth frobisher replied with whistle in exactly same key tone a chinaman latter leapt to foot took few step backward looked up at window seeing nothing there proceeded to glance round anxiously frobisher gave low whistle a man now turned head in direction fluttered white handkerchief chinaman instantly caught sight of movement commenced to run toward prisoner coming to sudden standstill a encountered outer edge of carpet of broken glass low exclamation of phew escaped a understood meaning of obstacle followed by subdued execration in english on hearing frobisher at once knew who be be risking life in endeavour to save man be none other than captain drake how little skipper have come to hear of friend predicament how have contrived to travel three hundred mile in disguise undetected frobisher must not guess knew be that at last have again stanch comrade by side one who must not forsake even in last extremity in relief must scarcely help shouting aloud for very joy fortunately remembered in time absolute necessity for strict silence contented with calling in low voice be drake surely be that same responded little man in tone a subdued a frobisher own where dickens be saw something move just now be hanged if can see thing now be here just beside door replied frobisher must have be away hour ago if have not be for confounded glass must manage to get across if take coolly walk slowly whispered drake if plant foot carefully balance well before step ought to be able to do watch slip be where danger come in d think must not have done that long ago skipper if have be possible frobisher whispered thing be impossible because have taken away boot thin wrapping have round foot must be cut to ribbon in dozen step might have known replied drake be old game of theirs well must be got across somehow be clear quickly there be nobody on guard up above a yet there be knowing when may take into head to post sentry h be pulling at one of piece of glass stuff stuck in too securely to move so be use thinking of trying to get over difficulty way there be neither time opportunity to collect anything to lay down on top of there be only one way can see so let try without waiting for frobisher to ask plan little man commenced dangerous voyage across pavement of glass have thick stick in hand frobisher saw that be wearing thick wooden soled chinese boot thus provided drake succeeded in making journey in safety in few minute stood unharmed by friend side shaking hand a though meant to pull arm from socket be glad glad indeed to see again laddie murmured heartily more than glad to see that yellow skinned pirate have not deprived of of limb be quite common trick among chink returned frobisher heartily think need tell how glad be to see again how did get to know be here understood from admiral at tien tsin that have gone to england for cargo of arm ammunition for chinese government so did replied drake carried out contract too have only be back in china couple of week must not stay here yarning be much too dangerous place to be swapping experience in will keep until later when be out of mess be so agreed frobisher question be how be to get away saw for what ticklish matter be to cross that glass even with stout boot on foot with assistance of thick stick to help to keep balance upon word fail to see how be going to manage business propose to carry take concluded chuckling giving little man sly dig in rib must even try succeed too perhaps be drake reply if there be other way out can do better than thought of scheme directly came to edge of glass sown patch understood game that chink have be playing off upon be such born fool a to stand there shout across to with chance that yellow skin might be up aloft there hear besides wanted to see for whether not scheme must work have for here be safe sound not penny worse for passage now here be just a simple a abc be thundering big chap know while be little noticed long ago that boot mine be pretty much of size while that be wearing now be bit big for though be best must get hold of just slip boot off slip on then with help of stick make passage of glass same a have done while stand here to watch do at same time keep look out then a soon a be across chuck back boot stick one at time will catch 'em have be cricketer year for nothing rest will be plain sailing will be alongside on right side of glass in two shake of lamb tail savez excellent returned frobisher in whisper a say perfectly simple only must go first surely suppose that be going to make good escape leaving here to run risk of being taken in stead drake kicked off shoe with muttered sailor blessing on frobisher head at what termed latter tomfoolery going down upon one knee seized first one then other of frobisher foot removed bandage from then thrust on boot capital fit murmured a rose to foot put stick into companion hand now off go buck look sharp about pirate will have two prisoner to amuse with instead of one recognising that little skipper be determined to have own way frobisher forbore to protest further stepped carefully out upon broad area of broken glass creeping along close under wall be able so effectually to steady by with help of stick that in few minute have safely negotiated passage short time before have appeared practically impassable then running far enough round outer margin of glass sown ground to secure clear shot in through doorway threw back to drake first one boot then other finally stick have satisfaction of seeing friend deftly catch of five minute later little skipper be safely beside thank god be out of hole piously ejaculated under breath a pair crept along in deep shadow of rear wall of fort where away to now into jungle first where ca be seen by chance look out up aloft answered drake then a soon a be safely hidden will explain made passage across open reached cover of jungle in safety whereupon drake replaced boot while frobisher swathed foot again in strip of underclothing have brought away with be serviceable enough a foot gear frobisher found that protected foot much better than have anticipated lasting quite long time before needing to be replaced by other strip having readjusted clothing two men be ready to begin long perilous journey back to civilisation drake gave companion to understand must have to be made overland before starting frobisher requested drake to cut heavy cudgel similar to one be using so that in event of encountering enemy might have something at least to defend with drake did so a handed to friend plunged hand into one of pocket brought out something also passed over to frobisher why exclaimed latter in astonishment be one of own brace of revolver how in name of fortune did get hold of here be other said drake showing butt got out of cabin aboard su chen got back safely to tien tsin may tell how came to be aboard to get up here be too long yarn to spin now let wait until be in le danger than be in at present right be skipper answered frobisher yarn will be interesting enough will be bound be glad found revolver brought along for be good barker man feel certain sense of security with one of in hand now lead way since probably know best drake took comprehensive glance at star then plunged along narrow apparently seldom trodden path through jungle seeming to find way by instinct for forest be so dense that moon ray seldom succeeded in penetrating have be jogging along at steady four mile hour for about hour half when fugitive be startled by hearing distant boom of heavy gun proceeding apparently from spot have recently left at once guessed what meant realised danger in still stood evidently be escape have somehow be prematurely discovered that gun have be fired a alarm instead of having a have confidently anticipated about eighteen twenty hour in to make good start have gained hour half pirate must be already on track true might take time to discover in direction fugitive have headed must assuredly make discovery sooner later then must be purely question of speed by jove drake exclaimed frobisher must hurry now fellow have discovered absence will lose time in taking up pursuit may depend do know of hiding place that can make for thought of just thing on way here answered drake breaking into run picked out spot will suit to t if can reach in time be old ruined town goodness know how ancient nobody life there now there be thousand of ruined house plenty of underground passage where can hide if can only get there unseen breath being precious pair wasted more in talk saved for long run before side by side dashed along at top speed sometimes colliding with tree stumbling over stone creeper until be bruised from head to foot never once halting when be beginning to hope that might be out distancing pursuit deep bell like note floating down wind warned that pirate possessed bloodhound that dog be hard upon trail frobisher took out revolver spun cylinder to satisfy that be loaded then thrust back into pocket if dog came within shot must take care that hunted more prisoner how far ahead now panted when have be running for half hour at top speed about five mile grunted drake who be feeling strain even more than frobisher must be there in about hour at pace if can keep up hope will be able to hold out be not in such good form a once be getting old too if ca keep up push on lad will try to keep back with pistol likely be replied frobisher ironically if ca hold out of course will stay face out with do can must not give in at last moment on on plunged at last began to find jungle thinning out so that going be little easier pace consequently increased must tell by frequent deep throated baying that dog be gaining on steadily dashed out of forest altogether at last away in front of on right bank of mighty hoang ho house gleaming spectrally in moonlight stood ruined city drake have referred to not more than two mile distant very haven of refuge a frobisher must easily imagine if must reach for be of considerable extent once lost in labyrinthine street underground passage pirate might search for in vain have not heard dog for minute hoping that pursuit have perhaps be abandoned frobisher glanced round be well that did so dog have also left forest seeing prey in front of be running in silence be not more than fifty yard distant grasping revolver frobisher called to drake together two men turned to face beast chapter fourteen genghiz khan hoard hideous brute dog be quite unlike usual breed of bloodhound for be fully a large a young leopard whit a powerful ferocious certainly possessed drooping ear heavy loose jowl of bloodhound hide be not smooth haired like cuban dog rough shaggy like wolf with animal be quite possible forebear have be crossed leg be extremely long very massive powerful giving power of covering great distance at high speed altogether appearance of beast be sufficient to inspire very wholesome terror in unfortunate person on whose track be placed there be fortunately only three of a master have not yet appeared in sight frobisher drake hoped to be able to settle with club revolver reach shelter of ruined city before pirate must overtake recapture time be to be lost however for be still at considerable distance from nearest building on outskirt of city while dog owner must probably be not very far behind since must be certain to have come on horseback so a to keep in reasonably close touch with hound drake drew revolver from fold of voluminous chinese jacket ranged alongside friend without word fired weapon at first of dog by time be almost upon in excitement however perhaps because of strain upon muscle from long fatiguing flight missed before must fire again animal have sprung full at throat knocking down sending revolver flying out of hand in second drake throat must have be torn open by savage slavering beast frobisher be cooler more fortunate whirling round right on top of dog thrust revolver muzzle into ear fired at moment when terrible jaw be in very act of closing on companion throat have time to assist drake to foot for other two brute be in very act of springing a turned away from dead dog cocked weapon for second shot strangely enough couple entirely ignored drake confined attention to frobisher who only saved by making rapid leap backward so avoiding first charge baulked in spring seemed like almost other savage animal dazed for moment a though must not understand why have missed prey that momentary hesitation gave frobisher opportunity to pull trigger of revolver while drake who have caught sight of own weapon half buried in sand few yard away executed quick roll in direction in second have revolver in hand frobisher bullet struck creature aimed at in upper part of near fore leg heavy missile shattering bone like pipe stem brute collapsed upon ground with deep raucous howl of pain at same moment drake raised revolver fired a sat time aim be excellent bullet striking hound frobisher have just lamed full in spine severing backbone killing creature instantly other dog apparently cowed by death of mate stood motionless in crouching attitude glaring at man in turn seemingly undecided to attack first hesitation cowardice be fatal two men fired almost together one bullet drilling hole in skull other smashing in at one side of body out at other did not live long enough to raise even whimper dropped dead where stood pool of blood immediately welling out from beneath carcass by jove drake exclaimed frobisher that shot of yours finished off in fine style what in world be using in pistol went on a turned body over curiously examined great hole in brute side have seen wound like in man who have be hit with piece of pot leg ' handful of nail never with ordinary bullet drake winked that remarked be little device of own have often noticed that be very difficult matter to bring down man especially fanatical savage with ordinary bullet go in at one side out at other so cleanly that man whom hit doe not know that be hit until be dead frequently manages to do lot of damage before dy so invented little dodge call man stopper ' consists in simply rymering ' hole in nose of bullet with file tang anything else that come handy then when bullet strike edge of hole expand become mushroomed man who be hit know about assure of course that sort of thing be not permitted in civilised warfare when fighting savage trick be used quite frequently indeed be only kind of missile will effectually stop rushing savage must advise to treat bullet in same way a soon a have time dog master may appear in sight at moment if do before leave spot happen to be mounted a feel sure be will catch easily before can possibly reach shelter yonder be scarcely prepared to fight crowd be right skipper agreed frobisher let get along a fast a can two men thrusting revolver into pocket set off at top speed toward ruined city not little refreshed by brief halt while fighting dog wonder drake jerked out a ran how pirate managed to set dog after have garment of yours have be sure have none of mine by must lay on scent have boot confound returned frobisher a be beginning to realise to cost wrapping be about worn through foot be almost a sore a though have be skinned by jove yes have forgotten said little skipper two men pounded along over sand in silence once more wall building of ruined town standing out more more clearly moment only half mile so must be safely hidden from view among maze like street of place must do in time must pursuer sight before must get under cover be question haunted see drake presently panted pointing in front of be pretty nearly there now that opening in wall be site of one of city gate once inside that be safe frobisher took hasty glance behind pursuer have not yet put in appearance there be nothing in sight three black dot on sand where fight with dog have taken place nothing in sight a yet gasped encouragingly to drake on whom pace be again beginning to tell keep up little longer be nearly there now couple of minute more of hard running placed almost in shadow of wall frobisher be congratulating on escape when suddenly something whizzed past ear with shrill whining sound starred out in splash of metal on stone of gateway plainly visible in moonlight moment later crack of modern rifle made heard confound growled frobisher looking round minute too late by be annoying buck up drake fellow be in sight have spotted shouted will be touch go now mistake drake nobly responded to call few second later two men plunged through gateway be under cover unfortunately pursuer have seen where have gone must not now be at likely to give up chase until have examined possible hiding place inside wall along first street that fugitive came to dashed then down turning to left along street leading out of only to find that be blind alley that way be stopped quick back again gasped drake can not get out way hurry will catch at other end time replied frobisher breathing heavily must of necessity go forward now here into open doorway will give shelter for moment if sight may not try street at accordingly dashed into house indicated by frobisher vanished from view just a chorus of yell at mouth of street indicated arrival of pursuer while clatter of horse hoof told only too plainly that pirate even if have not actually sighted quarry have decided to search that particular street at event here come whispered skipper must stay here will be caught like rat in trap up staircase for life will get out on roof make stand there if decide to search house taking stone step two at time fugitive dashed upward presently coming to kind of landing from several stone flagged passage radiated thence climbed up narrow staircase led to flat roof went up last so quickly that drake who be leading have popped head up above level of parapet before realised what be doing luckily none of pirate happened to be looking upward at particular moment be riding helter skelter down street evidently determined to see what lay at end drake counted before getting under cover again found that there be thirty of that there might possibly be others searching elsewhere be contingency to be kept in mind frobisher have now also crept out on to roof through small opening trap door at top of stair men cautiously peeped over low parapet a watched saw horseman come to halt opposite identical house be in evidently discussing matter appeared to think that men wanted have not come that way at while others majority believed differently seemed to want to search house in street at rate have certainly made up mind to search particular dwelling for began to dismount outside doorway be bottled at last be afraid said what do say to opening fire on now not yet whispered drake let see first if there be way down if once discover presence here will get for certain for have only six shot left between must bring spare cartridge for reloads phew whistled frobisher under breath be bad be in tight place indeed then come let see if there be other way down crept silently away from parapet toward back of house to intense gratification discovered flight of ruined stone step leading down outside of wall to narrow alley in rear down step at once made way then ran at top speed up alley out of end of into one of broader street of city have now got good start for must take little time for pirate to ride round even if must chance to catch sight of fugitive shout be raised behind to indicate that have be seen sprinted along over rough cobble for be worth there be large very handsome building at end of road determined to make for since structure of size must surely afford greater facility for concealment than smaller house from extent became more apparent a drew nearer frobisher conjectured that be probably ruin of ancient mandarin palace possibly summer palace of one of petty king of china who ruled in far off day when place be built for must see at glance that city have be abandoned for century that building be doubtless fairly ancient at time of abandonment so absorbed be men on goal have set that dashed past end of sundry street without even glancing down so failed to realise that be still in considerable danger until heard series of yell proceeding from one of enemy have divided force one of have passed ahead searching side street have seen englishman run past clatter of horse hoof told drake frobisher that pursuer be close behind did not seem possible now to get clear away without consultation at once determined to sell life a dearly a possible looked round for favourable place where might make last stand then with muttered exclamation frobisher seized drake arm dragged into narrow passage between two house just a pirate swept into street passage be in deep shadow with one accord men threw down at full length hoping that must not be seen that pirate must pas on imagining quarry still in front of luckily be just what happened pirate never thought of examining narrow passage perhaps never even saw at rate dashed past turned down street evidently considered to be road fugitive have taken instant be out of sight drake companion rose to foot continued run toward palace only few hundred yard away now be not yet at end of trouble horseman a soon a have turned down side street alluded to have seen that fugitive be certainly not in must have be in full view unless indeed have taken refuge in one of ruined house thereabouts of pirate suggested searching before looking elsewhere while others insisted that have overrun pursuit advised going back at once whole band be noisily discussing pro con when drake frobisher darted past end of street seeing fugitive pirate wheeled horse with savage whoop started in pursuit again one circumstance however gave englishman little advantage sufficient indeed a matter of fact to save life while talking horseman be bunched together in little crowd a happened to be one of men on far side of group who have be first to catch sight of fugitive galloped horse right through knot of companion without moment hesitation warning thus throwing whole company into momentary confusion one man being unhorsed while in instance horse rider went down together before remainder must extricate from melde make fair start drake frobisher have obtained full fifty yard lead by time pursuer have reached main street fugitive be more than half way to palace once on straight however horseman have advantage overhauled so rapidly that when englishman be still twenty yard from palace step foremost of pirate be so close behind frobisher knew must be cut off unless something must be done therefore gave warning cry to drake instantly darted to one side a first man dashed past unable to rein up horse navy man fired point blank into animal bringing rider to earth with tremendous thud drake accounted for next two men in quick succession while frobisher dropped fourth then others having reined up better to use rifle two men took to heel again reached long broad flight of step leading up to palace entrance in midst of hail of bullet none of fortunately took effect pirate wasted time in reloading came on again to foot of step here be of course obliged to dismount handed over horse to others of number to hold so that be only beginning to mount step a drake frobisher reached top darted in through great doorway drake be by time dreadfully out of breath gaspingly protested that have come to end of tether nevertheless managed to muster sufficient strength to jog along close behind friend at last hiding place have sought concealment aloft frobisher decided now to take refuge below since palace appeared to be kind of structure must afford better prospect of escape from vault cellar accordingly younger man kept eye open for flight of step leading downward a pirate be close behind darted down first that met eye be narrow winding stone staircase led downward so far that appeared to be reaching to very bowel of earth pair eventually came to bottom finding in long stone flagged corridor extending considerable distance very dimly lighted by small grating evidently communicated with chamber above seemed to have come to end of tether at last however for nowhere must find opening leading out of corridor already must hear pirate descending stair come drake whispered frobisher dare not remain here let try to left there may be door concealed somewhere among shadow wish have little more light other end of passage be reached without single exit being discovered there be time to run back try farther in other direction be end guess said drake a approaching footstep sounded nearer be back against wall fight to death for now friend suiting action to word little skipper grasped cudgel by thinner end took revolver with only one shot remaining in other flung backward against wall then curious thing happened solid wall at end of passage yielded to pressure of skipper body drake still leaning against fell farther farther backward until at last found in reclining position on now sloping wall then to frobisher unbounded amazement little man disappeared from view dull thud from below announcing fact that have dropped distance of several foot in instant younger man realised what have happened corridor have purpose after door at end be probably secured by concealed spring of sort drake must have unwittingly pressed when flung back against wall without losing instant frobisher knelt down at edge of dark opening then turning allowed to slip downward gradually for be obvious that there be step a foot touched bottom be barely in time to remove finger from sill when door swung to above with muffled click pirate have not reached foot of stair when door closed so that unless knew guessed at found secret of opening fugitive be safe from at rate thought occurred to frobisher when door closed behind now that be in how be to get out again called softly to drake soon found that worthy be much more startled than hurt although even yet hardly able to realise what have happened to a soon a little skipper have recovered faculty little listened hearing nothing of pursuer struck match box of have fortunately concealed in robe looked to see whether there be spring inside door failed to find one however frobisher exchanged glance full of apprehension seemed to have escaped swift death for one of lingering starvation have time to spend in dismal foreboding must now faintly hear uproar above in passage a pirate hunted for door by quarry have escaped crouched down together wondering whether pursuer must hit upon spring minute after minute passed however door still remained closed after about quarter of hour pirate be heard to take departure probably convinced that fugitive have not gone down stair after with sigh of relief frobisher turned to drake asked to strike light so that might get sort of notion where be drake did so first thing light revealed be great bundle of torch evidently placed there in bygone day for use of people whose business took into underground chamber two men eagerly lighted one then taking few more a stand by proceeded to explore enormous chamber light revealed appeared to contain nothing there be several passage leading from seven in a explorer counted tried first came to to ascertain where led extended for distance of about hundred foot then terminated did there appear to be door concealed otherwise at end of two more passage be explored with same result fourth middle passage of seven be different in at end came to massive iron door drake stretched out hand made attempt to twist iron handle must not budge again tried time seemed to move little a did so frobisher thought caught slight grinding whirring sound like rusty machinery reluctantly moving what be that prompted to act did not know suddenly becoming possessed with suspicion of door sense of danger in vicinity dragged drake quickly away from handle retreated few step be well that did so for at moment grinding sound became quite perceptible waxed louder then like lightning from cloud row of curved swordblades shot out of slot in stone work men have not previously noticed swept together for world like pair of calliper leg person standing by door must have infallibly be stabbed through through by deadly device then just a suddenly blade sprang back into wall door swung back on hinge revealing smaller chamber beyond by power gasped drake wiping perspiration from forehead what fiendish invention mr frobisher be second time night that have saved life will not forget pshaw answered frobisher what about time have saved mine drake continued excitedly have got idea that be on point of discovering something man who owned palace must have have something very well worth guarding must never have taken trouble to instal such elaborate arrangement a to destroy possible thief for be what be intended to do without doubt let get along see what there be to see be careful for goodness ' sake there may be more of man trap about want to be left dead in hole so saying frobisher stepped slowly cautiously through door way holding torch high above head at once found in small circular chamber be almost completely filled with ironbound case chest of description great caesar ghost almost shouted frobisher to drake who be standing just inside door with mouth wide open torch almost dropping out of hand have dropped right into somebody treasure house mistake if chest contain valuable name be not murray frobisher bring stick let see whether can wrench off one of lock must not be very difficult for wood look so rotten a almost to be crumbling to powder sooner said than done drake eagerly placed end of stout cudgel under hasp of nearest of box using a lever soon sent iron flying nail drawing out of soft punky wood a easily a though have be set in putty next swung lid back then what sight met astounded eye box contained gold silver be full to brim with jewel of most magnificent description unset one of flashing scintillating in glare of torch like boxful of most exquisitely coloured liquid fire sight be so extraordinarily beautiful that fairly took beholder breath away for quite minute neither of must speak word simply stood still gasping with wonder delight chest then be opened of missing page missing page chapter fifteen muttering of war single scarcely original exclamation of oh be captain drake appeared to be capable of uttering for moment eye continued to bulge from socket looked like suddenly awakened somnambulist be trying to realise meaning of what frobisher have just told be finding altogether too much for at last frobisher said with laugh well skipper money here sure enough so be remains to be seen whether not can get out will get out right trouble returned drake confidently unable a yet to detach mind from subject of suddenly acquired fortune just now mentioned name of gentleman who collected stuff jenkins can think said be called who be how did come to pouch pile of loot be one of old buccaneer like morgan kidd that read about well replied frobisher be not exactly buccaneer for be not sailor landsman operated in much larger way than morgan kidd a matter of fact be tartar chief in young day many century ago who gradually drilled armed own tribe then other tribe still others until came in course of time to have enormous army under idea then occurred to to make use of vast army determined upon le task than of conquering asia did too there be hardly square mile of continent have not echoed to tread of troop everywhere went be victorious took sacked city destroyed sowed ruin with salt be said that to day grass will grow where genghiz khan army trod naturally in course of time accumulated vast booty from city captured finally became too large cumbersome for to carry about with so determined to alter tactic for once instead of destroying to build city for where must bury hoard must make head quarter be well known that actually did various record state record say exactly where city be said be founded somewhere in northern china on bank of mighty river be wording believe there be several river in china answering description so place might be almost anywhere then year afterward man determined to conquer japan fitted out great armada sailed for nippon a in case of famous spanish armada storm arose entire fleet be wrecked hundred of thousand of chinese lost life japan be saved from time onward genghiz khan record relating to treasure disappeared city founded a well a treasure gradually passed into legend story being handed down from father to son by word of mouth man be supposed to have be cast ashore in japan where adopted dress custom of japanese in course of time becoming one of winning great renown under name forget for moment antiquarian insist that name assumed be japanese rendering of own former one of genghiz khan at rate never returned to china to recover treasure legend have that still remained where have be originally hidden from time to time expedition have be formed for purpose of searching for legendary deserted city have remained for drake to discover to secure genghiz khan million must be town must be treasure for not otherwise can such enormous hoard be accounted for nobody conqueror of asia must ever have amassed so much that be very interesting mr frobisher said drake who have be listening intently be very comforting thought that belongs to if can only get out suppose in case have better fill pocket lest must not be able to get back here must not be at bad idea skipper returned frobisher two men slipped few handful of jewel into pocket a coolly a though have be so many pebble instead of gem worth several thousand of pound now said frobisher have better turn attention to getting out of will not feel comfortable until have satisfied that place be not going to prove living tomb for closed lid of chest passed through what frobisher called door way of sword carefully closing door behind by mean of stick lest closing must again set sword in motion did not mechanism be evidently so arranged a only to operate upon opening of door think need fear burglar here said drake with smile a door clanged two men then decided to explore remainder of corridor for unless exit from one of must be found there be little doubt that treasure must prove a useless to a have be to genghiz khan first passage explored ended in blank wall a three others have done in next to great relief found passage branching away to left followed for distance until reached spot where branched into two a there be knowing if be right one took one on left a previous opening have be on left of corridor followed for considerable distance be doomed to disappointment corridor led nowhere simply came to what seemed to be dead end like others frobisher felt drop of sweat forming on forehead for be beginning to look remarkably a though there be one entrance to vault that through have come that other passage be either natural have be cut simply with idea of mystifying misleading possible intruder never say die be however frobisher motto drake too for matter so tried back entered right hand branch better success attended here ending in blank wall also there be now only one corridor untried with sinking heart proceeded to explore exit of sort rewarded here either hardly daring to look other in face from fear of what might see there returned to main chamber into drake have fallen headlong in first instance here must still hear distant shout trampling of pirate who be evidently moving about in chamber directly overhead continuing search for prey even thought that be safe from barbarous savage be now hardly sufficient to cheer must have be almost better to have met death in open fighting than to be compelled to watch slow approach in dismal place far below level of ground unable to remain still frobisher again most carefully examined inside of secret door in search of hidden spring sign of must discover seemed evident that unless door be actually propped open by person entering vault there be getting back by way frobisher must not help thinking that surely other exit must have be provided people accustomed to using vault must not be expected always to remember to prop door open when entered did not seem reasonable to suppose that place have be so constructed that mere lapse of memory must be tantamount to person signing own death warrant emergency exit must have be made for use in case main door became closed accidentally otherwise question be where be situated drake suggested that there must undoubtedly be opening somewhere because air in vault be comparatively pure fresh at least have not dead stale stuffy smell of air confined in hermetically sealed chamber frobisher pointed out that door by have entered although excellent fit did not butt up against jamb so closely a to exclude air altogether yet acknowledged that air in vault certainly seemed sweeter than might have be expected have main door be only channel through must filter in under stimulus of new glimmer of hope thus caught corridor be once more explored even more closely than before with other result than frobisher completely satisfied that there be most certainly exit from of passage even concealed door opened by spring must hardly have evaded close scrutiny of two men became more more apparent that have be caught in trap from there be escape be feeling famished for want of food be parched with thirst frobisher must not help wondering how long agony of death from starvation thirst must be prolonged before blessed unconsciousness came to relief suddenly have be sitting dejectedly on floor frobisher jumped to foot look here drake exclaimed there be just one place that never thought of searching be treasure chamber be too deeply interested in valuable found to think of looking for exit in there who know very thing be hunting for may be in there time two men fairly raced down passage leading to chamber opened latch with due caution re entered vault at first sight there appeared to be semblance of second door hope dropped to zero once more then drake proposed that a last chance must remove chest to centre of room see whether possibly there might be door concealed behind of set to work feverishly in doing so spilled jewel coin in heap on floor what did matter unless found way of escape from prison jewel coin must be of far le value to than loaf of bread jar of water then at very end when hope be practically extinguished last chest removed disclosed little oaken door set into wall not more than four foot high by three foot broad drake be about to open impulsively when frobisher restrained did not want either of to be killed on very threshold of success by other hidden fiendishly ingenious piece of mechanism when cautiously opened with aid of one of stick nothing happened in instance crawled safely through into passage being careful to close door behind passage looked good deal more promising there being le than four other corridor branching off at right angle curiously enough leading away to left determined to go straight ahead in first instance exploring corridor afterwards if not successful in present direction traversed so long distance in perfectly straight line ground rising gently way that soon became convinced that be at last on right track a passage must distance back have passed from under foundation of palace be leading undoubtedly to exit at considerable distance from building seemed probable that might have be constructed with view to providing mean of escape must palace ever be attacked stormed that be correct in surmise be proved shortly afterward when little distance ahead frobisher caught sight of pin hole of light presently resolved into sunlight shining through keyhole of door realised that since be now broad daylight must have spent several hour in genghiz khan treasure house door did not open with handle a others have done there be key hanging handily on wall a there have be when frobisher escaped out of pirate fortress so after there be still rather formidable obstacle to be overcome before must actually stand in blessed light of day again must not let stop drake exclaimed frobisher though yet quite see what be to do if have big stone must burst lock off out there be so much a pebble to be seen anywhere about how far be away from palace do think asked drake if be out of earshot of pirate can easily manage good quarter of mile must say replied frobisher must fire rifle in here must never hear mean to do something like returned other produced revolver muzzle of thrust against keyhole pulled trigger turning face aside at same time explosion in confined space sounded like roar of twelve inch gun dust splinter flew in cloud when air cleared lock be gone in place ragged hole appeared through clenched fist must easily be thrust one two strong pull together while gripping edge of hole sufficed to loosen whole affair presently with rattle of falling piece of broken iron spring door grated open once more beheld blessed light of day on stepping outside found in midst of thick clump of bush vegetation completely concealed door from outside have evidently not be disturbed for century so thick matted be growth through pushed broke way coming out few moment later into what be evidently remains of once spacious magnificent garden there be still traceable outline of old walk lawn ruined fountain marble basin for gold fish be scattered about there be even remains of marble seat couch whereon warrior of genghiz khan retinue have be wont to take ease during too brief respite from fighting sundial beautifully modelled in bronze statue in bronze copper marble in case even solid silver be to be found in many of corner few be still on pedestal most of lay broken on ground though gave evidence of high level to chinese art have advanced even in far off day quarter of mile away be to be seen palace pair have recently vacated peering cautiously from behind screen of brushwood be able to make out figure of of pirate still apparently searching industriously while smoke of fire little distance away showed that have by mean given up pursuit be cooking meal preparatory to instituting fresh search of palace precinct have not yet apparently thought of looking in garden think dare risk enquired drake voicing idea uppermost in mind pointing toward group of unconscious pirate yes replied frobisher seem to be pretty fully occupied with own concern just now be evidently under impression that be still hiding somewhere in building so think must not hope for better opportunity must without fail eventually discover that be nowhere in building so have better get away before take into head to start searching in direction expect group have joined force by time to participate in meal be preparing so must be able to get clear of town without being seen point settled pair made way cautiously out of garden soon gained street traversed slowly to save a much a possible in case pursuit must again be taken up in about hour during have perceived no cause for alarm realised by gradual thinning of house that be approaching outskirt of city on eastern side be proceeding carefully conversing noting interesting relic of bygone civilisation when without word drake suddenly seized companion arm hastily dragged behind convenient wall frobisher too much astonished for word must only look round wonderingly imagining that pirate be after again a did so perceived cause of skipper alarm danger be not behind in front pirate have proved to be wider awake than of englishman have anticipated have posted sentry at eastern gate fortunately for man happened to be looking in direction at moment when turned corner discovery must have be inevitable a be question arose how be fresh obstacle to be overcome might possibly avoid man by making long detour to other gate plan appealed to of for even must succeed in escaping by other outlet ground outside wall be so bare that man must inevitably see alarm must be raised when of course pursuit must at once be resumed capture become certain few word between two englishman sufficed to show that same plan only practicable one have occurred to avoiding main street made way through side lane back alley until emerged at spot only few yard distant from unsuspecting sentinel then watching through convenient cranny until back be turned ran swiftly forward concealed behind low stone wall man be passing repassing on beat next time passed that sentry experienced unpleasant sensation of being jumped on from behind by two men one small other very large heavy latter kneeling on chest squeezing windpipe while other securely lashed wrist ankle together with strip torn from own robe operation being completed by thrusting gag made of same material into mouth securing there firmly englishman then carried between into one of adjacent ruined house took to upper room left there for companion to find if fate must so decree a matter of fact fate evidently decreed against unhappy man for several month afterwards remains of gagged bound chinaman be found in very house by party of travelling nomad be case of pirate life of englishman did not take long to decide world must best spare sentry having be thus disposed of drake frobisher struck off across desert by margin of river at good round pace for since pirate have posted guard be probable that must visit sooner later englishman wanted to be well out of sight before anything of sort must occur little later on be fortunate enough to come to village most of inhabitant of be away a happened probably hunting fishing otherwise engaged upon usual occupation here secured hearty meal of rice bread cheese goat milk after found marvellously refreshed thought meal cheap at price of one of genghiz khan gold piece specially cleaned up for purpose of payment be unnecessary to relate in detail incident of journey of fugitive back to tien tsin for nothing in way of real adventure occurred after have once left ruined city behind on way drake explained to frobisher how have come to attempt friend rescue in few word be how came about drake have returned in quernmore from england with cargo duly delivered then a china be purchasing steamer for use a transport be offered about twice ship actual value sold so found at loose end without employment regarded a favourable opportunity to commence enquiry respecting frobisher whom believed to be still prisoner in korea happening to encounter wong lih who have by time returned from visit to southern china heard whole of frobisher history from moment when admiral found rescued at asan to of expedition up river after pirate be also informed that expedition have failed that friend be dead prisoner wong lih said drake be greatly cut up at losing so promising officer man too of whom have made friend must not be induced to send rescue party be altogether too busily occupied with matter of moment to country war be so imminent that a matter of fact admiral found absolutely unable to spare ship crew for purpose drake therefore determined to ascertain for if frobisher be still alive if so to attempt rescue a happened to be good chinese linguist possessed in high degree art of disguising attempt proved a have be seen completely successful be exactly two month after frobisher escape from pirate fortress when two very weary very ragged englishman arrived in tien tsin so bronzed disreputable did appear that must obtain accommodation nowhere until have proved by exhibition of of gold that be not up country robber solvent citizen of merely temporarily unattractive exterior condition be soon altered with assistance of few bath shave new drill suit having made toilet frobisher proposed starting immediately to report to wong lih admiral happened to be on spot at moment drake insisted on accompanying accordingly two men sauntered off toward navy building where be told that admiral wong lih might be found at dockyard busily superintending fitting out for sea of several repaired re boilered cruiser upon enquiring reason for bustle confusion be everywhere apparent quite unaccustomed businesslike air of port frobisher be informed by officer to whom applied for information that japan have few day previously perpetrated act must hardly be interpreted otherwise than a meaning war consequently possible preparation be being hurriedly made to meet contingency gun be being mounted ship be being dry docked scraped painted nucleus crew be being brought up to fighting strength in short everything must be done be being done to place china in position to send navy to sea to encounter japanese squadron for be plainly to be seen said officer since first act of hostility have taken place formal declaration of war be merely matter of few day there be great deal to be done in time frobisher thanked man for information then drake hurried on way toward dockyard truly air be full of muttering rumour of war chapter sixteen dragon awakes on way to dockyard while passing along street of many water heard in distance sound of military band playing very barbaric music to english ear be to say in what be undoubtedly march time presently found compelled to halt for about five minute at cross street named lotus while several company of chinese line regiment went swinging past on way to barrack drake companion must not refrain from commenting favourably upon smart businesslike appearance of men be appeared part of crack corp officer private seemed fully to realise fact to be proud of there be not single soldier among standing le than six foot in height majority be broad in proportion navy men whom frobisher have so far encountered be usually uniformed somewhat after fashion of european officer seaman officer wore flat peaked cap with gold dragon in front instead of crown anchor while jacket trouser of dark blue cloth be almost exactly similar to of own men except that facing instead of being gold be of peculiar shade of blue so much in favour among chinese ordinary tar wore conventional dark blue baggy trouser blouse of same colour cut to v shape at neck in front collar at back european seaman have adopted while skirt of blouse be allowed to hang loose outside trouser instead of being tucked in only essential difference between celestial seaman uniform own lay in cap instead of being flat dark blue in colour be of conventional chinese shape white in colour with knob of soft material on top pigtail be rolled up tucked into crown of cap more correctly hat arm consisted of rifle frobisher noted be of widely different pattern most of obsolete although be breech loader kind of cutlas somewhat similar to british naval weapon with two handed hilt only small circular piece of polished brass for guard soldiery however smart though be in way resembled of european army uniform similar of course consisted of identically same hat a worn in navy white jacket very long very loose with baggy sleeve collar front skirt edge of cuff edged with broad chinese blue braid short baggy trouser gathered just below knee tucked into kind of puttee legging consisting of long wrapping of white canvas trouser be also white with chinese blue stripe of broad braid down outside strangely enough inside also of leg boot be eminently sensible serviceable be something like red indian moccasin upper being made of two thickness of deer hide be kept on foot by mean of narrow tape run through eyelet while sol be built up of several thickness of felt amounting in to about inch half have appearance of great clumsiness be a matter of fact extremely light springy comfortable thickness of sol springiness of felt absence of heel made boot particularly easy to march in soldier be thus able to cover great distance without feeling fatigue men instead of hiding pigtail under head gear allowed to hang down of frobisher observed be of great length in case falling a low a back of knee for arm men carried rifle of more modern pattern than in use in sister service in fact seemed so far a frobisher must see without close inspection to be martini weapon of pattern most serviceable reliable fire arm far superior to modern small bore rifle in opinion of soldier a man stopper rush checker long wicked looking bayonet with basket hilt back of blade serrated for three quarter of length like edge of large saw swung from left hip armoury be completed by long hilted long bladed knife short sword stuck through belt supported bayonet must certainly be tough crowd to meet at close quarter a drake murmured to companion while men swung past soldier appeared to be extremely partial to flag for there seemed to be one to twenty thirty men be identical in shape colour being triangular yellow with device of crimson dragon open jawed in centre a soon a men have passed frobisher drake continued walk shortly afterward reached entrance to dockyard where be sharply challenged in chinese by sentry fortunately a have be before noted drake be excellent chinese scholar in answer to explanation that be in search of admiral wong lih man allowed to pas very civilly directed where to go having seen officer in question pas short time previously while drake be obtaining information frobisher amused by looking around a did so caught sight of very gorgeously dressed official approaching attended by several servant one of whom be holding large umbrella over master head while timidly supported heavy silken train of mandarin cloak there be something familiar about man appearance englishman must not remember whether not have really met before whether be only resemblance to other have attracted notice be man of very high standing there must be doubt about for while be yet ten yard away sentry abruptly ceased conversation with drake pushed little skipper aside presented arm face assuming fixed expression of wooden image touched frobisher imagined with more than trace of fear indeed upon closer inspection official countenance be seen to be anything pleasant in expression did not deign to return sentry salute stared in particularly offensive manner at two englishman finally coming to halt putting several question to sentry who replied in tone positively quavered with apprehension during time personage never took eye off two friend frobisher be on point of losing temper when unknown with distinctly perceptible sneer turned back rudely with curt command to waiting attendant stalked majestically away who what began drake frobisher simultaneously then stopped frobisher simmering with rage continued drake ask sentry here who in thunder insolent bounder be by jingo have mind to go after tweak pigtail soundly why looked at a though be dirt beneath foot a though have business to be alive confound impudence drake fully a indignant sharply put desired question in reply received long explanation from sentry who constantly sent glance after mandarin a though fearful that latter might overhear what be saying even at distance presently concluded drake translated whilst two continued search for wong lih fellow say explained drake that individual who treated to such close scrutiny be very important official indeed be one of member chief in fact of naval council also four button mandarin entitled to wear insignia of golden peacock be also captain of battleship ting flagship of chinese northern fleet fly flag of celebrated admiral ting last by mean least hold important post in dockyard though how manages to carry out duty of of captain at one same time know while to cap everything be member of chinese royal family prince no le assure what do think of for tally eh mr frobisher well be rather inclined to be sorry for people who come under scope of naval jurisdiction returned frobisher must hate to serve in ship of be captain of course know fellow from adam there be something about aroused in very strong sense of repulsion looked to like arch criminal by way did man tell what name be feel sure have seen somewhere before remember repellent snaky look in eye give one shiver up down one spine oh ay replied skipper 'd forgotten that did mention tally a matter of fact let see um what be again ah remember called prince see at least be what sounded like by jove then remember when met last drake exclaimed frobisher be when went with friend admiral to council meeting at navy building when received commission in chinese navy wong lih mentioned then that name be prince hsi recollect how very unpleasantly impressed then appears also that be bit of scoundrel for in wong lih absence in korea fellow have audacity to send chih ship be to be appointed to to wei hai wei to have replaced by inch gun intending to sell smaller weapon substitute old out of date twelve pocket difference luckily wong lih met on way there screwed information out of captain stopped hsi little game hate wong lih therefore a be friend of admiral have honoured also with share of dislike low down ruffianly swab drake burst out there be just sort of beast look well mr frobisher if a say dislike from way looked at must say that hate ' be more correct word must advise to keep weather eye lifting that sort of man hesitates at very little seems to have power a well a will to do bad turn so watch out will drake replied frobisher can rely on here be at last think be place where sentry said must find wong lih be ordnance wharf third shed along first door on far side of sheer leg before come to fifty ton crane said replied drake so reckon that be door by jiminy there be admiral walking beside other officer in gold lace flag captain must say by aiguillettes be right enough agreed frobisher together two men set off in pursuit keeping little in rear until two officer must have finished conversation presently captain saluted went off about own business wong lih turning caught sight of drake frobisher a eye fell upon latter stood stock still jaw dropped eyebrow went up looked a though have seen ghost why captain frobisher exclaimed at last coming forward holding out hand be then really dear boy be glad to see again safe sound too by appearance have be mourning a dead three month more ever since got back from south learnt of disaster to su chen on hoang ho never expected to see alive again when heard that have fallen into clutch of pirate be more grieved than can tell a captain drake here can testify not to be able to send rescue party after to try to save at least avenge be absolutely impossible have ship men to spare imminence of war with japan have be threatening daily for month past be now acknowledged fact must not allow of much a regretted country naturally be first consideration of course sir agreed frobisher heartily quite understand too be delighted to see once more indeed came down here to yard on purpose to find report ready for duty hope sir that can still employ employ ejaculated admiral must rather say can why must use hundred of men like if only existed in china come along to office can talk more comfortably there too captain drake if will so far honour poor quarter with pleasure with pleasure lord maj er sir mean drake almost shouted in confusion quite flabbergasted a must have called at chinaman stately old world courtesy few minute later found in wong lih comfortably furnished office in ordnance department of dockyard arrived there having seated admiral ordered refreshment immediately plunged into matter always nearest heart now more so than ever since have reported captain frobisher commenced take that be ready for service at moment instant if wish sir answered frobisher thank captain said wong lih be practically what amount to ship chih yuen be here now must like to take command of at earliest possible moment be in readiness to go to sea with store ammunition men aboard must be at sea now a matter of fact have have officer to whom dared trust sir turning to drake be willing to accept service under emperor if so can offer berth certainly be highness replied drake heartily only if may be so bold a to say so must like to be on same ship a fr a captain frobisher here say friend ' drake broke in frobisher be on tip of tongue be truth if man who save life be not friend know what else must call quite right captain frobisher said wong lih like to hear say a for mr drake can satisfy wish very easily a happens acting first lieutenant of mr frobisher ship be not fitted for post be best have at time now if choose will replace a first lieutenant of chih yuen will have commission made out immediately nothing must please better lord replied drake with utmost enthusiasm assure that very well then interrupted admiral who be plainly hard pressed for time be agreed will receive commission to night now gentleman although be so busy that scarcely know what to do first must spare time to give short account of state of affair a stand at present since be necessary that must have fullest information to enable in particular captain frobisher to understand exactly how thing be with china how extremely critical situation be when have heard what be about to tell will be able to form own idea plan so be in position to work intelligently with brother captain under admiral who be going to command northern fleet to will be attached may mention be to be in command of southern division while admiral ting will be chief remember of course captain frobisher when rebellion in korea became so serious that government must not deal with korean minister asked assistance gave a saw at asan also informed then that japan have thereupon thought fit to manifest somewhat unfriendly attitude by sending unnecessarily strong guard to minister at seoul coupled with intimation that must feel obliged to send much larger force if rebellion be not immediately crushed that in a fully realised amounted very nearly to threat of war against china showed that japan be only awaiting opportunity therefore sent very strongly worded protest against such action to tokio japanese thereupon agreed to defer action until must be seen what turn event in korea be going to take be situation when be sent in su chen up hoang ho of who have eye to see ear to hear be fully awake to fact that concession on part of japan be merely postponement of evil day perhaps found be not a fully prepared for war a have imagined know be not colleague of who have country interest at heart took warning therefore hurried forward preparation for war a rapidly a must then thing remained fairly quiescent until few day ago have practically quelled korean rebellion matter be resuming normal status in korea only thing remained being to institute reform be undoubtedly necessary in country proposal for be offered to accepted by korean government proposed modification of policy began to take shape at once one must therefore have thought that little campaign in korea might be said to have terminated satisfactorily that korea might be left to carry out course of action to have pledged in fact actually commenced withdrawal of troop then suddenly japan sprang mine minister at seoul be informed by japanese representative that japan did not consider korea competent to carry out promise that therefore japan must unite with china to carry out reform between of course be tantamount to japan claiming right to share china suzerainty over korea most audacious may almost call infamous proposition be one to japan of course knew must never agree told so in very plain term next thing heard be that japan have landed no fewer that five thousand men in korea that be marching on seoul on same day japanese minister there forced situation by tendering two ultimatum one to korea one to korean ultimatum required that within twenty four hour korea must disclaim chinese suzerainty pledge to allow japan alone to carry out reform in question alternative be that if korea must not agree be to be treated a enemy to japan ultimatum addressed to be to effect that must also within same time surrender suzerainty to japan relinquish claim over korea alternative in case being war of course must not possibly send reply within time stipulated even if must must have refused proposal with scorn minister at seoul did man must do to gain time sent news to immediately a soon a heard of japan action knew that anticipated moment have come that war have become inevitable therefore hurried eight thousand men on board transport dispatched at once to asan now come circumstance almost break heart to tell war have not yet be actually declared understand japan be still officially awaiting decision yet japanese fleet in full strength lay in wait for transport convoying men of war attacked sinking transport kowshing with over thousand men on board one of cruiser other transport cruiser escaped got safely to asan where troop be landed ship sheltering under gun of fortress messenger who brought news of treacherous attack informed that five thousand japanese troop mentioned just now having reached seoul have be dispatched again immediately under general oshima to asan to attack garrison there met small force of soldier four day later at song hwan be sorry to say defeated only silver lining to cloud lie in surprise japanese will receive when find met at asan by seven thousand of men instead of only small garrison of place for be not very likely that oshima force being on march will have heard of naval battle of successful landing of majority of men at sea fight occurred week ago only received news of land battle to day although have be taken unawares by japan treachery in striking before declaration of war have managed to prepare pretty well thanks to warning have that be coming mark japan will find to cost that can not insult ride rough shod over country without being called to very strict account war mr frobisher will be declared by china against japan tomorrow st of august rely upon a well a upon rest of officer to do utmost to keep command of sea country secures will have other at mercy ought to be able to secure a navy be if anything little more powerful than of japan seeing that have two battleship a well a cruiser whereas japan have only cruiser be situation gentleman be now a fully posted a be with regard to state of affair so strike hard often for china when get opportunity will sir replied men enthusiastically continued frobisher trust that ammunition will prove very different from supplied on su chen probably heard that expedition failed for other reason than more than shell be filled with charcoal instead of gunpowder ala ala did replied wong lih wish must promise that such monstrous iniquity must never occur again can not be doing have always done best to prevent shameful tampering with government property what can one man do amongst so many will remember that told mandarin be filling pocket at expense of country there be telling how far peculation may have extended have examined a much ammunition a have have time for be bound to say that look all right beyond can not go for be impossible to know for certain without opening cartridge at crisis like must be impossibility must do a do trust powder will prove what pretend to be very well sir returned frobisher bowing doe not seem very satisfactory state of affair will do best assure be certain of returned wong lih now one last word sorry a be to have to acknowledge there be traitor everywhere about so trust one admiral news must have be conveyed to japan by one of countryman to have enabled fleet to know when transport sailed where to meet that man whoever be have japanese gold in pocket blood of thousand of countryman on head drake frobisher exchanged glance involuntarily same suspicion have evidently crossed mind of simultaneously do suspect anyone in particular sir enquired frobisher if so perhaps will kindly warn in direction to exercise most care be sorry to say that do suspect someone most strongly be wong lih reply after somewhat lengthy pause unfortunately be so highly placed that even dare not mention name if man so much a guessed that suspected treachery must be assassinated within twenty four hour so for country sake must refrain from telling something must give good deal to be able to do someone very highly placed repeated frobisher drawing chair little closer to wong lih lowering voice must be very wide of mark in guessing to be prince of blood royal wong lih turned pale glanced uneasily round must be on contrary very near truth if suspicion be correct replied that man have played many scurvy trick in time other delinquency be light compared with treachery to country fear to breathe name in connection with so horrible crime tell how came to suspect also have ground none replied frobisher have met man twice on occasion have impressed most unfavourably suppose one must take notice of intuition certainly look thorough scoundrel to mind will watch a carefully a can do said admiral say have met twice recollect first time recall second when be not hour ago sir returned frobisher met with retinue just leaving dockyard honoured so far a to treat to very impertinent scrutiny a passed leaving dockyard echoed wong lih did not see about here ought to be on board ship ting yuen by right for be quite ready for sea know admiral ting be only too eager to take fleet out to look for enemy indeed a soon a be aboard chih yuen have hoisted flag be likely to make signal to proceed to sea man have business here wonder what be doing acting upon wong lih hint that interview have better terminate frobisher drake took leave of kindly admiral went back into city to transact necessary business before going on board included securing uniform suit of mufti toilet article in fact personal requisite of kind of men have be destitute for several month past business having be transacted new possession be packed sent to ship frobisher drake followed immediately afterward arrived on board former have commission read by interpreter for be of course written in chinese script at last after many strange vicissitude found standing on own quarterdeck captain of chinese cruiser chih ' yuen chapter seventeen prince traitor once fairly settled on board chih yuen although there turned out to be enormous amount of work to be done numerous little matter to be attended to before cruiser must be said to be thoroughly shipshape frobisher found time to look round little to cast eye over remainder of northern fleet lying off city of tien tsin accustomed a be to sight of great britain noble squadron enormous size of battleship cruiser chinese fleet at first glance seemed utterly insignificant a fighting machine in first place ship be few in number there be two battleship among cruiser must nearly have be considered obsolete in england about quarter of mile from own ship anchored in mid stream lay two battleship formed backbone of chinese navy at time ting yuen flagship of admiral ting with frobisher pet abomination prince hsi a captain chen yuen commanded like own ship by englishman craft be old out of date having be built a long ago a year armour be enormously thick of carried two eighty ton monster gun placed in turret set in echelon so that immense weight of weapon must be evenly distributed ship be little over seven thousand ton displacement be fitted with particularly long strongly reinforced ram upon effective use of chinese admiral be building largely not without justification a event proved two battleship completely dwarfed fleet of cruiser lying above below in river none of being of more than three thousand five hundred ton le than size of flagship of course not nearly so heavily armed in fact none of cruiser carried anything more powerful in way of gun than five inch weapon frobisher own ship latest addition to navy mounted of chih yuen possessed only two one in barbette forward one similarly mounted aft then came two sister ship cruiser of three thousand ton yen fu kau ling armoured vessel one of two thousand seven hundred ton also armoured named shan si while close up under wall of city lay couple of protected cruiser of two thousand five hundred ton yung chau tung yen be old acquaintance hat yen have be admiral wong lih flagship at battle of asan be also to be seen busily preparing for sea dispatch vessel san chau likewise recognised have also be pressed into service su chen in frobisher have made ill fated attack on pirate be still in hand of repairer who have managed to spin out job of putting to right again after fight ever since time of return from hoang ho lastly there be old cruiser kwei lin have be in navy for over twenty year have not moved from anchorage for last decade be absolutely useless a fighting machine short a chinese be of ship futility of taking to sea be at once recognised be to be left behind to carry on former duty a guardship to port in addition to above mentioned ship there be seven torpedo boat be to accompany fleet ranging in size from seventy to hundred twenty ton unlike japan china possessed none of type of craft known a torpedo boat destroyer tbd for short japan have quite number of over hundred ton one two being even over two hundred be of course much faster more heavily armed than chinese torpedo boat japan also possessed advantage in cruiser be not only larger than of china be also newer faster more heavily armed there be more of one ship in particular yoshino be larger than chinese battleship while armoured cruiser matsushima hiroshima hakodate be well over four thousand ton much more heavily armed than of chinese ship with exception of chen yuen ting be superior only in possession of two big gun secondary armament be not so powerful a of enemy cruiser frobisher who of course knew pretty accurately composition of japanese naval strength shook head a contemplated collection of vessel in river there be sad lack of homogeneity in squadron must render quick effective manoeuvring extremely difficult of newer ship own for instance be capable of steaming fifteen sixteen knot battleship be not good for more than thirteen while of older cruiser must not be relied upon for more than ten eleven a speed of fleet be necessarily that of slowest ship meant that whole squadron must not steam at more than ten knot thereabout speed of slowest japanese ship knew to be not le than thirteen knot so in event of naval engagement enemy fleet must be able to outmanoeuvre chinese choose own locality for fighting a well a range position be most important advantage to posse a frobisher considered likelihood nay practical certainty of chinese ammunition proving faulty did not feel at certain that china must come out on top notwithstanding possession of two powerful battleship be aroused from somewhat gloomy reverie by observing signal fluttering up to signal yard of flagship running below to cabin seized telescope hurrying up on deck again read off communication be enabled to do by mean of chinese secret naval code book few copy of have be prepared with english translation for use of british naval officer in fleet of whom there be several signal read captain to repair on board flagship immediately frobisher then knew that time for action be close at hand council must be held in admiral cabin on ting yuen admiral must inform captain of intended plan be willing at same time to receive suggestion be to be in fact council of war frobisher looked forward to eagerly a being first actual war debate must ever have attended must be first introduction to war a reality hitherto have only taken part in sham naval battle be now face to face with stern reality rejoiced exceedingly calling interpreter to have gig ordered got quickly into full dress uniform handed over ship to drake charge during absence in few minute be being pulled across quarter mile stretch of water lay between chih yuen flagship on arrival there owing to ship lying farthest away found remainder of captain assembled only awaiting presence to commence business be greeted very cordially in english by admiral ting with whom wong lih have already be in communication received few very courteous word of condolence upon disaster on hoang ho then followed introduction to fellow captain among whom be prince hsi with one exception be very warmly welcomed by especially by compatriot captain foster of chen yuen who a matter of strict fact be scotsman captain james of cruiser shan si be only other britisher present being captain there be several others in fleet in capacity of first second lieutenant especially in engineering department in fact with one exception chief engineer of ship be englishman scotsman council be not very lengthy one for be impossible to make plan very far ahead since little information be so far available a to enemy movement first duty of fleet explained admiral ting be therefore to proceed to wei hai wei where fleet of transport be already taking aboard several chinese regiment destined for service in korea be to be convoyed by entire squadron to mouth of river yalu forming boundary between china korea landed there after fleet future movement must be guided by circumstance probability be that enough information must be obtained meanwhile to enable admiral ting to locate position of japanese fleet in event chinese squadron must sail for spot indicated endeavour to force general action for be vitally important to china that must obtain command of sea at earliest possible moment keep otherwise must be seriously handicapped in transporting troop to seat of war if not entirely prevented from doing so similarly be necessary to prevent japanese if possible from transporting troop supply to korea must only be accomplished by first destroying seriously crippling japanese navy in conclusion admiral ting stated that intended to put to sea same afternoon desired captain to make preparation accordingly decision be received with symptom of delight by everybody except prince hsi who argued long forcibly for delay of day at least giving a reason that flagship be not in opinion quite ready for sea on hearing statement admiral looked very keenly at subordinate asked to explain ship unreadiness while rest of captain looked astonishment be too polite to put into word ensuing explanation be somewhat unintelligible to frobisher notwithstanding valiant effort of interpreter gathered that admiral considered prince hsi reason a quite inadequate concluded by informing prince without circumlocution a admiral be quite a capable a captain of judging whether ship be fit for sea not that a in opinion be perfectly ready to sea must go rest of squadron with a have already decided there be therefore nothing left for highness to obey spoilt scion of royalty showed very plainly by bearing that be considerably upset by admiral adherence to decision admiral ting then signified in courteous fashion that deliberation be at end dismissed of captain with word two of hope encouragement being particularly gracious to three briton added for benefit of that be intention to hoist signal to proceed to sea a soon a possible after skipper have regained own ship frobisher noticed that sooner be word out of ting mouth than prince hsi murmured low voiced excuse disappeared hastily from cabin a though have suddenly recollected something of importance paid little attention to fact at moment being too fully occupied with own thought circumstance be recalled to memory during short journey between ting yuen own ship gig have just passed under stern gallery of flagship at few yard distance when one of chinese seaman who be pulling boat uttered exclamation covered eye for few second with hand a though something have blown into frobisher instructed interpreter to enquire what be matter be told that there must be evil spirit in boat for while have be keeping eye on ting yuen blaze of light brighter than sun have flashed into nearly blinding englishman must see for when fellow removed hand that be still dazzled puzzled to know what have happened for sky be absolutely clear with possibility of light being attributable to flash of lightning frobisher handed yoke line to interpreter turned round in sternsheets looking to see where must have originated few second later saw what be from one of cabin port in flagship stern situated just below gallery in position where captain quarter must almost certainly be placed there came quick flash of brilliant light lasting instant extraordinarily dazzling in intensity englishman at once recognised what be happening somebody be able to form pretty accurate guess who be using hand glass shaving mirror a heliograph evidently either trying to attract attention of someone on shore sending message did not much signify for frobisher be easily able to pick out spot on shore where light impinged be window in small whitewashed house standing by in large garden situated about way up hill that message signal be expected be soon proved to frobisher when saw through telescope man hurriedly dash out of house make way through garden toward beach where several boat must be made out drawn up on sand by time however gig have reached chih yuen frobisher be unable to spend more time watching strange game seemed to be going on being fully occupied a soon a got on board in giving order to officer to prepare ship for proceeding to sea signal for a ting have said be now flying from signal yard of ting yuen just a anchor be in process of being catted however chanced to glance again in direction of flagship saw lying right under stern concealed from view of on deck by stern gallery small boat in small boat be man to whom signal have be heliographed be evidently talking to somebody through open port of captain cabin few second later frobisher saw hand appear through same port holding something white that looked suspiciously like letter packet man in boat at once seized thrust into bosom then after hasty glance round seated pulled slowly back again toward shore with exaggerated air of nonchalance frobisher must not avoid wondering who be man have be so anxious to send message ashore also what nature of message might be that sender be so intensely eager to dispatch at very last moment must certainly be important one to render advisable to send for special bearer to take instead of letting go ashore in usual way by boat in admiral must send off last official dispatch notifying departure to navy council a matter of fact frobisher must hardly be said to wonder very much about point for if have be put to felt almost certain that must have named sender content of message also thought that without very great effort might be able to name man for whom message be intended what did wonder at be audacity of man who dared to undertake so dangerous business in full view of fleet also whether anybody besides have witnessed transaction perhaps mysterious sender have reckoned on everyone else being too busy to notice occurrence voice just beside frobisher at moment testified to fact that at least one other person in fleet have eye wherewith to see voice be drake said be suppose saw that sir from tone in word be spoken frobisher knew that own suspicion be shared frobisher glanced round ay saw replied with set teeth there be noose waiting for certain acquaintance of ours drake sooner be placed round neck hauled taut better will be for china further conversation be out of question for at moment there came boom of gun followed by string of flag fluttering up to signal yard of ting yuen interpreted signified that flagship anchor be up that be under way then came signal ordering ship to proceed to sea in double column of line ahead starboard line being led by flagship port line by other battleship chen yuen gradually two battleship gathered way proceeded to head down river abreast of other then came own ship chih yuen in starboard division with shan si a companion yen fu khu ling came next then yung chau tung yen while old hai yen san chau ended line fleet thus being composed often vessel two of two last named be practically useless for fighting line be to be employed a tender dispatch vessel a occasion might require seven torpedo boat have taken departure from anchorage while war council on flagship be in progress have be sent on ahead to mouth of river a scout be to run distance of twenty mile out to sea to ascertain whether there be of enemy ship in offing then to return with report to entrance of pei ho where battle fleet must await arrival under gun of taku fort torpedo boat on return from scouting expedition reported sea clear of enemy war ship fleet immediately proceeded on way to wei hai wei be reached following afternoon here thing be in state of almost hopeless confusion troop waiting to be embarked be scattered over neighbourhood foraging countryside for provision on own account of baggage have be put aboard transport must not be found at officer must not find troop men did not know own officer when saw so be not until fleet arrived navy men began to take thing in hand that order began to be evolved out of chaos matter to straighten out gradually at length however last man last horse last rifle be safely got aboard transport of there be le than ten fleet with convoy got under way for port of wi ju at mouth of yalu where troop be to be disembarked distance from wei hai wei to wi ju be little under two hundred mile voyage be completed without mishap in about twenty hour whole fleet coming to anchor in roadstead just a first shade of evening be falling there being facility at port for working during night task of disembarkation be deferred until following morning soldier on board troop ship seized opportunity to indulge in sing song to while away evening last entertainment of kind that many of be ever to take part in transport be of course anchored nearest shore with war ship outside of for protection in case of sudden raid by japanese fleet while outside of mile distant seven torpedo boat steamed constantly to fro acting part of patrol boat keeping sharp look out seaward for chinese must have be caught in trap have enemy appeared while be lying at anchor in roadstead unable to manoeuvre night came down a black a inside of wolf mouth air be thick heavy difficult to breathe surcharged with electricity to drake intimately acquainted a be with sea seemed that typhoon be more than probably brewing there be sense of discomfort uneasiness in atmosphere communicated to man beast for in stillness of night in pause in singing uproar horse in stall on board transport must be heard whinnying neighing a though not altogether at ease little ball of electricity came went on yard at masthead like mysterious signal presenting very weird uncanny effect of superstitious chinese sailor who have have no previous experience of saint elmo fire burnt joss stick twisted prayer wheel in hope of scaring away evil spirit averred be hovering round ship from moment of joining chih yuen frobisher have be working early late to get ship into proper fighting trim being thoroughly tired out by time that fleet anchored have turned in for few hour well earned repose seemed however to have be asleep only few short minute instead of four five hour when be aroused by gentle persistent knocking on door in moment be broad awake out of bunk across to door being too cautious in face of stealthy character of summons to call question a to who be there opening cabin door found drake who with worried mysterious air proffered request that captain must come up on deck for few minute if convenient why what be matter drake asked frobisher be there sign of storm bursting well be reply certainly doe not look too healthy be not on account have disturbed believe there be hanky panky work going on sir be why want to come on deck see for will be up in minute replied captain in le than time specified have pulled on trouser flung greatcoat over shoulder be standing by drake side at taffrail now what be business said be got something to do with prince chap be dutchman be drake reply be leaning over rail here little while ago thinking of nothing in particular for lieutenant sing be on duty until midnight when saw light appear suddenly away in direction pointing there be nothing out of way in will say light be red one what be more somebody be holding in hand be waving about lantern to mind be signal for after waving for few minute man who held began to open close slide rapidly a though sending message by flash light know morse code of flash telegraphy for aught know may not have be morse certainly be signal when tell that came from ting yuen from same cabin so far a can judge a helio message be sent from at tien tsin will see why thought best to call be quite right drake replied captain there be something very queer about business at tien tsin from what say must seem that same man be playing same trick here only wish must catch at dirty work seems strange to that nobody on board flagship have got inkling of well will say unknown man game perhaps be that do suspect dare not speak did by chance catch sight of answering light of sort be just coming to replied drake did when first set of signal be finished red light disappeared away in offing red light showed that be what really made come down rouse perhaps may have come from own torpedo boat suggested frobisher replied drake came from spot beyond there be sir look there there be light again on ting yuen now watch for light from seaward in reply frobisher did not do so however without even answering darted forward gave few low voiced order then came back to drake immediately afterwards must be heard sound of bare footed seaman running about carrying out duty then man stepped up to captain announced that be ready very well wait for signal be be reply turned eye seaward watching for answering flash second later came a winked out captain placed whistle in mouth blew three short call in instant chih yuen great search light blazed out to astonishment of drake sundry other folk began to sweep slowly steadily back forth across horizon light on ting yuen vanished instantly frobisher noticed one to seaward went out immediately afterward vessel from have be shown must not put out of sight so easily beam of search light hesitated moment then settled unwaveringly upon little vessel about five mile away circled dodged to purpose must not escape that unblinking ray followed relentless a fate revealing detail on board a distinctly a though be under light of day that be destroyer be at once apparent there must be mistaking long low clean cut black hull with four squat funnel short signal mast must there be doubt a to nationality chinese be not china possessing boat of description since be lurking in particular spot under cover of night there be only one thing must possibly be japanese scout locality of chinese fleet have be discovered thanks to traitor in midst destroyer must now return to parent fleet with report unless chinese be very careful must be caught in roadstead like rat in trap frobisher watched flying shape of destroyer undecided whether not to try shot from heavy gun soon realised that by time that gun must be loaded trained chance of making hit must be small indeed therefore ordered search light to be kept going in case other similar craft must be lurking in offing after few word to drake went below dressed fully then late a be ordered gig have pulled across with speed to ting yuen smiled grimly a pictured admiral ting face when must hear what be about to tell chapter eighteen battle of yalu directly got on board flagship frobisher through interpreter sent message to admiral asking whether must see captain of chih yuen immediately upon urgent business alone for englishman have mind to have interview interrupted by presence of prince hsi happened that individual must be kept in ignorance of fact that treachery be so strongly suspected a to be almost certainty otherwise must be on guard be intention if admiral ting agreed to leave man in ignorance of suspicion have aroused until must grow careless over bold then to pounce suddenly upon catch red handed englishman knew that unless man be actually caught in act so that there must be possible doubt a to treachery possessed sufficient money influence to worm out of almost predicament however strong appearance might be against fortunately admiral be still awake what be more to point be alone immediately sent back word by messenger that if captain frobisher must kindly step down into cabin must grant interview with pleasure frobisher descended to admiral private quarter dispensing with service of interpreter since ting spoke english thereby ensuring that conversation must be strictly private then proceeded to give a succinct account a possible of occurrence have just happened not hesitating to express opinion that prince hsi be playing role of traitor admiral ting be much alarmed at hearing that japanese destroyer have be detected prowling about in offing did not express surprise when frobisher mentioned suspicion about prince indeed admitted that although have nothing definite to go upon have for time past be extremely doubtful a to hsi loyalty to country man be so highly connected however have so much influence at chinese court that effort that ting have made to get transferred have be unsuccessful have only succeeded in making of highness bitter enemy what reason fellow must have for wishing to betray country be impossible to say ting must only surmise that must have lost great deal of money at play of be inordinately fond be looking to japan to fill coffer again in return for service rendered ting averred that must do must be to have prince watched closely if be actually detected in act of attempting treachery admiral vowed that must be punished happen what might a there must be no longer doubt that japanese fleet be in neighbourhood if not near at moment very soon must be when destroyer have delivered report have become necessary to act at once there be facility for disembarkation at night a have already be mentioned under new circumstance be imperative that troop must be landed immediately so that fleet might be free to go out fight without being obliged to leave ship behind to cover landing ting therefore ordered gun to be fired signal to be made for captain to come aboard announced that disembarkation be to take place at once process to be facilitated a much a possible by various ship search light must give enough illumination to prevent accident consequently about midnight work commenced much to annoyance of soldier who did not of course know reason have be looking forward to comfortable night on board boat belonging to fleet a well a pontoon raft carried on board transport for purpose be called into requisition very soon long procession of craft of shape size be seen plying to fro between transport shore guided by powerful ray of search light horse be simply slung by mean of broad strap to end of whip hoisted out of ship swung overboard strap being released a soon a be in water when swam ashore of own accord being caught upon arrival by soldier who have already landed picketed so rapidly methodically be work carried out due principally must be acknowledged to effort of british officer belonging to navy ship that when daylight broke about four o'clock disembarkation be already half completed meanwhile ting have issued order for full head of steam to be kept up on board ship transport a well a man of war for intended to put to sea instant that last man be ashore have desire to be caught where be by japanese fleet especially since must then be seriously hampered in movement by helpless unarmed transport anxious eye be often turned seaward to where torpedo boat be still carrying out patrol duty in offing more than one brave man heaved sigh of relief a hour after hour passed without one of steaming in at full speed to give notice that enemy be in sight at length about ten o'clock in morning last horse have swum ashore last boatload of soldier be on way raft pontoon be hoisted in secured boat a returned be run up swung inboard various captain hied to bridge of respective ship from steam pipe of white feather of steam be escaping at midday just twelve hour after frobisher midnight visit to admiral signal for departure floated up to yard of ting yuen fleet steamed slowly majestically out of roadstead in two column with transport well away to starboard on opposite side from enemy might be expected to appear torpedo boat spread out fan wise carrying out office a scout course be shaped for wei hai wei under gun of transport must be safe from capture have be steaming for about five hour have covered little more than quarter of distance to wei hai wei when puff of smoke burst out on board one of torpedo boat one farthest away to port toward north east followed by sharp ringing sound of one of twelve pound quick firers be signal agreed upon must enemy heave in sight fact that little craft have already turned be steaming at full speed toward flagship gave sufficient proof that long expected moment have at last arrived in fact by time torpedo boat reached ting yuen be possible to make out fewer than thirteen coil of smoke away on eastern horizon showing that enemy fleet be arriving in force steaming in line abreast that outnumbered chinese squadron by three ship thus a two of latter be not fit to take place in fighting line ratio be about one half to one in favour of japanese so far a number be concerned judging from number nearly if not whole of japanese fleet be present ting immediately ordered transport to break away make for wei hai wei at full speed men of war undertaking duty of preventing of enemy getting past going in pursuit in unlikely contingency since japanese admiral must need ship if be to gain victory over china transport consequently quickened pace being fast steamer gradually began to draw away from slower more unwieldy battle squadron here may be stated that be not pursued arrived safely at wei hai wei without mishap ting now hoisted signal to clear for action scene of bustle orderly confusion at once ensued boat belonging to squadron be hoisted out lowered san chau went round collecting having done took in tow steamed slowly away to westward so a to be out of way when hostile fleet presently came to grip stanchion be taken down stowed away magazine be opened ammunition placed in hoist gun loaded fire hose connected laid along deck be thoroughly drenched to lessen possibility of fire bucket of fresh water for use of thirsty wounded men be placed in convenient position round deck lastly lighter loose furnishing in cabin ward room gun room be taken down put out of way to avoid being smashed through terrific vibration when great gun began to fire fire control officer made way with range finding instrument into fire control top captain went to conning tower word be sent below to engine room staff warning of what be coming so that steam might never be lacking finally shell proof grating be slid over engine room hatch watertight door be closed in grim silence chinese fleet steamed ahead waiting for word must start mighty gun roaring great armour piercing shell hurtling through air on errand of destruction by time preparation be complete japanese fleet have approached closely enough to allow of various unit being easily distinguished through telescope from level of deck frobisher observed that largest ship be placed at starboard extremity of long line smallest weakest being at other end size of cruiser nearest chinese fleet estimated at about nine thousand ton then came two of about seven thousand then two more of six thousand so then three of four thousand next five small cruiser gunboat ranging from one thousand to two thousand ton besides there be four destroyer of about three hundred fifty ton guessed that fighting speed of fleet must be about twelve thirteen knot against chinese ten vast advantage enabling possessor practically to choose own time position for fighting comparing two fleet frobisher came to conclusion that despite preponderance possessed by china in two powerful battleship japan be stronger since possessed more ship while several of smaller cruiser be larger than china largest when to be added fact of extra three knot speed began to look a though china must find work cut out to come off victor if there be one thing more certain than be that before beginning of battle there be not single officer among whole chinese fleet who did not feel convinced that china be going to win after event proved that have issue lain in hand alone stout heart must have forced victory notwithstanding disparity between two fleet japanese fleet have now approached to within about six mile gun layer be beginning to fidget to wonder when action be to commence then signal broke out on board chinese flagship two column swung grandly to starboard in wide sweep until bow pointed full at japanese ship suddenly bugle shrilled forth challenging order commence firing with crash made very air vibrate great gun on board two battleship opened fire sending ranging shot so truly that announcement from fire control station of range correct seemed superfluous fire have be opened with gun laid to eight thousand yard four heavy armour piercing shell have found billet historic battle of yalu have commenced be japanese behindhand in accepting challenge with what appeared to be almost lightning speed japanese admiral nozu changed formation from column in line abreast to column of division steaming in echelon starboard division being led to starboard by cruiser yoshino of nine thousand ton division to port being led by fuji of about same measurement two being most powerful ship possessed by japanese particular formation enabled japanese to direct whole of fire against chinese ship since two division of fleet be to pas on inside of chinese double column while double chinese column must prevent ship in port line from firing to port in starboard line from firing to starboard likewise inner line of of japanese division sheltered outer line from fire of chinese port starboard column respectively amounted in plain language to giving japanese four time volume of gunfire that chinese must bring to bear be masterly stroke of genius on part of nozu admiral ting did not comprehend until be too late to remedy matter found hopelessly enveloped in net a yet however action have only commenced through observation slit in wall of chih yuen conning tower frobisher saw a japanese fleet completed evolution several dazzling flash of flame dart out from turret of yoshino fuji simultaneously appeared a though entire japanese fleet have fired at same moment so fierce so continuous be flash of discharge felt ship reel stagger a le than five heavy shell fortunately not armour piercers struck almost simultaneously heard shriek cry of men in mortal agony a deadly flying fragment scattered like shrapnel about deck must never do said frobisher to if kind of thing continued ship must be put out of action before have opportunity of giving back a good a received so without waiting for admiral signal for general action pressed one of electric button close to hand in wall of conning tower two in chih yuen forward barbette roared out hoarse defiance dropping shell full upon yoshino after turret where burst with explosion like of small powder magazine without doing much damage have fallen under muzzle of gun of weapon must have be heard from again although turret appeared uninjured frobisher must have be quite satisfied with execution wrought if must have looked inside gun crew within while in act of serving weapon have of become aware that after end of turret have suddenly glowed red hot for moment after none of knew what have happened for have be killed a by lightning stroke by terrific concussion of two shell striking together have man be foolish enough to place hand on spot even five minute afterward must have left skin behind so intense be heat generated by impact frobisher however must not know sent word to lieutenant in charge of barbette to plant shell if possible on near gun of enemy be already in action leaving after gun until later presently have satisfaction of seeing one shell after crash down on very spot where hakodate single gun protruded from turret when flash of explosion yellow fume of bursting charge have cleared away there became visible black ragged hole where gun port have be gun blown from mounting be pointing muzzle upward to sky useless for rest of action fleet have now broken formation to large extent fight have resolved more le into series of individual action between ship ship chinese flagship be close alongside fuji giving most unmerciful hammering with eighty ton monster gun sent high explosive shell crashing through side a through match boarding subsequently bursting inside between deck carrying death horrible mutilation in train plucky chen yuen gallant british captain who with frobisher most distinguished that day have be laid in between already severely punished yoshino celebrated matsushima so far have not received single injury although have entirely disabled very nearly sunk little chinese unarmoured hai yen latter with only one boiler available very low pressure of steam in most of gun disabled captain killed officer wounded must do more when chen yuen came up drew matsushima fire upon quartermaster one of few surviving petty officer steered slowly painfully like crippled animal out of press when unpursued being too small fry to trouble about turned bow in direction of wei hai wei hobbled into port twenty hour later dismal forerunner of shattered broken remnant be so soon to follow frobisher knowing strength of own ship with strongly reinforced far protruding ram determined to try whether must not do more wholesale execution with than with gun alone for must already see that superior number of japanese ship consequent heavier weight of metal be beginning to tell severely upon chinese fleet therefore singled out a prey surawa one of smaller protected cruiser determining to experiment upon before charging blindly into one of heavily armoured ship for loss of chih yuen indeed of more of chinese ship at juncture must be fatal to hope of gaining victory accordingly telegraphed down to engine room for full steam passed word prepare to ram then sweeping round in circle caused cruiser to heel at considerable angle set going at full speed in direction of intended victim firing fore barbette machine gun a went so a to demoralise crew if possible prevent from escaping blow perfect hurricane of lead steel descended on chih yuen deck side a ship of japanese squadron awoke to what be intended in few second fore deck be swept bare a though by gigantic plane cruiser be well into stride a long a shot penetrated to boiler be bound to carry out design captain of surawa rang frenziedly for full steam ahead although japanese craft certainly did gather more way menacing stem of chih yuen followed relentless a fate then suddenly surawa plumped into stern of nagasaki cutting down to water line rebounded under impact to find bow of chinese ship on point of cutting into chih yuen men flung to deck in preparation for shock many of surawa crew leaped overboard to avoid second later came chih yuen sank iron ram into side of smaller craft a irresistibly a knife sink into butter although shock be terrific chinaman took harm surawa on contrary heeled over until sea lapped over edge of deck mast snapped like matchwood funnel guy broke letting smoke stack topple into sea full speed astern roared frobisher down speaking tube forgetting that order be in english engineer understood perhaps command be expected slowly chih yuen destroying ram withdrew from gash in other cruiser side in le than minute so deadly be wound surawa rolled heavily to port settled sluggishly on even keel once more then suddenly heeled over again capsized boiler exploding a did so down went carrying with over three hundred of japan bravest heart frobisher emboldened by success looked round for more prey nagasaki wounded to death by sunken sister be slowly settling down must be left have why not try for bigger game why not try for flagship yoshino if chih yuen ram crumpled well must surely destroy yoshino a well sacrifice must be worth gain by jove must try name of captain frobisher must be on men lip that day must know reason why hideous wreck above gun deck with funnel pierced mast tottering to fall gun dismounted plank stained red with life blood of many gallant chinaman chih yuen quickly gathered sternway piling water up in white foaming mass under round counter while vengeful gun of japanese squadron never ceased to thunder hatred of destroyer of two of ship frobisher be obliged to relinquish command to drake for few minute while surgeon bound up bad scalp wound be blinding with blood having be received from fragment of flying shell have managed to penetrate through observation slit of conning tower then quite by accident cruiser added success to roll of destruction that day enemy destroyer have for time past be hovering round in hope of getting home torpedo must send chinese ship to bottom one of have considered opportunity favourable when chih yuen be entangled in wreck of surawa have stolen up astern have come to standstill few hundred yard away from cruiser intending to send whitehead into frobisher stern air chamber proved to have be leaking became necessary to pump more air in before torpedo must be discharged men be so busy attending to that did not observe chih yuen gathering sternway until be too late only awoke to danger a cruiser stern crashed into rolled over sent headlong to bottom in wreck of bursting steam pipe spilling furnace crumpling machinery with fierce laugh frobisher pushed away surgeon who have finished seized spoke of steering wheel spun over until cruiser bow headed for yoshino then rang for full speed ahead pause between checking of chih yuen sternway gathering speed ahead must have be fatal have not be for drake of stinging little wasp destroyer have dashed past at full speed although severely punished by cruiser machine gun have managed to discharge torpedo full at side cruiser be helpless unable to move until engine have overcome inertia for few second looked a though nothing must save with hoarse cry drake dashed out of conning tower where be of course assisting frobisher ready to take charge if latter be killed without moment hesitation leaped overboard swimming powerfully toward rapidly approaching torpedo come back madman shouted frobisher what be about drake must not must not hear kept on way regardless of hail of rifle machine gun bullet flicked water into foam round then frobisher crew saw what gallant englishman be about a deadly missile approached hissing way along surface of water drake stopped swimming awaited a swept past flung arm round smooth glistening machine arm be nearly torn from socket managed to get grip upon thing just forward of greatest diameter once have secured hold be not going to let go again then with fierce strong stroke drake began to kick out with foot pushing strongly at nose of torpedo a did so wonder of wonder menacing head gradually swung away from chih yuen side be saved be not enough for drake torpedo might hit other chinese craft so encouraged by first success did not cease effort until have turned whitehead completely round got headed direct for cluster of three japanese cruiser then struck out for chih yuen be hauled aboard just a cruiser be beginning to forge ahead once more torpedo unnoticed plugged into side of unsuspecting soya huge column of white water upon ship appeared to rise bodily announced fact that have done deadly work effectively so have for before five minute have elapsed that unit of japanese navy have also capsized disappeared while chih yuen have be piling up success for herself earning laurel for brave young skipper brow laurel with chinese government be afterwards only too proud to crown while gallant englishman who captained battleship chen yuen have be engaging fewer than five japanese ship at one same time ay beating off too matter have be going badly for rest of chinese fleet be exaggeration to say that if chinese captain have fought a stubbornly a did englishman if ammunition have not proved a did in so many instance to be faulty chinese fleet must undoubtedly in spite of superior number of enemy have utterly destroyed latter obtained full command of sea japan must have be put back twenty five year there must have be russo japanese war china instead of being a now be third rate power might have held premier position in asia a japan so splendidly skilfully doe now a so often happens greed dishonesty self seeking cowardice on part of high official nullified effort of brave seaman who unavailingly gave life for beloved country when frobisher intending to ram yoshino came to look about heart sank a saw havoc have be wrought among rest of chinese squadron ala worse by far be yet to come term echelon mean literally step zig zag formation of column such a be shown in sketch number where japanese formation have be altered from line ahead a in sketch number to echelon chapter nineteen caught at last yen fu tung yen be mere motionless hulk lying inert upon bosom of sunlit shot torn sea one with rudder propeller blown away by torpedo have sent to bottom other with engine badly broken down result of chinese official having stolen disposed of many part have have to be roughly replaced at last moment be fighting fiercely however like tough old wolf at bay although hemmed in by several japanese cruiser be a yet giving back almost a good a got game be up for though a be quite unable to manoeuvre only thickness of armour light calibre of gun of ship opposed to have prevented from going down long before frequently too frobisher noticed there be long pause between discharge of yen fu tung yen great gun a well a of others of chinese ship made shrewd guess that be occasion when faulty charcoal filled cartridge failed to explode shan si with captain james in command be practically only entirely undamaged ship still possessed by chinese not because have not be in thickest of fight for have just through one of curious chance of warfare be constantly occurring be doing sovereign service rushing here there everywhere planting shell coolly accurately sweeping japanese deck with rifle machine gun fire many be attempt made by enemy destroyer to torpedo put safely out of harm way thanks to captain skill personal care of everything pertaining to ship be badly hit did machinery break down at critical moment went relentless way dealing death destruction about unchecked yung chau kau ling be being engaged by hiroshima naniwa ship afterwards celebrated in russo japanese war okinoshima of be much larger than of chinese ship be getting terrible punishing although still moving more le under control be leaking steam smoke from crevice opening ominous spiral of smoke be filtering up through yung chau deck have be set on fire close to bunker by japanese shell almost in le time than take to write be mass of roaring spouting flame for be old blazed like volcano men such of a must reach deck jumped overboard be hauled by rope up side of ship happened to be nearest for japanese like opponent have discarded boat pontoon before going into action chen yuen ting yuen be busily engaged in hammering away at biggest of enemy yoshino shikishima fuji niitaka be to relieve two battleship be being somewhat severely handled that frobisher determined to charge yoshino with ship signalling once more for full steam firing a went according to former tactic drove chih yuen at utmost speed toward japanese flagship by time have lost one of military mast forward funnel from whose torn base smoke flame be pouring voluminously wrapping conning tower round a though with black mantle utterly preventing skipper from seeing what be going on poor man be obliged to rely entirely upon discretion of gunnery lieutenant in forward turret that individual be doing duty well be proved by frequency with gun boomed out sending shell solid shot spattering against heavily armoured side of chinese battleship where splintered burst cracking starring thick steel very seldom penetrating to vitals close though range be a chih yuen clove way through water one of japanese destroyer discharged torpedo at missed by inch only be not wasted however for struck disabled yen fu heeled over a though pressed by gigantic hand few minute later went down taking crew with hiroshima also tried to ram in turn leaving stricken kau ling for purpose also be too late naniwa shikishima saw chih yuen approaching like messenger of death be backed away from opponent fuji turned gun on approaching vessel yoshino captain blinded by smoke from wrecked funnel did not see what be coming until be too late moment later chinese ship crashed into stern unfortunately striking glancing blow instead of direct one a frobisher have intended be severe enough however to make yoshino shiver from stem to stern from truck to keelson a chih yuen drove past frobisher saw that have sliced great gash in port quarter nearly down to water line dismounted gun in after turret attempt have not entirely succeeded have done great deal of damage with have to be content then a frobisher circled ship round to come into action again saw something that made gasp with astonishment apprehension there be fight of sort going on upon deck of chinese flagship what on earth must mean have not be close enough to of enemy ship to enable to board moreover be chinese sailor not japanese who be fighting what must possibly have happened seaman on board be entirely devoted to admiral if mutiny have arisen must be through machination of other person traitor who have seized opportunity to by jove have old suspicion came thronging into mind in instant in same instant believed must make very good guess at what have occurred of course be that scoundrel prince hsi who be at bottom of mischief frobisher seemed to know instinctively also recollected numerous occasion on highness have acted in extremely suspicious manner to say least did not take long to guess that be now beholding consummation of plot up to hsi have be leading for considerable time past what have happened to admiral ting wondered that prince hsi must have matter in own hand frobisher knew that so long a gallant admiral be alive conscious must never permit command to be taken from thus heart fell for feared that traitor to attain detestable end must first have killed brave old man well frobisher vowed to traitor must not succeed in scheme whatever might be even though have to board ting yuen slay prince hsi with own hand to avenge death of admiral then saw what be that traitor prince intended commotion on deck of flagship have ceased mutineer having slain driven overboard who opposed while frobisher ship be still distance away saw chinese flag flutter down from ting yuen peak to be immediately replaced by japanese naval ensign ship swung round in direction of enemy squadron began to forge ahead toward prince hsi having evidently determined to turn gun against own countryman a japanese ensign fluttered aloft there fell sudden silence over fleet a though by mutual consent gun be hushed for few moment hoarse stern menacing above strange stillness rose roar of execration from throat of chinese a at last realised meaning of extraordinary scene have just taken place aboard flagship defiantly captain trained gun on nearest chinese ship fired whether gunner must not bring to actual point of firing on country flag whether be due to excitement of moment shot missed shout of derision went up from chinese squadron captain frobisher knew that curse shout of execration must not bring back ting yuen if be to be saved to chinese navy must not be allowed to gain shelter of japanese main body if reached that must be lost for ever day must be lost beyond hope of redemption for chinese to lose one powerful battleship to find suddenly arrayed against for be what must of course amount to must so weaken already enfeebled chinese strength that success must be out of question englishman determined that come what might must prevent traitor prince from carrying out foul intention shouted few brief command to drake who vanished like puff of smoke from conning tower issued order to quartermaster at wheel rang to engine room two short call signified that required power engine must develop for sudden emergency then looked to see that sword be loose in scabbard revolver fully charged waited for drake to reappear while chih yuen bounding forward under full power of engine turned nose toward stern of ting yuen kept fixed there relentless a fate by time cannonade have again become general throughout fleet ringing high above crashing roar of gun must be heard wild cheering of chinaman a realised gallant exploit that english captain be about to attempt prince hsi realised also put on full steam to escape be few minute too late before unwieldy battleship must get into stride more nimble cruiser must be upon knowing that must not hope to reach safety before be overtaken prince determined to wait fight matter out with englishman whom have already learnt to hate so intensely therefore reversed engine trained available gun upon advancing chih ' yuen opened fire cruiser reeled quivered a hurricane of shot shell struck received injury to vital part be checked not moment in headlong course frobisher have given order that fire be to be reserved until gave word now watched for moment a tiger watch prey few second later time arrived frobisher pressed button let loose storm of death upon flagship rang off engine handed over command to drake who have just reappeared then left conning tower on port side of deck behind steel citadel found that drake have already drawn up fifty volunteer have called for fully armed ready to follow captain wherever might choose to lead second later there arose from ting yuen chorus of yell of astonishment fury a chih yuen instead of lying off fighting with gun a prince hsi have expected ground side against of flagship came to standstill right alongside frobisher shouted word of command to expectant sailor led round citadel across cruiser deck up on to of battleship before ting yuen men realised what be happening most of latter have thrown off cutlass better to handle gun be on unpreparedness that frobisher relied when led fifty boarder to attack like whirlwind swept down upon rebel seaman who stood petrified with alarm astonishment beside now useless gun broad bladed cutlass rose fell for few second to accompaniment of shriek yell for mercy frobisher with small force must not afford to give quarter until be certain that there must be no more resistance much a detested butchery simply dared not stay hand forward upward men cut way encountered more more opposition minute a mutineer found time to recover wit secure weapon men must take denial blade now dyed deep red swept through smoky air revolver crackled blazed merrily a englishman led forward presently after stern stubborn five minute fighting rebel broke fled below overboard anywhere to escape avenging sword of outraged countryman so far frobisher have seen nothing of prince hsi moment mutineer be broken have released remnant of loyal chinese sailor went in search of arch traitor having first headed ship back toward chinese squadron prince be not in conning tower a frobisher discovered when went there with one of own helmsman to send necessary order to engine room be in own cabin be next most likely place to look for diligently a frobisher searched man be not to be found appeared to have vanished completely perhaps frobisher decided traitor have seen that shameful plot have failed have thrown overboard to avoid consequence of act that however did not seem quite like hsi be more likely to be up to deeper villainy still a thought occurred to chih yuen captain blood ran cold for sixth sense instinct seemed to warn what hsi be about with nerve tingling frobisher darted below began to search for magazine for be thither guessed traitor have betaken be indeed fortunate that found just where have expected to be door of magazine be open man be to be seen inside with back to entrance engaged upon diabolical work by aid of carefully shaded lantern few second frobisher must have be too late ship must have be blown into air with crew for prince be even then applying light to end of fuse have already cut other extremity of be concealed from view frobisher repressed shiver of horror with one bound flung upon traitor dropping sword revolver a did so be case for use of bare hand alone man to man discharge of pistol might only complete hsi work for frobisher did not feel that must cut man down from behind in cold blood richly a deserved a man must undoubtedly have done have position be reversed gripped sacred person of prince round body endeavoured to hurl to floor so stun hsi be powerful man although taken at disadvantage managed to twist so that frobisher superior strength expended in vain then with mighty effort wrenched one arm free seized englishman by throat sinking in finger with fury testified too plainly to intensity of hatred do what might frobisher must not wrench traitor finger away although with left hand managed to prevent hsi from drawing knife suspended from belt knew that unless must release from that bulldog grip must very soon lose consciousness for already eye be beginning to protrude dim light of magazine seemed full of flashing star blazing firework blood drummed horribly in ear besides good heaven there be that deadly spark hissing sputtering way along fuse unless be quenched within minute ting yuen crew must be flying skyward cloud of splintered steel dismembered human body last thought gave frobisher back strength for moment with herculean effort wrenched throat from hsi grip then recovering quickly before chinaman have knife more than way out of sheath drew back arm struck hsi mighty blow full on point of chin prince neck clicked like breaking stick be dashed senseless against steel wall of magazine falling in tumbled heap upon floor without looking to see whether man be unconscious not frobisher dashed at fuse trampled fiercely underfoot until smouldering spark be entirely extinguished then with sob of relief withdrew other end from pile of explosive tossed out of door then lifted hsi on shoulder carried out of magazine closing door after took to own cabin where deposited senseless body in bunk afterwards securing prince wrist ankle firmly with length of rope procured from one of men done locked door put key in pocket went in search of admiral whom fully expected to find dead at same moment heard ting yuen gun again opening overhead a temporary commander brought into action once more smiled grimly a thought that if hsi have have way shell from very weapon must at minute have be crashing way through chinese hull instead of being directed a be against japanese ship frobisher found admiral ting lying on floor of cabin hand lashed behind senseless from severe cutlas sword cut across forehead have evidently be cut down while in conning tower have be brought to cabin there secured flung down for englishman have noticed trail of bloodstain on deck on way to ting quarter in very short time have cut old gentleman adrift after few drop of brandy have be forced down throat ting quickly revived gave frobisher account of what have occurred be short to point hsi have entered conning tower with drawn sword in hand before admiral must open mouth prince have ruthlessly cut down after that admiral knew more until awoke to find frobisher pouring spirit water down throat be profuse in thanks to young englishman when have learned from latter have happened promised that must never forget brave deed by have be rescued from eternal shame dishonour then despite wound frobisher roughly bandaged plucky old fellow insisted upon going on deck again taking charge when two men regained open what sight met horrified eye kau ling although dismantled have be fighting bravely when frobisher led boarder away have disappeared tung yen engine of have broken down have be surrounded by five japanese ship be even then sinking yung chau have taken fire early in fight be now abandoned charred wreck even gallant shan si chen yuen have done great deed ever since beginning be now terribly damaged own ship short distance away under drake able seamanship be still giving splendid account of herself even be experienced eye must tell be very badly mauled in short of ten ship china have possessed that morning four be destroyed one have crept away too seriously damaged to remain in action one have gone a convoy to transport remaining four be badly damaged a for torpedo boat japanese destroyer smaller cruiser have made short work of of seven three be sunk one have be captured two have fled toward wei hai wei hotly pursued by big japanese destroyer only one remained with remnant of chinese fleet japanese have lost only three small cruiser destroyer so that fleet be even now almost a numerous a china have be at beginning of battle true yoshino fuji be little better than wreck other ship have one received very severe drubbing be still afloat more le under control while undamaged gun now outnumbered of chinese by about six to one odds be too heavy to keep on fighting with four remaining ship against still powerful japanese fleet must be simply throwing four ship away to purpose shedding china best blood without avail if two battleship two cruiser must still be retained for china must live to fight day for with addition of southern squadron still intact undamaged must once more make up powerful fleet if be lost captured now must be end of possibly end of china also ting realised at glance with bitter groan ordered signal to retire to be hoisted enemy to be held at bay if possible while evolution be being carried out a be manifestly impossible for frobisher to rejoin own ship owing to lack of boat took charge a captain of ting yuen in place of traitor prince confined below in company with other battleship chen yuen endeavoured to beat off japanese craft be manoeuvring to surround two remaining chinese cruiser so bold front rather rear did four ship present that japanese before long relinquished pursuit not caring in view of success already obtained to risk losing more of already sadly battered ship by exposing to now concentrated fire of big chinese ship eighty ton gun projectile from have already done so much damage accordingly drew off gave up half hearted chase employing short time still remaining before darkness fell in effecting very necessary repair to ship while broken remnant of china northern squadron pursued halting way toward wei hai wei small torpedo boat still remaining to acting a scout in advance on look out for japanese destroyer earlier in day have left action in pursuit of couple of damaged chinese torpedo boat in late twilight fell in with destroyer on return from unsuccessful pursuit two small craft having succeeded in effecting escape have evidently anticipated complete victory for own side seeing light in distance have made for thinking that by time ship must be in japanese hand did not discover mistake until be under chinese gun then attempted to cut run be too late there be rattle of machine gun fire drove men from deck torpedo tube few second later one of chen yuen big gun plumped shell right into crumpling up like cardboard sending to bottom within few second very few of men be rescued made prisoner by chinese torpedo boat majority dead disabled from effect of bursting shell went to feed shark early following morning just after daybreak four ship overtook san chau transport fleet circumstance rejoiced admiral ting exceedingly a have be extremely anxious lest might perhaps have fallen in with prowling japanese cruiser be snapped up then war ship transport kept company until reached wei hai wei where found little hat yen recently arrived in sinking condition so that have be necessary to beach immediately to save from sinking at anchor admiral ting lost time in docking such of ship a there be room for others be run alongside wharf to have gun replaced upper work repaired after must one by one go into dock a repaired sister came out admiral then dispatched to tien tsin san chau only undamaged war ship with account of battle while torpedo boat after few minor repair be dispatched south with similar message to admiral wong lih suggesting that must bring up southern fleet so that together united squadron might seek japanese fleet once more give battle in attempt to recover mastery of sea be of paramount importance to china chapter twenty on special service for first few day after return of fleet to wei hai wei everybody be very fully employed including even admiral who despite deep painful wound insisted on being about dockyard head tied up in bandage superintending refitting of shattered ship nothing be mentioned with regard to prince hsi that arch villain have not even be seen frobisher supposed be ting intention to send a soon a must spare escort to tien tsin to stand trial procedure englishman be inclined to think very likely to end in farce since once among circle of rich powerful relative acquaintance man be wily cunning enough to be able to extricate even out of such predicament a in be now plunged frobisher have however forgotten certain promise ting have made at wi ju at mouth of yalu when prince hsi have be so very nearly discovered in communication with one of enemy destroyer promise that if actually caught prince red handed so that there must be possible doubt about matter not influence powerful relation in china must save from fate must so richly deserve there must be little doubt that be due to signal sent that night by prince to destroyer that japanese have learned strength of chinese squadron destination have thus be enabled to come up in full force a have done practically annihilate northern squadron be not first second time hsi have played traitor although until now there have be no actual proof of treachery be strongly suspected for instance of having brought about disaster to transport kowshing when have be sunk by japanese cruiser naniwa with over thousand chinese troop on board admiral ting have not allowed oath to slip memory old fellow gentle kindly courteous though be to friend must be very vindictive when came to dealing with evil doer especially criminal of hardened remorseless type prince hsi have proved to be be only biding time a event be very soon to prove one evening frobisher received polite message from admiral that presence must be required on board flagship at ten o'clock on following morning so did other captain first lieutenant consequently at hour named captain foster james frobisher quen lung of chen yuen shan si chih ' yuen yen respectively together with first officer found assembled in admiral ting cabin on board flagship of attired in full dress uniform wearing side arm admiral be also present dressed in fullest of full dress wearing various chinese order decoration while cabin door be guarded on side by chinese sailor with drawn cutlas room have be cleared of most of usual furnishing plain long narrow oak table have be placed in centre with chair sufficient to accommodate little party of officer assembled at short distance from table there be placed chair standing by use of be to be discovered presently a soon a last officer have arrived admiral ting explained that be met together to sit in judgment on person of prince hsi member of royal house of china lately captain of battleship ting said officer being accused of treachery to country mutiny desertion to enemy during time of battle accuser be for official purpose first lieutenant of ting yuen officer of high birth proved integrity who have also be struck down confined below by prince hsi mutinous sailor admiral ting intended to act a judge advocate other captain officer made up court opinion a to guilt innocence of accused to be taken after hearing of case beginning with man of lowest rank present idea of being to prevent younger le experienced officer from being influenced by decision of superior on table with point directed toward judge advocate seat lay prince hsi sword have be taken from at time of arrest officer having taken seat in order of seniority admiral ting declared court open directed prisoner to be brought in few second later door opened prince hsi entered guarded by two sailor with drawn sword wearing full dress uniform with order displayed across breast looked frobisher thought trifle pale be otherwise cool collected face wore usual expression of cold haughty resentment with entered officer belonging to admiral ting staff whose duty must be to act a prisoner friend position something similar to of counsel for defence at civilian trial having bowed to assembled court prince in view of rank be permitted to seat in chair provided trial commenced from first be quite evident that hsi believed judge must never dare to proceed to extremity for reply be always careless often flippant frobisher must see that court be very much in earnest that prince be deceiving very badly began to dawn on prisoner after time that accuser be making out very serious case against a indeed must not help doing in face of evidence possessed made desperate effort to justify conduct to excuse action though in face of fact be attempting utter impossibility at expiration of hour accusation defence have be heard prince be ordered to be removed admiral ting then summed up asked verdict of court commencing with youngest lieutenant present working up until last pronouncement rested with captain of chen yuen officer gave a conscientious conviction that prince be guilty hsi be then recalled started violently a saw that sword have be reversed that point be now toward instead of away from for knew by token that have be found guilty that now remained for be to hear sentence even yet be clear did not believe must be at severe be however most severe must be passed sentence ran that prince hsi having be found guilty by court composed of fellow officer of charge preferred against must be stripped of decoration have insignia of rank torn from uniform in presence of assembled officer crew of chinese fleet that thereafter must be shot upon quarter deck of flagship ting yuen when terrible sentence be pronounced prince hsi be observed to stagger turn deathly pale such ignominy a have never dreamed of to lose life into bargain with lightning like movement before guard must prevent hsi placed back of hand to mouth held there second then with groan of deepest agony reeled backward fell upon cabin floor when picked up be quite dead cause of death be revealed by large ring wore on third finger of left hand have be made hollow with tiny hinged cover concealed in hollow there have evidently be minute dose of extremely powerful poison from odour of almond filled cabin directly afterward frobisher recognised a being prussic acid one of quickest most deadly poison known to science with solemn courteous gesture ting dismissed officer trooped silently out of cabin leaving admiral alone with dead little later in day body be enclosed in coffin placed on board ship bound for tien tsin with direction that must be delivered to prince relation thus perished man who bad used high position to attain own base end at expense of country life of countryman nemesis have overtaken at last a sometimes doe evil doer high born prince hsi died miserably condemned criminal frobisher returned to own ship from court of justice saddened disheartened true prince have richly deserved fate china must never have known safety while remained alive seemed dreadful thing that young man like prince hsi with life infinite possibility to one of standing before must deliberately imperil finally forfeit possibility for equivalent of few thousand english pound in order to be able to practise vice have originated in first place simply through possession of so much money that felt have to get rid of somehow so adopted quickest mean available young english captain have very little time in to moralise over hsi miserable end for shortly after return to chih yuen while be changing into undress uniform messenger came aboard with request that must wait upon admiral again immediately wondering what be now in wind frobisher went across to ting yuen to find admiral anxiously pacing deck awaiting soon learnt what be that superior required for appeared that ship have come in short time previously bringing important news captain have just communicated to ting to effect that japanese have resolved upon seizure of chinese island of taiwan formosa that intended to dispatch expedition thither under general oki in two transport conveying twelve hundred men a intended invasion of island be believed by japanese to be dead secret be proposed to send only one gunboat small cruiser to convoy transport evidently considered that chinese northern fleet being still under repair at wei hai wei southern fleet away in southern chinese water have little nothing to fear that very small measure of protection even none at must suffice how man have obtained information declined to say solemnly declared that news be genuine spoke so convincingly that quite satisfied admiral of need for taking immediate action ting therefore asked frobisher whether be true that repair to ship be completed on being informed that day work must suffice to render chih yuen ready for sea if service be urgently required ordered young englishman to expedite matter a much a possible get store ammunition on board sail at earliest moment for kilung at north end of island of formosa at spot be reported that japanese intended to disembark troop disembarkation said ting must be prevented if possible gunboat transport be to be destroyed captured a circumstance must decide ought added to be easy task for chih yuen must prove very adequate reprisal for sinking of transport kowshing of attendant ship by japanese squadron week previously be just kind of commission appealed to frobisher who have still great deal of boy left in there be nothing that liked better than to be able to get away on special service therefore assured ting that must return on board hurry preparation forward get away at very earliest moment morning one following therefore found steaming out of harbour of wei hai wei with drake almost a eager a standing on bridge beside there have be very little prospect of active service for of until wong lih must join force with northern fleet might possibly not be for time therefore men be in highest spirit at thought of getting to hand grip with enemy again so quickly be with light heart indeed that young captain ordered admiral salute to be fired a chih yuen swept seaward out of harbour distance from wei hai wei to kilung at north end of formosa be close upon thousand mile frobisher reckoned that must take seventy hour to do trip on other hand distance from nearest japanese port nagasaki to same spot be only about seven hundred mile therefore if proposed invading expedition sailed at time when chih yuen left wei hai wei probability be that japanese must be there first in case task must be exceedingly difficult if not impossible once let soldier get ashore with small force must be quite unable to turn out be only by meeting transport gunboat at sea that must hope for success did not spare coal engineer stoker feeling in eagerness to reach scene first of course there be always possibility that believing plan secret enemy must not greatly hurry to get to kilung be not taking chance drove ship through short choppy sea at full power of engine have additional incentive to haste in aspect of sea sky for there seemed to be typhoon threatening be keenly anxious to run out of storm area before hurricane must break when twilight fell that evening sun be already enveloped in peculiar dun coloured mist that resembled enormous pall of distant smoke in midst of orb appeared like dimly seen red hot iron disk a sank toward western horizon darkening sky overhead away to eastward glowed with dull incandescence like reflected glare of enormous furnace while short choppy wave of forenoon have given place to long oily sluggish swell without single ripple to disturb surface through chih yuen stem clove way like knife shearing through butter ship be rolling heavily in queer eerie stillness fell with disappearance of sun usual ship board sound clank of machinery far below even voice of men assumed so weird unnatural character frobisher felt gradually being overcome by most unpleasant dismal sense of foreboding sea reflecting ruddy glow from overhead looked ghastly in extreme recalling to englishman disturbed fancy old sailor legend of appearance of hand of satan in sea of darkness be precisely kind of sea out of terrible apparition might be expected to appear so strongly did feeling of menace take hold of that actually caught at time glancing apprehensively over shoulder in spite of resolve to contrary about hour after sunset puff of hot wind came moaning about ship from direction oppressive almost a noxious a fume from open furnace door indeed there be distinctly sulphurous smell in atmosphere air be so full of electricity that quite perceptible shock be to be felt if bare hand be placed on metal especially upon copper fitting of binnacle feeling of vague uneasiness seemed to have taken possession of man on board temper be short almost to point of acerbity petty officer must be heard snarling at men officer grumbled at subordinate even frobisher drake have something of passage of arm up on bridge until realised that fretted nerve be due to extraordinary weather condition laughed little unpleasantness off accordingly frobisher now gave order that gun be to be doubly secured so that might not break adrift in event of ship being overtaken by typhoon approach of now appeared most probable everything might possibly strike adrift be fastened double fastened in view of what be almost certainly coming canvas dodger round bridge be taken down put away quarter deck forecastle awning be removed stanchion taken out of socket placed below lashing of boat cover be again looked to boat secured more firmly in chock until finally there remained nothing more possible to be done for security outbreak of storm must be awaited with reasonable confidence about eight o'clock in evening swell became even more pronounced ship commenced to roll so heavily that be necessary to run hand line fore aft deck to enable seaman to go about duty otherwise there be great danger of men being hurled right across deck sustaining serious injury gloomy lowering red light have suffused sky at going down of sun have given place to dull copper coloured glow mingled with kind of brassy glare more ominous from fact that there be visible source of origin for in ordinary course of event must have be quite dark except for such light a be given by moon sun having disappeared more than hour half previously so strong be unearthly light that horizon be plainly visible in direction save away to northward there blackness be intense not faintest glimmer of star be observable through inky curtain covered about ten degree of horizon in direction now again sudden dazzle of wicked looking forked lightning shot across face of bank a yet however there be sound of thunder same unearthly stillness prevailed save when moaning sound must be plainly heard a puff of hot wind more more frequently scurried through ship wire rigging sobbed weirdly in hood of ventilator there be certainly something pretty bad coming sir drake presently volunteered unable longer to endure strained silence have sailed sea before although have never seen sky looking quite so threatening a doe now there be much same premonition before great hurricane of when more than twenty thousand chinaman be drowned hundred of junk sailing ship steamer be destroyed wreckage strewn up down coast be in old barracouta at time although be a well found craft a ever sailed in never expected to live through must be queer state of affair if be to drop across enemy now sir must men must have pretty job serving gun mistake action with swell such a running must be utter impossibility be be reply before long will be having work cut out to take care of ourselves without troubling to attempt destruction of other fellow by jove drake believe be coming now drake glanced apprehensively behind there sure enough just below inky curtain of blackness on northern horizon be now being rent in direction by continuous lightning flash must be seen long line of whitish colour there must be doubt be approaching ship with more than speed of express train frobisher have scarcely uttered word before darkness be rent by most terrifically vivid flash of lightning that have ever seen while simultaneously air be shattered by clap of thunder of such frightful volume that cruiser jarred shivered from stem to stern a though have taken ground at full speed indeed for second be not at sure that have not happened upon uncharted shoal while hand be still cringing involuntarily from shock there came dazzling flash of lightning apparently within few yard of vessel followed immediately by peal on peal of thunder rolled reverberated over sea a though great gun in existence be being fired at same time within few mile of then rain came down a only can in latitude a though bottom of enormous tank have be suddenly knocked out roar of colossal volume of water beating on deck being such that although frobisher put mouth to drake ear shouted with power of lung latter must not distinguish syllable for only few brief second did last then ceased a suddenly a though tap have be turned off instant later line of white water appeared scarcely hundred yard distant from chih yuen stern frobisher have barely time to yell order to men on deck to hold on for life before oncoming wave attendant hurricane broke upon cruiser wave black gleaming sinister in sheen of lancing lightning flash capped with ridge of phosphorescent foam swept over cruiser stern down upon quarter deck then forward burying ship in instant from stern to stem so that captain up on navigating bridge be unable for few second to see anything of vessel deck bridge on drake be standing endeavouring to stand top of ventilator being of upper work that showed above racing turmoil of foam covered water at same time frobisher drake be literally jammed against quivering rail of bridge held there powerless to move by amazing force of wind perceptible quiver thrilled through hull of sturdy vessel a like live thing endeavoured to free from enormous weight of water few moment later emerged from swirl poured off deck in cataract then rolling free of rest of burden be carried irresistibly forward on back of wave like chip in current of mill race frobisher gave big sigh of relief a saw ship shake free little longer drake must have foundered under foot managed to gasp if have not be sturdy craft that be must not have come up again be right sir replied drake wiping spray out of eye be narrow squeak if ever there be one hark to wind must be blowing at ninety mile hour at least pray that nothing may get in way for must not possibly avoid hair breadth out of course ship must broach to capsize with drake spoke truth although sea be absolutely smooth wave crest being shorn off by terrific force of wind almost before have time to form extremely heavy swell have arisen earlier in evening be still running even hurricane must not flatten chih yuen driven forward by own steam power of wind behind rushed down one steep slope up next with speed made even most experienced seaman gasp very slight alteration of helm at speed at ship be then travelling must certainly suffice to send reeling over upon beam end aided by send of sea looking round after storm first wild outburst frobisher be horrified to observe terrible damage loss of life have be caused by first great rush of water of men who have be on deck at time only dozen poor draggled half drowned creature clinging limply to nearest support must be seen while movable object have be swept overboard into sea a well a number be not usually considered easy of removal several ventilator have be shorn off level with deck water have poured in ton down opening thus formed two quarterboats have disappeared altogether of boat only stem stern post remained hanging to davit tackle by ring bolt stanchion be either missing altogether bent into variety of curious extraordinary shape even of lighter machine gun mounted on deck have be torn from tripod be by time at bottom of sea havoc be simply indescribable be heart be full of bitterness a surveyed shocking wreck of what have few minute previously be smartest finest cruiser in whole chinese navy thought of poor soul who be perhaps even now struggling feebly a gradually sank to watery graf night drake frobisher remained on bridge not daring to leave ship to herself for instant many many time during hour of darkness did of think that last moment be come yet time after time cruiser recovered from staggering blow inflicted by wind sea rushed from crest to crest of swell like flying fish pursued by dolphin several time during night following morning skipper tried to gauge speed at ship be travelling ultimately estimated that must be doing fully twenty knot over ground a cruiser be travelling at high speed frobisher became particularly anxious to obtain sight of sun at midday in order to ascertain position for be of opinion that must be very near if not actually among island forming chu san archipelago feared moment that chih yuen might crash headlong upon submerged rock unfortunately atmosphere be far too thick to render observation possible indeed what with black low hanging cloud dense spindrift with air be filled be a dark at midday a must have be under ordinary circumstance hour after sunset be perforce obliged to content with very unsatisfactory result obtained by dead reckoning late in afternoon typhoon eased up little frobisher sent drake below to secure rest for men be completely worn out promising to call take own turn after first lieutenant have refreshed with three hour slumber at expiration of time wind have dropped so much that felt quite justified in leaving bridge therefore have drake called to take place with easing of wind however very steep heavy sea naturally began to rise frobisher therefore instructed drake to call immediately must danger arise to ship then went below turned in standing excepting that discarded boot water soaked oilskin be asleep almost before head have touched pillow seemed to that have be sleeping few minute when felt violently shaken by shoulder awoke to find drake still haggard worn for want of proper sleep standing over in dripping oilskin hillo anything wrong drake be immediate enquiry followed by request to be told time since own watch appeared to have run down nothing absolutely wrong sir be reply what can feel for sea have risen very badly ship be not behaving a well a must like chief engineer also have just sent up word that engine be working bit loose of bearing be almost red hot think that part of machinery must have be strained when first wave swept over so thought just a well to let know a for time sir be nearly three o'clock in morning three in morning ejaculated captain surely not drake must have slept nearly ten hour in case right will be on deck in few second hardly be word out of mouth when there arose on deck fearful outcry a of men in extremity of fear dismay before frobisher drake have planted foot on first step of companion ladder ship struck heavily plunged forward then struck again at same moment electric light went out everything be in darkness chapter twenty one in hand of formosan cannibal heaven above shouted frobisher a drake picked up from floor to have be hurled at first shock ship be ashore a if to emphasise statement just a two men succeeded in reaching top of steeply inclined ladder deluge of water crashed thunderously down on cruiser poop driving in solid mass along deck from end to end causing to bump again heavily then came terrific shock accompanied by heart stopping sound of rending tearing iron shearing rivet jangling machinery worse than despairing scream of men who have be caught by giant comber swept overboard to death among rock be grinding tearing way into unfortunate chih ' yuen vitals when frobisher lieutenant gained wave swept deck first faint glimmering of coming dawn be just appearing away to eastward object close at hand be beginning to take on recognisable form in ghostly grey dawn light so that although lamp in ship have gone out with stoppage of dynamo have be jolted from bedplate at first shock be to slight extent possible to see what be happening to dodge mass of wreckage be being hurled hither thither about deck frobisher first instruction be to engine room staff to stop engine engineer have omitted to do doubtless waiting for order next be to carpenter to sound well ascertain how much water ship have inside true seemed to be firmly enough fixed on rock at moment there be knowing when might slide off if have taken in much water carry to bottom then without waiting to receive man report ordered such boat a still remained in condition to swim to be stocked with provision water to be hoisted off chock ready for lowering in hurry must necessity arise be soon discovered amounted only to three not counting steam pinnace frobisher feared must be impossible to get into water under circumstance be at once apparent that notwithstanding large number of men who have be already swept overboard drowned there must not be sufficient accommodation for remaining crew meanwhile sea although still continued to break heavily over ship stern be not nearly so violent a great wave have swept deck when first struck men be able to move about in comparative safety by watching opportunity after first few moment of alarm confusion too frobisher strong personality cool confidence soon restored men courage discipline once more prevailed carpenter returned after about five minute absence reported already there be more than ten foot of water in fore end of ship while in engine room be almost up to bedplates consequently stoker be drawing furnace a quickly a must in order to avert explosion also added that during brief period while have be sounding well water have risen almost foot that therefore vessel must not be expected to float much longer indeed be now evident that although bow of chih yuen be supported on ridge pinnacle of rock after portion of ship be in deep water in be quickly sinking lower lower so that be almost question of minute before must either break in two else slide backward off rock founder by time light have become so much stronger that be possible to make out in small degree position in be situated ship have apparently driven upon outlying ridge of rock stretching mile more into sea in north easterly direction from array of black looking rugged cliff towered upward to height of several hundred foot above sea cliff shut out view to south westward toward south shore line must be seen running away until became lost in distance thus proving although light be still too poor to enable men to see very far that be not isolated uncharted reef upon ship have run island of considerable size although seemed to frobisher almost impossible that land must be actually island of formosa yet be still believable when came to consider great speed at chih yuen have be travelling during storm urged forward by engine by terrific force of wind in fact few minute consideration sufficed to convince that must indeed be formosa since there be other island of such extent a anywhere in vicinity upon cruiser must possibly have struck seeing then that there be time to be lost frobisher gave order for boat to be hoisted out a many men a must safely hold being told off to with instruction upon cargo being landed be to be brought back to ship by crew selected among for remainder of men in meantime while boat be transferring of men to shore remainder be to set to work to construct raft a quickly a possible out of raffle of wreckage washing about deck alongside so that in event of boat not having time to make more than one trip left behind must have mean of saving life other than by swimming very fortunately now fast increasing light disclosed strip of sandy beach on west side of very largely sheltered by ridge of rock on chih yuen have struck be for spot that frobisher directed boat to make a offering most suitable landing place in sight order given men rushed to execute in few minute first boat be ready for lowering into water crew got in while others stood by tackle prepared to lower away at word of command drake carefully watching sea sweeping up behind ship waited until especially heavy wave dashed past then when ensuing smooth arrived gave word to let run boat dropped down cruiser steep side like rocket hit water with resounding splash bow stern men unhooked tackle oar pushed little craft away from ship side perilous journey toward beach be commenced time after time appeared a though boat must be overrun by sea swamped coxswain in charge of be old man o ' war man time avoided disaster by hairbreadth until at expiration of breathless five minute frobisher saw living cargo leap safely out on beach heaved sigh of relief by time too second third boat have be got into water without mishap be also on way shoreward leaving about hundred fifty men still remaining aboard cruiser working like madman to complete raft for now appeared almost certain that chih yuen must not live long enough to allow hand to be taken off by boat engine room staff have be driven on deck time previously by inrush of water be also making raft for up in bow of ship others be busily engaged in getting up such unspoiled provision a must lay hand on yet party headed by frobisher be collecting little armoury of weapon on deck ready to be taken ashore for englishman have heard ugly yarn of savage character of native of island method of treatment of such shipwrecked crew a be unfortunate enough to fall into hand among yarn be one two to effect that be also strongly addicted to cannibalism drake indeed of rest be at desirous of ending career a part of ingredient of cannibal banquet on desolate forbidding shore of formosa unfortunately magazine be flooded so that be impossible to procure ammunition for fire arm rifle in arm belt happened to be loaded in readiness for expected encounter with japanese gunboat transport be therefore unloaded cartridge placed in box for safe transit officer revolver be also fully charged while frobisher drake second lieutenant have small quantity of revolver cartridge loose in cabin be added to general store be then found that entire supply of ammunition available amounted to three hundred round of rifle ammunition little over hundred round of revolver cartridge together with supply of rifle revolver cutlass formed part of second cargo of first boat have by time returned to wreck be soon on way back to shore with small party of seaman a well a weapon frobisher be on point of going below again to endeavour to rescue few more article likely to be of use to people in position when drake suddenly shouted look out sir look out men jump for life ship be sinking under indeed even a word left drake lip with terrible grinding sound of rending iron timber chih yuen began to slide backward off sharp pinnacle of rock supported bow of men followed drake advice leaped overboard others seized anything handy must serve to support while one small body of seaman made herculean effort to launch half completed raft last be too late structure have be made of large dimension on purpose to sustain weight of considerable number of men be too heavy to be moved unless hand have applied to task refused to budge while men be still struggling with cruiser slid clear of last ridge of rock into sea in terrific swirl of foaming water rolled sluggishly once twice with water up to level of gun casemates then slowly capsized sank throwing men who be fortunate enough to have be above deck into water where terrible scene of struggling among drowning at once ensued quite large proportion of chinese be unable to swim of who possessed spar piece of plank to cling to strove to save by clutching at nearest swimmer fought to tear more fortunate companion from support seize for there be many exhibition of mad brutality selfishness cowardice a there too frequently be on such occasion be redeemed by heroic deed of others who retained sens manhood raft have of course floated clear when ship sank frobisher drake after being submerged so long by suction of sinking craft a to be almost suffocated be lucky enough to come to surface close alongside having gained raft at once set to work to haul on board everybody within reach then with assistance of few oar have floated free of broken boat remaining on cruiser occupant managed to propel raft despite heavy sea still running to large grating to dozen men be clinging submerged to chin by time however raft be a heavily weighted a must safely be water indeed be sweeping over at time in such volume a to bury men almost to waist be fortunate for occupant that other two boat now returned getting alongside proceeded to relieve of of living burden otherwise great number must inevitably have soon be swept away to death there be still few men swimming clinging to piece of wreckage when have be taken on board boat mournful harvest be completed save for spar grating fragment of wreckage sea be clear of trace of once proud cruiser survivor of catastrophe be either ashore on raft divided between two boat after careful scrutiny in direction frobisher recognised that there be more to be saved ordered boat to pas line aboard raft tow to shore landing be effected in safety except for loss of one man who be snapped up by shark a sprang out of one of boat to help to run up beach great fish swooped up with rush turned on side in willow water dragged man away before hand must be lifted to rescue despairing shriek rang in ear of everybody for many day afterwards yet fate be lucky one compared to in store for of who stood shivering wet upon that sandy beach in chill air of early morning once safely ashore frobisher proceeded to count survivor out of crew of three hundred thirty men who be on board chih yuen when left wei hai wei found only hundred forty remaining of others have be washed overboard during typhoon more have be swept away when ship first struck rest have gone down when sank either between deck sucked down drowned in vortex caused by sinking hull be time for repining however be not yet by mean out of wood there be good deal of work to be done at once first of provision water cask be left on beach under guard while two party headed by frobisher drake respectively armed from stock of weapon brought ashore went off in different direction in search first of water supply secondly of spot in immediate neighbourhood where might construct sort of defence to protect from attack until rescued that there be urgent need for such structure be very soon demonstrated for scarcely have frobisher party penetrated quarter of mile into jungle when be saluted by shower of spear arrow that stretched le than thirteen of number dead on ground wounded several others frobisher immediately threw men roughly into square formation fired volley into surrounding bush in midst of naked brown form must be seen flitting hither thither by volume of shriek groan cry arose immediately after discharge seemed that have taught savage native sharp wholesome lesson at rate retreated in confusion soon afterward frobisher be fortunate enough to discover spot must serve admirably a site for sort of blockhouse fort there be spring of good water sufficient in quantity to supply need of whole force open space of ground on structure must be built abundance of small timber must easily be worked up into palisading with assistance of tool from carpenter chest one of first thing that frobisher have thought of sending ashore after arm ammunition party be therefore divided one half remaining to defend chosen site if necessary while other half be dispatched to inform drake of success to bring up beach party with provision water cask arm box of cartridge boat frobisher ordered be to be hauled a far up beach a possible together with raft of be to be well secured be not considered very likely that savage must attempt to seize boat for must not know how to handle if did frobisher be determined that task must be made a difficult for a possible that might break up for sake of nail be contingency must have to be faced a dared not leave small guard to protect have not men enough to be able to leave large one when drake arrived with exploring party informed frobisher that too have be attacked by party of native although there have apparently not be so many of in case a in of captain few shot fired into jungle have be sufficient to clear road for two incident served to convince frobisher that there have be exaggeration in tale concerning dangerous character of formosan savage realised that sooner stockade fort of description must be erected better must be for of carpenter chest be therefore at once opened available tool divided among a many a supply must allow while four men with ax started to cut down small tree of size suitable to make post for stockade others set to work with cutlass for want of better instrument to mow down root up scrub with site of proposed fort be covered putting on one side for use afterward a protective hedge others again using saw proceeded to cut tree into suitable length a soon a be felled by axemen fourth party using cutlass a spade undertook to dig hole for reception of finished post remainder be employed in task of guarding labourer with rifle drawn cutlas from chance of attack by savage by midday when hand sat down to hasty meal actual erection of stockade have be commenced by time darkness have fallen first line of post be completed in form of square thirty foot by thirty length of about twelve foot perforce have to be left open for night since men must not work in dark guard being posted there to prevent unauthorised person from entering fire be lighted round outside of stockade so that savage must approach without being seen while light of description in interior of enclosure be strictly forbidden by frobisher in order that advantage must be on side of defender in event of attack half dozen men be told off to take first spell at guarding twelve foot gap in palisading two more be stationed at loophole have be formed in of other three side to prevent surprise from of direction then rifle revolver having be reloaded piled in different part of enclosure ready to hand cutlass resharpened on grindstone belonging to tool chest placed close to owner hand remainder of little company stretched out on bed of bracken have be cut during day in few minute be fast asleep completely worn out by fatigue excitement of very long arduous day frobisher however though extremely tired must not permit to sleep feeling to full responsibility resting on shoulder for safety of men insisted that drake must do so for have be awake most of previous night while frobisher be resting to keep awake captain periodically perambulated round stockade constantly replenishing watch fire have be placed at considerable distance from fort seeing that men told off for sentry duty be keeping awake on alert strive a might against temptation to close eye if only for moment found continually nodding even a walked once twice awakened to realisation that have for few second actually be walking in sleep unfortunate watchman too be constantly needing to be roused before long frobisher found that time made round be necessary to reawaken of being found sleeping leaning on rifle against stockade while too be becoming more more drowsy at last shortly after midnight determined to rouse second lieutenant dozen of sleeper to take place of who have be doing first spell accordingly reeled in through opening in stockade scarcely noticing that men who be supposed to be guarding gap be so nearly asleep that be quite useless a sentry took little time in darkness to find spot where second lieutenant be lying be just shaking man gently by shoulder to rouse when still night air be rent by most heart shaking yell instantly followed by several shrill scream of agony in quick succession a frobisher started to foot in horror saw somnolent sentry at gap in very act of falling under flashing blade of horde of yelling shouting ferocious savage who at first wild rush have broken into fort be now spearing hapless chinese seaman who scarcely half awake be blindly searching for rifle cutlass armed frobisher desperately strove to break through get to front so that might in degree stem rush until men must recover wit must not be done chinese be being driven backward jammed together by sheer weight of number until must move neither hand foot be being slaughtered like sheep last thing that frobisher be conscious of be that be shouting frenziedly for drake then something flashed before eye thousand spark danced through brain knew more chapter twenty two japanese troop to rescue next thing of frobisher became aware be that be in extremely uncomfortable position that be suffering very considerable amount of pain also appeared to that be experiencing altogether unpleasant degree of warmth while seemed to hear ringing in ear like echo of something listened to age ago sound of what very strongly resembled steamer syren added to be conscious that there be many people quite close to groaning in varying degree of agony finally a faculty resumed normal condition began to realise that be in very disagreeable predicament refraining from opening eye waited patiently until feeling of sickness dizziness with be oppressed have slightly worn off striving meanwhile to remember how came about that be wounded in head firmly lashed with arm behind to trunk of tree in unpleasant proximity to large fire little by little memory returned remembered clearly everything have taken place up to time when enclosure have be rushed by formosan savage have fallen unconscious from blow of spear haft across head what wondered have become of poor drake have not set eye on during whole of brief scuffle began to fear worst for friend remarkable sight revealed to wondering gaze when at length opened eye instead of being bound to trunk of tree a have previously supposed found that be secured to stout post driven into ground arm behind encircling post with wrist lashed together by what felt like rough rope of native fibre glancing downward saw that ankle have be placed one on side of stake secured there by several length of rattan be to that uncomfortable cramped position be due a whole weight be thus thrust forward until be supported almost entirely by wrist looking round saw that number of similar stake have be erected in form of circle in centre of be roaring fire heat from have become unpleasantly aware of on return to consciousness to post be secured body of man supported in same manner a many of appeared frobisher noticed to be in state of entire nearly entire unconsciousness men be of course chinese seaman who have escaped death at first onslaught of savage have survived very greatly feared only to meet far more sinister fate than of sudden death gaze diligently searched circle for drake be beginning to fear that old friend must be numbered with slain when one of figure raised head slowly painfully a though just returning to consciousness revealed blood stained haggard feature of first lieutenant at same time drake turned eye in frobisher direction stared blankly at for second then smiled glad painful smile painful because of slash have received across face refrained from calling greeting frobisher instantly recognised that other must have good reason for remaining silent circumstance very much opposed to usual nature reason soon became apparent a frobisher managed to twist head round with considerable difficulty look behind for then saw that survivor of crew be tied up in front of native formosan village spot where be standing being evidently open space be to be found in portion of savage town be still night time glare of great fire shone redly on low reed thatched hut with two foot high door covered with fibre mat through occupant be obliged to crawl on four reason of drake silence became apparent in bronze shape of several of savage either lounging against wall of hut seated on low stool before door of without exception be nursing evil looking long hafted broad bladed spear carried belted to waist long bladed knife with wavy blade somewhat similar to malay parong kris be evidently very ready willing to use on least provocation native have appearance of people who be waiting impatiently for pleasurable happening to take place frobisher realised how very much be to advantage of of to feign unconsciousness a long a possible exhibition in prisoner be undoubtedly to become principal actor must hardly take place while prisoner be still insensible therefore not in fit condition to furnish sport there be doubt directly of showed sign of being in condition to feel pain savage revel must begin what form must take frobisher did not of course know must shrewdly guess by what remembered to have be told about folk that must be something very horrible shuddered involuntarily at moment there thrilled through still night air same deep throbbing note that believed have heard at moment when have be struck down sub consciousness have then attributed sound to result of blow have since thought no more of now that heard again have doubt a to what really be be deep toned vibration of steamer syren not so very far away cast quick glance in drake direction if there be steamer so close at hand there might yet be chance of being rescued if communication must possibly be established with people lieutenant have also heard directly chief eye met lip slowly very distinctly formed one silent word japanese be quite possible at short distance in strong light to read from one lip provided motion be slow very distinct two men at once entered into silent conversation relating to situation in found drake time kept wary eye on guard feigned unconsciousness course immediately followed by frobisher immediately there seemed least likelihood of one of turning head in prisoner direction there must be question a to identity of stranger stranger steamer undoubtedly be one of transport gunboat sent by japanese to take possession of island part of very expedition that frobisher must now have be engaged in fighting have not be for terrible catastrophe of chih yuen being cast away question then arose how soon must be before troop be landed must be likely to come way in search for spot on to erect fort barrack if did so must arrive in time must scarcely begin disembarkation before dawn frobisher conjectured dawn must surely be not very far off now found praying fervently that chinese seaman might remain insensible a long a possible for first recovered sens must be almost certain in astonishment alarm to betray fact must not believe that when once entertainment commenced savage must not trouble to discriminate between insensible conscious victim must butcher entire company to satisfy lust for blood have be carrying on silent conversation with drake for nearly hour during time prisoner captor have moved first streak of dawn be appearing to eastward when lieutenant suddenly dropped chin on chest a though shot so naturally be performance carried out that for few second frobisher believed friend have fainted be wise enough however to follow example instantly presently through half closed eyelid saw couple of savage rise to foot stroll toward circle of prisoner drake be one of first at whom stopped looked keenly at down hung head even prodded in rib with spear haft although blow must have be exceedingly painful drake retained sufficient self possession not to utter sound exhibit single sign of consciousness after pause two men strolled along to next prisoner be chinese quartermaster of chih yuen directly touched frobisher realised that man be dead fortunately perhaps there must be mistaking inert manner in body responded to shaking of taller of two formosan with animal cry of disappointed rage fellow reversed spear drove broad blade again again into insensate figure sight be sickening one be only consolation be that object of barbarity be beyond reach of cruelty for ever then men passed on to figure still always without result until frobisher became aware that turn be coming next drake eye be on knew watching anxiously braced to bear in silence barbarity savage might feel inclined to inflict knew of course when stopped opposite although have now closed eye tightly must scarcely repress start when felt heavy hand fall upon shoulder for did not know what next to expect temptation to open eye be almost irresistible with strong effort managed to keep closed be indeed well for that did so drake who be watching told afterward that when saw horribly suggestive gesture followed upon man placing hand on frobisher shoulder almost fainted from very horror be scarcely able to draw breath until after few second hesitation men decided to postpone barbarous idea until victim be in state to anticipate to feel passed on frobisher heard depart forbore to open eye for few second lest must be playing trick so did not see what happened to man on left drake did not with iron nerve must repress muffled cry of horror immediately men wheeled luckily having back turned at time be unable to locate sound accurately fancied that be uttered by one of seaman who unhappily for have just regained consciousness be gazing about in blank amazement terror with shout of exultation two inhuman wretch left cruelly mangled form of victim passed on to sailor paused in front of for few moment gesticulating laughing fiendishly then to frobisher amazement left untouched returned to hut here uttered peculiar kind of cry presently must be heard sound a of number of people approaching through jungle few others appeared sleepily at door of of hut crawled out yawning blinking into fire light here remained talking in harsh unmusical tongue chuckling at suggestion put forward by tall man until arrival of party of men armed with spear kris in instance bow arrow blowpipe who have evidently be out hunting to procure breakfast for tribe for carried with number of small animal somewhat resembling hare few splendidly plumaged bird intended for pot on hearing what tall man be saying however burden be contemptuously cast on one side eyed prisoner with expression told frobisher more plainly than word that have fallen into clutch of cannibal discarding of spoil of night hunt proved only too clearly what intention be how frobisher prayed prayed again that japanese troop might pas way in time must of course mean exchanging of one prison for knew japanese be civilised officer gentleman indignity other hardship must be inflicted upon captive beyond temporary confinement englishman felt that must almost be willing to undergo lifelong captivity if might by so doing save comrade from dreadful fate that only too plainly be in store for chief having now concluded harangue audience with shout chuckle of anticipation ferocity dived back into hut to reappear few second later with number of wooden shovel stake sharpened to point hardened in fire being evidently intended for breaking up of hard earth for shovel to deal with more easily then whole of with exception of couple of spearmen left to guard prisoner trooped off into bush stopping little distance away proceeding to dig eagerly a frobisher must tell by shout sound of shovel pick being driven into ground ah if only be possible for drake to loosen bond while savage be away few second must suffice to dispose of guard few second more must liberate rest of prisoner most of whom be now showing sign of returning consciousness must all be away in depth of forest before others must reach spot once free must be strange indeed if must not reach protection of japanese troop who must by time surely be disembarking possibly only short mile away if must have elected to land at spot where chih yuen boat have be left phew boat thought frobisher to if troop must land where expected must officer must not avoid seeing seeing must naturally at once endeavour to discover whose be name of ship be on boat if jap officer must understand chinese character surely surely must try to locate people who have landed from vessel if only to attack drive from island if disembarkation have begun at dawn strong force might even now be in vicinity searching perhaps within earshot at very moment concentrated shout on part of drake might reach ear of troop bring to spot in time to save hand from horrible death risk be too great shout must inevitably bring back savage even if guard did not punish outcry with spear thrust then must be over only thing to do be to wait pray fervently that preparation of formosan might take considerable time thus giving japanese more opportunity to find prisoner before be too late if be coming at seemed strange to frobisher that savage have not also heard steamer syren attributed circumstance to fact that perhaps own ear drake be more sensitive to sound in presence of imminent death than of formosan besides lieutenant knew that arrival of japanese be expected whereas formosan have reason to suspect anything of kind while be debating matter in mind heard noise of savage crashing through bush on return knew that unless assistance came within next five minute must arrive too late for of presently cannibal reappeared in clearing laughing joking among having thrown shovel pick down by side of one of hut picked up spear advanced expectantly toward circle of bound men baring gum showing teeth exhibiting symptom of pleased anticipation then tall chief who have be last to return dived into hut while others stood around leaning on spear running thumb along edge of parongs waiting impatiently for to reappear be at moment that frobisher who be staring hard at drake trying to attract attention thought caught distant echo of voice by sudden start that lieutenant be unable to repress be evident that too have become aware of something immediately glanced across at captain raising eyebrow nodding head in direction of sound frobisher nodded in return at same time glancing warningly at formosan forming word wait with lip a distinctly a must drake understood flashed comprehension at moment that savage chief reappeared in doorway of hut have dressed in celebration of occasion in splendid tiger skin cloak wore skull of tiger on head a kind of helmet necklace made of teeth claw of beast be suspended round neck supporting huge unset emerald be fastened by piece of gold wire run through hole have be drilled through angle of stone also wore pair of white cotton trouser terminating just below calf kept in position by belt made of silver medallion connected by piece of deer hide while from belt depended very handsome silver hilted kris in wooden scabbard very richly ornamented have undoubtedly be stolen at time from rich malay trader gold bracelet encircled arm nearly from wrist to elbow ankle be ornamented by soft gold band must be clasped on taken off a owner desired made fine figure of man be evidently quite aware of fact for stood still for few moment sunning in admiration of follower until frobisher trembled lest voice must again make heard be detected by waiting cannibal in fact a strained ear englishman must now distinctly hear distant crackling of undergrowth announcing passage of number of men through bush be a yet very faint indeed must have passed unnoticed for strained condition of nerve be to quite perceptible approaching closer closer second to unbounded delight cannibal now formed circle began to sing slowly parading round doomed men clashing haft of spear thus effectually drowning sound approaching troop might make at same time notifying presence to japanese be broad daylight by time frobisher kept eye glued in direction from sound have proceeded hoping second that must be gladdened by glitter of approaching bayonet in midst of singing chief suddenly whipping out kris paused few second on edge of circle looking for victim then sprang like tiger at one of chinese seaman man saw coming shrieked pitifully must scarcely have felt death poor fellow for next second severed head fell to ground waving kris above head laughing madly chief looked round for next victim eye fell upon frobisher englishman breathed prayer prepared to meet death bravely keeping eye fixed undauntedly on chief face a looked fellow suddenly dropped streaming weapon falling upon knee collapsed in heap simultaneously with crack of revolver be immediately followed by quick succession of rifle shot a hidden marksman picked out victim taken completely by surprise cannibal be shot down like sheep frobisher scarcely realised what be happening until saw last savage throw up hand fall then felt bond slacken staggered weakly forward to find supported by arm of japanese officer while standing about in group at edge of jungle must be seen figure of soldier leaning upon still smoking rifle chapter twenty three frobisher capture satsuma several month have passed since moment when frobisher stood staring in face of death in formosan clearing to be saved in very nick of time by well directed shot from japanese officer revolver now together with drake remained of crew of chih yuen twenty three seaman only out of complement of over three hundred be crawling slowly carefully on hand knee down steep jungle path not mile from scene of rescue on way to beach how come to be in position creeping along keeping cautiously within shadow cast by moon can soon be told immediately cannibal have be slain by japanese volley officer men have cast loose cramped stiffened form of prisoner wounded formosan of whom there be very few have be executed by order of japanese captain who said that must not afford to take savage prisoner courteously informed frobisher that although be delighted honoured at having be mean of succouring honourable captain men in extremity must be obliged a two country be still at war to make men prisoner until such time a must be exchanged if however frobisher must give parole for crew must be very glad to give passage to japan when transport returned thither otherwise must be obliged to keep with on island until be relieved japanese garrison withdrawn frobisher drake after consulting decided that must not give parole be eager to get away from formosa back to duty a soon a possible believed might be able to form plan by to bring about if be not sent to japan therefore informed general oki of decision that officer shrugged shoulder ordered two englishman twenty three chinese to be closely guarded until building must be erected a prison for be soon run up twenty five men placed therein with sentry stationed at door night day be well treated very strictly guarded be long time before even glimmering of opportunity to escape occurred gunboat have convoyed transport back to nagasaki a escape be impossible without assistance of ship became necessary to wait until returned a be expected to do in about three month time with store be longer than however before appeared provision be becoming exceedingly scarce when one day everybody awoke to find one of latest finest japanese torpedo boat destroyer lying off beach with old tramp steamer laden with store be then that frobisher drake decided to attempt putting into execution scheme matured by month previously have be simmering in brain ever since departure of gunboat transport scheme be nothing le than capture of war vessel must certainly accompany storeship question now be how be scheme to be carried out with so small number of men twenty five to hundred ten must be about complement carried by destroyer be very long odds frobisher drake between evolved plan that thought might meet with success have observed at time when japanese be first landing store after troop have be disembarked that crew of transport war ship have be allowed to come ashore in detachment to stretch leg after voyage being permitted also to go into wood at back of cliff with rifle after tiger other game provided always that went in large party so a to avoid danger of being cut off by cannibal have also made note of fact that when gunboat crew have taken turn at shore leave fully three quarter of men have arranged to do so at same time so that battue on large scale might take place leaving only few men behind to look after ship battue have proved tremendous success that crew of two transport have followed example of service comrade have likewise have excellent sport report of success frobisher felt sure must be communicated to crew of ship be to bring next consignment of store be upon possibility of major portion of destroyer men coming ashore together leaving ship very indifferently manned that englishman have built plan if japanese did not follow predecessor example then plan must have to be thought out after ship arrival when must be seen what arrangement be actually in force fortunately for success of frobisher scheme everything have fallen out a have hoped storeship crew came on shore first met with splendid success a destroyer consort be making brief stay war ship crew have arranged to hold battue following day have therefore warned men directly became aware of what be intended be with mingled feeling of delight apprehension that saw heard laughing japanese tar making way into bush a twilight fell to take up post for moonlight shoot prison have be built at distance from storehouse barrack close to edge of jungle not far from strip of beach where chih yuen boat have landed other two building just referred to be more than mile away at top of cliff where signal station have also be established on night selected for attempt crew of store ship happened to be holding sing song to officer on shore number of men from barrack have be invited seemed a though fortune be on side of conspirator frobisher gave hunter hour in to make good offing a phrased then when shade of evening have well set in passed word to men to be ready there be two sentinel on guard night day over prisoner have be changed hour before time attempt be to be made frobisher must hear pacing slowly up down outside whispered to one of sailor who must speak japanese that moment have arrived fellow immediately shouted at top of voice help help have be bitten by snake acting on frobisher instruction remainder of men began to raise tremendous hubbub a though trying to find reptile to kill while bitten man altering tone of voice called wildly to sentry to bring rifle to shoot thing plan worked to perfection prisoner have always be quiet well behaved have never made attempt to escape so suspicion now suggested to guard hastily unlocked door dashed in with rifle held ready to shoot next moment be on floor with dozen men on top of of rifle in hand of frobisher drake respectively be bound gagged in le time than take to tell five minute later little band be in situation in be discovered at beginning of chapter crawling cautiously along jungle path toward beach once there in shadow of cliff hastened to spot where arm store from chih yuen have be concealed when first landed of have be left there when went to build fort if japanese have not discovered must be there still there be soon found frobisher distributed rifle cutlas to man saw that rifle be loaded that remaining cartridge be distributed a far a must go then gave drake cutlas revolver took one of then little band crept quietly along toward place where japanese boat have be pulled up nothing of kind having be anticipated have not be deemed necessary to leave guard over boat fugitive have thing own way oar be muffled with piece of men clothing boat be carried bodily down to water edge placed carefully in water to avoid noise created by running down beach there might be sentry on destroyer store ship although in case of latter be not very probable owing to concert proceeding on board if anyone must be watching on destroyer frobisher hoped that crew must be taken for party of hunter returned early for reason until must be too late to offer resistance if there be sentinel on guard well attention to fugitive must not be attracted by undue disturbance quietly quickly men slid into boat be soon on way toward destroyer lying about mile from store ship be within few yard of when to astonishment momentary dismay be challenged there be sentry on watch after japanese speaking seaman replied to challenge with statement that have returned early a sport have turned out to be poor before sentry must make up mind whether not recognised voice boat crew be on deck have opportunity to rectify mistake be silently overcome gagged bound in trice in le than ten minute remainder of destroyer men most of captured while enjoying well earned nap be in iron confined with sentry over in own vessel forecastle scuttle of be closed screwed home with spanner so that outcry of theirs must reach other ship fire be banked steam pressure be low by extravagant use of oil working pressure be soon raised frobisher wisely waited until have full head of steam before slipping cable lest might be chased by store ship before have power for full speed at expiration of hour be in readiness word be given cable slipped through hawse pipe with roar screw revolved satsuma swung round in circle headed northward for wei hai wei sound of cable running out alarmed crew of store ship concert ceased abruptly craft might a well have hoped to catch streak of lightning a satsuma when once be well into stride two day later destroyer now flying chinese flag steamed proudly into wei hai wei ala pride soon have fall for harbour be full of japanese war ship matter have be progressing while frobisher be prisoner in formosa battle have be fought on land sea china have be humbled in dust men in navy army have fought like hero ala be always same tale victory dearly bought still victory must have be theirs in nearly case for peculation of mandarin other high official who supplied everything of poorest to unfortunate men whose duty be to do fighting poor weapon poor food cheap boot clothing faulty ammunition be cause of china downfall nothing else remnant of fleet under admiral ting have fought bravely contested naval action have be destroyed with exception of one ship chen yuen have be captured southern fleet have be bottled up by japanese squadron admiral wong lih have gone to tien tsin to see whether must be of use there army in korea have be crushed by enemy superior in number in everything else bravery at moment of frobisher return peace envoy be in act of concluding treaty of shimonoseki higher chinese naval officer broken hearted at disgrace be none of own fault have one committed suicide dragon teeth be drawn claw pared must ever rise again frobisher wondered under men worthy of hero who be only too willing to fight battle time alone must show there be little more to add to present history of captain murray frobisher captured destroyer be of course claimed by japan frobisher remained prisoner for one day until treaty be signed then being free sought admiral wong lih who have refused to follow comrade example destroy englishman obtained from loan of old gunboat armed manned at own expense went up hoang ho settled outstanding account with certain pirate individual by name of ah fu then drake revisited ruined palace brought away genghiz khan hoard two men shared brought to england where arrived about christmas time frobisher be now immensely wealthy man famous one too for found that account of service with chinese navy have reached home that name be in everybody mouth be surprised on day following arrival to receive visit from dick penryn who after first warm greeting have passed handed document intimating that former sentence of court martial have be reversed that frobisher have be reinstated in british navy with rank of captain that ship be waiting for a soon a cared to take command have however little business of own to transact first nature of became apparent little more than year later when captain murray frobisher of majesty cruiser dauntless presented to grateful astonished country no le than four splendid battleship of latest design built in mother country with part of proceeds of share of hoard of ancient conqueror of asia did not intend said to deputation who waited upon to thank that country must ever be exposed to danger of fate have overtaken china if china have have more ship might have come off victorious in war with japan in spite of manifold disadvantage to have be subjected be disadvantage of kind to great britain knew must never be exposed wanted beloved country to posse good margin of safety after generous unparalleled gift will surprise reader very much to learn that lieutenant who be once cashiered from navy for losing ship be now captain sir murray frobisher baronet holding rank of post
