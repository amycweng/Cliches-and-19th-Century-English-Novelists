settlement be effected complication arise disaster be narrowly averted later hero companion leave island home carrying treasure with strange adventure of eric blackburn by harry collingwood chapter one catastrophe happened on seventh night out from cape town when have accomplished about third of distance between city melbourne ship be saturn of well known planet line of combined freight passenger steamer trading between london cape town melbourne eric blackburn aged trifle over twenty three year be fourth officer saturn be brand new ship being maiden voyage be twin screw of ton register at lloyd steaming knot have accommodation for passenger of whom be first class second class steerage berth be occupied steerage crowd consisting mostly of miner attracted to australia by rumour of newly discovered goldfield of fabulous richness crew of ship numbered told therefore when catastrophe occurred saturn be responsible for life of people of whom about be woman child be officer of watch be therefore on bridge when happened time being shortly after six bell in middle watch say about quarter past three o'clock in morning weather be fine with so moderate westerly wind blowing that speed of ship just balanced smoke spark from funnel rising straight up into air when fireman shovelled coal into furnace apart from long westerly swell there be very little sea running motion of ship be therefore very easy just slow roll of four five degree to port starboard equally slow gentle rise fall of ship over swell followed moon be only four day old consequently have set hour earlier sky be cloudless air be clear star shining brilliantly afforded light enough to reveal ship at distance of quite three mile must be difficult therefore to imagine condition of more apparently perfect safety than at moment prevailing aboard saturn yet destruction came upon in manner with suddenness be absolutely appalling be pacing bridge from one extremity to other keeping sharp look out ahead round ship when at port end of promenade wheeled on return march there be sign few minute intervened between eternity a approached wheel house became aware of sudden access of light in sky behind illuminating entire ship in radiance increased with incredible rapidity while at same moment low humming sound became audible that also grew in volume a rapidly a light wheeling sharply round to ascertain meaning of strange phenomenon heard helmsman ejaculate through open window of wheel house gosh be big 'un mistake biggest ever seen on note of sudden alarm ai goin ' to fall so very far away from d see that big fireball sir headin ' way a man spoke caught sight of object to referred horror chilled to marrow for never before verily believe have mortal eye beheld so awful apparition broad over port bow at elevation of forty degree above horizon beheld great white hot flaming mass emitting long trail of brilliant spark coming straight for ship be increasing in apparent size even a gazed at dumb paralysed with terror indescribable while sound of passage through air grew in course of second two from murmur to deafening roar light emitted became so dazzling that nearly blinded a looked at a came hurtling toward seemed to expand until looked almost a big a ship be of course optical illusion for when second two later struck saw that fiercely incandescent mass of roughly spherical shape be twelve foot in diameter struck ship aslant on port side few foot abaft funnel close to water line passing through engine room out through bottom there be perceptible shock attending blow crash be terrific while smell of burning be almost suffocating be not to be wondered at since mass be blazing so fiercely that set ship on fire merely by passing through so intense be heat of that a passed through ship bottom into water instantly became enveloped in dense cloud of hot steamy vapour moment later exploded under throwing up cone of water came near to swamping ship for space of perhaps two second after passage of meteor through ship hull silence of night continued then a though in response to signal there arose such dreadful outcry a hope never to hear again while cabin door be dashed open out from cabin companion way streamed crowd of distracted men woman child clad in night gear just a have leapt from berth men shouting to know what have happened while poor woman child rushed frantically hither thither jostling other wringing hand weeping screaming hysterically calling to child who have become separated from in seething crowd first man to run up against be skipper who sprang out of cabin straight on to bridge exclaiming a clutched by arm what be have happened for god sake speak man ship answered have be struck by enormous meteorite sir have set on fire believe have passed out through bottom have taken perceptible list to starboard already at moment be interrupted by chief engineer who dashed up on bridge demanding breathlessly where be captain be here mr kennedy what be news out with jerked skipper engine be wrecked sir utterly destroyed answered kennedy ship be holed through bottom down in engine room hole be big enough to drive coach through room be half full of water already if of bulkhead go will sink like stone at juncture be joined by chief second third officer who came upon other heel ah here be gentleman remarked skipper be about to send for learn from mr blackburn that ship have be struck by falling meteor mr kennedy tell have passed through bottom according to engine room be flooded be of opinion that if of engine room bulkhead yield ship will go down quickly in opinion agree with even a be may notice that ship be taking strong list be very perceptibly deeper in water therefore will ask mr hoskins to chief officer mr cooper to second to muster hand proceed to boat deck clear away boat ready for lowering in case of necessity mr stroud to third officer will mount guard at foot of boat deck ladder prevent passenger passing up until boat be ready give word mr blackburn go down find purser tell have happened what be doing ask to keep people quiet until be ready for can lend hand thank god boat be provisioned ready for emergency while water in be renewed only yesterday so there be nothing to do cut adrift swing outboard be at present gentleman so go get to work at once why who be men on boat deck now what be doing with boat look like miner answered hoskins be rough lot a likely a not may have trouble with 'em ay thought so chap be up there too trying to send others away seem inclined to go come along cooper have got to clear miner off somehow will get nothing done therewith four of departed upon respective mission leaving captain in charge on bridge deck be now full of people rushing aimlessly hither thither stopping everybody met asking other what have happened meanwhile electric light have be switched on so that be possible to see who be who a quite expected sooner did poor distracted creature catch sight of uniform than be surrounded hemmed in by crowd who piteously besought to tell have happened if there be danger have by time quite recovered self possession be therefore able to answer calmly with steady voice naturally did not tell whole truth for knew must precipitate panic in everybody must get out of hand therefore told there have be breakdown in engine room be being attended to that there be immediate danger that strongly advised purely a measure of precaution to return to cabin dress warmly put into pocket into parcel money valuable might have in baggage so that in event of anything untoward happening whereby might be compelled to take to boat must be prepared to do so at moment notice of listened to allowed to be persuaded others seemed afraid to leave deck for moment lest must be overtaken by calamity after apprehension be not to be wondered at there be excuse enough for to spare there be very strong smell of burning occasional puff of smoke coming up from below where engine room staff be fighting flame ship have taken heavy steadily increasing list to starboard be visibly settling in water to crown crowd of miner who upon first alarm have taken possession of boat deck be refusing to leave brisk struggle between seaman be proceeding though a yet firearm be being used knew hoskins temper be by mean patient man one given to much verbal argument be usually word blow with not infrequently blow came first knew also that habitually carried revolver in pocket when at sea must not therefore have be at surprised to hear crack of weapon at moment have just managed to extricate from crowd be making way toward purser cabin when from interior of ship almost beneath foot there came deep boom knew that after bulkhead of engine room have given way that moment of saturn be numbered no use to hunt up purser now thought made dash for boat deck to see if must render assistance there be too late sound of bursting bulkhead coming on top of previous alarm be be needed to produce panic have along be dreading in instant deck be alive with frantic people desperately fighting way upward to boat deck where pandemonium now raged supreme where pistol be popping freely showing that hoskins be by mean only man in ship who went armed now what be best thing for to do must do anything useful stood on outskirt of seething maddened crowd watched men woman striving desperately together trampling other remorselessly down shrieking cursing fighting no longer human reduced by fear of death to condition of rabid ferocious brute must hing a well go down below attempt to stay inrush of water with two hand a strive by argument to restore people to reason while a for force what must strength avail against of hundred have gone mad in madness be destroying rendering impossible to launch boat so dooming everybody else to death be awful that scene often revisits in dream even to day awake sweating trembling with unspeakable horror of meanwhile ship be rapidly sinking have taken so strong list to starboard that be only with utmost difficulty must retain footing upon steeply inclined deck while be so much down by stern that sea be almost level with deck right aft scarcely knowing what did acting with inconsequence of one in dream clawed way across bridge led from upper deck to poop reached taffrail where stood gazing blankly down into black water thinking be afraid rather rebellious thought must have stood thus for at least five minute before realised that hand be gripping life buoy one of six be stopped to rail still acting mechanically with very definite purpose drew forth pocket knife severed lashing passed buoy over head shoulder thrust arm through climbed rail dropped into water chill of immersion instantly brought to sens in moment realised that if must save life must without instant delay put greatest possible distance between ship before foundered otherwise when sank might do at moment must drag down with drown desire to live seemed to have be paralysed within by suddenness of disaster dreadful scene have subsequently witnessed re awoke struck out vigorously know not how long have be swimming seemed to in anxiety to get well away from ship to have be very few minute when tumultuous sound of contention aboard doomed saturn suddenly changed to long wailing scream glancing back over shoulder saw upreared against star lit sky fore end of ship standing almost vertically out of water while at same instant loud boom reached ear proclaiming bursting of ship boiler yielding of bulkhead possibly blowing up of deck then a paused for moment to watch conclusion of catastrophe hull sank lower lower still in water until within space of minute completely vanished dreadful sight stimulated to superhuman exertion for believed be still perilously near great sinking mass indeed have scarcely covered dozen yard when felt strong suction of foundering ship fought against with desperate energy in about minute time relaxed ceased swimming now asked what be next thing to be done suppose be instinct that prompted to get into life buoy swim away from sinking ship in doing so have not merely exchanged quick for lingering death if have stuck to ship must have gone down with died with very little suffering if while so far a can see be now fated to drift about in buoy until perish slowly miserably of cold hunger thirst be most depressing reflection for moment felt strongly tempted to slip out of buoy throw up hand sink have done with love of life self preservation be told be first law of nature must not permit to act foolishly reason reasserted reminding that while there be life there be hope remembered be floating in stretch of water be highway for ship bound round cape to from australia new zealand be highway that if not quite so busy a london fleet street be traversed almost daily by craft of one sort bound east west something might come along at moment if must attract attention to myself pick up besides did not really believe in giving up have be instilled into from earliest childhood that correct way to meet difficulty be to fight to fight harder more formidable appear difficulty doctrine be sound have have proved to be so over over again meant again to put to test then in most discouraging combination of adverse circumstance with have ever be confronted water be bitterly cold if remained submerged to armpit a then be must not survive long enough to get fair chance needed raft of sort buoyant enough to support practically dry remembering that there be numerous loose article such a deck chair grating what not must probably float off wreck when sank turned swam back towards spot where saturn have gone down hoping that might be fortunate enough to find something must afford support required a struck out afresh be cheered encouraged by assurance day be not far distant for looking ahead saw that sky low down toward horizon wore pallor be forerunner of dawn by imperceptible degree day crept up over eastern horizon cold white a soon a there be light enough to enable to see from crest of one swell to of next began to look about in hope of finding flotsam of sort must be useful to also occurred to that there might be who have remembered that cork jacket be to be found in state room might have made use of in case might fall in with other survivor who might be useful to to if joined force for several minute search of surface of sea proved fruitless at be distinctly disconcerted for knew that there be many article of buoyant nature have be lying loose about deck must have floated off when ship sank be beginning to fear that somehow have got out of reckoning have missed scene of catastrophe minute two later a topped ridge of swell caught momentary glimpse of something floating fifty sixty fathom away striking out vigorously in direction presently arrived at spot found in midst of small collection of broom scrubbing brush squeegee bucket deck chair grating gigantic slice of luck one of ship life boat floating bottom up of human being living dead not sign be therefore evident that of five hundred thirty five aboard saturn at moment of disaster be sole survivor naturally made straight for upturned life boat recognising that bucket might prove very useful secured one towed along with reaching boat be greatly gratified to find that not only be quite undamaged also that be riding buoyantly with whole of keel about foot of bottom above surface of water of course first thing to be done be to right boat then to bale out with water a smooth a then be thought there ought not to be much difficulty in doing righting of boat however proved to be very much more difficult than have imagined be fairly big boat floating wrong side up full of water be very sluggish for long time scarcely responded to effort eventually succeeded with glad heart seized bucket have secured hove into boat climbed in after finding to joy that even with weight in boat floated with gunwale nearly four inch above surface of water thus there must be difficulty in baling dry at once proceeded to do working vigorously at task not only with object of freeing boat a speedily a possible still more to restore circulation get little warmth into chilled benumbed body chapter two yorkshire lass by time have baled boat dry sun be above horizon air have become quite genially warm exertion have set body aglow while clothing be rapidly drying in gentle breeze be blowing out from about north west also discovered that have somehow developed most voracious appetite fortunately be able to regard last circumstance with equanimity for manager of planet line of steamer have laid down a most stringent rule that while ship be at sea boat be not only to be maintained in state of perfect preparation for instant launching be also to be fully supplied with provision water upon scale proportional to passenger carrying capacity be also to have full equipment of gear stowed in ready for instant service now boat have be fortunate enough to find by way seemed to be only one have not be carried down with ship be number craft thirty two foot long by eight foot beam carvel built double ended fitted with air chamber fore aft along side with keel six inch deep to enable to work to windward under sail be yawl rigged pulled six oar full carrying capacity be twenty four person for number carried provision water enough to last according to carefully regulated scale four day even six day at pinch provision be of tinned variety be stowed in locker specially arranged for reception between two midship thwart thus there be risk of food being damaged by salt water on one hand of being washed out of boat on other upon coming into possession of boat therefore be not only so fortunate a to find ark of refuge also ration of food sufficient to last ninety six day knowing such knowledge being part of duty sooner have hove last bucketful of water out over gunwale than opened food locker spread constituent of very satisfying breakfast in stern sheet of boat whereupon fell to made excellent meal a sat there eating drinking solitary individual adrift in vast expanse of southern ocean began to look future in face ask be now to do in general sense be not at difficult question to answer saturn splendid new perfectly equipped steamship have gone to bottom taking with five hundred thirty four human being apart from boat sat in there be nothing nobody to tell what fate have be be sole survivor of probably unexampled disaster obvious duty be to hasten with a little delay a possible to spot from must report particular of disaster to owner of ship what spot precisely must endeavour to reach a officer of ship of course knew exact position at noon on day preceding loss be latitude degree minute second south longitude degree minute second east remembered figure well having something of gift in direction have sedulously cultivated in view of possibility that day might find exceedingly useful in same way be able to form fairly accurate mental picture of chart upon position have be pricked off for cooper second have be studying together in chart house shortly after skipper have pricked off a result knew that saturn have foundered two thousand mile east south east of cape of good hope that madagascar nearest land bore about north by west true with island of reunion mauritius not much farther off bearing about two point farther east item of information be of course valuable value be to very great extent discounted by fact have sextant chronometer wherewith to determine boat position day after day chart to guide at point in self communion realised that alternative course be open to proceeded to give most careful consideration comparing one with other more carefully examined more difficult did find to come to decision on one hand here be right in track of ship bound east west consequently stood very fair chance of being picked up at moment when ship wireless installation must at once enable to make report on other hand in unlikely event of failing to be picked up must dispatch cablegram from say port louis mauritius immediately upon arrival there point have to decide be whether must at once steer north whether must remain where be trust to being speedily picked up will not weary reader by repeating in detail argument pro con presented to mind let suffice to say that eventually adopted second of course outlined above so certain did feel that be right decision actually adhered to for seven day during sighted four steamer one sailing ship a ill fortune must have three of steamer sailing ship passed at too great distance to permit of intercepting while fourth steamer big liner with three tier of port blazing with electric light passed during night within le than four mile of have light with to signal to thus be passed unseen liner passed during fifth night succeeding that of wreck during following two day saw nothing a watched sun go down on seventh day have spent in boat said to myself well here endeth seventh day of most disappointing experience if seven day ago anyone have told that must hang about here in boat for whole week right in track of ship without being sighted picked up must not have believed yet here be judging from past experience here may remain for seven day even longer with more satisfactory result have spent seven precious day waiting for ship to come along find now will go see if can not find ship failing that find land where will at least be safe from destruction by first gale chance to spring up thinking thus put up helm wore boat round headed upon course believed must eventually enable to hit off reunion mauritius must not be picked up beforehand be very anxious night indeed for by far most anxious have thus far spent since destruction of saturn for wind steadily increased compelling to haul down first then second reef in mainsail while wind sea being now square abeam be continually exposed to danger of being swamped by sea breaking aboard by constant watchfulness however contrived to escape danger eighth morning found boat bowling along to northward reeling off six knot per hour with steady breeze from westward long regular sea running clear sky giving promise that weather condition be unlikely to grow worse than be then have to stick to mainsheet yoke line do a best must without rest for time being fortunately a day wore on wind moderated until by nightfall have dropped to extent be able to shake out first one reef then other while with moderating of breeze sea also went down until be no longer dangerous have now have sleep for thirty six hour consequently felt in sore need of rest therefore hove to boat coiled down instantly sank into dreamless slumber must have be about midnight when awoke at once let draw fore sheet filled away upon course have decided upon kept boat going for remainder of night ninth day of boat voyage dawned pleasantly with wind still blowing moderate breeze from westward long regular swell running sea worth troubling about condition be therefore quite favourable for little experiment desired to make being only human must not avoid necessity for securing certain amount of sleep up to now when needed rest have be habit to heave to boat leave to take care of trusting to curious sailor sense sailor men soon acquire to awake must need arise heaving to meant loss of time having already lost so much be very reluctant to lose more if such loss must possibly be avoided therefore set boat going on correct compass course then releasing yoke line endeavoured to render craft self steering by adjusting fore mizen sheet took best part of hour to accomplish to complete satisfaction did at length done went aloft took good look round there be nothing in sight indeed scarcely expected to see anything in part of ocean have then reached therefore descended rested until dinner time indulging in nap until hour for evening meal in preparation for night watch weather have now become quite settled be a favourable a must possibly be to person who like be engaged upon ocean voyage in open boat wind still held steadily in western quarter enabling to lay course with eased sheet while strength be sufficient to push boat along under whole canvas at speed of about five knot with need to keep one eye continually watching lee gunwale only difficulty at time be lack of light to illuminate boat compass at night can containing supply of lamp oil seeming to have gone adrift when boat be capsized be therefore compelled to steer entirely by star be sometimes disturbed by uneasy doubt a to whether might not occasionally have deviated slightly from proper course by holding on to one particular star for too long time in other respect did splendidly morning of tenth day of remarkable on whole uneventful voyage of mine in life boat dawned auspiciously daily routine into have settled began went aloft for look round then horizon being empty have breakfast after with boat steering stretched out for short sleep must have slept for perhaps two hour when mysterious influence awoke started up gazing eagerly about there be still nothing in sight from low elevation of boat being awake decided to have look round from aloft in minute be straddling yard of main lug from position a boat floated up on ridge of swell caught momentary glimpse of something gleaming white in brilliant sunshine right ahead must of course be one thing namely upper canvas of sailing craft of sort remained where be intently watching that gleaming white speck until have grown into semblance of royal head of topgallant sail from time to time also got occasional glimpse of upper part of sail must not for moment identify ultimately a watched strange craft seemed to alter course little then made out puzzling piece of canvas to be triangular head of gaff topsail vessel be therefore without doubt brigantine what must not at first understand however be way be steering at one moment must appear absolutely end on while minute two later must be broad off wind to extent of four five point be exceedingly erratic steering to say least of be tantalised too by inability to determine whether be heading toward away from eventually decided that since mast have hove up above horizon just where be must be heading toward only argument against assumption be that did not appear to be rising rapidly enough to justify certainly be rising although slowly be enough for in meantime without further ado therefore slid down from aloft went aft seized yoke line saying to believe be going to be right time be sailing craft be raising although very slowly will be afternoon before can get alongside please god there will be no more open boating for after to day that craft in sight be indeed brigantine became unmistakable a stood on slowly raising canvas above horizon later on in day made two further discovery of rather peculiar character in connection with one be that be hove to other that be flying ensign upside down at peak of mainsail latter circumstance indicating that be in distress required assistance of kind be about three o'clock in afternoon when life boat crept up near enough to brigantine to enable to distinguish detail first thing observed be that group of five six men apparently forecastle hand be grouped aft curiously inspecting boat through telescope a approached little later when arrived within few fathom of learned from inscription in white letter on stern that craft be named yorkshire lass that hailed from hull a drew up within hail put hand to mouth trumpet wise shouted yorkshire lass ahoy be castaway have be adrift in boat ten day may board to amazement instead of replying group of men clustered on deck aft turned to other seemed to hold brief consultation finally after short palaver one of hailed boat ahoy say mister be navigator yes certainly replied much astonished at having question addressed to by british seaman instead of a have fully expected receiving cordial invitation to come alongside be fourth officer of saturn of planet line of steamer running between london melbourne then stopped for instead of listening to be talking together again at length when life boat have crept up close under brigantine lee quarter one of men came to rail looking down into boat remarked right mister come aboard welcome look out will heave line couple of minute later life boat with sail lowered be alongside climbing craft low side reached deck welcome aboard yorkshire lass mister be greeted by great burly specimen of british shellback a stepped in over rail very glad to see ye be sure what about boat be fine boat mistake be afraid will have to let go adrift be too big for to hoist in have place on deck where must stow if there be anything of value aboard will have out eh mister certainly agreed there be still quantity of preserved provision in locker there be two water breaker there be life buoy be about look here continued if something must be turned adrift why not get rid of long boat of yours hoist in life boat in place latter be very much better boat of two there be indeed comparison between be sure must stow very snugly in long boat chock ay agreed other believe must a say be lot better than long boat have got air chamber see in fact be proper life boat be roomy enough to take hand of if anything must happen what say chap will try last to other men who have stood around listening to everything be said party five of in slouched over to rail stood looking down into life boat with air of stolid indifference a rose fell alongside then turned looked inboard at long boat stood upright in chock on top of main hatch with jolly boat stowed keel up inside finally one of said yah ve will do id be wort ' de drouble gome on poys led ged do vork haven 'd done moosh dese lasd dwo day und id von 'd hurd shoomp ub dere zome of und ged de sholly boad oud of dad now thought what sort of craft be have blundered aboard of be liberty hall afloat by look of jack a good a master there seems to be something bit queer here something ca quite understand at present will find out what be before long of fellow be skipper wonder if of be a be very much inclined to think where be then suddenly recalled to mind question be navigator have be put to before received permission to come aboard for moment thought of demanding explanation before permitting life boat to be hoisted in changed mind resolved to defer investigation until later flattered that if anything must prove to be really wrong aboard brigantine have wit enough to enable to deal with meanwhile five men having summoned three others from forecastle to assistance got to work with exasperating deliberation characteristic of british merchant seaman to be found in forecastle of small craft first of got jolly boat down on deck ran aft out of way then cleared out number of warp cork fender other lumber from long boat lifted out of chock finally unshipping gangway launched overboard fisherman fashion dropped astern riding to painter then got mast yard tackle aloft arranged chock in place on main hatch with tremendous amount of fuss with assistance of snatch block windlass winch contrived to hoist in stow life boat have stood in such good stead for nearly fortnight done hand held somewhat lengthy animated pow wow on forecastle head at conclusion of man who have given permission to come aboard came aft pointing to life boat remarked to reckon have made very good job of mister be sure be very much obliged to ye for idee be worth dozen of long boat quite worth trouble have took to put where be then without waiting for response stepped aft peered through skylight stepping to where ship bell hung struck eight bell four o'clock rejoining a stood watching long boat have be cast adrift remarked with clumsy effort at civility tea will be coming along aft in about five minute reckon will be glad of cup s'pose have be gettin much hot food while have be moochin ' about in boat have ye have not replied be impossible to do cooking of kind a of course will readily understand ah well ye will be able to make up for now be rejoinder for here come steward teapot step down below into cabin make at home many thanks said by way be master of vessel gather from ensign being hoisted union down that be in distress what be wrong with chapter three amazing story be now passing down companion ladder on way to cabin a finished speaking man to whom addressed question who have led way below motioned to enter open doorway at foot of stair obeying invitation found in small rather dark stuffy cabin very plainly fitted up woodwork painted dark oak colour beam underside of deck planking overhead imparting little cheerfulness to small interior by being painted white while locker be covered with cushion of much worn plush have once be crimson through age wear dirt have become almost black place be lighted by small skylight in deck two port scuttle on side at one end of skylight be screwed clock while to other end be screwed mercurial barometer hung in gimbal immediately over chair at fore end of table hung tell tale compass table be laid with damask table cloth have seen better day doubt have once be white while ware be white of thick solid character defies breakage well filled bread barge containing ordinary ship biscuit stood at one end of table flanked by dish of butter on one side pot of jam on other tray be placed at starboard side of table amidships at fore end there stood dish containing large lump of salt beef behind three plate with carving knife fork alongside to chair in front of at head of table man who be acting part of host now waved hand mutely inviting to take certainly not said be master of ship presume a such be of course rightful place why must surrender to ah be just where make mistake mr er er forget name be not skipper be bosun name enderby john enderby man indicating individual who at moment joined be william johnson carpenter otherwise chip then where be skipper mate demanded be what be in distress about answered boatswain sit down sir please let get on with tea while be gettin ' of will spin ye yarn be why chip be havin ' tea down here aft afternoon at other time mess with rest of men in fo cbele a soon a comed aboard reckernised that 'd want to know in out of here traverse that find in so 't be arranged that chip must have tea with ye explain whole thing see said well may heave ahead while carve beef can do listen at same time yes assented enderby then breathing deeply gazed steadfastly at clock for so long time with air of such complete abstraction at length chip who be sitting on locker alongside gave awakening nudge of elbow accompanied by injunction heave ahead man heave ahead will never get under way if show better than ay be right there lad sha be fact returned enderby trouble be that know where to make start whether to begin with what happened night afore last whether 'twould be best to go back to sailin ' from london perhaps last will be better plan suggested if start at very beginning will stand better chance of understanding whole affair ay ay yes of course will agreed boatswain well be like here began left london last september will find exact date in log book with full cargo for cape town complement bein ' thirteen told thirteen unlucky number mister a soon a reckernised that ship company totted up to knowed must have trouble in shape form arrived at cape town right discharged cargo took in ballast filled up water tank got away to sea again right be until night afore last that trouble comed along skipper name be stenson mate called john barber 'low be a likely a not purser name for never liked man more did of for though be good enough seaman have very nasty temper be everlastin'ly naggin ' men appeared that skipper be old friend anyway knowed one pretty well havin ' be schoolfellers together story go that while ago man barber bein ' at time on beam end runned foul of skipper begged help from spinnin ' yarn about lot of treasure that 'd found on island somewhere away to east'ard offerin ' to go share if 'd help barber to get hold of stuff dunno whether yarn true skipper believed for upshot of be that cap'n stenson who might say be owner of yorkshire lass hustled around got general cargo for cape town after dischargin ' took in ballast sailed in search of here treasure well everything worked right until night afore last when barber who be takin ' middle watch went below for reason brought skipper up on deck svorenssen who be at wheel say that pair of 'em walked fore aft in waist for goodish bit talkin ' together then suddenly got to high word then in minute started fightin ' strugglin ' together before svorenssen must sing out do anything be at rail pair of 'em went overboard locked in one arm went overboard reiterated good heaven what extraordinary thing be effort made to save svorenssen sung out of course replied boatswain must leave wheel for 't be pipin ' up freshish breeze on port quarter be doin ' about seven seven half knot with topmast lower stunsails set to port of course have to take 'em in clew up royal to'ga'ntsail haul down gaff top l before must round to took so long that at last when 'd brought hooker to wind hove to have got jolly boat over side knowed that 'd be earthly use to look for of same took boat with three hand pulled back over course 'd come a near a must guess at although pulled about until daylight never got sight of of what truly extraordinary story repeated pray who be now in command of ship well s'pose be a much a anybody though there have be much commandin '' since skipper be lost answered enderby be oldest most experienced man aboard others have be sort of lookin ' to to advise what to do since there be ne'er one of a know anything about navigation advised that must heave to hoist signal of distress then wait until something comed along must supply with navigator now that have comed along need waste more of fine fair wind because s'pose wo have objection to do navigatin ' for eh that depends entirely upon where be bound for replied of course will be very pleased to navigate ship to nearest port on way can not promise to do more than have not yet told where be bound did not understand that be to island ay yes be right answered boatswain here raised voice to shout billy come here lad tell gen'leman what know about here v'yage whereupon to astonishment very intelligent looking boy of apparently about eleven twelve year of age emerged from pantry where appeared have be helping steward stood before alert evidently prepared to answer question be only little chap fair haired blue eyed eyelid be red a though have recently be cry there be honesty straightforwardness fearlessness in way in looked straight in eye evident eagerness in manner greatly pleased said enderby by way of introduction be billy stenson skipper son have mother pore little chap so have be comin ' to sea with father last two three year have billy yes be quite right bosun answered boy well now gentleman mr er dashed if can remember name mister proceeded enderby blackburn prompted thank ' e sir blackburn well billy continued boatswain here mr blackburn be first class navigator havin ' be orficer aboard liner will be able to take to barber treasure island if anybody can of course will have to know whereabouts be afore can navigate ship to now that pore father um no longer aboard reckon that be only one who can say what be latitood longitood of be just what ca do bosun answered billy know what latitude of be longitude matter mr barber did know father did know know exclaimed do mean to tell that father actually started out with deliberate intention of looking for island latitude only of knew yes sir answered boy be right let tell how happened know because father told story lot of time besides have heard mr barber talking about so often that be not likely to forget word of be how be before mr barber met father last time be mate of dutch ship trading out of batavia collecting sandalwood shell called at place named named waing do mind sir if get chart show place on somehow never can exactly remember name of place can point out on chart because have listened watched while father mr barber talked over together yes said by mean get chart boy will be able to understand story ever so much better with before whereupon lad entered state room at fore end of main cabin presently returned with chart of malay archipelago spread open on table there said pointing with finger be place called at waingapu in sumba island pencil mark mr barber drew to show track of ship boat afterwards a nearly a must remember after leaving waingapu ship sailed along line pointing with finger through maurissa strait up to here here mr barber dutch captain have terrible quarrel fight know what about because mr barber did say ended in mr barber being turned adrift by in boat with small stock of provision one breaker of fresh water boat be old one very leaky have sail so mr barber must hing just let drift hoping day that something must come along pick up nothing came five day later found that water be gone breaker havin ' be leaky next thing happened be that mr barker got light headed with thirst used to make feel awfully uncomfortable to hear tell about thing thought saw while be way at last got so thirsty that must stand longer bein ' mad filled baler with water from over side drank then found that water be fresh drank more sens came back to lookin ' round saw that there be land on side of boat that be in sort of wide river although land be so plain in sight mr barber be so weak that must do anything for while be light headed 'd hove grub overboard be now starving so just have to let boat drift with wind after bit drove ashore even then mr barber must do anything just climb out of boat fling down upon sand where slept until next morning when woke up felt bit better awfully hungry so got up seeing few tree not far off managed to crawl over to 'em be lucky enough to find fruit on said did know what fruit be did care be so awfully hungry that 'd have eaten even if 'd known be poison be be quite good after have felt so much stronger that went back to beach moored boat to big boulder so that must drift away now that mr barber have found food water set about taking care of so that might get strong again be able to get away from where be because of course did want to spend rest of day there wanted to find out a much a must about place so a soon a be strong enough began to wander about bit explorin in particular wanted to have look at something that thought might be house overgrown with creeper when at last be able to get to found that be very ancient ship that thought must have drove ashore during height of very heavy gale of wind when level of sea surface be raised several foot above ordinary deeply flooding low ground where found of course mr barber climbed aboard have good look round thinking that 'd perhaps be able to take up quarter aboard until must get away from place found timber deck planking so rotten that be safe to move about aboard same gave good overhaul down in run found little room in eight big chest bound round with thick steel band with lot of trouble broke open five of 'em found packed full of gold silver thing coin candlestick image thing that believed have be stolen out of church with chain ring bracelet thing of sort other three chest have in sort of gem diamond ruby emerald forget name of thing said found in remember said that looked a though 'd be broken out of article of jewellery two of chest be full chock block other be about three part full said that altogether treasure must be worth million so a soon a mr barber felt well strong enough to get away from place caulked seam of boat water breaker with kind of cotton that found growing wild made mat sail for boat out of grass laid in stock of fruit water taking handful of gem along with went out to sea again before leaving place got meridian altitude of sun by setting stick upright in ground measuring length of shadow very carefully several day running in way afterwards found that latitude of wreck be about degree minute south then when be satisfied that 'd got position near enough to be able to find again set sail went out to sea be unlucky again for on very night gale sprang up sail be blown away have work cut out to keep boat from being swamped then fell ill again went crazy once more coming to again aboard chinese junk bound for singapore of course first thing did be to search for little packet of gem be gone although strongly suspected chinese of having stolen swore that have seen nothing of at singapore mr barber applied for help a distressed sailor after waiting bit be sent home in ship bound for london four day after landed in london met father who helped by giving money inviting to take up quarter for bit aboard yorkshire lass then told father about treasure kept on talkin ' about evenin ' when day work be done until at last father agreed to help mr barber to search for treasure mr barber to go half in everything found mr barber to come with a mate think sir be quite enough too said why be most amazing story to have ever listened do really mean to say that father actually allowed to be persuaded into engaging in such wild goose chase a of hunting for spot of latitude only be known that merely approximately must imagine yes indeed sir be fact answered billy know because father mr barber drew up agreement signed father keeping one copy mr barber other father copy be in desk now if 'd care to see later on perhaps said there be other more pressing matter requiring attention just now er unfortunate affair of night before last have suppose upset plan clapped effectual stopper on treasure hunting scheme eh asked turning to boatswain oh sir have answered enderby looked bit like first off will allow 'cause see loss of old man mate left without navigator none of knew way to head ship chip bein ' only two officer left have confab together then mustered rest of hand put to 'em whether 'd agree to what two proposed what proposed be barber have evidently persuaded cap'n stenson that there be no mistake about treasure actually that might be found with bit of tryin ' otherwise ship must be where be now then there be agreement between two by treasure when found be to be equally divided between 'em of havin ' gone over side agreement must be carried out there be billy here there be crew of ship what chip proposed be first of to get hold of navigator who 'd agree to join in with then go try to find treasure arrangement bein billy a father son must have half of crew navigator must divide other half equally between there be lot of palaver over naturally know sir what sailor men be at last everybody agreed then since did know where to head for hove to waitin ' for something to come along whereby must get hold of navigator then at last along come havin ' turned up s'pose there be reason why must haul down ensign swing head yard fill away to complete v'yage said reason at why must not do thing advise to fill on ship at once steer a be heading when have misfortune to lose skipper mate do know what that course be oh yes answered enderby course be north east quarter east very good said let be course until will have have opportunity to take set of sight to determine ship position suppose captain stenson have sextant chronometer necessary navigation table aboard yes sir said billy be in state room if will come with will show to thanks said what be chiefly interested in just now be chronometer do happen to know when be last wound billy yes sir answered boy last sunday morning father used always to wind sunday morning directly after breakfast good remarked then everything will be quite right now bosun what about berthing where can stow difficulty at about sir answered enderby old man state room be place for because instrument chart book be in there a of course will want place to billy can shift over into mate state room be also vacant excellent suggestion remarked right agreed enderby then will call settled steward when functionary appeared boatswain continued joe be mr blackburn new skipper will take order from in future joe see that thing be straightened up in two state room bed made so on steward very cheerfully assented enderby carpenter then rose to go on deck quickly followed by two men went for'ard joined little crowd assembled on forecastle to whom a of course surmised forthwith proceeded to relate what have passed in cabin whatever may have be seemed to afford hearer satisfaction for smiled nodded approval from time to time a story be being told when at length be ended came aft while one hand hauled down ensign stowed away stationed at wheel remainder tailed on to brace swung headyards boarded foretack trimmed jib staysail sheet getting way upon ship bringing to former course after without waiting for order from set port topgallant topmast lower studding sail done boatswain carpenter came aft to where stood inquired whether what have be done met with approval to replied in affirmative now sir about watch remarked enderby before night afore last mate took port watch starboard now that mate gone how must be if be to take port chip starboard watch must suit ye sir yes said must be excellent arrangement think by way how many do muster in watch four in includin chip answered boatswain um none too many especially considering part of world to be bound remarked will have to keep sharp eye upon weather call in good time if must be in least doubt a to what ought to do have of ever be way before have not appeared what about forecastle crowd asked be good reliable men of be foreigner be yes answered enderby lowering voice drawing away from vicinity of man at wheel yes worse luck four ab be foreigner not that have got anything very special to say against be good sailor men of 'em fact be sir like bein shipmate with foreigner like way of have got very nasty temper there be svorenssen for instance big chap with red hair beard be roosian finn have got vile temper believe be unforgivin sort of feller remembers thing against man if understand what mean then there be dutchy ' a call that chap that pushed for'ard when hoisted in boat be awk'ard feller to get on with too hate bein ' ordered about believe in discipline svorenssen will be in watch will see to that mind p q other two be so bad 'd be lot better if svorenssen dutchy be out of ship ah well said be five englishman to four of if must take into head to be insubordinate have doubt will know how to deal with now must like to have look at log book suppose know where be kept yes answered enderby skipper used to keep in cabin billy will give show want to see know where father kept everything oh forgot to mention supper will be on table at seven o'clock righto returned a wheeled about headed for companion chapter four take command of yorkshire lass billy boy where be called a entered cabin here be sir replied lad emerging from have be father state room be there anything can do for sir billy stenson be certainly amusing very lovable little chap a stood there before alert bright eyed reminding somehow of dog asking for stick to be thrown into water that may show how cleverly can retrieve if billy have possessed tail be certain that at moment must have be wagging vigorously yes billy said must like to see ship log book enderby tell that know where be kept can find for must like look at chart that showed little while ago also if can put hand upon agreement between father mr barber must like to look through with other paper there may be bearing upon matter story be very remarkable one feel greatly interested in yes sir said billy will get log book chart agreement think 'd like to see father diary too sir when met mr barber began to talk about goin ' huntin ' for treasure started to keep diary writin down in everything that mr barber told about there be drawin ' in that mr barber made sort of picture of place showing how looked so that might know when saw again ah said must certainly like to see that diary if care to show perusal of will be most interesting will probably tell want to know few minute later be seated at table with chart spread open before log book open diary at hand ready for immediate reference log book however have nothing to do with story of treasure simply recorded daily happening aboard brigantine position noon from date of departure from london only interest have for be that enabled to approximate position of ship at moment of tragedy have be written up to four o'clock in afternoon of day on tragedy have occurred while log slate carried on story up to midnight few minute sufficed to make fully acquainted with required to learn from log book then laid aside turned to diary document be inscribed in thick manuscript book appeared to have be started about time when writer first began seriously to entertain barber proposal to join in search for treasure opened with record of meeting between barber writer set forth at length story of barber destitute condition what writer did to ameliorate then followed in full detail barber story of adventure culminating in discovery of stranded wreck chest of treasure stowed down in run with expression of barber conviction that ship have be pirate also recorded at length step barber have taken to obtain necessary data from to calculate latitude of wreck be ingenuity of man method that at last began to impress upon conviction that story might possibly be true especially a be illustrated by sketch drawn from memory be true showing appearance of land from entrance of river very much in same way that chart be occasionally illustrated for guidance of seaman story be succeeded by record of successive stage by negotiation between writer barber advanced winding up with final statement that on such such date agreement have be drawn up in duplicate signed by contracting party whereby stenson be to bear entire cost of expedition recouping so far a might be by securing freight along route barber undertaking to discharge duty of mate during voyage without pay proceeds of such treasure a might be found to be equally divided between two men perusal of diary fully occupied right up to moment when steward entered to lay table for supper when have finished found regarding adventure with very different eye from have turned upon to start with to be perfectly frank when first heard yarn have not particle of faith in existence of treasure quite set down late skipper a credulous fool for risking hard earned money in such hare brained speculation after reading story a set out in extenso with very great wealth of detail felt by mean sure that skipper stenson very far from being credulous fool have originally supposed to be might not prove to have be exceedingly shrewd wide awake person in word have begun to believe in truth of story of treasure strange incredible a have seemed at first hearing change of view on part involved corresponding change in attitude toward adventure conversation with enderby johnson over tea table have left upon mind impression have be invited by a representative of entire crew to act a navigator assist in possible way to secure treasure remuneration for service to be one share of value of amount of treasure obtained now barber have expressed opinion that value be to be reckoned in million eight chest notwithstanding regarded estimate a enormously exaggerated result probably of ignorance of value on barber part nevertheless assuming value to be very considerably le say million believed might possibly amount to only very simple calculation be needed to show that if sum be divided by two one of part be awarded to billy a skipper stenson remaining sum of one quarter of million divided into eleven equal part there being eleven prospective participant including must yield to participant nearly twenty three thousand pound sum very well worth trying for viewing matter in bearing finally came to conclusion that regarding merely a speculation might be quite worth while to throw in lot with men project certainly have allurement for must be remembered be then young enough to be thoroughly imbued with spirit of adventure be poor even bare possibility of making over twenty thousand pound in few month very powerfully appealed to finally if rejected chance made best of way back home there be possibility might be out of employment for considerable period while at best must hope for nothing better than billet a fourth officer in planet boat in fine more considered boatswain proposal better liked at same time inward monitor whispered that must be wise not to manifest too keen readiness to fall in with men proposal while reflection be passing through mind noticed that steward in laying table for supper be laying for one person only while arrangement have advantage also have certain disadvantage regarded a outweighing former therefore bade lay for boatswain carpenter a well for have sense enough to recognise importance of keeping finger upon pulse of crew so to speak knew that must best be done by mean of little confidential chat with boatswain chip who be men representative steward presently brought along from galley chief ingredient of supper consisting of pot of piping hot cocoa dish of steaming lobscouse to be followed informed by jam tart then sent billy up on deck to find enderby bid come to supper in cabin during progress of meal conversation be of general character consisting chiefly of discussion concerning weather behaviour of ship under various circumstance relation of certain not very interesting incident connected with voyage after have finished chip have come down to take supper while enderby took over charge of deck boatswain fell into step alongside a paced fore aft enjoying unwonted luxury of pipe there be just one p'int in what be said at tea time mr blackburn remarked that feel bit hazy about have be able to make quite clear to men remember that when spoke about navigatin ' ship for said 'd be willin ' to do so far a nearest port be about what be be yes replied be what said so thought concurred boatswain well sir continued do mean that be unwillin ' to take hand in here treasure huntin game with oh a to said really have not have time to consider matter a yet besides quite know what be that men propose let know will give matter most careful consideration ay ay yes of course be quite right agreed enderby will have talk to chap for'ard hear what have got to say about about nearest port ' that mentioned sir have ye got particular port in mind eye n o can scarcely say that have returned if have be probably port louis mauritius idea be very hazy thus far must understand for at present moment know where ship be will be unable to discover position until can take requisite sight then will have out chart prick off position discus matter further yes sir thank e answered enderby will be time to morrow s'pose certainly agreed time to morrow unless of course sky must be obscured by cloud preventing taking of necessary observation think need not seriously fear anything of kind sir no not much fear of agreed enderby therewith trundled away for'ard joined little group of men who seemed to be somewhat impatiently awaiting be pleasant evening sun be on point of setting western sky be magnificent picture of massed cloud ablaze with most brilliant hue of gold scarlet crimson purple while zenith be vast dome of purest richest ultramarine fresh breeze be blowing steadily out from about west sou ' west there be long rather high swell overrun by sea just heavy enough to break in squadron of creaming foam cap must have meant anxious night for have still be adrift in life boat apart from white foam cap ocean be wide expanse of deepest sapphire blue over brigantine be rolling plunging at speed of fully eight knot taut rigging humming like aeolian harp with sweep of wind through for several minute after enderby have left stood gazing in admiration at brilliant exhilarating scene then for mere pleasure of stretching leg bit after being for so long cramped within confined limit of life boat started upon vigorous tramp fore aft weather side of deck between wheel grating main rigging on following morning immediately after breakfast have long talk with enderby who came aft to lay before proposal of men a to term upon be to be admitted to partnership in adventure be in brief that in consideration of undertaking navigation of ship be to receive one eleventh part of half of treasure to be shared among crew so far so good have objection to part of proposal when came to question of status in ship learned that four foreigner insisted upon brigantine being run upon strictly socialistic line there be to be skipper officer giving of order ship be to be worked by two committee consisting of two watch who be to decide question a to making shortening trimming sail while be to have authority voice in anything except just determination of course to be steered well demanded what have englishman to say to proposal oh a to said enderby chip be dead against know a must work at fancy sayin ' svorenssen nip up aloft stow that there to'garns l turnin ' round sayin ' if want to'garns l stowed up stow ' oh must never do of course must not returned do other englishman think of why fancy much care one way t'other answered enderby ye see sir be ignorant lot can easy be talked over by chap with gift of gab like svorenssen van ryn 'd be all right if be left to self be treated a if be men not just dumb cattle at mercy of brutal driver dago have way of talkin ' about one man being a good a make ignorant men feel dissatisfied with thing way be just so returned have be shipmate with class of man before to day know from experience what mischief socialistic doctrine can work in ship forecastle elsewhere now can go for'ard explain to men that if be to remain in ship to navigate to find spot where treasure be supposed to be will have socialism aboard condition insist on be that be to be skipper be to issue such order a may deem necessary for safety of ship welfare of hand be to be obeyed without question argument of kind if men agree to condition well good if not shape course for nearest port leave ship there right ye be sir returned enderby ye may trust to put matter to chap in way that will understand think a there will be trouble to speak of if there be fancy that chip will be able to deal with with that boatswain walked away forward to convey ultimatum to men who be gathered on forecastle head evidently waiting for while turned to billy who be standing close by said when father took sight billy who used to note chronometer time mr barber always answered billy then father used to work out calculation together if want anybody to note time when be taking sight mr blackburn can do for be sure can do quite accurately asked quite sure asserted billy just try sir very well will said come below let see what can do billy soon demonstrated that be to be implicitly trusted in matter of noting chronometer time while took sight morning being gloriously fine have difficulty in determining longitude of ship found to be degree minute second east while meridian altitude of sun taken two hour later gave latitude a degree minute second south then got out chart of indian ocean pricked off ship position on sat down to consider what must be next step for whether decided to remain in ship to leave position a now laid down on chart showed that shift of helm must be necessary did not take very long to decide that in case must take ship into port louis harbour mauritius might be reached in week le if weather held favourable thence must report to owner loss of saturn also if decided to quit yorkshire lass there must have choice of two route home namely by messageries maritimes via madagascar suez canal by union castle line via cape town atlantic if on other hand crew acceded to condition be to remain in ship to call at port louis must be deviating mere trifle from straight course for east end of sandalwood island whence must pas through maurissa strait go over a nearly a might be ground that barber be said to have travelled before struck spot where be supposed to have found treasure when at length went up on deck again enderby be waiting for well said have people for'ard made up mind what be going to do be rather anxious to know because upon decision will depend final plan be right mr blackburn answered boatswain two chap svorenssen van ryn seemed to have quite made up mind to have thing own way chip soon brought up with round turn by tellin ' hand what 'd said say now look here chap have got navigator want if here treasure place be to be found may all bet boot will find wo have socialism no runnin ' ship by committee nonsense of sort will be mister skipper none of forget now be quite satisfied when cap'n stenson commanded ship what difference do make to of whether be stenson mr blackburn give order make hap'orth of difference to e'er one of ye very well then chip have be talkin ' thing over together have decided that havin ' be lucky enough to get hold of mr blackburn ai goin ' to lose 'im because of socialistic tommy rot so if there be anybody here a object to mr blackburn condition let say so will ask new skipper to put in somewhere will shove dissatisfied one ashore there be fine old rumpus when said that four dago swore a be goin ' to be done out of share of treasure for nobody nobody be goin ' to put out of ship for minute two looked a though be goin ' to have mutiny englishman stuck together others backin ' up chip at last when dago seen way wind be blowin ' give in said right might 'ave own way since seemed so stuck upon so there be sir be new skipper if dago get obstropolous will just shove ashore even if have to maroon scarcely think will be necessary to adopt such extremely drastic step a said if foreigner be made to understand that rest of will stand nonsense from will probably settle down quietly enough if if manifest least inclination to be troublesome will put ashore at port louis mauritius at port intend to call in case may report loss of saturn send certain letter home will take very little out of way if dago learn that be going to call in at british port on way may steady bit help to see that wisest plan will be to settle down behave now be going to shift helm haul up to ' east take pull upon lee brace during ensuing six day made excellent progress brigantine revealing quite unexpected most welcome turn of speed carried to port louis exactly week after have boarded remained there four day to enable to dispatch cablegram home receive reply after having meanwhile laid in good supply of fruit little fresh meat sailed again shaping course for maurissa strait for four day following departure from port louis did well then breeze lessened in strength became baffling finally died away altogether leaving helplessly becalmed except when for few minute at time vagrant draught of air must come stealing along glassy surface of sea imparting to evanescent tint of delicate blue then there must be call upon watch to man brace trim yard to meet transient breathing to muttered disgust of men who must see advantage in labour resulted in many case in moving ship only to extent of few fathom have to be done for be on border line between prevailing westerly wind of southern ocean south east trade to get into latter ship have to be jockeyed across intervening belt of calm curious fact in connection with time of trial to patience be fact that caused anxious speculation be that two men svorenssen van ryn who at outset of connection with seemed most likely to be source of trouble be two who grumbled least at continual call to brace be on afternoon of fourth of trying day that a lay becalmed in middle of glass sea polished surface became touched here there with faint evanescent patch of softest turquoise blue appearing for moment then vanishing again be cat paw that indicated momentary stir in stagnant air appearance of be always greeted by foremast hand with execration for meant box hauling yard work for what regarded a ludicrously inadequate result on occasion cat paw instead of enduring for few second then being more seen for hour at time lingered for a long perhaps a two three minute then passing away only to be succeeded by others coming from same quarter enduring little longer than predecessor so continuing until at length not only got way upon ship be able to maintain during lessening interval between one puff finally moment arrived when cat paw began to merge one into while whole surface of sea down in south eastern quarter lost hateful mirror like appearance donned tint of faintest most delicate blue deepened even a watched creeping steadily down toward until reached ship with last gentle rustle of canvas yielded to impulse of first breathing of south east trade when at true breeze reached came away out from about south east by south enabling still to lay course on starboard tack with brace merest trifle checked once fairly set in wind rapidly freshened until when of afterguard went down to supper at seven o'clock evening fiery breeze be humming through tautened rigging hooker be reeling off seven knot with royal stowed rapidly rising sea foaming under lee bow chapter five find treasure be grand evening when after supper went on deck for usual constitutional salt ozone laden breeze be just cool enough to set one blood coursing freely through one vein to fill one with joy of living ship be making good headway sky over lee quarter be gorgeous blaze of gold colour where sun be sinking in midst of galaxy of cloud of most wonderful form be like yachting experience in latitude glory of sunset very quickly fade with disappearance night fall upon scene like drawing of curtain so be on evening in question have grown accustomed to rapid nightfall for few minute immersed in own thought be quite unaware of anything unusual in surroundings a darkness deepened around however suddenly occurred to that there be something strange in appearance of water instead of colour deepening under shadow of night a usual seemed to be becoming lighter a though be being diluted with increasing quantity of milk until a stood watched wondering became first of snow white then a darkness continued to deepen star appeared entire ocean from horizon to horizon became sea of luminous molten silver weird unearthly beauty of there be word to describe yet beautiful a be unusual almost unique character of phenomenon invested with awe inspiring element be not very far removed from terror especially for men on forecastle whose anxious glance aft restless agitated movement sufficiently proclaimed apprehension presently chip who be in charge of watch who have be padding fore aft on lee side of after deck crossed over remarked what be matter with water to night mr blackburn boy man have used sea good twenty year more never have seen sight like do signify anything particular think ye nothing beyond most unusual exceedingly beautiful state of phosphorescence replied have not used sea for anything like so long time a have seen something of same kind once before though nothing like so brilliant beautiful a be not so very far from spot saw while making run from cape town to melbourne be due to presence in quite unusual number of animalculae produce appearance of phosphorescence in water while under ordinary circumstance animalculae be only present in sufficient number to cause usual appearance of star luminous cloud in agitated water be present here to night in such incalculable myriad that light emit instead of being more le detached be merged into one uniform blaze of beautiful silvery radiance see may last for several hour yet sooner later will become normal again explanation seemed to afford chip considerable relief presently sauntered away for'ard with evident intention of allaying apprehension of forecastle hand while prognostication a to ending of phenomenon be verified about hour later there now ensued full month more during steadily plodded way across indian ocean close hauled day after day with nothing more eventful than occasional capture of shark capful of wind to break somewhat wearisome monotony of voyage during devoted hour two day to improvement of master billy stenson education also giving considerable amount of study to late skipper diary in endeavour to arrive at sort of conclusion a to whereabouts of spot where barber alleged treasure be to be looked for taking barber determination of latitude of place degree minute south a being approximately correct ruled pencil line representing that parallel right across chart noted various island that crossed then marking spot where man have be turned adrift by dutch skipper strove to trace course over boat have drifted taking into consideration prevailing wind current a set forth in sailing direction in way ultimately arrived at conclusion that spot be seeking must be found somewhere between meridian of degree degree east longitude still assuming barber story to be true reasoned that fact of stranded ship having remained so long where be apparently unvisited uninterfered with until englishman arrival upon scene argued that be to be found on island not only uninhabited also very rarely visited reasoning thus be at length enabled to make fairly shrewd guess a to most likely direction in to look for in direction accordingly headed ship be about month after passage through maurissa strait that a be working to windward against light fickle breeze land be sighted about three point on weather bow time be close upon eight bell in afternoon watch land sighted be mere dot of faintest blue showing just clear of horizon have be anticipating appearance at moment since have worked out sight at noon pricked off ship position on chart for spot of be in search be unknown mysterious island careful study of barber narrative a recorded in late skipper stenson diary have convinced that island be quite well known have be more le thoroughly surveyed exhaustive study of diary chart combined have finally led to conclusion that if treasure really existed must be found not very far from peak have just hove in sight of must perhaps be better able to judge when must see little more of took ship telescope out of becket where hung in companion slinging over shoulder made way up to royal yard where seated comfortably steadying tube of instrument against masthead brought to bear upon land to windward from elevated position now showed a steep cone of moderate height rising from one extremity of long range of lofty hill running away in south easterly direction until sank below horizon so far so good contour of distant land a revealed by lens of telescope agreed in general way fairly accurately with sketch made from memory by barber in late skipper diary illustrating passage descriptive of appearance of treasure country a have appeared to man upon departure from if a drew nearer certain arrangement of white rock outcropping on hill side immediately below cone must reveal must then know beyond possibility of doubt have found spot of be in search condition of certainty must not possibly be arrived at before morrow at earliest for land be quite fifty mile away be dead to windward ship working up against light breeze be approaching at rate of le than knot hour happily for impatience matter shortly afterwards improved somewhat for with setting of sun breeze freshened by end of second dog watch be slashing away to windward at fine rate reeling off eight knot per hour with royal stowed breeze held through night when went on deck at eight o'clock on following morning cone have viewed through telescope on previous evening be only fifteen sixteen mile distant broad on weather bow arrangement of white rock on hill side five of forming vertical line diary assured be distinguishing mark by might identify spot for be searching be clearly visible in lens of telescope while mouth of estuary be about five mile ahead yes said to enderby who be standing beside a closed instrument be right so far opening to nor'ard of curious hummock be mouth of estuary into barber drifted while in state of delirium stranded hulk be supposed to contain treasure stand according to somewhere on southern shore will have to make short board along southern shore keeping sharp look out for anything in nature of stranded craft anchor abreast go ashore give careful overhaul thus far look a though there might be truth in man story have longer doubt that barber actually entered that estuary will still have to see wreck before be finally convinced of existence barber be admittedly crazy when landed yonder for that know to contrary may have remained crazy time that be there have imagined whole thing holy moses exclaimed boatswain in consternation surely mean to say sir that after time still have doubt about truth of there treasure yarn do ye if find wrack there will be dickens to pay in forecastle men especially dago will be that disapp'inted that there be knowin ' what game may try to play how what do mean boatswain demanded sharply well mr blackburn returned what mean be that if find wrack chap will be so disapp'inted that in rage may rise upon afterguard try to take ship from good must do demanded if be to attempt so foolish thing be to succeed what must do with ship suppose even dolt a must prove in such event a mention must not be idiot enough to suppose that must compensate for disappointment by becoming pirate eh blest if know what might believe if svorenssen two dutchman got talkin ' to 'em asserted boatswain be wonderful talker three of 'em be everlastin'ly gassin ' about one man bein a good a freedom right of man know sir sort of slush that such chap spout that shellback swallers a greedily a must pannikin of egg flip yes said know have heard over over again until have be sick tired of listening to have wondered how be that sensible level headed british sailor even though may not have have very much education can swallow believe in such froth however be very glad that have mentioned matter will keep weather eye lifting at very first sign of trouble will act to purpose too be right sir hope will approved enderby if action must ever be needful may depend upon chip to back ye up in meantime will keep eye ear open too let know directly see sign of trouble brewin ' when descended to cabin few minute later in response to steward summons to breakfast found billy stenson already seated at table billy must explain have within two day of arrival aboard yorkshire lass be promoted from position of pantry boy to of passenger in virtue of fact that through father death have become owner of brigantine inheritor of prospective profit might accrue in respect of present highly speculative voyage have also become pupil having undertaken to ground in rudiment of navigation good morning billy said do happen to know whether there be firearm weapon of sort aboard here yes mr blackburn replied lad when father mr barber agreed upon voyage decided that ought to have mean of defending ship if necessary so father bought dozen rifle with bayonet three brace of navy revolver with good supply of ammunition for kind of firearm be in two case down in lazarette do men for'ard know be aboard asked oh sir think so answered lad came aboard be stored away week more before crew be shipped good commented then turning to enderby who also be present said what said on deck little while ago suggests to that will be wise thing to have case up out of lazarette without further delay will open give content overhaul clean oil ready for immediate use if need be may not require if on other hand must need will probably be so urgent that there will then be time for preparation will have up immediately after breakfast upon return to deck found that be just entering estuary mouth of be about three mile wide shore on side being quite low with here there narrow strip of beach composed of sand gravel low flat shore on side of inlet be backed by range of hill extending inland a far a eye must see whereas low flat country between shore base of hill be le than mile wide on northern bank ranged from five to twelve mile wide on southern side soil be everywhere grass clad grass seeming to be very luxuriant about three foot high while dotted about pretty thickly over plain be clump of palmetto palm tree of various kind of must probably be fruit tree that have restored barber to life big clump of bamboo scrub anticipated that must be among clump of scrub that must eventually find treasure hulk if indeed craft actually existed be not figment of madman imagination also foresaw that search for hulk might easily be very much more arduous protracted affair than have anticipated for appeared to that one of clump big enough to conceal hull of five hundred ton hulk ought to be examined there be need however for to begin search quite at once for be only entering estuary whereas according to barber account hulk lay six eight mile from entrance assumed distance be of course very vague unreliable guide therefore determined to take ship up inlet about five mile anchor commence search at point gradually working way upward meanwhile wind have come away far enough out from southward to enable to hug southern shore a closely a pleased consequently although breeze be light made good progress within hour have reached point at decided quest might very well begin therefore anchored furled canvas hoisted out jolly boat making up search party consisting of four foreigner enderby went ashore began hunt for craft in existence of have little belief chief difficulty be that have bearing to guide concluded that at time of barber visit be destitute of mean to make note record of kind for story be set down entirely from memory be singularly barren of information that of most general character there be little illuminating detail to tell whether be be not nearing goal one solitary fact from must draw useful deduction be that at time of barber arrival in estuary be very ill weak yet despite feeble condition be able to reach certain tree fruit of restored to health now from fact deduced inference that particular fruit tree to barber owed restoration must of necessity be at great distance from beach otherwise man must not have have strength to reach hence to find spot at near barber landed must look for part of plain where tree be growing within say two three hundred yard of water edge there be just one such clump abreast spot where have anchored apart from must see others anything like so near beach for distance of fully mile to eastward confess entered upon treasure hunt hampered by very strong feeling of doubt of course have ocular evidence of existence of place a barber have described a where treasure be to be found for there be visibly before be also prepared to lend credence to story of stranded hulk strange a story might seem for actually have personal knowledge of even stranger happening than be existence of treasure steel bound chest packed with gold silver gem doubted according to barber own story be crazy when drifted into estuary although may not have known perhaps remained crazy time be there if be indeed true that have stumbled upon stranded ancient hulk very fact may have so excited disordered brain a to cause to imagine treasure looking back at episode now after lapse of year that appears to be very much mental attitude with regard to yet doubt notwithstanding be determined to leave stone unturned to test barber story to uttermost consequently when late in afternoon of following day actually came upon hulk chief feeling be one of surprise there be nothing whatever of exciting dramatic character in circumstance connected with discovery be absolutely commonplace be not even molested by native of whom saw sign from first to last having thoroughly searched without result entire area of flat country for space of eight nine square mile immediately opposite spot where brigantine be first anchored got under way again under fore aft canvas only moved ship three mile farther up estuary intently studying country on starboard hand meanwhile through ship telescope on look out for object suggestive of stranded hulk overgrown with creeper be in way that found telescope enabling to identify at distance of fully mile arrived abreast of again anchored brigantine same search party under command once more landed walked straight to hulk lay high dry at distance of about quarter of mile from beach dismasted craft of seven hundred ton burden built on line of old spanish galleon with low bow forecastle lofty stern after castle great flat stern embellished with much carving remains of gallery surmounted by iron frame of three big poop lantern doubt have once presented very gallant picture of paintwork gilding trace of be discoverable about here there apart from whole exterior have be reduced by sun rain to uniform tint of neutral grey except where moss fungus have taken hold of boarded without difficulty sooner have arrived below than found ample confirmation of barber statement a to rottenness for what with dry rot white ant deck planking beam have become merest shell of wood yielding freely in place to pressure of man weight so that in order to avoid accident have to move about aboard with utmost circumspection what be very much more to point however be that found not only ship also eight big chest of treasure exactly a described by barber in yarn given in late skipper diary have be broken open content appeared to be intact a very carefully examined arrived at conclusion that have never be touched since barber have left to go in search of assistance needed in order to secure possession of content discovery of chest still more sight of content be naturally productive of utmost excitement also quite naturally at once roused greed be latent in nature so far a enderby be concerned be quite able to control sooner did four dago set eye upon gold coin with one of chest be filled than threw upon chest a starving wolf might throw upon carcass proceeded to stuff pocket with coin of course must not possibly be permitted enderby drawing revolver compelled quartette to replace in chest coin have snatched yielded only under compulsion with snarl growling muttered menace be only silenced by threat to maroon on spot if showed least sign of disposition to give further trouble transfer of eight heavy steel bound chest with content be trying job nothing must induce men to leave single one of where be for night insisted on being allowed to stick to task until be completed by dint of such strenuous effort a probably none of have ever before exerted task be completed few minute after sunset following upon caused whole to be securely fastened up struck down into lazarette forenoon of next day be spent ashore gathering abundant stock of such fruit a place afforded immediately after dinner jolly boat be hoisted in anchor hove up yorkshire lass stood out to sea chapter six caught in typhoon who have never enjoyed experience of suddenly coming upon treasure of enormous value substantial share of one know will one day be one own will naturally suppose that crew of yorkshire lass must be one of happiest most contented little community on face of earth assuredly ought to have be in so far at least a prospective possession of great wealth can confer happiness for little a of knew of actual value of treasure have so easily obtained knew enough to feel assured when time for division must arrive must be rich enough to be independent for rest of life of need to work for living on contrary a matter of fact acquisition of treasure gave rise to condition of restiveness discontent caused grave uneasiness not be greatly surprised from moment when first climbed in over brigantine rail from saturn life boat recognised that presence of four dago in ship company be likely to breed discord be not until witnessed mad covetousness with flung upon chest containing coin proceeded to help regardless of right of others actually began to scent real serious trouble for then foresaw that having once glimpsed treasure men must never more be content until be actually theirs to squander in debauchery that called pleasure trouble anticipated developed within twenty four hour of departure from estuary first taking form of demand on part of six seaman in forecastle that division of treasure must be effected forthwith when pointed out that owing to impossibility of justly valuing such article a gold silver candlestick salver bowl cup casket jewelled cross article of jewellery gem such division a desired be out of question insisted that ship must forthwith be taken to nearest civilised port in order that treasure might be turned into money division effected to replied that only in london must be possible to obtain anything approaching fair value for so enormous treasure a ours therefore to london intended to take whereupon dago became so violently insubordinate that forcible measure have to be resorted to very pretty fight ensued between on one hand boatswain carpenter on other before succeeded in putting quartette in iron dumping down upon ballast in main hold where informed must remain until must show unmistakable sign of having come to sens such resolute action coupled with fact that during confinement food consisted solely of coarse ship biscuit water soon brought insubordinate one to bearing message of unconditional surrender being brought from to within thirty six hour of confinement promising good behaviour in future if must release permit to return to duty naturally be more than willing to accept olive branch thus held out for absence from duty of four able seaman out of little company left ship perilously undermanned must have involved in serious difficulty might indeed have imperilled safety of ship have fallen in with bad weather fortunately however weather for first week after departure from estuary proved to be almost too fine for liking consisting a did of light baffling contrary air interspersed with spell of calm thus temporary confinement below of four foreigner proved of disadvantage to although be heartily glad to have back on duty again nevertheless soon became apparent that reformation be like beauty only skin deep at heart be a ready a ever to give trouble exceptionally fine weather to have just referred continued for nearly month during with much pulling hauling at tack sheet brace contrived to jockey brigantine fairly into pacific where intended to hunt up cargo of copra sandalwood shell on way home extraordinarily long spell of fine weather a have be experiencing be bound to break sooner later break came during afternoon of twenty seventh day out barometer for nearly three week have be standing well above thirty inch gave first warning of coming change by ominously rapid decline of mercury be quickly succeeded by subtle veiling of sky clear rich blue of gradually changed to uniform tint of dirty white in midst of sun hung mere shapeless blotch light breeze during earlier part of day have be fanning along at scant three knot died away leaving surface of sea oil smooth colourless while stagnant air grew so hot that literally felt heat of in nostril with breath drew quality of air seemed to change too rendering difficult to breathe so that found gasping for breath at frequent interval while perspiration poured from in stream that must distinctly feel trickling down body limb so enervating be condition that none of cared to make slightest unnecessary movement yet steady decline of mercury be warning dared not ignore accordingly at eight bell in afternoon watch when enderby took charge of deck showed barometer expressed conviction that be in for typhoon instructed to set hand to task of stripping ship to close reefed topsail reefed fore topmast staysail close reefed main trysail when boatswain went for'ard gave necessary order men received a have quite expected with black look muttered curse inarticulate growl sight of chip lowering stowing big mainsail while surlily slouched about deck letting go halliard clewing up hauling down perhaps more than aspect of heaven conveying message man must misinterpret caused somewhat to modify attitude by four bell ship be a nearly ready for what might come a must make preparation be completed not moment too soon for be in latitude where twilight be unknown with disappearance of sun below horizon there closed down upon darkness might literally be felt for attempt to move about deck well a believed to be acquainted with resulted in constant collision with unexpected obstacle bewildering state of affair continued until shortly after five bell in first watch when became aware that atmosphere be being subtly gradually suffused with ruddy light coming from knew not where change be so gradual that be impossible to say just when began within hour of first perception of light have grown so strong that not only be able to move about freely without running foul of thing standing aft by useless wheel looking forward detail of ship hull spar sail rigging stood out clearly sharply like silhouette cut out of black paper against background of shining oil smooth water dense mass of twisting writhing cloud shape reflecting weird mysterious ruddy light be awe inspiring phenomenon strongly suggestive of supernatural from uneasy glance be directed aft from forecastle be not difficult to surmise none of men have ever before beheld anything like have of afterguard for matter have doubt must have be very much more seriously alarmed than be at spectacle have not read somewhere description of hurricane have be similarly heralded a be be by mean happy at prospect of what be in store for asking uneasily whether quite have be done that be possible to do to prepare ship for impending ordeal there be one thing must think of be to order scuttle to be securely closed be at once done although rendered cabin insupportably hot close of course must have liked to send down royal topgallant yard to have housed fore topgallant mast main topmast must have attempted have have decently willing crew doubted whether dago must have undertaken job except under compulsion be unwilling to engage in tussle with crowd of insubordinates with hurricane threatening to burst upon at moment naturally under circumstance never dreamed of turning in did of others for matter boatswain chip keeping company aft while glance for'ard showed that even forecastle bunch jealous a be of right preferred for once in way to spend watch below on deck shortly after midnight weird ruddy light began to fade indicating that crisis be approaching accordingly sent boy billy below secured companion door closed slide knowing to be one of ship most vulnerable point in heavy sea such a one might expect when gale must burst upon thereafter there be nothing more to be done to abide event be about hour later light have almost entirely faded when got first distinct warning to stand by came in form of sudden scurry of wind apparently from nowhere in particular that swept whining moaning over ship causing canvas to flap violently then be gone occurred perhaps dozen time gust lasting few second longer being perceptibly stronger than one preceded smiting canvas with such violence that quite expected to see fly out of bolt rope while brigantine being only in ballast rocked staggered like drunken man fortunately there remained just light enough to enable to trace direction from tornado came with help therefore chip who at once sprang to wheel managed to get ship head round before hurricane struck enderby going for'ard to stand by on forecastle announced approach by low weird unearthly moaning that with terrifying rapidity swelled to deafening compound of shrieking yell of swooping wind hiss of tempest lashed sea a rushed in form of wall of ghastly heaped up phosphorescent foam stretching from horizon to horizon straight down upon ship spectacle of unbridled outburst of elemental fury be awe inspiring beyond power of word to describe be terrifying too a be evidenced by chip remark moment before gale struck leaning over toward a stood on opposite side of wheel yelled good bye sir be finish ship ai built must weather such outfly a felt very much inclined to agree with to seemed impossible that combination of wood metal work of men hand however cunningly fashioned deftly put together must withstand frenzied onslaught a be about to burst upon instant be within hurricane clutch with yell of indescribable fury blast struck a storm wave boiled in over taffrail swept along deck filling to level of rail taking with in rush for'ard movable thing in way saw storm trysail fill with terrific jerk of doubled sheet then go flying away out of bolt rope like sheet of tissue paper whether not remainder of canvas have withstood strain must not for moment determine for be up to armpit in surging water pinned by pressure of wind so hard up against wheel momentarily expected to feel breast bone collapse under pressure luckily gale came up square astern hit end on luckily also be in ballast ship be therefore quite lively nevertheless felt hull under foot tremble perceptibly under tremendous strain to be subjected a wind sea smote for few breathless moment believed be foundering under then a gradually freed of water flooded deck gathered way went foaming off before gale like mad thing next occurrence of be clearly conscious be that chip be again leaning over toward shouting god mr blackburn be narrer squeak if ever there be one if anybody have told that old hooker must have stood must have ' believed 'em think be right now so long a can keep runnin ' afore if only spar riggin ' will stand strain what about what be ahead of sir be there anything that be likely to run foul of nothing so far a know answered chart show clear sea for hundred of mile to eastward before have run that distance gale will have blown out there be enderby trying to claw way aft wonder what news have for unnatural ruddy light in sky have by time quite died out be replaced by faint ghostly sheen emitted by foaming surface of wind scourged sea by feeble radiance be just possible to discern burly form of boatswain laboriously clawing aft along port bulwark against tremendous pressure of wind presently reached seated upon wheel grating at foot gasping panting for breath well enderby shouted what be news from fore end of ship did sea pooped do damage not so much a might have ' be expected returned boatswain jolly boat clean gone life boat wreck to'gallant bulwark side be gone for'ard of fore riggin ' staysail blowed out of bolt rope directly gale struck worst of have lost three of little crowd lost ejaculated what d 'ye mean man just what say mr blackburn answered boatswain have lost three hand van haalst mendal manning sea broke aboard must have took unawares swept 'em over bow for be on deck before be swept when cleared be gone jove be bad news indeed said be short handed enough before will be worse off than ever now be good men too can ill spare ay agreed enderby there be others that must better have spared if of 'em have to go a to bein ' good men well be good enough sailor men wo deny if 'd lost other way than bein drownded if 'd cut run for instance must have ' grieved overmuch at loss of two dago thereupon fell silent for to out shout yell of wind roar of sea be easy matter moreover loss of three men set thinking on top of that ship needed most careful watching for in light trim a be there be moment when rudder seemed to lose control of then taxed skill strength to utmost to prevent broaching to must have meant end of of hand will never forget night so long a live never before have known blow anything like so hard wind smote one like something solid with such tremendous force to have stood up unsupported against pressure of must have be impossible if have be blowing say half a hard a actually be there must have be terrific sea running far from being case surface of ocean be a flat a billiard table slightest roughness being instantly seized by wind swept away to leeward in form of scud water then there be appalling unnatural darkness through ship be rushing at speed be certain have never before attained only mitigating circumstance be that wind lashed sea emitted certain ghostly radiance that despite deluge of spindrift scud water with air be saturated enabled one dimly to discern object a far forward a foremast to rush at speed at be travelling into heart of pitchy blackness be nerve racking work for although chart assured that have clear sea for hundred of mile ahead there be still such possibility a derelict to be reckoned with under such circumstance a have be endeavouring to describe if obstacle of sort must happen to be in way to avoid must be sheer impossibility while to strike must mean for simply destruction be anxiously considering chance of such eventuality when terrific gust swooped down upon ship trembled lurched forward a though be about to plunge to bottom have done with heard loud crack behind simultaneously received terrible blow on back of head then oblivion dull aching throbbing pain at back of head be sensation of be first conscious upon awaking from what seemed to have be sleep haunted by innumerable harrowing nightmare then before have time to fully realise be once more awake free from torment of dreadful nightmare became aware of two thing first that soft warm salt laden breeze be gently fanning face affording much refreshment next that air be vibrant with deep booming thunder of heavily breaking surf be aware also be in bed that apart from throbbing headache be quite comfortable for perhaps two three minute remained a be quiescent enjoying sensation of comfort quite oblivious of everything else then suddenly occurred to to wonder where be what be matter with head back came memory of awful night of hurricane that terrible blow on back of head opening eye started up with inarticulate cry be to say attempted to start up failed body felt like lead have strength to move after moment ineffectual struggle abandoned attempt let head sink back upon pillow a did so became aware of slight movement at side glancing in direction saw boy billy bending over with expression of deep anxiety in eye a continued to gaze expression of anxiety gave place to one of satisfaction said ah be better mr blackburn believe be not going to die yet after going to die reiterated have be ill then have mistake emphatically asserted boy for four day night have be just raving while refused to take anything occasional drink of water wonder found too weak to rise just now by jove ejaculated amaze billy be puzzled be in own bunk in own cabin there be nice breeze blowing for can feel coming through open scuttle hear seething of water along ship side yet will swear be not moving inch what be explanation will tell in minute two answered billy first let get broth for can see that be about done up need something to strengthen thought morning that seemed bit different when stopped raving dropped off to sleep chance to get something ready for against time when woke up will fetch in jiffy so saying billy disappeared into main cabin returning minute two later with bowl of steaming hot savoury smelling soup with after propping up with cushion cautiously fed little at time until thought have taken a much a be good for then removing cushion lowered gently back into reclining position made comfortable seating by bedside proceeded to make acquainted with happening succeeding accident chapter seven billy tell how became wrecked word began billy sha forget in hurry awful look of sky night when ordered to come below heard slam companion door behind draw over slide felt certain that with sky blazing like when be gettin ' on toward middle of night something dreadful be goin ' to happen did did be frightened enough to start with when battened down tell mr blackburn be fairly terrified two three time climbed half way up companion stair intendin ' to shout to to let out then thought again that must have sent below if have known be best place for so crept back again curled up on locker cushion then came hurricane heard even before struck ship when hit felt shiver made sure that be up with knelt down on cabin floor kept on sayin prayer over over again be still sayin ' when suddenly heard slide pushed back companion door flung open there be scuffling of foot on stair heard enderby chip warnin ' one to be careful then came into cabin carryin ' between 'em laid on cabin table said 'd met with accident saw that head be bleedin ' undressed in hurry put in bunk told to look after then rushed up on deck again shuttin ' in just a did be insensible then so got to work hunted up stuff to make bandage with then opened medicine chest got out book of instruction while be trying to find out what be proper thing to do heard bosun chip shoutin ' something listened tryin ' to hear what be shoutin about then above noise of wind heard sound like well can hardly describe can hear now roar of surf on reef grew louder louder still until be well just deafenin ' then felt ship hove first up then down then touched something did seem to hit very hard felt blow like heavy sea hittin heard fall rush of water on deck crash sounded a if mainmast have gone over side then struck again harder three four time heeling over until seemed to be on beam end flinging right across cabin floor time must hear that be bein ' swept by awfully heavy sea after bit thing got rather more quiet felt that be aground still rolling heavily must hear at roll sort of crunching sound a though planking of ship bottom be grinding upon something sea be coming aboard now nearly so heavy so often a be after time did come aboard at rocking motion eased up thought from sound that did seem to be blowin ' quite so hard time be in bunk insensible a soon a be able to stand without bein ' flung down again got water from pantry filter bathed head there be nasty cut in be still bleedin ' washed a well a must made pad bound tightly over accordin ' to direction found in book then think must have fallen asleep for remember anything more happenin ' until awoke saw sun shinin ' through scuttle cabin skylight be still insensible so bathed head afresh put new dressing on then went on deck to have look round word mr blackburn be astonished when pushed open companion slide looked out ship be ashore on reef total wreck mast gone by board bulwark carried away deck swept everything galley gone be be left of crew good heaven billy surely mean to say that hand except ourselves be lost exclaimed in horrified tone yes do mr blackburn protested boy must be surprised if have heard a did tremendous sea swept ship when first hit reef must have be bit surprised if have gone to piece right then be wonder that deck be clean swept wonder indeed agreed say that be ashore on reef billy what sort of reef be just ordinary rock answered billy be not just jagged seaweed covered rock white almost like marble little bit rough uneven not like rock get at home reef seems to be in piece like great tremendously thick wall yes interrupted think understand be probably coral reef how far doe extend how far reiterated billy why pointing come from away over there a far a can see stretch right across to a far a can see on other side ay agreed coral reef without doubt how much water be there alongside not more than two three foot at most answered billy be standin ' lot higher out of water than be when afloat when first noticed thought be because happened to be low water when looked be that because be always pretty nearly same think there be difference of more than just few inch between high low water in case commented a much to myself a to companion explanation probably be that when hit reef sea be heaped up by gale considerably above usual level that have now subsided again leaving nearly high dry now billy be there land in sight if so what doe look like billy considered for moment two evidently conjuring up mental picture then answered first about two mile off there be beach of very white sand then there be lot of tree palm tree think must be growing along inner edge of beach behind bush more tree thousand million of 'em of sort of colour white yellow green red purple remember seein ' be really black be there mountain on island asked well no not exactly what 'd call mountain think there be plenty of fairly high hill answered billy how big do suppose island to be asked how big repeated billy oh really know quite big place 'd say stretch athwart bow a far a can see way dickens doe exclaimed be very extraordinary can not understand at rate island must be at least thirty mile long yet there be such island shown on chart island of sort indeed large small just where be yet have be under impression that sea have be thoroughly surveyed main fact however one most important to be that be here with very little prospect fear of getting away again for time must turn out begin to get busy there be evidently time to waste billy please find clothes billy regarded gravely then shook head be very well mr blackburn said what be good of talkin ' about turnin ' out when have even got strength enough to lift up in bed sir please attempt to do anything so foolish 'd only fall hurt worse what have got to do be to get well a quick a ever can best way to do be to stay where be until have got strength again will help can will feed up look after tell everything that happens please please be in too great hurry be case of more hurry le speed ' be sure of only trust to mr blackburn will get well a quick a ever can by jove billy said believe will have done marvellously well thus far why boy must have be born to become great physician talk more wisely than many lad of twice age yes will trust absolutely to now come to look at eye be so heavy with sleeplessness that seem scarcely able to keep open how have managed for sleep while have be ill oh answered billy have done pretty well when have be quiet for bit have stretched out on sofa slept until woke with ravin ' now that have come to sens expect will be able to get really good rest hope will said there be time like present so a be feeling very comfortable just now much inclined to sleep go turn in get that really good rest that spoke of leave open door of state room that of own if need anything will call out for thanks to tireless attention with billy tended meticulous care with followed instruction set forth in book of direction attached to ship medicine chest for case a mine be not again troubled with delirium did experience other set back of kind on contrary made such excellent progress that within fortnight be able to be up about again although be something of task to climb companion stairway to deck even with help of billy that task once achieved made rapid headway be soon old self again upon first visit to deck after illness sustained something of shock last view of brigantine have shown ataunto although what billy have told ought to have prepared for change that met gaze must confess be distinctly taken aback when upon first emergence from companion beheld mast gone by board bulwark swept away deck hampered by confused mass of raffle consisting of mainmast with attached stretched fore aft while foremast have gone over bow head resting upon coral while splintered lower extremity projected ten foot above knightheads fore topmast have carried away close to cap with yard be afloat under bow fast to wreck by standing running rigging life boat have served so well have practically disappeared only keel fragment of sternpost remaining by miracle galley remained intact be in regular use by billy for preparation of meal almost first care be to sound well in hope that by stroke of marvellous good fortune hull might have so far escaped serious damage be capable of being floated again of course be too much to expect found nearly two half foot of water in well be about depth alongside inference therefore be that upon striking reef ship have be bilged of plank have be started that therefore if depended upon effort alone must never float again next turned attention to external helped by billy tottered to skylight seated upon cover from obtained clear view of whole reef from horizon to horizon appeared to be typical example of coral barrier reef running roughly parallel to shore of island from north to south seemed to vary greatly in width for while in place judged to be not more than five six yard wide be nearly quite three hundred yard wide where brigantine lay most fortunate be for that be so for if after striking ship have be driven over inner edge of reef to comparatively deep water of lagoon must assuredly have gone down taking with a be there be space of only about fathom between forefoot inner edge of reef a ascertained later great wall of surf fifty foot high breaking perpetually upon outer face of reef stretching mile after mile to north south of be wonderful sight especially in early morning when sun ray struck great cloud of spray creating most beautiful perfect rainbow same wall of spray by way effectually excluded view of ocean outside so that even if whole navy happened to be passing must never catch smallest glimpse of so long a remained aboard wreck be evident therefore that first step toward escape from present predicament must be transfer of ourselves everything of value to island by natural transition of thought next turned attention to land stretched north south athwart bow of wreck great belt of smooth water averaging two mile in width lay between reef beach of dazzling white sand extending to right left a far a eye must see to south land seemed to dip out of sight below horizon northward appeared to terminate in high headland estimated to be about eighteen mile distant considered therefore that island must measure from north to south at least forty mile what might measure from east to west be not to be easily determined summit of most distant range of hill appeared to be nearly quite twenty mile distant how much land lay beyond be of course impossible to guess description of island billy have given several day earlier be quite good one there be far stretching ribbon of white beach bordered on inshore margin by innumerable cocoa nut palm beyond land rose gently in irregular fold to hill in rear inch of soil apparently being clothed with vegetation of sort chiefly tree many of seemed a seen through ship telescope to be smothered in blossom of varied most beautiful hue subjected foot of land in sight to most rigorous scrutiny through lens of telescope in search of indication of inhabitant must find nothing cleared cultivated land smoke suggestive of dwelling canoe on beach moving figure to appearance indeed gull pelican other aquatic bird wheeled screamed over lagoon dived into water might be only life on island well mr blackburn what do think of demanded billy when at length lowered telescope from eye be wonderful declared be amazed simply can not understand that island be quite big place there be nothing in least like shown on chart anywhere near spot actually occupies how have so far escaped notice of hydrographers be puzzle to matter however most concern be that viewed from here at least appears to be sufficiently desirable place on ought without difficulty to find ample mean of subsistence how doe idea of living ashore there for time appeal to oh say exclaimed billy will be splendid just think of jolly time will be able to have huntin ' wild beast fightin ' savage havin ' sort of splendid adventure well said of thing may possibly come way really want excitement of sort billy boy of course be right where be so long a wreck hold together remains habitable trouble be that know how long may be such gale a placed here might send such tremendous sea pouring in over reef a to wash old hooker off reef into lagoon where must quickly founder be reason why consider that must establish ashore a soon a possible oh exclaimed billy never thought of do really think mr blackburn that there be chance of wreck sinking be quite possible replied although have known case where stranded wreck have remained for year still possibility must be recognised provided against wherefore be of utmost importance that lose time in getting safely settled ashore then what do propose to do sir demanded billy moment be strong enough to do work said will start to build sort of craft in can ferry across lagoon explore island in search of suitable spot upon to pitch camp after everything will depend upon condition on find possible to live one condition be of paramount importance must establish where clear view of open sea can be obtained from will be possible to signal to ship may heave in sight now billy do happen to know whether there be timber aboard out of must be possible for to build boat without preliminary necessity to start breaking up yorkshire lass why yes believe there be answered billy hesitatingly ca say for certain seem to remember hearin ' dad say something about buyin ' plank a stand by in case of repair of sort bein needed believe saw plank scantlin ' down in fore hold bit later while ship be still in dock if timber aboard anywhere be where will find mr blackburn thanks billy said a soon a be strong enough to lift hatch will explore fore hold see what be to be found there nearly fortnight elapsed before be strong enough to open fore hatchway even with billy help when at length managed be amply rewarded for labour abundant supply of plank scantling for utmost need being found took careful stock of recording nature dimension of piece of scantling plank then providing with paper pencil scale set to work to scheme out craft must be easy to build fast stiff weatherly under canvas fairly good sea boat of light draught be decidedly ambitious scheme for individual who up to then have attempted nothing bigger than three foot model even experience be soon found of great value to ultimately evolved design believed must approach within reasonable distance of requirement done routed out carpenter chest of tool from forecastle cleaned sharpened got up on deck such timber a immediately required started work with billy a enthusiastic helpmate chapter eight go exploring meet with adventure cost billy nearly three month of strenuous labour to build boat rig get afloat then upon certain day boy provided with rifle apiece brace of revolver abundant supply of cartridge for kind of weapon climbed down side of wreck into completed craft set sail pushed off upon first voyage of exploration wind be a usual blowing moderate breeze from eastward when started consequently island lay dead to windward beat of two mile to nearest point of beach thus affording excellent opportunity to test weatherly quality of boat be agreeably surprised not only at style in turned to windward also at speed with slipped through water certainty celerity with stayed made distance in few minute over half hour considering that a drew in under land wind grew ever more scanty regarded a very creditable performance a shortened distance between ourselves land prospect grew ever more attractive eliciting frequent exclamation of delight from billy ground now revealed a finely broken into range of lofty hill of gracefully flowing outline with suggestion of picturesque valley winding between affording infinite variety of glowing light soft shadow while variegated brilliant hue of foliage completed picture of indescribable beauty beauty by mean exhausted charm of place for a drew still closer to beach be able to distinguish that wood be habitat of countless thousand of bird of strange most gorgeous plumage among identified what believed to be three four specie of bird of paradise a well a great variety of sun bird flitting from flower to flower like living gem be to be admitted that cry of bird be not always in accord with splendour of plumage being for most part distinctly harsh unmusical there be one exception startled not little when first heard cry be exact reproduction of sound of sweet toned bell so exact indeed that for moment felt fully persuaded that hidden somewhere in heart of vast ocean of greenery there must be monastery such institution be not until marked irregular intermittent character of sound fact that emanated from frequently changing locality that at length arrived at explanation of apparent mystery while be still discussing matter boat gently grounded upon dazzlingly white beach of coral sand stepped out securing boat by mean of grapnel attached to end of long painter digging fluke of former deeply into sand then billy carrying weapon with have provided ourselves set out to explore new territory beach be of varying width ranging from two three yard to in place nothing at indeed many of cocoa nut tree be actually rooted in soil be at moment being laved by salt water due to fact that happened to land about time of full tide happened also that fruit be at season just ripening so many of nut falling to ground with thud even a stood staring about that be able without difficulty to collect place in boat a many a pleased done attempted to make way inland so dense be undergrowth at point that be soon compelled to abandon effort being clearly evident that only way in must penetrate must be by hewing path for ourselves did not follow that because failed here must necessarily fail everywhere therefore re embarked again getting under way headed northward keeping close to beach maintaining good look out for spot affording reasonable prospect of successful penetration several time believed have found what be seeking on occasion hope be speedily dashed most successful effort resulting merely in penetration for distance of le than mile even so attempt be not unmitigated failure for while clothing suffered somewhat in encounter with thorn persistently barred passage be fortunate enough to secure few bunch of delicious wild grape large bunch of very delicately flavoured banana six splendid pineapple upon return to beach took precaution to mark spot by cutting good big branch inserting upright in sand so that must easily be seen at distance then resumed voyage of exploration lunching luxuriously upon banana meanwhile at length after working northward for distance of fourteen mile along western shore quite suddenly opened out mouth of what at first supposed to be important river running in south easterly direction toward interior of island subsequently proved to be one of several channel dividing what originally imagined to be only one island into group of le than seven naturally at once decided to abandon for moment further exploration of lagoon in favour of survey of waterway boat be accordingly put about headed into at entrance measured about mile wide a proceeded gradually widened out until at point about eight mile inward from lagoon be quite two half mile wide here channel trended point two farther to eastward four mile farther on forked one branch continuing to south eastward while other trended away toward north east decided to follow latter land on side be still distinctly hilly densely covered with forest on left hill sloped rapidly downward until died away in plateau level of be only two three foot above surface of water a boat glided slowly onward under influence of breeze have steadily grown more languid fitful a progressed subjected plateau to rigorous scrutiny through ship telescope carried with place looked so uninviting that decided against landing there did land to southward look more inviting for consisted of cliff ranging from two hundred to five six hundred foot high rising almost vertically from water therefore pushed on more impelled thereto because channel now ran almost directly to windward be therefore obliged to beat up through moreover afternoon be progressing wanted if possible to find spot where must pas night in comfort at point eight mile farther on channel again forked one branch heading away to north east while other trended off in south easterly direction a reached point wind suddenly freshened there be salt tang in quite distinctive from odour of earth vegetation that have now be breathing for several hour also there came to ear subdued by distance low continuous booming thunder of surf from surmised correctly a subsequently proved that be nearing eastern extremity of group heading boat into south eastern channel with long range of vertical rocky cliff still stretching away on starboard bow presently came abreast of island measuring six mile from east to west by about seven mile from north to south roughly triangular in plan surface sloping upward on side from water edge to peak estimated to be about two thousand foot high standing close inshore to get a near view a possible of island found appearance most delectable like much of what have already seen entire island be forest clad country be much more park like in character tree grew le thickly together be not matted together by impenetrable jungle of undergrowth although many of be almost smothered in what appeared to be innumerable variety of orchid soil be clothed with what looked like short grey green grass down to inner edge of narrow beach be lined with cocoa nut palm taken altogether place wore so exceedingly attractive appearance that finding rather unexpectedly standing into nice snug little bay headed straightway for beach determined to push exploration farther for day securely mooring boat a before landed fully armed made way inland over southern shoulder of hill observing a went that among forest giant towered about on hand there be fruit tree in abundance among identified bread fruit mango custard apple shaddock grape fruit grape vine twining about many of bigger tree yielding large cluster of richly flavoured fruit while banana plantain be to be seen wherever one turned one eye bird also seemed to regard island a desirable dwelling place for be everywhere beautiful plumage adding further charm to little island paradise from beach to ridge of hill for be making distance be about mile ground rising gently way going be comparatively easy for by making slight detour here there be able to progress without need to force way through dense undergrowth gentle saunter of about hour duration therefore took to point for be aiming arrived there be afforded clear view eastward when discovered a have suspected that have practically reached eastern extremity of group immediately before ground sloped down to eastern shore distance being about mile that shore be washed by water of lagoon be at point six seven mile wide outer margin being marked by continuous wall of spray thrown up by long line of pacific swell eternally hurled upon barrier reef midway between reef island on stood there be smaller island in essential appeared to be replica of one be on for too be park like in arrangement of tree grew upon while also boasted central peak rising to height of six seven hundred foot small island be evident be easternmost of whole group at once determined to pay visit early on morrow for if must prove upon inspection to be a desirable a looked must certainly be place on ought to take up abode since from must best be able to signal ship might heave in sight from also if opening in reef happened to be anywhere handy must slip out to sea in boat if need be intercept that ship south of on opposite side of channel about three quarter of mile wide lay curious island of vertical cliff already referred to from view point occupied must see entire length of island estimated at about sixteen mile eastern extremity being low cliff eight mile south east of resolved that on morrow after visiting small island to eastward of already began to speak of a ours must pay visit to other island somehow seemed to have invested in eye with air of mystery spent that night encamped on grass close to beach occupying tent formed of old sail three oar have brought along for purpose slept soundly night air on eastern side of group being a discovered very much fresher cooler than on western side where wreck lay be astir by sunrise next morning treating to swim in bay after proceeded to prepare breakfast when have finished meal struck tent packed away in boat started upon day exploration first call be at small island forming easternmost extremity of group have practically determined upon a place of abode during such time a fate might keep prisoner on group found almost ideal for purpose in first place there be on south western side snug little cove just large enough to accommodate boat wherein might ride safely in weather next discharging into cove there be brook of deliciously cool sweet water springing from side of cove affording ample supply for purpose island be rich in fruit tree of great variety finally rigorous examination of failed to disclose existence upon of anything noxious inimical to human life although like other island visited place swarmed with bird to crown complete satisfaction found that there be passage through reef immediately to eastward of island through in boat might reach open sea spent entire morning on island partook of mid day meal there leaving rather reluctantly to continue survey of group island next intended to visit be one with vertical cliff along have coasted on previous day rugged precipitous cliff formed northern coast line of island from certain observation have made from own island came to conclusion that southern side of island must reveal very dissimilar characteristic so proved for when after sail of six mile in southerly direction rounded south eastern extremity discovered that southern shore rose only few foot above level of water being bounded a seemed usual in group by narrow beach of coral sand liberally fringed with cocoa nut tree ground sloping gently up from beach for distance ranging from two to four mile when abruptly ended against southern face of cliff to have so frequently referred be by mean most surprising characteristic to explorer for having thus far failed to discover sign of inhabitant have perhaps rather hastily jumped to conclusion that group be uninhabited whereas now saw that whole surface of particular island from southern shore right up to base of range of northern cliff be under cultivation wide area of indian corn be interspersed with spacious field of sugar cane varied here there by great orchard of what assumed to be fruit tree of various kind what appeared to be garden plot devoted to cultivation of vegetable occasionally caught glimpse of native working either singly in small group in field orchard garden from gesture of amazement from manner in stood transfixed staring when boat swept within range of vision conjectured that be first time in life that have ever beheld sight be almost coal black in colour inspection of through telescope showed to be absolutely naked wherefore decided not to pay visit until future occasion when billy must not be with although apart from state of nudity impressed a being perfectly harmless resolve to abstain from landing there on occasion be however broken down within next half hour too in sufficiently remarkable tragic manner be skimming briskly along before pleasant easterly breeze billy being at helm while sat in bottom of boat taking peep through telescope at interesting object in landscape seemed to be gliding past when suddenly heard from distance ahead of sound a of horn being blown sound being taken up repeated at various point ahead astern of do think be meaning of rumpus mr blackburn asked billy do think be scared at sight of look bit like doe for see sir have started to run directed telescope toward shore be a billy have said everybody within sight be running at remarkable speed too whether not be apparition of boat have startled must not tell for about half of seemed to be hastening at breakneck speed toward part of beach about mile ahead where group of forty fifty black have already gathered close to water edge seemed to be engaged in feverish haste in collecting stone lump of coral other group believed to be composed of woman be running with equal speed toward cliff at back of island turning telescope again upon rapidly gathering native on beach saw that must not be boat be causing excitement for number of having collected a many stone a must be conveniently held in hollow of left arm be now excitedly pointing directing companion attention to object in channel immediately before turning telescope in direction toward be pointing presently sighted three object believed to be head of animal making rapid progress through water toward point on beach where still rapidly swelling crowd have collected a watched little jet of water began to spout up round foremost of head black be stoning with evident object of driving off at least of preventing approach remarkably good marksman appeared to be too for a continued to watch observed four five direct hit evoking from target most appalling shrieking roar while progress through water perceptibly speeded up that three swimming creature have be recognised by black a enemy possibly of long standing be clear enough here appeared to be excellent opportunity for to establish good relation between ourselves savage by taking hand in game be evidently toward accordingly laid down telescope a reached for rifle directed billy to luff head boat straight for spot where black be gathered a rapidly threw open breech of rifle to assure that weapon be loaded leading swimmer reached willow water rising to foot revealed a gigantic anthropoid ape probably specie of gorilla creature towered clear head shoulder in stature above native have comparatively small head with flat receding forehead very wide nostril long enormously muscular body immensely wide across massive shoulder disproportionately short leg huge arm so long that even when brute stood upright clenched fist reached to within foot of ground a started to wade ashore advance be momentarily checked by terrific volley of stone hurled with amazing force precision then emitting series of dreadful shrieking roar dashed forward with outstretched arm seized nearest native without apparent effort literally tore unfortunate man head from body be evident that if meant to intervene to good purpose there be not moment to lose boat be now within hundred yard of spot where battle between ape native be raging dared not risk shot in quarter for great brute still roaring horribly be completely hemmed in by crowd of native battering huge hairy body with big lump of coral movement of combatant be so quick be more likely to hit black than beast second ape be now in willow water on point of rising to foot therefore levelled rifle held pressed trigger a two sight of weapon came into line with centre of head just above ear harrowing shriek pealed out on hot air a little puff of smoke from rifle blew away have satisfaction of seeing creature throw up great hand sink back into water dead dropping empty weapon snatched up loaded one threw quick glance around to decide must be next mark third ape be now le than twenty yard distant a gaze fell upon saw change course head for boat afforded opportunity wanted levelling weapon aimed for centre of forehead fired distinctly heard thud of bullet a crashed into massive skull there be shriek time beast simply collapsed sank meanwhile aspect of affair ashore have remarkable change whether be sharp crack of rifle coincident death of two ape fact that brute have effected landing have already put seven eight of native hors de combat must not guess native have apparently with one accord a though at preconcerted signal suddenly abandoned fight be now fleeing in direction while ape perhaps taken by surprise at quick change tactic possibly dazed by severe blow that have received stood staring about a though undecided what to do next only for moment for just then boat with good way on grounded slid well up on beach while rose to foot leaping lightly over bow advanced toward brute glancing quickly about enormous beast instantly noted movement with deep savage roar turned to meet little eye blazing with fury lip drawn back in snarl exposed formidable teeth pair of great tusk protruding from lower jaw with blood stained foam dripping from champing jaw blood from numerous wound streaking great hairy hide presented most formidable spectacle a approached with body bent crouching ready to spring long sinewy arm outstretched great hand opening closing a though eager to clutch throat be now within dozen yard of other a though by mutual consent halted at same instant glaring into other eye saw beast crouch still lower noted ripple of muscle of great loin a gathered together for spring be to settle dispute off hand quickly levelling revolver have drawn from belt a sprang ashore pointed weapon straight for head pulled trigger there be sharp click a hammer fell explosion cartridge have missed fire at precise moment brute made leap a came hurtling at through air by instinct suppose for there be time for reasoning again pointed revolver time straight at wide open mouth again pressed trigger on occasion explosion came off right then while report still rang in ear huge body of ape with curious writhing motion crashed down upon dashed violently to ground fell side by side upon back ape face downward convulsive shudder shook body for moment then lay still a for remained where have fallen breathless dazed half stunned until be aroused by billy who springing ashore rushed up to ask anxiously whether be very much hurt fortunately be not be scarcely even bruised by fall scrambled to foot not penny worse for rather grim encounter lingered on beach for nearly hour in expectation that of native might possibly return thus afford opportunity to establish something in nature of amicable relation with none of did eventually therefore got boat afloat again made sail on way back to wreck abandoning for moment idea of further exploration chapter nine settle down on eden found wreck a of course have quite expected in precisely same condition a have left a stowed boat sail made securely fast to wreck be fixed intention to continue exploration on following day a sat on deck night smoking final pipe before turning in plan underwent certain amount of modification have quite come to conclusion that tiny islet formed easternmost extremity of group be spot on ought to take up abode in view of hope of eventual rescue while considering matter also occurred to that since be impossible to forecast duration of detention upon group might run to month for aught must tell reasonably comfortable dwelling of sort something le susceptible to vicissitude of weather than mere tent for instance be absolute necessity therefore spent ensuing four day in planning house a billy might between be able to construct by end of time have got satisfactorily planned out on paper determined to build entirely of wood first because wreck afforded abundance of material next because must do cutting out sawing planing mortising fitting aboard ship where such tool convenience a possessed be at immediate command where must work from early morn to dewy eve without fear of interruption of kind then when timber be cut shaped fitted must be comparatively simple matter to transfer to islet by mean of boat there erect fit together from such observation a have already be able to make have come to conclusion that barrier reef upon yorkshire lass lay stranded must probably be found to encircle group completely with perhaps breach two in somewhere a determination of point seemed to matter of importance decided that next exploration must be conducted with object accordingly upon morning of fifth day after first expedition again left wreck boat being well stocked with everything must think of a likely to be required during week cruise a before started by steering northerly course in due time arrived off entrance of channel have explored on first trip have proved to lead to centre of group on occasion instead of entering channel a before continued to push northward barrier reef still holding intact on port hand while to starboard lay what proved to be most northerly island of group a coasted along north westerly shore be able to see that while southern portion of be low flat range of hill occupied eastern side while le lofty le extensive range marked north western extremity land looked savage unattractive uninviting therefore made attempt to land contenting with maintenance of strict continuous scrutiny of country through telescope uninviting however a be aspect of island became markedly more so when be presently favoured with glimpse of of inhabitant of thus far have seen nothing have just rounded headland be most northerly point of group visible from deck of yorkshire lass have hauled up close to wind to fetch point four mile distant to north eastward when scrutinising shore through telescope saw two creature suddenly burst through dense scrub seemed to be only form of vegetation growing thereabout begin possibly might have be continue what have appearance of desperate fight on open beach be at moment not more than quarter of mile from shore little farther than from spot where fight be taking place creature be therefore within plain view of while telescope clearly revealed detail of what be happening of creature so incredibly agile be in movement that several minute elapsed before be able to do more than just form rough estimate of size presently boat drew up fairly abreast of then directed billy who be steering to haul fore sheet to windward to deaden boat way for be curious to see what must be outcome of struggle combatant be well matched a to size activity there appearing to be not pin to choose between in respect set down to be about same size a ordinary donkey did not in least resemble donkey a to shape indeed at first sight seemed to be more like gigantic frog that however be merely first impression for there presently occurred momentary pause in fight presumably to enable to get second wind then be enabled to note detail accurately hind leg be proportionately a long a of frog much more muscular while fore leg appeared to be not more than foot long four extremity being armed with exceedingly stout formidable claw unlike frog however boasted powerful tail seemed to serve very much same purpose a of kangaroo a weapon propellant at base be same thickness a body tapering away to point appeared to be about same length a body head be however most remarkable feature of animal when seen in profile be not unlike of ape have encountered be evidently even more formidable for projecting from nose be stout sharp horn similar to of rhinoceros while pair of long tusk projected from upper jaw in colour animal be greyish brown dark on upper part of body fading to dirty white on lower serrated ridge of what might be loose skin ran along back from nape of neck to extremity of tail body appeared to be thickly dotted with wart like excrescence altogether have very much more appearance of reptile than of other class of animal kingdom detail be able to observe during short pause in fight to have already alluded in le than minute struggle be resumed with apparently greater ferocity than ever method of fighting be a remarkable a general appearance facing opponent crouching low at distance of three four yard apart one of must suddenly spring high in air land upon body of adversary striking furiously with claw tusk tail while other throwing on back must lash out a vigorously with own weapon then two must grip rolling over over other for few minute must be impossible to see what be happening so quick be movement dense cloud of dust that raised then must occur brief pause to be followed by further renewal of fight after about quarter of hour became evident that struggle be nearly over end came with dramatic suddenness one happened to be lying upon back made lucky upward stroke with hind claw disembowelling antagonist a latter descended upon moment later be tearing great morsel of flesh from still writhing body of late adversary let draw fore sheet billy exclaimed will get away from here a quickly a wind will take for sight be horrible disgusting one hour later arrived off gap about mile wide between two headland gap forming entrance of noble bay eight mile long by five mile wide at widest part curiously enough immediately opposite that gap there occurred corresponding gap break about two mile wide in barrier reef so have place be known to mariner ship in distress might have passed through break in reef sailed straight into bay even in hardest gale that ever blew naturally at once headed boat into bay sailed to farther extremity hugging western shore way still maintaining close watch upon country generally through telescope be very rugged broken until reached bottom of bay where hill from height of eight hundred foot sank into plain hill side inside a outside bay nourished fairly dense growth of low coarse scrub searched with glass in vain for sign of life noticed very early after passage between two headland that for reason be quite unable to guess at water of bay be swarming with shark first that have seen since occurrence of wreck wherefore at once christened great sheet of water shark bay while to island gave name of north island headland guarded entrance to shark bay be pair of lofty promontory rising to height of four five hundred foot forming part of range of hill engirdled bay on hand while range on western side sloped down to water edge sinking into plain at distance of about ten mile from entrance range on eastern side sixteen mile long gradually receded from shore line a swept southward space between foot beach being occupied by swamp lying so low that be difficult to judge in place precise line of demarcation between land water southern half of island consisted entirely of low flat ground sparsely covered with coarse grass isolated clump of scrub across at distance of eight mile high precipitous cliff of island where encountered ape must be distinctly seen by time that arrived at inner southern extremity of bay sun have declined to within finger width of ridge of western range of hill be clear therefore that there must be further exploration for until morrow began to look about in search of suitable spot whereon to pitch camp for night to choose seemed difficult western shore of bay with broken ground scrubby vegetation looked uninviting to say least of in addition to be on other side of same hill at spot only few mile distant that have afternoon witnessed terrific fight between two horrible unknown creature have inclination to place where might perchance make closer acquaintance with other creature of similar perhaps even more ferocious kind eastern shore of bay be swamp consequently out of question therefore turned attention to plain formed southern part of island when looking in direction saw animal of sort squatting on hind quarter on beach staring at be only about quarter of mile distant bringing telescope to bear upon at once identified a victorious fighter of afternoon creature similar in respect be hardly likely to be same beast however for thought doubtful whether long arm of coincidence must bring same creature within ken again so soon moreover animal at moment focused by lens of telescope showed wound other sign of recent battle will have shot at beggar if will only remain a be minute longer exclaimed take telescope billy watch will aim for heart will be able to see whether not score hit thrusting telescope into billy hand snatched up rifle four hundred fifty yard must be about right muttered a adjusted back sight of weapon to range then raising rifle to shoulder bringing sight into line on part of still motionless beast body where supposed heart to be pressed trigger plop of bullet upon creature hide distinctly reached ear second two after crack of rifle instead of toppling over dead a fully expected beast simply wheeled about in sequence of enormous bound quickly vanished in distance by jove exclaimed in amazement what extraordinary thing will swear hit have a neatly covered a possible hand be a steady a rock there be not enough wind to deflect bullet furthermore heard strike yes so did agreed billy be certain that hit brute mr blackburn ca say for certain that actually saw bullet hit believe that second two after fired instant before beast turned bounded away saw tiny dark spot on dirty white skin of breast wonder whether really did whether be merely imagination said anyway beggar must be tough one to kill for while feel a certain a do hit fact remains that be very far from being dead when last saw furthermore yonder plain harbour such creature be strong argument against camping there to night only thing therefore can see for be to stand off shore for mile two anchor boat rough aboard for night did ample reason have to congratulate upon decision for shortly after through hour of darkness ear be assailed by almost continuous succession of such hair raising shriek howl roar bellowing a thoroughly convinced that north island be sort of dwelling place for human being with penchant for peace quietness furthermore there be moon night well advanced in second quarter at frequent interval during particularly restless night caught glimpse of shadowy form moving restlessly hither ashore with arrival of dawn next morning be astir after early breakfast anchor be hove up got under way to resume voyage of exploration on previous afternoon pretty closely skirted western shore of bay now on way out a closely hugged eastern shore kept under continuous scrutiny with help of telescope nothing worthy of record be seen day voyage might be dismissed with mere mention of for fact that when be about half way down bay reached spot where water swamp be so intermingled that actually ran right into vast bed of rush without grounding there be perhaps nothing very remarkable about there be peculiarity about rush billy be first to observe remark upon namely absolutely perfect straightness inspired with idea stock of ammunition be limited when must become exhausted what be to do so long a remained upon group must have weapon of sort only substitute for rifle revolver must think of be bow arrow cut one of rush found to consist of exceedingly hard outer casing filled with soft pith be remarkably light instantly occurred to that smaller thinner rush ranged from about eighth of inch up to quite two inch in diameter must make ideal arrow therefore set to work there then cut about two hundred reed of suitable diameter of being long enough to make at least two arrow when toward sunset that evening again reached little islet have resolved to make home named eden because be so like garden first thing did be to spread reed out on grass to dry next rigged tent for intended to spend night on island then billy took walk up a far a shoulder of hill from be to be obtained view of sea upon off chance of there being sail of sort in sight a more than half expected ocean be bare met with adventure unpleasant otherwise night enjoyed several hour of sound dreamless sleep awoke refreshed next morning to pursue voyage of exploration did meet with adventure worth recording on third day of voyage sailed past eastern end of island inhabited by native leaving about two mile on starboard hand a steered south then sailed past much bigger island estimated to measure sixteen mile long by about fourteen mile wide be in form of double coned hill sloping on side down to water edge higher of two cone being about nine hundred foot high other perhaps two hundred foot le be thickly wooded from beach to summit have doubt that many of tree saw bore edible fruit did not land to test matter rather late in afternoon arrived abreast much smaller island proved to be southernmost of group named south island about sunset ran into tiny bay close to western extremity anchoring boat passed night in time without disturbance of kind continuing circumnavigation of group reached wreck again about hour before sunset on fourth day of travel keeping within lagoon time thus confirming theory that reef completely encircled whole group estimated that in course of four day sailed distance of about one hundred fifty mile be well worth for now have considerable knowledge of general characteristic of entire group to must add when set out to traverse intersecting channel matter about be now most anxious be erection of projected house on little islet of eden to cutting shaping of timber be to be employed in construction billy at once devoted energetically making remorseless inroad upon wreck for required material maintaining cabin after part of ship intact that might not deprive ourselves of one dwelling place until other be ready to receive be more anxious to get important piece of work completed without loss of time because have suspicion that in latitude there be what be known a hurricane season during extremely violent gale be prevalent knew that very first of when came might destroy wreck so turn out of house home sooner have begun work than recognised wisdom have prompted to prepare carefully drawn detailed plan of future house beforehand for now be able to determine by reference to plan exact dimension shape of piece of timber required thus saving vast amount of time labour must otherwise have be spent in consideration in tentative fitting together of several piece there be need to tax patience of reader by describing in detail daily progress let suffice to say that worked day day from dawn to sunset until at length after five week of strenuous uneventful labour punctuated at interval by thunderstorm of terrific violence accompanied by torrential downpour of rain thankfully utilised for replenishment of fresh water supply carpenter work of projected house be finished then came still more formidable task of erection began by loading boat with a much a must carry of building material requisite for few day stay upon islet then left wreck arriving at destination rather late same evening taking short cut through part of intersecting channel that have already traversed upon occasion of discovery of islet choice of site for house unloading conveyance of tool building material to site occupied whole of day for site chosen be on eastern slope of hill about mile distant from cove where boat lay involving carrying of several heavy load of timber distance up hill be well worth labour for situation afforded magnificent uninterrupted view of open sea to eastward while toward west south west have view of considerable portion of island with remarkable precipitous cliff broad stretch of lagoon to south of spending night of very fatiguing day on eden returned to wreck on day following fair wind whole way enabling to accomplish trip in time to load up boat same evening in readiness for early start next day mode of procedure be followed for nearly month by end of period have transported from wreck to islet whole of material for house chest of treasure ship medicine chest tool of description be to be found in ship arm ammunition chronometer other navigating instrument chart considerable quantity of most valuable content of lazarette after be practically independent of wreck for a soon a have built house must be in possession of everything absolutely necessary to maintenance of life health house however still remained to be built task kept billy busy for six week when be finished found relatively speaking in clover for house consisted of strongly built weather proof bungalow containing living room store room two bedroom kitchen scullery fuel house other outbuilding with stoep veranda extending round be roofed with deck planking caulked thoroughly well tarred then coated with sand furniture be of course bit rough served purpose be eked out by addition of couple of comfortable arm chair six deck chair from wreck with of course bed bedding table linen crockery cutlery cooking gear great task accomplished next business be to run boat single handed to fro between islet wreck removing from latter everything might by chance be of slightest value to while billy having developed ambition to lay out considerable expanse of slope in front of house a garden put in time in realisation of ambition after time be able to lend hand at job finished up by setting on end in front of house brigantine spare main topmast made fine flagstaff upon proposed to hoist ship ensign union down if ever ship must heave in sight chapter ten spider web next task be one felt have already neglected too long namely provision of weapon to supplement firearm so save ammunition for case of extreme emergency proposed to do by manufacture of bow arrow if must find material suitable for purpose so far a arrow be concerned have already found perfect material for shaft in bundle of rush have cut in shark bay swamp have by time dried hardened in air until have become must wish for still required wood from to make bow spent whole day unsuccessfully searching wood of eden for suitable tree did not follow that because there be suitable tree on own islet there be none on of other island of group therefore on certain evening announced intention of starting next morning upon further voyage of exploration discovery in pursuance of intention immediately after breakfast on following morning put two rifle in boat with ample supply of cartridge while carried brace of revolver in belt strapped round waist in addition to took along with ship cutlas to serve instead of axe with to cut suitable bough might chance to find for prospecting purpose chose western island of group not only because be largest most densely wooded also because seemed to remember vaguely having seen when sailing past on way to from wreck certain tree resembling yew than of course nothing must be better for purpose got under way with fine fair wind headed for east channel entering ran close in under precipitous cliff formed northern coast line of island inhabited by native thence passed into north island channel with mysterious north island on starboard hand a boat buzzed merrily along kept telescope focused upon wide flat plain formed southerly half of island upon off chance of catching glimpse of of weird inhabitant saw nothing then rounding southern extremity of north island entered north west channel with west island close aboard on port hand hauled up to northward keeping sharp look out for tree of be in search be about noon when spotted clump of tree growing together at great distance from shore at once headed for grounded boat upon beach looking well to weapon to ensure that be in working order billy shouldered rifle made way toward clump of tree grass be waist high very matted rendering going rather difficult distance be mere trifle in about ten minute be at tree looked well at came to conclusion that if be not actually yew be of very similar character sufficiently so at least to justify in testing quality accordingly climbed into one of with care selected about dozen suitable branch hacked off with cutlas threw to ground where billy retrieved from long grass done decided that next thing in order be to pipe to lunch meal discussed in comfort at leisure aboard boat luncheon over agreed that little fruit must be acceptable leaving boat set out to hunt for vegetation on eastern side of island be not nearly so dense impenetrable a have found on west side where landed upon occasion of first boat excursion undergrowth here being almost entirely absent consequently apart from trouble of forcing passage through long matted grass experienced little difficulty in penetrating wood where timber grew thickly be comparatively speaking very dark sudden transition from brilliant sunlight in open space to deep shadow of thickly wooded part be distinctly trying to eye went warily halting at frequent interval listening for sound might warn of approaching danger for be now upon biggest island of group knew not what dangerous form of life might be lurking within recess of forest when a be looking about for fruit bearing tree of kind quite suddenly woodland silence be broken by rapid succession of piercing cry somehow suggested to idea of cat in state of acute terror physical distress hark what be exclaimed billy laying hand upon arm sound a though there be cat somewhere quite near in grip of enemy let look for rescue poor thing if can mr blackburn cat be just one thing needed to complete homelike look of bungalow poor thing be over there somewhere be sure be in terrible distress hurried in direction indicated by billy pointing hand few second later saw at distance of yard two ahead of commotion in long grass a though creature creature buried in be engaged in violent struggle spot happened to be in deep shadow thought came to that hidden in thick mass of tangled grass small animal might be fighting for life possibly in embrace of snake a likely a not might be of deadly venomous specie therefore put forth restraining hand said sharply to billy stay here come until call will go alone see what trouble be about with couple of stride reached scene of commotion cry meanwhile pealing out a piercingly a ever a stooped to investigate cap came into contact with something yielded slightly to touch be snatched off head surprised little startled by unexpectedness of happening straightened up to see cap apparently suspended in mid air still more surprised stretched forth hand seized cap to replace upon head when found that strongly resisted effort looking closely to discover reason saw that have become entangled in spider web yes spider web web a venture to say very few men save have ever seen hung suspended from branch quite ten foot above ground be tightly strained between trunk of two tree at least eight foot apart reached right down to ground where be strongly interwoven with long grass that web be not spun to catch fly mesh be from two to four inch wide although thread be so fine a to be invisible in subdued light until closely looked for be enormously strong so strong indeed that required quite powerful tug on part to disengage cap effort to do so caused web to vibrate strongly that suppose irritated owner for while be still tugging brute suddenly appeared from nowhere in particular running swiftly over web in direction of still entangled cap that spider be in perfect keeping with web that have spun there be home staying people who in wonderful wisdom will doubtless shake head smile incredulously at what be about to say possibly there may be among more widely travelled reader one two who will know from experience be not exaggerating when say that body of creature of deep ruby colour be a big a head of average sized man head be about size of orange have pair of wicked looking eye fairly blazed with fury a catching sight of suddenly halted glaring at emitting low angry hissing sound clashing formidable jaw together in what looked like access of perfectly demoniac ferocity struck motionless for moment in sheer amazement quickly recovered believing that thing be about to spring at face inflict possibly fatal bite raised cutlas with slashing blow clove creature through leaving severed part of body still clinging tenaciously to web next turned attention to screaming frantically struggling creature at foot single glance sufficed to show that be obviously feline about a big a full grown cat have somehow become entangled in bottom mesh of web be fighting desperately ineffectually to free indeed struggle seemed to have more hopelessly involved for although have torn hole several foot long in bottom of web be still held fast by dozen more of thread while body be completely enveloped in layer upon layer of tough tenaciously glutinous web unfortunate animal be evidently near to point of exhaustion from violent effort to break loose when bent over poor thing looked up at whined piteously a though appealing for help be appeal must by mean resist therefore taking creature in hand tore free by main force parting thread after thread until be severed whether be that poor little beggar be too completely exhausted to struggle further whether instinctively understood that meant well by can not say fact remains that from moment felt in grasp ceased to struggle when be completely freed from web lay quite passively in arm carried to where billy still stood awaiting return showing to said here be cat ' billy must touch yet for be in filthy state having be tangled up in most amazing spider web ever saw of course boy immediately fired whole broadside of question at relative to recent adventure also must need be taken to see web defunct spider after forgetting about fruit have started to seek re entered boat set out upon return to eden reached shortly before sunset a worked way back through winding channel billy beguiled time by taking newest acquisition upon lap endeavouring to free from clinging tangle of web in have enveloped so agreeable did operation appear to be to animal that lay quite passive permitting to be handled freely eventually to billy great delight started to purr for own part however reflection caused to question whether have be wise in introducing new member to family circle have be dog must have have doubt dog must have be delightful companion for of creature what be a have already said be about size of full grown cat undoubtedly belonged to cat tribe despite size judged to be mere kitten quite young one at leg be much thicker more muscular fur be shorter not so fine a of domestic cat although have seen good many domestic cat have never seen one marked like creature rich ruddy brown on head shoulder fore quarter shading off to light tawny colour at hind quarter tail with just suggestion of darker spot here there white on throat breast belly inside of leg occurred to that if suspicion be correct might eventually find that have introduced decidedly awkward member into domestic circle meanwhile kept suspicion to myself billy displayed utmost interest in new pet apparently be unable for moment to think of anything else be particularly anxious that little beast must settle down in house become thoroughly domesticated with object in view at once proceeded to liberally smear fore paw with part of slender remaining stock of butter having heard that cat so treated never deserted house in have received such hospitality next set to work to make kennel out of odds end of material left over from construction of house a for considered be far more usefully employed in stripping bark from branch have gathered converting into bow respective enterprise progressed a satisfactorily a must be desired billy protege in moment of inspiration have given highly original name of kit fed to repletion upon fish be apparently quite content to bask in sun day on floor of veranda to be petted played with by when must spare time to take up quarter at night in billy kennel upon luxurious bed of sweet scented hay while bow upon expended pain promised to be everything must desire billy made voyage to swamp in north island collected reed enough to make hundred of arrow headed with hard sharp thorn embedded in about three inch of clay at head to impart steadiness of flight to missile arrangement found to answer admirably then when bow be completed set up target in front of house practised assiduously until within fortnight became sufficiently expert to hit six inch bull eye at two hundred yard time having attained to degree of skill must get a many bird a needed for food without further expenditure of ammunition accordingly hoarded remainder of powder shot against possible moment when must be in dire need of striving for perfection made twelve bow before be quite satisfied with result of effort thus allowing one bow for of second a stand by have eight bow for have particular use did not quite come up to standard yet did not care to destroy after consideration therefore decided that might be used a medium for establishment of friendly relation between ourselves neighbour native on cliff island accordingly on certain day placing superfluous bow number of arrow in boat taking rifle revolver with billy started to pay visit heading run of five mile brought in course of hour to western extremity of cliff island rounding presently saw that native appeared to be at work in field of maize sugar tending fruit tree sight of sail gliding along within short distance of beach caused to drop work might be engaged upon to watch progress although boat must by time have become quite familiar object to so often have passed island on way to from wreck arrived at spot where have encountered ape hauled boat to wind ran in upon beach stepped ashore be first time have landed upon island since memorable occasion consequently be not surprised to observe action created something of commotion among inhabitant alarm trumpet be sounded there be again stampede on part of woman child toward curious cave in cliff face while men came running together rallying round individual who appeared to be leader chief meanwhile walked slowly up narrow beach to level ground beyond there stood with hand upraised in token of amity man whom assumed to be chief stood intently regarding for several minute a though endeavouring to gather from action what motive for landing on island might be whereupon beckoned then again raised hand above head by way of response chief raised hand for moment then proceeded to discus a surmised situation with certain others who be probably minor chief finally after have several time repeated beckonings about dozen of including man whom supposed to be chief came slowly toward with hand raised approach be marked by very considerable amount of hesitation halt being frequent progress resumed only in response to vigorous beckonings on part so fully twenty minute be consumed in traversing distance of five hundred yard originally separated at length party arrived within about dozen yard of there finally halted moment have evidently arrived for to declare intention therefore drew from pocket necklace of big turquoise blue bead that formed part of truck provided by late skipper stenson for purpose of trade holding aloft advanced with friendly smile toward chief who seemed more than half inclined to turn tail run a purposely moved very slowly deliberately however stood ground when halted before placed necklace round own neck low murmur of admiration escaped party then removing bead from own neck stepped slowly forward again lightly dropped round neck of chief who thought seemed to find difficulty in deciding whether be more frightened delighted continued smiling upon in friendly fashion offered right hand in token of amity sign seemed to understand for after moment of hesitation placed hand in mine gave friendly squeeze instantly returned now turned toward boat saying come with have something to show beckoned party to follow of course did not understand word must have correctly interpreted tone of voice for followed without hesitation halting at top of bank however to take good look at boat exchange excited remark concerning a easily conjectured from animated gesture meanwhile advancing to boat took from billy small wooden target have prepared together with bow sheaf of arrow target fixed up on beach stationing at about hundred yard from directed attention of little audience first to bow then to arrow drew from quiver finally to target then fitting arrow to string drew bow to full extent next moment arrow be quivering in bull eye to amazement audible admiration of new friend feat performed second third time then led party to target that might see for how firmly be arrow embedded in evidently provoked in further admiration for at once plunged into animated discussion of matter at least of already appreciating value of bow a lethal weapon for one of party admirably mimicking action of ape coming up beach then drew imaginary bow instantly clapping hand over heart fell back in imitation of death agony patted approvingly on shoulder nodded said yes be idea old chap be precisely what want fellow to understand again seemed to comprehend for nodded vigorously then wrenching arrow from target conducted party back to hundred yard mark placing bow arrow in hand of chief signed to to try hand of course made terrible bungle of to start with first failed to put enough strength into pull arrow flew only few yard by dint of patient coaching on part however gradually improved when after practising diligently for about hour succeeded in sending arrow a far a target although several yard wide delight pride knew bound then showed that be possible to hit target at double distance after took to boat presented to remaining seven bow with sheaf of arrow filled simple fellow cup of joy to brim insisted on conducting billy through plantation of maize sugar cane directed attention to orchard of fruit tree finally led to cliff now saw be honeycombed with rock dwelling introduced to own particular mansion be cave of twelve foot wide by twenty foot deep very stuffy malodorous here be entertained to luncheon of boiled green maize cob several variety of delicious fruit household consisted of elderly woman whom conjectured to be mother two young men who understood be son five girl who might be wife daughter when at length be able to effect escape from rather pressing hospitality returned to boat found that during absence somebody presumably recent host have sent down several basket containing green head of indian corn sugar cane fruit took back with to eden for part feeling well satisfied with result of visit chapter eleven raid by ape having thus successfully established friendly relation with native determined to maintain with object made frequent call upon chief who be most anxious to display increasing skill of subordinate in use of bow indeed progress made be exceedingly creditable quite sufficient to enable to put up good defence against ape with difficulty gathered be prone to swim across channel from time to time for purpose of plundering native field orchard if understood new friend aright raid though not perhaps very frequent be occasionally of far more formidable disastrous character than have thus far imagined not infrequently resulting in quite serious loss of life on part of native who be courageous enough to defend possession accordingly decided to make present to plucky black twelve more bow with sufficient supply of arrow to enable to resist successfully incursion of formidable enemy work of procuring material necessary for manufacture of weapon making of together with performance of sundry odd job in garden kept busy for nearly month during be afforded ample opportunity to note progress billy be making in domestication of cat beast be growing fast be also developing certain marking tended to confirm original suspicion that be specie of leopard panther circumstance that not only occasioned considerable uneasiness also led to impart fear to billy even to hint tentatively at advisability of shooting creature before full development of natural proclivity must render actually dangerous billy indignantly scouted suggestion that pet must possibly develop dangerous tendency directing attention to affection displayed for of be compelled to admit so far contention be sound for beast followed about like dog must scarcely endure to be separated from of for great length of time seemed never so happy a when lying at full length on floor of veranda before chair with foot lightly resting upon body a upon footstool upon now comparatively rare occasion when took trip in boat kit be invariably to be found on beach waiting watching for return be amusing to observe delighted gambol in indulged a stepped ashore new bow arrow being at length ready billy started for cliff island on certain morning for purpose of presenting weapon to prospective owner upon arrival be received by native with accustomed cordiality at once handed over gift to bowata chief who be profuse in expression of gratitude have by time acquired sufficient grasp of very simple language to enable to make pretty shrewd guess at meaning when spoke to also to make fairly well understood by gathered from bowata that gift be singularly opportune inasmuch a that ape have of late for inexplicable reason be unusually pertinacious in raid upon island that thanks to original gift attack have be successfully withstood without loss of life on part of native invading ape having be slain before be possible for to effect landing little fellow be immensely proud of achievement a indeed might well be considering that before bow arrow era raid by ape have resulted in death of one two native more le serious maiming of others so proud be of skill people have developed that must need set up target there then might witness display of skill now became apparent that bowata be by mean devoid of shrewdness for not only have personally practised assiduously at target have insisted that petty chief who have be entrusted with bow must do same not content with have chosen two dozen other men of whom have personally trained so that when turned up with gift have already about thirty men one of quite fairly expert bowman must not forbear smile at intelligence imparted with most perfect naivete for almost appeared a though man have divined intention to make second gift now occurred rather remarkable coincidence for while display of native skill be in full swing trumpet be sounded giving warning of approaching raid ape appeared be heading for point about mile to westward of spot where be assembled toward spot archer twenty in number including who have be entrusted with new bow set off at top speed followed by unarmed comrade who merely delayed long enough to collect such block of coral rock of suitable size a happened to be in way a for announced intention to attack brute from boat if must be in time to intercept bowata delayed departure long enough to beg to allow men to deal unaided with enemy a victory gained by people increased confidence in added if of ape must escape attempt to swim back to own island must be rendering good service by destroying on way sound common sense of contention instantly recognised keeping well off shore that might be safely out of range of stray arrow billy arrived in boat off scene of impending struggle while leading ape be still good three hundred yard from beach be glad to see that black be keeping cool withholding fire instead of wasting arrow by discharging prematurely ape be swimming easily keeping so well together that be only with difficulty be able to count billy be agreed that totalled sixteen if have understood bowata aright be far away most formidable number have ever be encountered looked to rifle edged boat in little nearer shore to be ready for possible eventuality then a first arrow be discharged brought boat to wind hove to first shot be miss second shot scored for saw leading ape shake head angrily go through motion of plucking arrow from neck swam few yard farther however then suddenly flung up arm rolled over in water motionless be glad to see that native have assimilated advice have endeavoured somewhat laboriously to impart to to shoot singly at selected mark thus economising arrow promoting good shooting be adopting tactic now soundness of be demonstrated by fact that le than five of ape be put hors de combat before foot of of touched bottom started to wade ashore then indeed a half dozen of huge creature upreared simultaneously revealing whole of body above hip black betrayed sign of panic whole flight of arrow greeting brute if indiscriminate discharge be indeed result of panic be nevertheless thoroughly effective for one of monster went down dead too desperately wounded to be capable of further effort fate of comrade however seemed in wise to dismay act a deterrent to survivor who five in number pressed resolutely on finding bottom rose in quick succession to foot proceeded to scramble ashore actually passing between body of dead dying companion noticing only to thrust roughly aside in eagerness to get to grip with enemy latter be quite ready for success of bowata fellow archer thus far have inspired with such confidence in weapon that believe not man of must have turned tail so long a single arrow remained to a surviving ape advanced be met by withering flight of arrow that not one of lived actually to emerge from water then with yell of triumph victor rushed into water gave coup de grace to such of ape a betrayed sign of lingering life let draw fore sheet billy said must go ashore congratulate friend upon victory a boat grounded on beach saw that several of native be still in water busily engaged in retrieving arrow from body of victim have shrewd suspicion that many of arrow shot have be hopelessly lost suspicion suggested idea upon acted later on for moment attention be fully occupied by bowata people who crowded round talking at once of excitedly relating particular incident of adventure while others be striving to express gratitude to for putting into hand mean to defend successfully against most formidable raid have ever be attempted by ape on way back to eden gave consideration to idea referred to above be long a have be on group without sighting so much a most distant glimpse of sail hope be ever present that day must eventually dawn when must be rescued from imprisonment mild even agreeable a be in respect when day must arrive what must happen to bowata people who must continue to supply with weapon of defence against ferocious enemy be obvious that from moment of departure from group must be left entirely to own resource to seemed that must be only humane if not actual duty to supply mean whereby might be possible for to replenish for supply of bow arrow now how be to be done must see nothing for to provide with something in nature of boat wherein to navigate channel then to show bowata where wood for bow shaft for arrow must be obtained finally teach people how to make bow arrow for fully realised that to present savage with boat might be proceeding not altogether devoid of danger for savage even such apparently harmless savage a neighbour be apt to develop treacherous tendency once provided with boat must be difficult to prevent visiting own particular island of eden when if of possession must chance to excite cupidity who must say what might happen there be of course way whereby danger might be reduced to minimum be by so reducing dimension of boat that must be incapable of carrying more than two men at time determined to do a to material there be plenty of such a required to be obtained from wreck for meant boat to be of simplest construction being in fact nothing more than miniature flat bottomed thames punt to be propelled by pair of paddle having settled matter to satisfaction explained intention to billy that evening a sat together under veranda discussing event of day by light of glorious full moon with kit sprawling a usual at foot intention be to start next day with billy for trip to wreck where proposed to remain until have constructed punt believed must be done in something le than week starting immediately after breakfast taking with carpenter tool chest ample supply of fruit food of course kit who must not possibly be permitted to roam eden at large be deprived of company for whole week voyage be accomplished without incident arrived at wreck early in afternoon found old craft in respect just a have left excepting that cabin having be securely closed during absence be distinctly stuffy be soon remedied however by throwing back companion slide opening skylight scuttle after filled in remainder of afternoon in making up bed in state room preparing generally for week sojourn when be done hour two of daylight still remained utilised by preparing sketch of proposed punt be to be five foot long on bottom with rising floor two foot long at end making nine foot long over with beam of four foot sufficient freeboard to enable to carry two men safely in tranquil water of inner channel being flat bottomed flat sided square ended be easy model to build there be plank to be bent a wreck afforded abundant material a did not aim at such refinement of finish a be included in coat of paint completed task during afternoon of fifth day even to putting over side into water to take up leaving wreck immediately after breakfast next morning with punt in tow arrived at anchorage in eden cove about hour before sunset almost whole of passage being beat to windward while towage of punt further retarded progress however found everything just a have left although think enjoyed little change involved in living on wreck be glad to find once more at home particularly kit whose ramble have be restricted to deck of ship who displayed delight at returning to wider space of eden by starting off at full gallop moment pad touched sand rushing out of sight appearing more until reached house where discovered beggar squatted on top step of veranda awaiting arrival on following morning after breakfast billy got boat under way with punt in tow sailed for cliff island running boat in on beach be quickly joined by bowata who informed that four day earlier ape to number of nine have attempted raid proudly added have be successfully repulsed at expense of many lost arrow hinted pretty broadly that further gift of very useful missile must be highly appreciated whereupon informed that intended to do even better than continue to furnish people with bow arrow be going to present with mean whereby might procure material wherewith to make for a many of weapon a pleased therewith led down to beach directed attention to punt bowata looked at craft grunted approval of be evident that have not remotest notion of how be to be mean of providing with bow arrow so casting off painter billy stepped into paddling along close to beach showed savage in very practical manner how to handle next landing billy taking bowata into punt with handed paddle first directing attention to manner in manipulated own invited to try hand proved apt pupil within hour be able to manoeuvre punt single handed then beaching punt securing to stake firmly driven into beach invited bowata son to enter sailing boat informing that having given mean to navigate channel now proposed to show where to obtain wherewithal from to make a many bow arrow a desired pair entered boat with distinct suggestion of trepidation must understand punt apparently have evidently not yet grasped fact that be wind endowed boat with mobility seemed to regard with distrust a magical craft might a likely a not fly away with never to return be under impression presently appeared that intended to turn adrift to shift for a best must when explained that billy intended to go with fear vanished seated contentedly enough in bottom of boat in place indicated be perfectly clear that not only also fellow savage regarded expedition upon be embarking a quite notable adventure for assembled in force to witness departure admiration apprehension in about equal proportion being dominant expression upon countenance of left behind a boat glided smoothly rapidly away from shore took guest first of to west island upon grew tree from have obtained wood found to be suitable for making of bow having directed bowata attention to characteristic peculiarity of tree a distinguishing from others shinned aloft into one of carrying with small hatchet have come from wreck proceeded to lop off about dozen suitable branch with ample supply of thorn to form arrow head be duly placed aboard boat then shoving off again proceeded by way of north west channel round to shark bay in north island where running boat into swamp cut goodly stock of reed from to make shaft for arrow two task including time occupied in sailing from place to place returning occupied entire day so that be already dusk when having landed bowata son cargo of branch reed arrived back at own island of eden next day billy again sailed for cliff island where with old sheath knife a tool showed bowata how to make bow arrow at same time presenting with hatchet knife quantity of cord from to make bow string spent three day with native supervising work of making bow arrow by time that have used up material with have supplied have attained to degree of proficiency felt must justify in leaving henceforth to own device chapter twelve island of fire have by time be on group eight month although with brief interval spent in visit to wreck sharp look out for appearance of sail in offing have be maintained nothing have be sighted disconcerting possibility now began to impress upon that if continued to trust only to occurrence for deliverance might spend year waiting for event most fortunately have thus far be blessed with perfect health seemed too much to expect that immunity from sickness accident must continue indefinitely if of must chance to fall sick at same time what must be result something very like panic seized at thought of such possibility felt have be culpably foolish in relying so implicitly for so long time upon extraneous help conviction forced upon must at once take step to effect own deliverance yet what must do first idea have suggested to after wreck of brigantine be to build sort of craft in must effect escape to civilisation after considering matter have come to conclusion that undertaking must be altogether beyond power with only billy to assist doubt be helped to conclusion by conviction then felt that something must certainly heave in sight within next month two to take off with lapse of time confidence have insensibly waned have accordingly set to work to make stay upon group a comfortable a might be now however felt constrained to reconsider original conclusion a preliminary took pencil paper drawing instrument scale proceeded to make tentative sketch of such craft a considered essential to enable to make voyage in safety with reasonable amount of comfort to insure requirement decided that boat dimension must be fully decked that must be powerful enough to face successfully battle with whole gale of wind also must be capable of being handled by billy taking requirement a basis set to work upon sketch relative dimension of boat must be governed to considerable extent by rig cutter rigged craft be more powerful than other be open to objection that mainsail cutter most important sail be awkward sail to handle in sudden emergency if craft happens to be short handed a must be believed however that difficulty might be overcome by watchfulness taking of timely precaution therefore after weighing matter carefully decided in favour of cutter rig bearing above requirement in mind set to work ultimately evolved design for craft thirty foot long on water line by ten foot beam six foot draught of water aft to build boat of dimension with only billy to help be sufficiently ambitious project have learned good deal while building existing boat after felt sure that if must need more manpower bowata must willingly lend of people also realising that henceforth billy must be fully occupied in building new boat thought occurred to that be high time to secure such domestic help a must enable to give whole time thought to work without troubling about such matter a cooking house cleaning so on such help must only be obtained through bowata therefore decided to seize early opportunity to interview upon whole matter meanwhile however now that have at last determined to attempt building of sea going boat be impatience to make beginning a further came to conclusion that beginning so far a framing of keel stem sternpost be concerned must be made aboard wreck where material be at hand lost time in again removing with necessary good chattel to what remained of yorkshire lass here made start by laying out full size in chalk upon after deck accurate outline of keel stem sternpost greatly facilitated work chief difficulty discovered be to find bolt at once of required length necessary strength since must not possibly make difficulty absorbed so much time that spent nearly month on wreck before keel stem sternpost be framed together in readiness to be set up on beach at eden where intended to do remainder of work framework be much too big heavy to be conveyed to eden otherwise than by towing a whole trip be more le beat to windward transport of cost two day arrival home occurring so late in afternoon that there be time to attempt anything further that day on day following sailed over to bowata island explained to requirement finding more than eager to do anything everything must to oblige domestic question be very easily arranged bowata suggesting must employ man whom must especially recommend who with two wife must be able to do everything required in particular direction while a for labour for building of cutter assured might have a many men a wished for a long time a needed nothing must be more satisfactory than only point felt doubtful about being domestic part of arrangement billy settled by undertaking to supervise work until man wife must be trained to efficiency plan when put into operation worked excellently keel of new boat being now ready next thing be to set up accurately plumb longitudinally transversely upon building block to do obtained loan of twenty native for day for keel with stem sternpost attached be much too heavy mass of timber for billy to manipulate without assistance with help work be most satisfactorily accomplished doing manual work under billy guidance while supervised directed adjustment be frequently necessary next set up five stout mould one at midship section of boat with two aft two forward of giving exact shape of boat at point to mould firmly attached several temporary wale stringer thus obtaining kind of skeleton giving accurate idea of form of finished boat when have got thus far with work inspected result from various view point be a much amazed at own audacity in attempting so ambitious undertaking a be gratified at appearance presented for saw before outline of very shapely yacht like little ship that if knew anything of such matter promised to be fast weatherly very fine sea boat quite capable of taking care of herself when hove to even in heavy gale of wind be intention to plank upon diagonal principle using three thickness of comparatively thin plank for have mean by to steam single layer of planking of necessary thickness so render pliable enough to bend to correct shape while believed that by using thin plank must bend to shape unsteamed be getting somewhat ahead of yarn however for progress outlined above represented nearly three month hard work appreciable proportion of have to be done second time owing to inexperience with accession of black helper domestic arrangement flourished exceedingly only difficulty experienced in connection with occurring during first fortnight three week after arrival trouble arising with kit who violently resented intrusion have to be kept strictly tied up until have learned to understand that must in nowise interfere with even after reaching stage native have to be exceedingly careful how conducted in presence for never advanced farther than merest toleration of while when of other black be on eden assisting to build cutter be absolutely necessary to keep beast closely confined to house until have left very soon made discovery have be obliged to depend solely upon effort of billy must have be compelled to abandon idea of building cutter at very early stage of operation be not so much that found work beyond strength although in respect be often glad enough to have little additional help be often necessary to have plank waling such matter held firmly in position at dozen point more at same moment while fixed be on such occasion welcomed assistance of native a such occasion occurred pretty frequently happened that be kept au courant with everything of importance with great deal be exceedingly unimportant occurred on cliff island thus came to know contrary to hope expectation arming of native with bow arrow with resulting destruction of raiding ape have be absolutely ineffective in checking raid be now occurring more frequently in greater force than ever appeared almost a though brute be possessed of sufficient intelligence to understand that something have happened rendering no longer possible for attack by small number to be successful that be strengthening attacking force accordingly with evident determination to succeed ultimately at cost be greatly vexed to hear for be evident that existence of such formidable beast in group constituted growing menace to human life in be wondering how menace be to be fought when bowata people without consulting made attempt to solve problem for short time at least seemed to be crowned with success be height of summer there have be spell of six week of very hot dry weather when on certain morning a billy with native be at work upon cutter lad directed attention to thin cloud of light brownish blue smoke rising in air beyond cliff island there be gentle easterly breeze blowing at time sweeping smoke away in direction of west island a watched cloud rapidly increased in density colour darkened somewhat to astonishment seemed to spread in easterly direction against wind soon became clear that be forest on ape island have caught fire be equally evident that thanks to long dry spell to fanning of easterly breeze fire be spreading with great rapidity for within twenty minute of appearance of first light film of smoke be able to see over eastern extremity of cliff island flame speeding up hill side toward conical summit of island preceded by so vast volume of smoke that completely veiled hill of west island from sight while billy stood watching rapid march of flame one of native noticing interest in spectacle approached informed that bowata one of son determined to drive ape off ape island have that morning crossed ape channel in punt have given with avowed intention of setting entire island on fire beginning at northern extremity in order to drive ape away from that part of island from whence be wont to start to swim channel thence working round shore to eastern extremity of island hoping thus to drive anthropoid in westerly southerly direction right away from cliff island a ape island be everywhere densely covered with forest undergrowth be exceedingly probable that unless something unforeseen occurred to extinguish fire living thing upon must be destroyed except such creature a might essay to swim middle channel take refuge upon west island a day progressed fire advanced spreading ever more rapidly a great volume of spark be borne by wind on ahead of main body of flame kindling subsidiary fire in advance began to doubt whether west island must escape remembering a did that there be stretch of middle channel be little more than mile wide across tremendous volume of spark a now filled air might easily be wafted toward evening anticipation in respect be verified for upon ascending to summit of own peak on eden at conclusion of day work saw that not only be surface of ape island unbroken expanse of black smoking ash charred tree stump that fire have leaped middle channel practically whole eastern side of west island be mass of flame destruction of life must of course be enormous such glimpse a have thus far be afforded of animal life upon group seemed to indicate that be inimical to mankind if destruction involved that of ape be not to be greatly regretted waited three day to allow ash to cool then taking billy with sailed for middle channel running boat ashore on ape island at spot where stream of fresh water discharged into narrowest part of channel here landed started to walk eastward over through ash be ankle deep in place still unpleasantly hot be quite prepared to find evidence that destruction of animal life have be tremendous even so be amazed at innumerable scorched shrivelled carcass of creature have made way to water edge have there perished probably suffocated by smoke because have feared to take to water lay thick upon ground huddled together a far a eye must reach to right left of spot where landed odour of burnt flesh be almost overpowering while fly bird swarmed about in legion remains be mostly so far consumed a to be impossible of identification here there came upon what judging from skull teeth have once be creature of cat tribe probably leopard while skeleton of snake of from dimension evidently python be numerous also came upon several carcass of what thought might have be boar if be creature must have be huge specimen of kind there be also few calcined skeleton of animal must have be a big a bigger than british dray horse of very different build did not suggest animal with be acquainted be quite unable to put name to walked two mile more inland before turning back nowhere did see anything suggesting destruction of so much a solitary ape at be in nowise surprised for felt sure that ape at least must be able to keep well ahead of fire make good escape to west island west island be like ape island fire blackened ruin a far a eye must see toward north south if fire have swept clean across island to western shore must mean holocaust in ape also must be involved for there be retreat sanctuary beyond west island be too late to push investigation farther that day resolved that on morrow must see what western side of west island looked like accordingly eight o'clock in morning of following day found billy emerging from north west channel into lagoon hauling round to southward to skirt western shore of west island needed not to travel so far a however to discover at least part of west island have escaped ravage of fire for upon arrival off south western extremity of cliff island saw that owing to greatly increased width of middle channel at point direction of wind peculiar configuration of island area roughly estimated at about hundred square mile at northern extremity have be untouched by flame area of forest although probably little more than quarter of of whole island must still afford cover for good many animal have sense instinct to escape to be not until have rounded northern extremity of west island have followed west coast southward for distance of about eleven mile that again came upon ruin wrought by flame found have swept right across island leaving area above referred to untouched while to southward a far a eye must see be black ruin desolation at point too sign of devastation wrought upon animal life of island began to reveal in shape first of isolated carcass then of group of same rapidly becoming more numerous more crowded a boat glided along southward within stone throw of beach a be exceedingly anxious to discover whether not ape have escaped destruction have overtaken other creature inhabiting two fire stricken island landed at various point along beach made short investigating excursion inland coming upon remains of animal reptile of several different kind variety indeed be astonishing including regretted to see two three variety of deer at length found half consumed carcass of three ape close together found more day be by time drawing on toward sunset accordingly made sail for wreck of brigantine took up quarter aboard for night early on following morning resumed inspection of west island starting at point where have left off on previous evening on day came upon remains of two more ape several mile apart although five carcass of ape be that found be of course quite possible that there might have be many more for excursion inland be necessarily of very limited extent to have made anything approaching complete examination of burnt area must have be work of week rather than of day be indisposed to devote very much time to undertaking moreover effluvium arising from so many rapidly decomposing carcass be of sufficient deterrent slight limited a be examination sufficed to prove that island must have literally swarmed with animal life several specie of be a in case of found on ape island quite new to late in day having extended walk to crest of hill discovered that there be little south of middle of island triangular shaped lake about six mile long by about five mile broad at western end have served to protect preserve clump of forest about two mile long sound proceeded from indicated that many animal have found sanctuary there by time that have completed survey be too late to think of returning to eden day so again bore up for wreck spending night aboard returning to own island on day following on way back touched at cliff island have chat with bowata relating to result of trip of inspection told that have seen very few dead ape hazarded conjecture that brute retreating before flame on own island have swum middle channel to west island on northern unburnt portion of might have established when suggested that portion also of island must be set on fire to make assurance doubly sure very strongly demurred pointing out that even if conjecture must be correct unburned forest must doubtless be swarming with animal life other than of ape that must be very great pity to destroy in order to effect extermination of ape unless drastic measure must prove to be imperatively necessary after little break following upon firing of ape island returned with enthusiasm to work upon cutter in course of month used up available material have thus far accumulated necessitating visit to wreck to obtain more collected a large quantity a believed must conveniently handle forming into raft took in tow for transport to eden passage under ordinary condition must easily be accomplished in single day occupied five day be think toughest job have ever undertaken in life raft being so deadly sluggish in movement that be impossible to tow to windward finally found compelled to kedge more than way be glad when have at length brought safely into cove anchored there for now have enough material to carry on with for at least four month estimated that raft of equal size must suffice to complete cutter notwithstanding difficulty have just encountered felt strongly inclined to return forthwith to wreck procure sufficiency for future need be very tired after labour finally persuaded to postpone task for while to subsequent intense regret anniversary of wreck of yorkshire lass arrived passed have be whole year on group so far a knew not solitary sail of description have come within sight of island during whole of twelve month be astounding incomprehensible fact have never really anticipated possibility with passage of day week month have said to myself with gradually waning assurance certainly can not be long now before craft of sort come along to take off until moment when suddenly dawned upon that if be ever to escape must be through own effort own especially conviction now came upon with overwhelming force hope of deliverance by mean of extraneous agency suddenly sank to zero began to work with such febrile energy that presently drew from billy steadily growing flood of remonstrance have by time expended so much of material be in very act of preparing for visit to wreck to obtain more when poor billy fell sick of sort of fever within three hour of seizure became delirious be so extremely violent that being by time strong sturdy boy be obliged to at once drop everything else to look after see that did not injure during more severe paroxysm of course have long ago taken precaution to secure possession of ship medicine chest with accompanying book of instruction latter afforded little help for must find in case symptom of quite corresponded with of patient be therefore compelled to rely very much upon own judgment upon instruction for treatment of fever in general liberal administration of quinine seemed to constitute most hopeful form of treatment luckily possessed ample supply of drug accordingly dosed billy with for close upon sixty hour when delirium ceased poor boy sank into semi stupor of exhaustion enabled one of native woman to relieve by watching at patient bedside have by time be without sleep for two night more than three day be therefore glad enough to be free to retire to own room to rest for hour two arrived there removed boot then without troubling to remove further clothing flung upon bed instantly sank into complete oblivion chapter thirteen exterminate ape be aroused to consciousness by flash of dazzling light upon closed eyelid accompanied by crash of terrific clap of thunder opening eye discovered that room be in opaque darkness showing must have be allowed to sleep at least eight hour even a swung foot to floor started to grope for boot while reverberation of thunder clap still rumbled echoed in distance there came blinding flash of lightning instantly followed by deafening crash of thunder getting bearing by illumination of lightning started to foot forgetting boot rushed to billy bedside apprehensive of what might be effect of storm upon found patient not only awake also in right mind well billy boy how be by time demanded believe be better thank mr blackburn replied boy feel very weak oh goodness be hot be have just found time to become aware of excessive heat closeness of atmosphere perspiration be simply streaming from pore of body felt suffocating for want of sufficient air door window of bungalow be wide open atmosphere be absolutely stagnant naked flame of newly ignited lamp burning without faintest flicker one of native domestic be now busying arranging table in what called dining room in laying out material for supper for for now appeared that have slept for nearly fourteen hour on end good woman insisted that must have meal at once while preparation be in progress went out stood under veranda to take look at weather thunder clap have broken in upon slumber proved to be prelude to terrific electrical disturbance be now in full action centre of disturbance appeared to be almost immediately overhead for flash after flash of lightning be striking round house while detonation of thunder be continuous so violent that felt floor literally tremble beneath foot lightning be not confined to discharge from cloud overhead be darting earthward round practically at distance from zenith to horizon so frequent be discharge that illumination from be continuous revealing vault packed with enormous mass of heavy black writhing cloud stood for perhaps five minute fascinated by spectacle of vivid lightning play then just a native woman came out to announce that supper be ready down came rain in perfect deluge in moment eaves of house foliage of tree earth poured with soft warm water be too good opportunity to be wasted so hurried to own room threw off clothes seized morsel of soap dashing out to midst of downpour treated to most delightful refreshing bath a preliminary to supper rain continued for about hour then ceased with abruptness seems so characteristic of tropic have scarcely come to end when there arose loud rustling of leaf among tree in garden round about house blast of hot wind poured in through open door window violently slamming former causing latter to rattle furiously have barely time to rush close when terrific squall came roaring down upon bungalow squall be only precursor of several followed other at rapidly decreasing interval until interval became so brief a to be no longer distinguishable wind settled into roaring gale from westward blew night did not break until close upon noon next day a luck must have have chosen eastern slope of peak a site upon to erect bungalow consequently structure be to very great extent sheltered from gale by hill behind even so building quivered shook under stroke of blast heart sank a thought of wreck for felt that have not one chance in thousand of weathering out be on what be now windward reef a have be when struck upon surf must pile up on reef again raising level of water by perhaps three four foot in case poor old yorkshire lass must be washed off coral into lagoon must there sink with must go material needed for completion of cutter then there be cutter at least a much of a have thus far be put together how must stand buffeting to be being subjected be hopeful for be at time merely skeleton very imperfect skeleton at consequently there must not be much for wind to take hold of yet be anxious too for feared lest heavy rain might have displaced of keel block so let craft down perhaps strained out of shape so anxious indeed be must have gone down to cove at once despite fury of wind night be so pitch dark must have seen nothing single handed must have done anything might have happened so be perforce obliged to defer visit until daylight when daylight came fought way down to cove against gale be still blowing there found to inexpressible relief that nothing have happened what must be put right in hour two be naturally most anxious to ascertain what if anything have happened to wreck be not until nearly week after gale billy have progressed so far toward recovery be able to leave entirely to care of native when however moment arrived took immediate advantage of starting for scene of wreck immediately after early breakfast enjoining billy not to be anxious must be detained until next day with fair wind way boat made short mile of trip reached scene of wreck fairly early in afternoon at least hour before arrival worst fear be realised for where wreck have once be there be now sign of knew pretty well where to look for coasting along inner edge of reef ultimately came upon within few fathom of reef sunk in six fathom of water of course irrevocably lost to thought however that possibly useful wreckage might be floating about in lagoon therefore worked boat over to west island beach near to did indeed find few plank small odds end have broken adrift floated off when wreck went down formed into small raft towed round to eden on following day when looked from skeleton of cutter to small quantity of material available for completion heart sank within felt utterly discouraged for what have be ridiculously inadequate be not enough even to complete shell of craft where on earth be to get more there be of course thousand of tree on group have axe with to fell when be felled how be to convert into plank scantling be problem puzzled over during whole day succeeding return to eden seeking in vain for solution until at last seemed that be really doomed to remain where be until taken off by ship even though must grow old while awaiting arrival conclusion must doubtless have be terribly discouraging to many people after first shock effect upon be on contrary so provocative that resumed work upon cutter with more resolution than ever if be possible until six week later have used up available material work be perforce brought to standstill when happened have made such progress that cutter be planked up to gunwale with first thickness of planking so thoroughly satisfied be with work be determined nothing must prevent completion even though to provide necessary material must be compelled to pull down bungalow break up sailing boat such forcible measure a however demanded most careful consideration before adoption meanwhile rank luxuriance of tropical plant growth have already changed fire blackened area of ape west island to varying tint of delicate green several variety of new vegetation seeming to find congenial condition in thick coat of ash resulting from fire learned from bowata whose people have be maintaining close watch upon island thus far sign of animal life have be detected upon of although chief agreed with that might be case with ape island west island at least unburnt part of must be simply swarming with living creature conviction that be so be causing people so much uneasiness that permanent watch have be established at western end of cliff island native resident there to number of forty have be armed with bow arrow that might be prepared to repel possible incursion of ape from part of west island channel at point being little wider than ape be wont to swim when crossing from own island liability to incursion by ape seemed to be only source of anxiety on part of bowata people in other respect appeared to be perfectly happy for want be few so fertile be soil of own island that amply supplied want with very little exertion on part of easy going inhabitant trouble be that product of industry unfortunately appealed so strongly to appetite of anthropoid to gratify brute be willing to swim channel mile wide trouble be serious enough in conscience for a gradually learned in course of frequent conversation with chief ape not only destroyed far more than ate until introduction of bow arrow a weapon be only driven off with utmost difficulty frequently with serious loss of life on part of savage be indeed to put effectual end to frequent raid upon property that native in desperation have finally resorted to drastic measure of setting fire to island harboured monster longer meditated upon problem of how to meet shortage of material for completion of cutter more reluctant did become to resort to so extreme measure a breaking up of sailing boat still more bungalow to supply deficiency in perplexity visited east island here possible way out of difficulty be suggested to by discovery a then for first time particularly noticed that certain of tree flourishing on island appeared to be if not actually cedar at least specie very nearly akin thereto if upon closer investigation must prove to be case here be supply of timber admirably suited to requirement ample beyond utmost need be matter worthy of most particular attention accordingly selected group of supposed cedar forthwith proceeded to operate upon be three in number of just about right size for requirement be within quarter of mile of cove began investigation by hacking off good stout branch stripping off bark testing working quality found that wood gave off characteristic odour of cedar that be close grained that be easily workable that be in short everything must possibly desire therefore started work in earnest by felling tree have already attacked trimming off branch brought day work to close returned to eden with mind relieved of heavy load of anxiety for there be now no longer need to contemplate breaking up of boat bungalow true have found wood required what needed be thin plank not heavy balk of timber such a one might be able to hew out of tree trunk with axe how be to obtain plank considered matter suddenly remembered that cedar split easily therefore determined to ascertain by actual experiment whether must be possible to procure plank required by splitting felled trunk experiment be on whole successful for although wasted more timber than anticipated nevertheless succeeded in securing several very fine plank that when operated upon with plane must be reduced to exact thickness required thus encouraged made estimate of quantity of planking required to complete hull of cutter then proceeded to fell a many tree a be needed to furnish quantity be while be thus engaged that one day received urgent visit from bowata son who came in great distress to inform that watcher posted at western extremity of cliff island to guard against surprise attack on part of ape believed to have retreated to west island have that morning reported that anthropoid be recrossing middle channel to ape island that from observation of creature movement be strongly suspected that meditated attack in force upon cliff island inhabitant bowata concluded communication with entreaty must lend aid to repel threatened attack at once acceded to request with two native aboard sailing boat punt in tow proceeded to eden where collected arm ammunition possessed taking billy with made sail for cliff island a approached northern extremity of ape island from point brute usually started on swim across channel to cliff island telescope revealed numerous ape clustered together upon beach while many others must be seen wending way toward same spot must see none in water so concluded that threatened raid have not yet started inquired of bowata how many of people be now armed with bow arrow be gratified to learn that male above age of fifteen have be so armed meant that there be more than hundred archer to defend island learning came to conclusion that best form of defence be attack made plan accordingly landing bowata son to conduct defence of island took aboard boat seven native who chief assured be among most expert bowman headed across channel toward ape island plan being to cruise to fro opposite spot where ape be mustering to pick off a many of brute a possible while passing at point channel be only about mile wide ten minute therefore sufficed to accomplish passage to round to at distance of twenty yard from beach where fifty sixty of gigantic brute be now assembled most of squatting upon haunch a though awaiting signal of sort while others be joining at rate of two three per minute a boat approached monster eyed malignantly while several rose to foot a though preparing to repel attack suited purpose well a boat under billy skilful handling rounding to into wind with sail shiver glided slowly past spot where ape be congregated deliberately selected target drawing bow to full length of arrow let fly with deadly effect arrow went home many of finding heart with scream of mingled pain rage eight of ape crashed to ground few of writhing convulsively in death agony most of dead there be time for second discharge before boat drifted too far away three more of brute went down while five of comrade screaming bellowing with pain rage wrenched arrow from wound of in blind fury turning upon savagely attacking fellow manoeuvre be so successful that be repeated with equally satisfactory result thus far unwounded ape appeared to take little notice of havoc be working among feel certain that none of connected that havoc with appearance of boat upon scene when manoeuvre be repeated third time still more of number fell dead wounded seemed at last to dawn upon imperfect intelligence that strange object with white sail glided to fro upon water opposite must be somehow associated with casualty occurring among companion with yell of concentrated fury eye ablaze with deadly malice about dozen of shambled down beach into water striking out started to swim in pursuit of boat nothing must have better suited than senseless act of great anthropoid for although swam fast boat must easily out distance in breeze then blowing signed to billy to edge away toward wider part of channel so that when must discover how impossible be to overtake boat might have farther to swim must of escape attempt to make way across to cliff island precaution be unnecessary for when be in water swimming must do a must with within few minute ape have started in pursuit of boat be slain by time however others have also taken to water there being now at least thirty of swimming in pursuit of boat while others headed directly across channel toward cliff island necessitated alteration of plan yet still contrived to keep boat between ape island crossing recrossing in front of brute at distance of five to ten yard so that be impossible for to miss thus slaughter went on until very soul revolted at such terrible destruction for brute continued to come on by dozen score until there seemed to be end of most creature must have have intelligence enough to recognise eventually that persistence meant death to must have turned back discouraged terrified ape seemed to be incapable of emotion pressed resolutely on so that destruction became imperative if native of cliff island be not to be abandoned to tender mercy sort of thing must not go on for ever number of brute gradually decreased at end of about three hour last ape in sight succumbed to attack then appeared probable that have exterminated entire tribe of dangerous formidable creature chapter fourteen attacked by chinese pirate destruction of ape accomplished returned with avidity to task of felling cedar tree on east island splitting trunk into plank for completion of cutter for have by time entirely abandoned hope of rescue by passing ship be about three week later that emerging on certain morning from bedroom stepping out to veranda to scan offing according to custom before beginning regular routine of day gaze be instantly arrested by object poised on very verge of horizon twelve mile distant showing up almost black against vivid hue of early morning eastern sky be yet too small to be capable of identification by unassisted eye therefore darted back into house procuring telescope brought to bear upon stranger a focused image of distant object in lens of instrument experienced moment of most bitter disappointment for when gaze first fell upon tiny speck thought instantly leapt to mind that at long last moment of deliverance have arrived whereas moment two later telescope revealed to disconcerting fact that craft in sight heading straight for group be chinese junk may be certain of reader will wonder why approach of chinese junk to group must cause such acute disappointment may perhaps ask question be not chinese junk a capable a other vessel of rescuing shipwrecked people conveying back to civilisation to question must reply yes undoubtedly under certain circumstance let explain proviso implied in reply have boy billy only be concerned must have trusted aboard junk there be treasure to be considered be not altogether ignorant concerning character reputation of chinese sailor there may be probably be chinaman who be a honourable upright honest a average englishman experience such a have be be that be not to be found aboard junk chinese seaman be a rule drawn from lowest stratum of people among such men moral sense if not absolutely lacking be very nearly so be barbarian instinct be primitive honour honesty be word have meaning for be before thing else intensely acquisitive if want thing will take if can woe betide owner if resists in word chinese seaman be by instinct pirate cruel bloodthirsty one at hence feeling of disappointment at sight of junk for how must hope that treasure must remain inviolate if placed in power of such men a have endeavoured to describe must cut throat without scruple in order to posse of content of chest very appearance of be irresistibly suggestive of treasure took not moment to determine that rather than expose ourselves to such possible risk must have nothing to do with junk if must avoid must junk be heading straight for group running before light easterly breeze must probably give speed of about three knot in course of next three hour must be close enough to enable crew to see bungalow existence of be impossible to conceal built a be high up on hill side with passage through reef immediately opposite be at reasonable to suppose that craft must sail past group without calling to investigate there be of course possibility that junk in sight might be perfectly harmless that if entered lagoon must be merely to satisfy curiosity perhaps to obtain little fruit to replenish stock of fresh water if so well good if not if crew happened to be composed of such ruffian a have endeavoured to picture what then must hope that must be satisfied merely to come up to bungalow ask few question in pidgin english depart leaving unscathed to suppose such thing must be to say least of foolishness probability be that must attack sack place carrying away everything that took fancy including treasure chest murder billy burn down house out of sheer love of destruction reflection have taken so long to record flashed through mind upon instant following recognition of character of stranger realisation of danger possibly threatened naturally led up to question how be that danger to be averted must billy alone hope to put up successful defence against attack by perhaps thirty forty determined men for let chinaman be what may in other respect be not easily daunted by sense of personal danger especially if animated by hope of plunder then in moment there came to memory of bowata native of cliff island have be most profuse in expression of gratitude for help have afforded from time to time have repeatedly declared eagerness to find opportunity to give practical demonstration of gratitude here be opportunity be needed be to make aware of took long look at junk came to conclusion that must not reach lagoon in much le than four hour must allow time to make single trip in boat to cliff island get into touch with bowata secure assistance return to eden with dusky reinforcement decided to do so without waiting for breakfast at once started for cove boat wind being fair made quick run across to cliff island swift footed native boy soon brought bowata down to landing place where usually met explaining circumstance to found a have quite anticipated more than ready to render possible assistance departing to muster men returned in very short time with nineteen of most reliable fighter boat utmost capacity be twenty in addition to myself chief naturally elected to accompany head party men bowata assured be pick of entire tribe quite believed for although small slight compared with average englishman be lithe wiry active resolute looking men with eager gleam in eye seemed to suggest that prospect of fight be reverse of distasteful to be armed with bow quiver full of arrow most formidable looking war club head of be thickly studded with bone spike promised to be terribly effective at close quarter latter being quite recent addition to armoury invented by bowata son whose imagination have at last be stimulated by persistent attack of ape return passage to eden half of be dead beat to windward with boat loaded to utmost capacity occupied so long time be in perfect fever of anxiety lest junk must arrive before upon rounding south east point of cliff island be somewhat relieved to see that have so far not entered lagoon did see sign of during remainder of passage for low down in water a be spray of surf breaking upon reef effectually veiled from view everything outside there be still sign of junk when at boat entered little cove be usual landing place grounded on beach ten minute later surmounted crest of ridge on far side of stood bungalow once more got view of open sea outside over curtain of everlasting spray have obstructed view from boat junk be visible clearly enough hove to at distance of about mile to windward of reef hurried to house for telescope might obtain nearer view of what be happening aboard seizing telescope proceeded to veranda from brought instrument to bear upon craft now saw that have lowered boat manned by crew of five be heading for opening in reef immediately opposite island boat watched keeping telescope bearing upon a alternately topped disappeared behind long ridge of swell until at length passed through opening entered lagoon once through reef headed straight for eden looked a though men in contemplated landing on beach at foot of slope upon bungalow be built whereupon thought well to hoist brigantine ensign upon flagstaff have set up in front of bungalow a hint to intruder that island be british territory that inhabitant expected that territory to be respected boat approaching cautiously at length reached point about quarter of mile from beach when crew lay upon oar while man in stern sheet rose to foot proceeded to subject eden a much of rest of group a be visible from point of view to prolonged scrutiny after at sign from oar again dipped in water turning boat recrossed lagoon made way back to junk there be now pause in proceeding during conjectured man who have be in charge of boat be making report to skipper pause however be not of long duration for a continued to watch sign of sudden stir aboard junk became perceptible few minute later saw that crew be lowering two more boat much larger than first that considerable number of men who so far a be possible to see at distance be armed be swarming down junk side into seemed to indicate that worst suspicion regarding character of vessel be only too well founded that pretty stiff fight be in prospect for if must be so be time to see about making disposition for conflict accordingly re entered house girding on cutlas thrust brace of fully loaded revolver into belt seized own pet rifle filling jacket pocket with cartridge sallied forth joining bowata party led down to beach particular strip of beach must be explained be quite unlike other beach of group latter composed of white coral sand be continuous smooth unencumbered averaged from thirty foot wide in case to a much a hundred foot wide in others usually sloped steeply enough to enable boat with good way on to run high enough on to permit to land dry footed on other hand beach toward be now heading be strip of coral sand not more than quarter of mile long perfectly smooth sloping so very gently that much doubted whether boat have seen preparing to leave junk must approach within fifty yard of shore without grounding circumstance most greatly in favour be that comparatively short length of beach while inviting enough in appearance a landing place be backed on shore side by outcrop of black rock offered splendid cover for defending force while leaving attacker from sea completely exposed peculiarity of shore rendered morally certain that beach must be actual battle ground in coming conflict be with view to decision there that made final arrangement posted bowata men having done to satisfaction took rifle advanced to open beach where seated upon detached fragment of rock patiently awaited development proved to be somewhat slow in arriving period of waiting be rendered more tedious from fact that low down on beach a now be continuous veil of spray flying over reef effectually hid everything might be happening to seaward at length after waiting for fully hour for something to happen one of chinese boat appeared in gap in reef closely followed by second third two leading boat be largish craft pulling eight oar appeared to be carrying fourteen sixteen men while third be much smaller craft have already once entered lagoon crew of seemed now to be augmented by three four extra men once clear of passage formed in line abreast smaller boat between two big one while one man doubtless leader of expedition stood in stern sheet directing movement of little flotilla from time to time by wave of hand distance across lagoon at point from reef to beach of eden be about mile boat be therefore not long in traversing distance did not intend to allow unwelcome visitor to land without protest of sort at same time giving something in nature of warning therefore waited until boat have arrived within about two hundred yard of beach when rising to foot discharged rifle aiming to send shot few yard above head of leader who be still standing in stern sheet of smaller boat a though rifle shot have be signal oarsman of three of boat instantly ceased rowing tremendous jabbering arose among leader silenced by raising hand at same time shouting what took to be sharp command oarsman dipped starboard oar sweeping three boat broadside on to beach next moment be saluted by shower of bullet slug from twenty jingals for instant air about seemed to be full of lead be untouched knowing that must take minute two to reload wheeled about crossing half dozen yard of open ground took cover behind convenient rock a did so boat again wheeled into line abreast with crew excitedly jabbering shouting to other dashed toward beach at full speed leader drawing most formidable looking sword waving above head with shout of encouragement to men a have foreseen boat advanced few length farther when two bigger one stopped dead having grounded several of occupant unprepared for sudden stoppage toppled over backward causing great confusion among comrade at moment whistled shrilly whereupon bowata merry men arose from behind ambush among rock taking deliberate aim poured into boat flight of arrow one of must have told so short be range so great be confusion that ensued among chinese meanwhile smaller boat being of lighter draught continued to come stem on for beach be covering with rifle nicely resting in notch of rock in front of a came fair end on pressed trigger two foremost oarsman collapsed on oar of evidently shot by one bullet naturally added to confusion leader who appeared to exercise great influence over men soon restored order shouting command to follower caused in grounded boat to leap overboard where with water nearly up to waist paused for moment to discharge second volley from jingals then tossing cumbersome firearm back into boat uttered yell drew sword came charging helter skelter through water toward beach be opportunity for bowata party who with arrow ready fitted to bow string again rose from behind covering rock let fly at enemy of arrow missed mark about three quarter of be effective one man observed receiving no le than three shaft in body five of enemy fell while others came staggering forward with arrow sunk deep in various part of anatomy leader of band however remained unhurt continued by shout to urge men forward to attack be evident that follower derived great encouragement from word action to put hors de combat must practically be to win battle therefore leaving now empty rifle leaning against rock behind have be crouching drew cutlas advanced to meet fellow determined to personally tackle put out of action without loss of time be sufficiently formidable antagonist must be admitted two inch taller than broad in proportion with enormously massive chest shoulder great muscle stood out like cable under skin of bare arm feature be typically tartar small eye blazed with ferocity a waving sword above head advanced with shout of defiance to meet meanwhile bowata follower poured in still flight of arrow then flinging down bow gripped formidable war club uttering weird yell charged across sand fell upon chinaman a emerged from water quite anticipated that fight between leader must be long exceedingly tough one to amazement be begun finished in breath man came charging upon with uplifted sword evident intention being to make cut at head must finish out of hand indeed very nearly accomplished purpose for a raised cutlas to guard head blade descended upon with terrific force shore weapon clean in two if have not at same moment stepped nimbly aside must assuredly have be cloven to eye a be descending weapon missed by hair breadth shearing large hole in sleeve of shirt not touching skin scarcely realising what be about acting upon instinct impulse of moment suppose before antagonist must again raise weapon violently thrust severed blade into face a staggered back with force of blow whipped out revolver shot through head ended fight for a man fell dead at foot shout of mingled horror consternation arose from chinese who happened to witness incident who thereupon incontinently turned fled to boat example immediately followed by comrade hotly pursued by black who plied war club with terrible effect be disastrous adventure for chinaman for of total number engaged estimated to be between thirty forty only eleven escaped for counted on other hand casualty on side be remarkably small numbering only seven wounded wound consisting entirely of sword cut none of be serious of seven bowata happened to be one wound consisting of sword thrust through upper part of left arm therefore took six companion in misfortune up to house to dress wound leaving remainder of party on beach to collect weapon spent arrow to clear up generally surgical duty occupied about hour half when patient have be attended to sent with billy down to cove to be ferried across in sailing boat to cliff island where doubt own people must look after then remembering that there be wounded chinaman among abandoned upon beach started down to see what must be done for for although party of wounded doubt treacherous vindictive chink must be most embarrassing charge to have on hand common humanity demanded that must not be left to perish miserably where have fallen before however have covered distance between bungalow beach met remaining black marching triumphantly up hill singing song of victory carrying not only own recovered weapon also several sword that have taken from fallen enemy also brought rifle have left on beach sword scabbard belt of chinese leader solemnly handed over to a victor seeing that have evidently be busy among fallen asked whether there be many wounded among latter to man whom be questioning replied be dead pointing significantly to blood smeared war club by way of explanation well may perhaps seem inhuman to say be not altogether sorry men be undoubtedly pirate if not by profession pirate at least when opportunity seemed to be favourable have attacked deliberately without provocation for help of black billy must unquestionably have be wiped out ten dozen of such men wounded must have be terribly embarrassing charge for to have assumed must have be still more embarrassing to have have about place when be again hale strong taking everything into consideration be not altogether sorry that have be put beyond possibility of perpetrating further mischief meanwhile what have become of junk have looked for just before leaving bungalow on way back to beach have sighted six mile off in south eastern quarter heading to southward close hauled by judged that further trouble need be looked for from there be dead on beach to be disposed of without loss of time how must disposal be best effected considered matter presently hit upon plan chinese in precipitate flight have abandoned two of boat namely small one one of bigger one two must be sufficient to contain whole of dead having now decided upon mode of procedure led little band of black warrior back to beach with assistance transferred dead chinaman to two abandoned boat have barely completed gruesome task when billy returned with sailing boat whereupon boarded sailed round from cove to east beach took chinese boat in tow anchored for night under lee of northern extremity of eden next day again took boat in tow with party of eight native to help towed to beach of north island where buried dead chinaman smaller of two boat then presented to bowata in recognition of assistance have rendered in repelling attack by chinese while bigger one kept for sake of material must be valuable to in completion of cutter be while clearing up putting matter generally straight after chinaman unwelcome visit that sword of leader again came under notice impelled by curiosity drew weapon from sheath subjected to somewhat critical examination for if must prove satisfactory intended to make use of in future in place of cutlas blade of have shorn through with such perfect ease found to be somewhat heavier than cutlas blade being considerably thicker than of other weapon though not quite so wide be however perfectly balanced be able to wield with utmost ease while be literally a keen edged a razor so exquisite be temper that there be sign of notch indentation of description on edge along entire length from point to hilt returned to sheath with much satisfaction feeling have effected most profitable exchange chapter fifteen surprising reappearance be about three week later that a billy foregathered in living room of bungalow early on certain morning discussing biscuit early cup of coffee prior to setting out for matutinal bath always preceded work of day billy asked by way mr blackburn did kit disturb at last night be so uneasy have to turn out twice go to time found standing at top of veranda step straining at leash latterly always tied up at night switching tail fiercely uttering half suppressed growl a though scented heard something unusual prowling near house be only by staying with for about hour at last succeeded in quieting down see be afraid must awake knew how frightfully tired must be after long day work at cutter under broiling sun hope ape other unpleasant creature have found way to eden be lurking to frighten life out of think need not greatly fear said same there be probably cause for kit uneasiness by way did not in least disturb for never heard may a well try to discover what be therefore after breakfast will take rifle give look round be however unnecessary to wait until after breakfast for elucidation of mystery for when billy reached beach upon stood nearly complete hull of cutter two ragged unkempt sunburnt scarecrow emerged from shadow of craft approached mornin ' mister remarked taller of pair in must be hearty tone of voice that nevertheless somehow suggested cringing a did manner well here be again turned up like bad penny just in time by look of to help ye finish dandy yacht sail to wherever think of goin ' what exclaimed in inexpressible amazement can be possible that be svorenssen van ryn why believed that rest of crew of yorkshire lass be drowned when be wrecked more than year ago so be mister very nigh replied svorenssen there be only three of besides billy that escaped be dirk here chap named flemin ' pete used to call 'im when ship struck be washed overboard by first sea a broke aboard nat'rally of a must swim struck out a soon a head rose above water say mister ai there breakfast knockin ' about have ate nothin ' since yesterday a'ternoon be feelin pretty sharp set can tell ye breakfast reiterated why of course will be ready in about hour time can not come up to house a be know by way be by chance prowling about in neighbourhood of house last night ay be answered svorenssen landed on beach below made out at once in moonlight guessed a be yours be for rousin ' out to give bite o supper that dog o yours growled so vicious seemed so savage that decided to wait till mornin ' be extremely fortunate for that did said dog a call happens to be leopard if have persisted in attempt to approach house pair of must assuredly have be killed tell at once by way of warning beast will 'ave to be shained oop else how be to go in out of der 'ouse demanded van ryn will not go in out of house retorted there be room for there then just look at yourselves be a indecent in matter of clothing a be filthy in person before anything else will have to cleanse yourselves be clothed decently condition of clothes can not help suppose being castaway for more than year might at least have kept body clean be disgustingly verminous of after have have meal first business must be to get yourselves clean will remain here while billy go up to house bring down breakfast after must see what can be done to make reasonably presentable right mister answered svorenssen will keep clear of 'ouse never fear want to be tore to piece by leopard after tryin ' utmost for over year to get to ye lend hand in might be doin ' to get away from ruddy hole be just a anxious a can be to get away from may bet on well said to billy a turned away to retrace step to house bath completely forgotten reappearance of svorenssen van ryn be surprise not altogether agreeable one at never particularly liked of impressed from very beginning a being insubordinate of disposition impatient of discipline have not forgotten character that boatswain chip gave how did behave before joined yorkshire lass billy have father ever trouble with yes in way good deal answered billy what boatswain chip said about be quite true other two foreigner be always quarrelling with rest of forecastle hand wanted to do only just what work suited not what father wanted to do from what other men said believe that dago must have mutinied if have not be for chance of getting hold of sharing treasure returning to house billy snatched hasty meal then started back for beach bearing with food two suit of lightest clothing slop chest afforded two blue striped shirt two cloth cap soap towel comb pair of scissors two seaman be too hungry to talk much while discussing meal did attempt to question just then curbing curiosity until more favourable opportunity to satisfy must present when pair have finished eating marched off to river where handing soap towel bade strip enter water thoroughly cleanse from accumulated grime of year neglect at length done set to cut other hair beard generally render a decent looking respectable a be possible after handed new clothes bade burn old rag seemed to consider quite unreasonably particular grumbled good deal at what appeared to regard a wholly unnecessary trouble be imposing upon must take denial when at length realised intended to have way surlily submitted in end believe that in despite of be rather glad have be so insistent for when once more stood fully clothed appearance be improved almost beyond recognition seemed quite pleased with be by mean so pleased however when in response to remark by one of gave to clearly understand must not house in bungalow that during comparatively short period of further stay on group must have to be content with such accommodation a tent must afford argued hotly that being castaway survivor from same shipwreck stood upon perfectly equal footing be alike entitled to share equally in everything to replied that bungalow sailing boat cutter be mine built with own hand out of material salved by from wreck that have not participated helped in slightest degree in of salving building operation therefore considered be not entitled to claim share in comfort advantage arising from operation that a act of grace be prepared to allow reasonable share of comfort advantage while if must help to complete cutter make ready for sea assist on voyage must be welcome to passage in for heated five minute believed be in for very serious trouble with two men in midst of argument be chiefly between van ryn svorenssen intervened drawing companion away saying few hasty word seemed to have effect of wonderfully calming dutchman excitement dispute ended by admitting rather lamely thought that since be evidently master of situation supposed must make best of accept what chose to give a to helping with completion of cutter expressed a only too willing to do so since have have more than enough of robinson crusoeing now said to a toilet at length completed moved away from stream must again warn to keep well clear of house have already told that animal last night mistook for dog be leopard now that have arrived on island will be obliged to keep tied up if approach house will be at peril for if kit see scent of will probably break adrift will simply be torn limb from limb be most ferocious creature will not tolerate stranger so bear in mind what say give wide berth bud vants to see house protested van ryn how be to do that will have to forgo pleasure so be there be about replied dryly if brute interveres mit vill kill 'im threatened dutchman will said why man must stand more chance with leopard than if be merest baby enough of have better pitch tent on beach close to cutter go down there now choose spot to suit yourselves billy will come down later on with sail pole what other gear be necessary help to rig up by mid afternoon tent consisting of brigantine fore course have salved be satisfactorily rigged up trench dug round to carry off water in event of rain sufficiency of rude efficient furniture stored within somewhat to surprise pair who be to occupy expressed a quite satisfied then since be too late in day to do much work upon cutter invited seaman to give detailed account of how have fared since wreck be svorenssen who undertook to tell story told in coarse uncouth language of forecastle embellishing emphasising here there after manner of shellback by introduction of word phrase comprehensible enough to confusing quite unintelligible to landsman will therefore take liberty of translating narrative into plain simple english for benefit of reader thus translated ran a follows must have be about hour after chip came for'ard with news that have met with accident have be carried down into cabin gale be still blowing a heavy a ever when of on forecastle thought heard sound above shriek of wind hiss of sea looking ahead presently saw stretching away on bow a far a must see unbroken line of wildly leaping breaker flying spray at once hailed quarterdeck shouting breaker ahead on bow be exceedingly doubtful whether not be heard if have be must have made difference for before anything must be done ship be among breaker second later struck not very hard just sufficiently so to cant broadside on then struck again hung until tremendous sea broke aboard sweeping deck doubtless washing hand on deck overboard at event sea took swept helplessly over bow a also van ryn man named fleming knew nothing about until next morning being swimmer instinctively struck out have not made more than dozen stroke before hand struck something that at once seized clung to proved to be bit of topgallant bulwark about six foot long afforded most welcome support especially a sea be still breaking over so furiously that be only with utmost difficulty contrived to snatch breath between while breaking sea came near to smothering be also sweeping away fast to leeward after time found in smoother water sea no longer broke over water being quite warm experienced discomfort apart from uncertainty a to what be to eventually happen to just kept paddling along to leeward following run of sea might have be overboard about hour when clearing salt water out of eye caught loom of land ahead through darkness sight of greatly cheered for have doubt of ability to hold out until must reach shore have comforting conviction where there be land there be also safety about hour later found again among breaker be mere trifle compared with have already encountered shortly afterward foot touched bottom abandoning fragment of wreckage to have be clinging crawled up beach to above high water mark flung down upon warm sand instantly fell asleep when awoke sun be shining brilliantly gale have broken although be still blowing strong breeze looked out to seaward at once sighted wreck about two mile away dismasted hard fast upon reef then glancing at surroundings perceived that have landed upon beach of fine white sand backed by country densely wooded with hill stretching away to north south sight of tree suggested possibility of fruit thought of reminded that be hungry be about to make plunge into wood in search of something to eat when heard voice hailing looking in direction from hail have come saw to great satisfaction van ryn fleming about quarter of mile along beach naturally at once joined force being like hungry forthwith proceeded to hunt for food speedily finding abundance of cocoa nut have fallen ripe from tree lined inner edge of beach ate drank fill of fruit milk of nut then having meanwhile discussed plan for future began quest for practicable path inland for idea of camping on beach night after night have few attraction for undergrowth be so dense impenetrable that be not until have traversed quite mile of beach under ray of scorching sun that at length found spot where by cutting hacking monkey rope creeper with knife finally succeeded in working way into valley enclosed between two range of hill running practically parallel word be hot work assure mr blackburn of course there be lack of shade on other hand there be air atmosphere be simply stifling what with labour of hewing way through dense undergrowth much of consisting of bush covered with tough sharp thorn got hold of clothes not infrequently skin refused to let go perspiration poured from like water simply drenched clothes monkey rope creeper thorn heat be not worst of trouble whole place be swarming with mosquito hovered about in cloud bit savagely in hundred place at once a though be not enough there be myriad of small black ant penetrated clothing bit even more savagely than mosquito luckily did not encounter ant until be very nearly through belt of bush must have be compelled to abandon attempt ultimately however effected passage of bush found ourselves fairly in valley with long dry grass waist high plenty of tree big little not much bush creeper then encountered potential trouble of fresh kind for although be no longer attacked by ant too frequently heard rustling in long grass that presently discovered to be caused by snake be compelled to walk very warily lest must perchance unwittingly tread upon one of creature be bitten perhaps fatally a punishment confess well to put plainly did not half like what be to do be searching for cave shelter of sort must serve for lodging place of protection in event of recurrence of bad weather be not likely to find by standing still also be looking for food with view to future question of supply afforded little anxiety for banana plantain tree be abundant in valley to say nothing of grape several other kind of fruit coming to banana tree fruit of be fully ripe made good meal then feeling rather tired trampled down smooth place in grass under shade of big tree stretched thereon be soon fast asleep judging from position of sun in heaven might be about five o'clock in afternoon when be awakened by somebody shaking by shoulder a opened eye heard voice at once recognised a belonging to dirk here who be saying in sort of whisper hush make noise just lift head cautious look ' look where ' returned also in sort of whisper what be to hush for ' look to right at pete be name by usually addressed fleming lying fast asleep there see what will see replied dirk turned head very cautiously looked there within le than fathom of be pete fleming lying flat on back fast asleep with snake coiled up like cable right in middle of chest snake head be resting upon top flake of coil with cold cruel eye gazing straight at long black forked tongue flickering in out of mouth in most suggestively threatening manner what be best thing to do ' murmured dirk in low tone must do something quickly for if pete awakes stir a much a eyelid beggar will bite then will be up with poor pete ' there be small branch with few twig bunch of leaf on end of lying on ground within reach of right hand contrived to get hold of without disturbing snake then sitting up suddenly thrust bunch of leaf on end of branch straight hard at reptile vanished be only way in can convey idea of rapidity with retreated next instant pete be sitting up rubbing sleep out of eye demanding with many choice forecastle embellishment what meant by fool trick when explained to danger that have so narrowly escaped have grace to thank for intervention agreed that spot have longer charm for that be high time for to resume search for place where might pas night in safety place be by mean easy to find ultimately within few minute of sunset came upon sort of shelter among rock of at once took possession for need be by time urgent total darkness being due in about ten minute pete be strongly of opinion that wherever shelter might be ought to light fire in front of to scare away wild beast possessing burning glass took precaution to make fire with before sun sank too low to kindle torch with for purpose of lighting fire so having at length found shelter forthwith proceeded to gather material light protective fire dispose of ourselves for night having found refuge of sort anticipated good night rest sooner have darkness closed down upon than from quarter there arose chorus of most terrifying sound roar bark bellowing savage growl grunt shriek never in life before have heard anything like pandemonium raged around heard branch of tree being broken great stone came rattling crashing down steep hill side behind missing shelter by only what seemed series of miracle there be heavy thud accompanied by blood curdling snarl suggested progress of life death fight between ferocious beast at frequent interval caught through smoke of fire glimpse of great eye glaring at such be first experience of night life in wild at length however toward morning racket gradually quieted down snatched short spell of sleep until sunrise when turned out proceeded to hunt for breakfast luck be with morning for have not gone far when found partly eaten carcass of fine fat deer creature have not be dead very long for blood about be scarcely dry meat be quite fresh be hungry not too squeamish so got to work upon deer cut fine steak off part of have not be touched by thing have killed carrying meat back to shelter made up fire cooked fine breakfast finishing off with fruit a substitute for water that failed to find while partaking of breakfast discussed future a castaway with experience of past night fresh in mind fleming proposed return to beach construction of raft upon suggested must paddle off to wreck with view of giving overhaul in hope of finding something must repay for trouble when came to consideration of detail dirk came to conclusion that with nothing sheath knife to serve a tool scheme be impracticable what might have attempted have known that billy be alive still aboard be perhaps matter several other scheme of equally impracticable character be suggested only to be abandoned after discussion until finally failing more satisfactory plan decided that if must find nice comfortable cave to serve a dwelling must experiment bit upon robinson crusoe line see how liked found several cave of one sort day most suitable of be already tenanted a must tell immediately that put nose inside moreover many of tenant happened to be at home when called seemed to resent presence upon doorstep therefore to avoid unpleasantness retired in many case rather precipitately ultimately however came upon cave for inexplicable reason be untenanted seemed to be everything must reasonably be desired be situated high up on side of hill entrance be so small that be obliged to bend almost double in order to pas through once past entrance cave widened out until interior be a spacious a of dozen forecastle knocked into one with head room of ten twelve foot have beautiful dry soft sandy floor best of there be pool of deliciously cool sweet water at far end of first fresh water that have found air be a clean sweet a water zoological garden odour taint of rotting bone understand took possession at once vividly remembering experience of night before first business be to go out again collect enough dry stuff to make fire at entrance to last night next cut sufficient quantity of long dry grass to provide of with comfortable bed completed arrangement by cutting conveying to cave bunch of banana big enough to furnish with supper night breakfast next morning then having supped built lighted fire turned in slept soundly night notwithstanding even in sleep be conscious of repetition of weird sound of previous night suppose will scarcely be anxious to hear full detail of adventure befell during sojourn in valley indeed if did be afraid must not relate with much pretence to accuracy adventure enough to spare there be of one sort seem to have got mixed up together so that be unable to say just exactly when one in particular happened wild beast did not very seriously trouble interfere with during day time snake more than compensated for constituted perfect terror grew so fearful of at last especially after boot gave out that scarcely dared to put one foot before other indeed be snake finally drove out of valley chapter sixteen svorenssen relates interesting story be while be seeking fruit that thing happened have crossed valley plunged into forest on other side dirk being together while pete be few yard away when suddenly a be passing under bough of big tree heard kind of plop at same instant dirk gave yell very nearly scared stiff glancing round to ascertain cause of disturbance be horrified to see dirk enveloped in coil of enormous snake whose ugly head be poised within few inch of shipmate face creature forked tongue flickering in out of widely opened jaw suppose will never be able to explain account for impulse actuated at horrid sight fact remains that without pausing instant to reflect thrust forward left hand gripped snake just behind head while with right drew sheath knife across reptile throat pretty nearly severing head from body at one stroke instantly became case of stand clear ' snake uncoiled from about dirk body proceeded to fling about on ground with such terrific violence that air round about be presently full of bit of grass broken twig flying leaf while dirk yelling like madman flung upon writhing body of reptile stabbing furiously here there with knife never touching snake so far a must see while pete came running up to ascertain what be matter got dirk away from snake eventually helped back to cave when got there stripped to learn extent of injury to great relief found that there be very little matter with be much bruised about body from waist to shoulder be be however enough agreed that robinson crusoeing ' be not quite that in boyhood day have believed to be resolved to return to beach on following morning endeavour to swim off to wreck when started to work way back to beach discovered to annoyance that path have cut for through scrub have become completely overgrown again consequently have former work to do over again with ant mosquito even more pertinacious in attention than before thus afternoon be well advanced when at length once more caught glimpse of blue water by time be so utterly fagged that felt must be folly to attempt long swim under such condition therefore postponed attempt until next day saw that wreck be still on reef apparently in worse condition than when have last viewed with experience of life ashore still fresh in memory told other what fool have be in making attempt to get off to again a soon a weather have settled after first landing pete fleming be far away keenest of little party to get aboard again directed to observe how high be standing out of water expressed opinion that for reason might be possible for to penetrate to lazarette where must doubtless find quantity of tinned stuff must be infinitely more palatable than fruit diet upon have so long be subsisting of be now thoroughly tired be particularly eloquent upon subject of drink of seemed confident that must find considerable quantity so keen indeed be that be stripped in water four five minute before dirk be already swimming when two started to wade in then dreadful thing happened be little more than ankle deep when heard utter awful shriek saw throw up hand disappear in midst of violent swirl of water in instant terrible truth burst upon that poor chap have be seized by shark existence of in lagoon have never suspected on instant dirk moved by same impulse turned fled back to beach incident effectually cured of further desire to reach wreck never again ventured to attempt swimming until few day ago dirk camped on beach again that night building fire round camping place a protection against wild beast time during night happened to awake to discover that fire have burned perilously low that seven eight great brute be hungrily prowling round eye gleaming like green lamp apparently waiting only until fire have burned little lower courage have grown sufficiently to enable to leap in seize sprang up awaking dirk together heaped fresh brushwood upon smouldering ash until flame leaped up again then visitor left narrow escape brought home to realisation of extreme danger of sleeping in exposed situation after breakfast on following morning set out to return to cave in valley how long remained there on occasion can not tell for soon lost count of time must have be several month certainly for time lived exclusively upon fruit later on contrived to secure morsel of meat now then upon one occasion be afraid will not believe assure be true found young deer tangled up in biggest toughest spider web ever saw of course killed ate little creature that spider web suggested to idea of setting trap made of monkey rope in sometimes caught small game of one sort must probably have be living in cave to day for bad scare in case must never have known that billy have survived wreck must have made attempt to join so perhaps be just a well for of that have that scare be by mean certain that fully agreed with svorenssen view of matter said nothing man continued story there be something very curious uncanny about scare though just exactly what be nature of can not tell for never found explanation of mystery be long time before observed anything in least degree strange connected with surroundings at first not only when pete be with later when dirk returned alone slept soundly night night eventually there arrived time when when now how be to say so that will understand ve have disturbin ' dream prompted van ryn yes agreed svorenssen be have disturbing dream at least sometimes thought be dream while at other time be convinced that be real curious circumstance in connection with be that experience began for of on same night be practice to build big fire in front of cave night to prevent entrance of wild beast while slept on night about be now going to speak did a usual be never long in dropping off to sleep after have composed ourselves to rest for night particular night be exception to rule know how long have be asleep must not have be long for fire outside be still burning brightly interior of cave be brilliantly illuminated by when suddenly started up broad awake with hair on end sweat of terror literally streaming from pore for be feeling more thoroughly scared than have ever before be be trembling like leaf teeth be chattering although at moment have not slightest notion what be that have frightened then heard dirk muttering to looking round saw that too be sitting up looking a terrified a felt wha what be mate ' stammered what be happened ' be exactly what want to know ' said how come to be awake ' hush ' whispered dirk in trembling voice listen held up hand for silence listened believe not a please be solemn truth be telling that cave be full of queer little mysterious noise like people whispering soft tread of foot about looked dirk looked must see nothing yet sound continued now seeming to come from back of cave then about believe must have be far le terrified if must have seen anything to account for sound there be nothing panic seized sprang to foot rushed shrieking out of cave dashing headlong right through fire coming terrible cropper on rough sloping ground in front of cave in falling must have stunned for remember nothing more of what happened night consider most extraordinary part of whole adventure when awoke next morning found back in cave again lying upon grass bed with dirk close alongside ah commented quite queer dream what have van ryn to say about suppose mentioned to said dot va dream for shoost vot happened to svorenssen same thing happened to answered van ryn speaking for well of course be very remarkable agreed still must have be only dream since found yourselves understand in cave on own bed in morning yah dot va so assented van ryn vhen ve come to overhaul ourselfs ve found dot hand face va badly skinned by fall outside dot cave und hair beard a vell a clothes va singed vhere ve have shoomped through fire indeed said be certainly remarkable if be quite sure did not imagine very peculiar happening if mean about skinned hand face singed hair clothes there be imagination about asserted svorenssen about other well when came to talk about in broad daylight be unable to decide whether have actually heard sound whether have dreamed see be not a though thing happened once only happened several night running at length got upon nerve to extent that must endure no longer so agreed to return to beach work way along shore on look out for break in reef abreast of proposed to camp in hope that sooner later ship might come along enter lagoon take off most sensible plan said only thing be surprised at be to couple of sailor men like yourselves idea did not come much earlier ay agreed svorenssen be pity that did not have done so must no doubt have discovered that be still alive much earlier than did found mean to signal to doubt said well what happened to after left cave second time first thing replied svorenssen be that have misfortune to lose pete burning glass left without mean to light fire be terrible loss for left defenceless against attack of wild beast at night so that dared not camp anywhere in open dirk remembered having heard that native of certain country made fire by rubbing two piece of wood together tried same plan over over again indeed spent better part of several day trying to get fire in way without success must not even raise whiff of smoke be about worst misfortune happened to for without fire to protect at night to cook food during day be continually in difficulty be not long before discovered method of cooking after fashion without fire of course will understand that only cooking have to do be when be able to obtain morsel of meat be by mean day when succeeded used to look about for rock have be exposed to sun ray for several hour when have succeeded in search cut meat into thin slice laid upon rock be hot enough to so far broil meat a to render quite eatable dared not camp out at night even on open beach beast be certain to discover somehow came prowling round giving not minute peace many narrow escape have from thus be compelled to get what sleep must during day time keeping watch watch while at night did such travelling a be possible be not much for more often than not be driven to take refuge in tree to retreat into water sitting in up to neck with shark cruising round within few fathom of occasionally making dash into willow water running aground in effort to reach ah be lively time mistake often enough used to tell other that life be not worth living yet spared pain to preserve then a though have not already enough trouble dirk must need fall sick of fever of sort became violently delirious for three night four day must hing with be simply stark staring mad must not permit to approach threatened with knife whenever saw only thing must do be to keep just in sight pretty dance led following into wood over place excepting into water luckily for have sense enough to keep clear of shark must assuredly have have of course that sort of thing must not long continue toward evening of fourth day poor chap collapsed a luck must have found comparatively safe refuge for among rock where looked after attended to until be well enough to be up about again fatigue anxiety loss of rest told upon so severely that sooner be dirk able to look after than fell ill then be turn to look after for about fortnight then one day when be beginning to pull round bit dirk who have be out foraging for food returned to refuge in great state of excitement with intelligence that have just seen sailing boat alongside wreck statement greatly alarmed for of course did not believe word of fear be that chum be suffering relapse be again experiencing delusion when suggested idea to indignantly scouted idea repeating statement bidding crawl to opening of shelter see for if did not believe took advice be of course obvious thing to do there to amazement be boat unmistakably enough with mast stepped rigging set up sail stowed what be more after looking intently for several minute have impression caught glimpse of one two people moving about aboard wreck watched day next next moment expecting to see boat leave wreck time be trying desperately hard to make fire thus create smoke so whoever be aboard wreck must see come across to ascertain what meant try a must be unable to manage then one day dirk went out to look at trap have set in wood upon return reported that boat have left wreck be heading along lagoon in northerly direction that there be two people in man boy so naturally concluded that must be billy that have somehow escaped drowning after then said to van ryn if saw a distinctly a why did not show on beach wave to attract attention did replied dutchman d think be fool a to miss chance va not look vay not of und though shout yell und run along beach take notice sail on until at last sail out of sight be very strange said for whenever be cruising in lagoon always kept eye on shore then moost 'ave be lookin out abeam ahead not astarn vhere 'appened to be declared van ryn possibly agreed for saw that man be in aggressively disputatious humour wanted to have word with well what happened after go on with yarn svorenssen saw three four time after resumed svorenssen once passed so close that easily recognised of unfortunately be up tree at time be unable to descend for reason that there be savage brute of wild pig have driven up aloft be waiting below for to come down again of course shouted loudest a long a there seemed possibility that might hear be good suspect be roar of surf on reef drowned voice time saw if be not going alongside wreck be steering north so at length came to conclusion that have probably rigged up sort of shelter in direction accordingly agreed to work along shore in northerly direction try to find out where have bestowed yourselves to sailing along easily comfortably in boat dare say must seem very arduous job to work way along few mile of open beach to two circumstanced a be in place swarming with savage brute seemed to be for ever lurking on watch for without mean of kindling fire a protection with only sheath knife a weapon obliged to enter wood at peril of life to obtain food a often a not driven out again without food able to sleep only during day time very often not even then compelled to seek shelter in tree for hour at time ay often enough for whole day to save life be simply well there be word strong enough to describe why there be day plenty of when did not make so much a mile of progress when from one cause did not make fathom much le mile wonder that be so long time working way round to indeed now that look back upon innumerable difficulty that have to contend with only surprise be that ever managed to get here at then a appropriate climax of difficulty forest one day caught fire perhaps saw blaze almost whole of island be swept clean of green thing phew be experience with vengeance if have not beheld scene with own eye must never have believed there be so many wild creature in world a then saw great fierce monkey bigger than man little monkey in thousand leopard wild pig a savage a lion deer of sort size creature like of have never seen heard of before came swarming down to beach to escape flame very curious circumstance thought be so thoroughly terrified that none of interfered with others with stood huddled together by water edge bleating squealing roaring howling can not attempt to describe be kind of thing have to be seen to be understood naturally edged away a far a must from flame flying spark eventually began to dawn upon beast a well a men that extreme north end of island might possibly be spared with one accord set off in direction for little while twenty four hour thereabout men did very well creature stood huddled together trembling making queer moaning noise too terrified to take notice of anybody anything when needed food be necessary be to lay hold of deer haul out of crowd cut throat there be food required condition of affair be of course quite temporary sooner have fire burned out than creature recovered courage turned upon other like well like wild beast dirk quickly recognised that north end of island be too perilous place for there be therefore nothing for to escape from dangerous neighbour while must must only be done by bearing away south again did there be cause for further fear of wild beast a pursued journey southward there be not living thing to be seen anywhere ashore even bird have vanished that condition of affair be of course in favour so far a went unfortunate part of be that fruit be also destroyed so that while must now rest undisturbed at night only food consisted of such raw shell fish a must find at margin of beach must find fresh water wherewith to quench thirst for two day night be in predicament thirst being terrible only relief must obtain be very partial be to enter sea lie down in for about ten minute allowing ripple to wash over taking care not to go far enough in to give shark chance to get at then when felt sufficiently relieved staggered along for few yard repeating process about thirty forty time day at length however found stream of fresh water camped beside so terrible have be suffering from thirst that having at length found fresh water must not summon courage to leave again one day however a be seeking shell fish on beach near mouth of stream dirk suddenly remarked olaf son just run eye along ridge of hill yonder tell what see ' did so presently saw what have attracted attention there be little patch of green looked a though might be tree while below be black where fire have be certainly look very like clump of tree said where there be tree there will also probably be fruit let take walk up there investigate ' what about leaving fresh water asked dirk need to do ' said stream come down from direction can probably follow for good part of way surely be worth while to risk ' so started following course of stream until have arrived very near to destination when be reached found to be nice little patch of forest rising to top of hill dipping down on other side of for distance of about two mile reason why have not be burnt with rest be because stood on lee side of lake big enough to cut off flame from little patch there be plenty of bird there when proceeded to investigate soon found that there be animal also small monkey creature very like hare with short ear few deer nothing dangerous so far a must discover there be abundance of fruit of several kind also therefore quickly determined to settle down there rest bit before going farther there be great patch of reed along western end of lake here thousand of wild duck used to settle night soon found that be easy matter to get few by simply waiting for among reed catching a swam past built hut of wattle thatched with palm leaf kept dry comfortable when rained so happy easy in mind be that almost forgot existence when happened to remember used to say to other never mind be bit a comfortable a be will stop on here bit longer so did deferring departure day after day week after week until finally duck grew shy of other creature seemed to recognise trap avoid so that at length time came when be pretty hard put to to make living then too began to feel lonesome to get snappy short tempered with other to dream think talk about home comfort until grew thoroughly dissatisfied with life be living one day after have have one of now frequent quarrel said to dirk look here mate appear to have quite forgotten other two do think that man of brain like mr blackburn be going to settle down be satisfied to pas remainder of life among group of desert island like because if do just consider fact there be boy may safely bet that else may have done left undone will have taken care to save treasure that found aboard old galleon what good will do so long a remain here no good at therefore think may take for granted that will set wit to work to get away from here by hook by crook taking treasure with then where do come in what becomes of share of let cut adrift from spot anyhow be of further use to join when go will go with take share of treasure dirk quite saw force of reasoning eagerly agreed to proposal so made start there then here be chapter seventeen be trouble brewing exactly concurred here be how did know where billy have located ourselves how did contrive to make way here from southern end of west island west island be that name of place oh managed pretty well returned svorenssen from ridge of hill where forest be burned away be able to get very fair idea of geography of group in general counted six island in addition to one be already on observed that one to eastward of be like own fire swept also at one point be separated from island by channel only about mile wide to northward of island saw with small group of tree dotted about here there upon while remainder of surface appeared to be covered with corn field something similar so be not to be wondered at if jumped to conclusion that must find established there so made start by heading for narrowest part of channel between own island next one carrying with a much fruit a must handle for knew not when where must find more upon reaching channel question confronted be how be going to get across must see one way be to swim what about shark have already lost one of number through have desire that similar fate must befall of therefore camped alongside that channel two day while one of foraged for food other just sat intently watched water when evening of second day arrived without disclosing sign of shark in channel agreed to risk passage so stripped off clothes what remained of made into bundle secured upon head waded in got across safely be lucky enough to land just where little stream of fresh water came down from hill rose in middle of island camped alongside stream night made supper of melon ground nut have grown since passage of fire over land on following day proceeded inland following course of stream heading toward top of hill from hoped to obtain little further knowledge of geography of group also might be more definite information a to own whereabouts be successful in particular for while be on top of hill saw sailing boat coming round eastern end of island across channel northward of watching saw land on island stay there while then sail away again in north easterly direction upon seeing dirk came to conclusion that proper thing for to do must be to descend to beach there await next appearance when must signal have already detected little stream flowing down hill side discharging into channel quite near spot where decided to await reappearance so followed down to water edge where camped then that same evening boat again hove in sight saw land party of nigger just opposite where be watching having done again made sail to northward eastward led to conclusion that after have not settled upon cultivated island a have at first supposed somewhere else of course showed upon beach hailed channel be too wide for voice to carry across probably never looked in direction so failed to attract attention knew now that be still on group that be on track so did not trouble overmuch then before boat have passed out of sight while be still watching saw nigger paddling across channel from island have touched at to one that be upon be heading to land at spot rather more than mile to eastward of where be so got back into young growth have sprung up after fire pushed along toward spot for be making arrived few minute before did crouching down saw haul up tub of canoe on beach make way inland allowed to get well away from beach then crept down to canoe launched proceeded to paddle in track of boat fell dark almost before have got fairly under way there be fine moon so did not greatly matter paddled down channel across to point round have recently vanished good eight mile reckoned to be hot work be for two men who have be on short common for more than month forgot about when upon rounding point saw at distance of not more than five six mile light knew that now must not be very far away while be in possession of mean to reach be tough job to get little tub of nigger along when once have rounded point for at once felt full strength of easterly breeze popple raised be together just a much a must barely stem must have taken hour to get across five six mile of water long before landed have put light out turned in there be house plain enough to be seen in bright moonlight so headed straight for landed at last on beach just below what became of punt that stole from unfortunate native demanded why reckon be still there on beach where left be reply still there exclaimed why yes suppose be must be looked to at once billy take man van ryn with get to show where left punt then will paddle round to cove here make fast astern of sailing boat then get sailing boat under way van ryn will point out to spot on ape island from svorenssen took nod misder don 'd think id suddenly stormed dutchman be nod schibber now don 'd dake order from anybody else ve be equal now be said slipping hand into jacket pocket be where be making big mistake man mean to be just a much skipper here a be aboard yorkshire lass if men wish to share in comfort of life that be able to give to go home with when go will have to submit to discipline obey order ah ve will see about dot interrupted van ryn springing to foot olaf mine zon haf ve comed dis vay from over yonder to be ordered about mit dis man let show 'im dot ve mean to do a ve like here come on whipping out remains of sheath knife gathered together for spring upon with one eye on svorenssen meanwhile in full expectation that latter must back up be fully prepared there have be from moment when first encountered two men early that morning certain truculence of speech demeanour warned against trusting too implicitly have be on guard with day so now a dutchman sprang to foot sprang to mine leaping back from out of arm reach whipped out revolver have be carrying day in jacket pocket shouted hand up of so much a think of trying conclusion with for if of advance single step shoot to kill remember reputation two men especially van ryn earned for yourselves aboard brigantine be perpetually instigating trouble for moment imagine that will be permitted to make trouble here for simply wo have at first hint of anything of sort will hand over to friend native of yonder island ask to take charge of indeed believe must only be act of ordinary prudence to turn over to at once mister interposed svorenssen hurriedly think of there ai goin ' to be trouble assure ye take notice o ' what dirk say mister 'be bark always lot worse bite mean half quarter of what ' e say sit down thunderin ' fool put away knife of yours continued turning suddenly upon dutchman forcing back on packing case upon have be sitting seating beside then leaned over companion began whispering hurriedly excitedly in ear stop svorenssen exclaimed if have advice to give man speak aloud so may hear if be good advice there be need to whisper right mister returned finn be only tellin ' not to make bloomin fool of hisself now come on dirk let do what mr blackburn order what ' e say be right be skipper still may well recernise first a last know a well a do that ca hin ' without come along billy thereupon two men rose to foot proceeded to slouch along shore in direction of spot where have left punt on second thought said go two men bring punt round here to cove billy will come out in sailing boat to meet svorenssen waved hand to indicate that understood two men continued on way finn observed talking very earnestly to companion a soon a be out of sight billy walked down to boat boarded got under way worked round to south beach off fell in with took punt in breeze be blowing moderately fresh enabled to make trip to ape island in trifle over two hour at end of found unfortunate native squatted on haunch anxiously awaiting deliverance from former haunt of enemy where perceived young vegetation be already flourishing vigorously at once took man aboard where during passage across to cliff island explained to a best must episode of stolen punt to amazement of two seaman who seemed to regard a wonderful fact that in course of year have acquired fairly fluent command of native language observed with satisfaction that when bowata considerable company of native came down to beach to greet upon seeing boat heading for landing place two seaman looked more than trifle uneasy fearing perhaps must seize opportunity to fulfil threat to hand over to charge of black be not sorry to let see thus early what powerful force of auxiliary have behind must be meditating anything in nature of undue assertion of independence designedly directed particular attention of bowata follower to new companion explaining who what be of course shellbacks understood nothing of what be saying made little attempt to conceal relief when at length bade farewell to black made sail again upon return to eden on following morning resumed work upon cutter thought that van ryn svorenssen looked somewhat disconcerted when in accordance with arrangement with party of ten sturdy native arrived at shipyard about be in chinese boat have given to lend hand a when required two seaman turned to without demur soon have reason to congratulate upon acquisition of for while svorenssen revealed almost professional skill in use of carpenter tool dutchman explained that if must cut out cutter sail must undertake to make to entire satisfaction men did much more far better work than in least anticipated when at length knocked off work for day surveyed result of one day work felt that might now at last begin to calculate with approach to accuracy date at labour might be expected to come to successful conclusion two day later van ryn who be working at new sail under shade of tree at distance from shipyard requested that if possible must spare billy to assist a request seemed reasonable acceded to without demur thereafter matter went so smoothly for fortnight more that in satisfaction at progress be making almost forgot suspicion attitude utterance of two seaman have aroused when so unexpectedly reappeared upon scene with assistance work upon cutter have progressed so speedily that planking of be completed laying of deck about half done mast bowsprit finished mainsail gaff topsail sewn in process of roping therefore estimated that month must see ambitious project complete possibly ourselves at sea complacency be somewhat disturbed when on certain evening be instructing billy in problem of reduction of sun altitude to meridian have concluded explanation of problem when boy glancing up at with smile remarked that chap van ryn be awfully inquisitive mr blackburn be chaffing to day upon difference in manner of speaking now from what be when first knew said yes have to thank for for have insisted must study improve education evening since have be cast away then wanted to know about what have taught how much knew told that have be teaching arithmetic geometry algebra trigonometry geography navigation that last word surprised can tell be amusing to see how interested at once became wanted to know just how much knew about navigation must hardly believe when told that knew enough to enable to determine ship position day night provided that sky be clear must get sight of certain heavenly body when insisted must do have said seemed end pleased ah ' said must tell svorenssen what say will be glad to hear be only few night ago that be talking about time when must leave island saying what fix must be in if mr blackburn must meet with accident fall ill while be at sea so really believe billy that if thing must happen must navigate cutter said be quite sure must then conversation dropped kept harking back to time after time showing that be still thinking about yes said can quite believe can understand too amazement at assurance that mere boy must if put to navigate cutter other craft for matter there be probably not one boy in ten thousand of age billy who must truthfully claim such ability two circumstance have be in favour in first place be naturally sharp intelligent lad with strong predilection for study in next place there be little else for to do on group learn until started to build cutter now billy what have told relative to van ryn inquisitiveness cross questioning of have greatly interested for reason will explain later on therefore while be not a rule inquisitive will ask to make point of reporting to substance of further conversation man may hold with to take very particular notice of question may ask now let return to consideration of nautical problem at moment seemed strange that billy story must so powerfully have affected fact remains that did after have turned in night lay restlessly tossing upon bed wondering wondering whether van ryn questioning of billy be natural result of pure unadulterated inquisitiveness whether have deeper significance conversation appeared to have arisen naturally enough must not detect in relation of indication of deliberate attempt on part of man to lead up to subject of billy educational acquirement what reason indeed must have for doing so apart from lad more refined mode of speech matter that most powerfully exercised be dutchman eager curiosity to discover full extent of billy qualification a navigator yet even a to there seemed little enough reason for uneasiness man have given quite plausible reason for such curiosity reason must perfectly understand appreciate wondered whether be true actual reason be there more sinister one at back of evil mind in case what wondered must have put thought in dutchman head that something might possibly happen to while be at sea certainly experience have already befallen once since commencement of voyage with men of such limited intelligence a of van ryn svorenssen even such experience a usually make so very transitory impression that soon fade moreover difficulty have be surmounted must naturally believe must again arise must again be surmounted in same way only reason must think of why such idea must have taken so strong hold upon dutchman mind be that under certain circumstance eventuality of have spoken might be very much more than possible might be inevitable reasoning thus next asked question must anything happen to must for instance die aboard cutter before leaving island how must death affect fortune of two men svorenssen van ryn to say nothing of of billy why must be desired to get rid of be not difficult question to answer in of above hypothetical case boy must be absolutely in power at mercy of two men shuddered to think of what must happen to with out of way svorenssen van ryn be big powerful men must resort to violence what must boy do by way of resisting then cutter be now so far advanced that at pinch two seaman must complete launch make ready for sea without assistance escape from group be therefore in case assured while so far a navigation of craft be concerned have already wormed out of billy information that be competent to undertake if two seaman be actually conspiring against a now began to think be at least probable primary object must doubtless be to secure whole of treasure for doubtless recognised that so long a man a powerful a of with mind already tinctured with suspicion of lived to attempt to secure more than fair share of treasure might be difficult dangerous possibly even result in failure with effectually disposed of enterprise must wear totally different aspect must complete cutter sail away in with treasure on board billy a navigator willing unwilling upon arriving within sight of destination must murder poor boy rest must be easy so must probably believe yes knowing men so well a did felt that there be ground for suspicion of resolved that without appearing to do so must henceforth keep wary eye upon be constantly day night on guard against act of treachery on part now be not often that billy did anything foolish boy will always be boy to end of time expect about week after lad conversation with on subject of van ryn inquisitiveness spirit of mischief suddenly seized just for lark a subsequently admitted to must need leave dutchman upon pretence run up to house then pay visit at shipyard bringing kit with on leash that might enjoy consternation of native at sight of leopard be fortunate that spotted pair when did for beast be already beyond billy control dragging lad helplessly after with evident determination to interview stranger more closely animal although not yet fully grown have developed into magnificent specimen of kind a big a mastiff about twice a powerful to hold when hurriedly relieved billy of charge taxed strength to extent be obliged to shout to worker to quit work get into hiding at safe distance even so scent of men excited kit to extent that be only with utmost difficulty be able to drag back to bungalow safely lash up be therefore not very greatly surprised when after work be over evening svorenssen approached said see here mister did ye happen to salve arm chest from wreck before washed off reef foundered yes said what about why just blustered dirk want brace of revolver cartridge cutlash apiece out of chest be what about really said very modest request very modestly put be permissible to ask why want thing in what way purpose to use oh yes cert'nly be reply there be objection to astin ' a many question a bloomin ' well like want to purtect again ' that snarlin ' savage leopard o ' yours ai safe to be on same hisland with brute will not interfere with molest in way if give wide berth retorted a to giving weapon demand wo do so be flat wo eh returned finn glowering at savagely then can say mister be that dirk will have to see what can be done about purtectin ourselves for one ai goin ' to take risk of bein ' tore to piece not for day so give warnin ' now see here svorenssen said can make allowance do for very natural fear of leopard a have already told animal will not hurt either of men if keep clear of let hear more of such talk a have be indulging in during last few minute forget man seem to forget also that came to island of own free will did not invite did not even want be doing quite well without assistance a can again if necessary so let have more threat of sort will be compelled for peace quietness ' sake to request friend bowata people to take charge of be not first time that have obliged to say will not again repeat let there be more bickering between cutter be very nearly completed please god will soon be at sea in on way back to civilisation home man stared at for several second with thought murder in eye then turned away remarking right mister be top dog now what say go affected not to catch that final word proceeded to indicate to native several job upon wished to employ on morrow what wondered be explanation of fresh outburst of turbulence on svorenssen part for fresh be only once before have displayed such insolence of manner to wondered whether perchance have connection with suspicion have be bred in mind by billy report of dutchman recent conversation with argued suspicion might be wholly unfounded be result of certain unsuspected mental disorder brought about by long series of unusual experience through have passed beginning with destruction of saturn in case whether suspicion be well founded otherwise there must be disputing fact that two seaman be turbulent unruly violent character liable at moment to become dangerous therefore must be carefully watched a for voluntarily furnishing with weapon so rendering ten time more dangerous than already be if svorenssen really imagined must do thing must surely have set down for fool from time forward without appearing to do so maintained close watch upon men noting weighing word endeavouring to deduce from general conduct especially from demeanour toward whether not be really hatching plot against for rather more than week be unable to detect anything to justify least apprehension on part of course be impossible for to observe pair when be alone together after day work be done although svorenssen maintained usual surly demeanour attached little importance to for believed to be natural to while there be doubt that men be working steadily well chapter eighteen tragic end to trouble on certain evening eight ten day after outburst on part of finn in connection with demand for weapon billy remarked to apropos of nothing in particular a sat together studying a usual that dutchman be queer chap mistake mr blackburn will sit for hour saying never word billy pas that ' billy take hold of then of sudden will begin to chatter like parrot really said what doe chatter about sort of thing answered billy chiefly about what svorenssen went through before joined here like to hear how managed too before settled down on eden do know be beginning to think be not such bad sort of chap after seems to admire immensely doe indeed commented dryly in what particular way doe reveal admiration well said billy think be perfectly wonderful way wonderfully clever a navigator know clever to have be able to build sailing boat still more clever to have designed very nearly built beautiful craft a cutter most clever of to have built bungalow said that must understand that clever sailor like might be able to build boat must not understand how sailor even must build fine house wanted to know how long took to build how set about whether invented a went on whether drew out on paper beforehand when said that have drawn out before began to build said that 'd dearly like to see drawing because must give wrinkle if must ever again be shipwrecked what did say to asked well said billy see thought be perhaps roundabout way of asking to show plan so said did know where be that rather thought have destroyed when said that poor chap looked so disappointed that showed what be like by sketching out on ground with point of sail needle be very interesting said here be paper pencil just reproduce on a nearly a can sketch made on ground boy took pencil paper in few minute completed rough quite accurate plan of bungalow showing relative position of several room in front rear portion of house observed also that indicated with scrupulous fidelity position of window door showing possibility of passing from one room to other through passage living room sketch doe credit said give excellent idea of general arrangement of house really see how information affords be in least degree likely to be of use to van ryn even must be shipwrecked dozen time over to speak quite frankly must very much rather that have not made that sketch on ground for information do think understood confessed billy believe did for asked sort of silly question about that must have asked if have understood plan ah indeed said do happen to remember of question n o think do replied billy be so awfully stupid that did pay much attention to explained that mark pointing to drawing represented door yet silly as must understand how servant got from room to kitchen how brought meal from kitchen to living room without going outside walking round house must understand how got from room to living room without going outside be too bad said seems to reflect upon power of description doe billy doe rather admitted boy yet did best to make understand did seem able to grasp that be supposed to be looking down upon bungalow with roof off persisted in thinking that be looking square at that room in rear be above in front of house stupid fellow commented be house only thing manifested curiosity about oh answered billy there be lot of other thing asked about wanted to know where got kit from how be that be so tame with so savage with everybody else asked if be afraid that day must turn upon do injury said that if be bos 'd shoot beast right away grumbled bit because must give svorenssen firearm to defend with not only from leopard also from native whom said did trust little bit who might come across night massacre in sleep then wanted to know how be going to get cutter into water when be ready for launching then let see oh yes got on about native again ape said be very well for who must bolt securely in house at night what about svorenssen if ape must come across surprise in tent night how be to defend without weapon of kind laughed at told that there be so little likelihood of anything of sort happening that never closed door window except when rained said that did matter must defend if thing happened because have plenty of arm ought to have too said that what with leopard ape savage life be none too safe for unarmed men like finn did terror seem quite real do think be at exaggerated asked oh asserted billy with conviction be real enough be exaggerated be in regular funk see svorenssen have pretty bad time one way time be on west island be ape frightened worst of yes agreed can quite understand a idea suggested to do think van ryn suspect that repeat conversation of to n o think so answered boy why must believe thought ever enters head did not feel by mean so sure of a billy seemed to be if man suspected that remark questioning be repeated to assumption of extreme stupidity might be explained a designed to disarm suspicion aroused in mind by queer character of of question take relating to arrangement of house for example pretence that information must be valuable to must ever again be cast away be altogether too puerile for consideration required information very cleverly extracted from unsuspecting billy too for entirely different reason what be reason wondered be not long kept wondering second night after above recorded conversation between billy brought with threat of change of weather have be exceptionally hot day with le wind than usual there be languorous quality in atmosphere seemed to portend thunder portent be strengthened toward when wind died away to merest zephyr while great bank of heavy lowering cloud piled up slowly along eastern horizon so that rising full moon have chance to show a evening progressed what little air of wind there be died completely away be left with door window flung wide open gasping for breath sweltering a in turkish bath endured a long a must then tossing aside book be attempting to read announced determination to go down to cove have swim billy declared that must like swim too if must take header off veranda into deep water a to walking down to cove in heat no much a must enjoy dip be prepared to undergo amount of exertion to get a gathering storm seemed unlikely to break suddenly did not unduly hurry over dip remained in water about hour emerging at last delightfully cool quite ready for bed upon return to house found billy still up poring over book confessed to feeling sleepy upon ordered boy off to bed forthwith extinguishing lamp in living room retired to own apartment straightway turned in being quickly lulled to sleep by sound of pouring rain began just a stretched upon bed seemed a though have only just fallen asleep when awoke with startling suddenness rain be pelting down on roof in torrent making quite noise enough to account for sudden awakening through must just hear poor kit whining fidgeting restlessly under veranda outside french window imagining that be combined sound have awakened rose thinking must fetch that animal indoors expect poor beggar be getting pretty wet hence restlessness one of door of room opened into living room while other gave on to veranda of being wide open a passed through latter vivid flash of lightning revealed rain coming straight down in sheet rebounding in glittering spray off already streaming earth with kit straining at leash billy have made fast a usual to one of veranda post beast have withdrawn a far under veranda a leash must permit did not appear to be very wet seemed anxious to enjoy more complete shelter of living room so stepped out cast adrift to amazement instant released from leash tore away from hold upon collar with savage snarl bounded through living room door next instant there issued from interior of room yell of consternation immediately followed by shriek of terror fall of heavy body on floor scream execration dreadful sound of kit worrying somebody something before must draw breath figure of yelling screaming frantic man dashed from room cleared veranda step at bound landed heavily on ground five foot below still screaming disappeared through curtain of pouring rain sound from living room still continued with increasing violence augmented now by cry from billy whose form dimly descried outlined against dark background of open door perception of what have happened be still happening leapt to brain with sudden enlightenment bring light billy quick shouted a sprang through into living room instinctively avoiding table stood in middle of room flung upon struggling group on floor hand at once came into contact with kit hairy hide slid along until closed upon collar round neck when exerting strength dragged beast still savagely snarling resisting off writhing groaning form at foot somehow to day know not how managed to drag fiercely struggling creature out of room back to veranda where securely tied up again then returned to living room a billy entered with lighted lamp took lamp from said light lamp in room boy then lend hand to put man on bed next turned to writhing groaning figure on floor saw that a have already surmised be that of svorenssen be dressed only in shirt trouser of rain sodden drenched with blood be torn to rag by teeth claw of leopard be still raving outside doing utmost to break adrift from mooring man injury especially about throat shoulder arm chest be shocking felt that with limited appliance at command there be very small hope of saving life still grasped in right hand formidable bludgeon similar weapon lay on floor near have only time to take in detail when billy returned between contrived to half carry half drag writhing groaning finn into room deposit on bed then sent billy to native room occupant of have be roused by disturbance bidding set to work providing warm water such other matter a thought might require guided by book of instruction attached to medicine chest did best must for injured man wound be of so ghastly nature suffering so acute that recognised from very outset not only that be impossible must recover death must ensue in very few hour be dreadful to sit there by side listening to moan liberally interspersed with curse of leopard of not infrequently of mankind in general to reflect that flood of blasphemy be issuing from lip of man hovering on brink of eternity at length must endure no longer said to rather sharply be afraid stop blasphemy svorenssen for pity sake rather turn thought to prayer if know how to pray fear that life have be deplorably misspent one can last few hour longer before to morrow sun set will be face to face with god therefore urge to devote few remaining hour at disposal to making peace with instead of cursing who have never knowingly wronged what d 'ye mean gaspingly demanded ai goin ' to die be yes said be be well that must know therefore forget wrong real imaginary here be interrupted by outburst of such vile savage profanity that literally rendered speechless lasted suppose fully ten minute left utterer gasping in state of collapse administered stimulant at length colour came slowly back to sufferer cheek lip opened eye for several minute lay there gazing up at steadfastly questioningly then muttered thank ' e mister if have be for 'd have slipped cable that time so think be goin to die well be beginnin ' to think so now god be awful to think that few hour more will be face to face with maker bein ' called to account for whole lifetime of wickedness there be way out oh there be said eagerly thereupon began to expound with earnestness at command a lucidly a must wonderful story of man redemption got bible read passage after passage suited to dying man need until expression of terror anxiety gradually faded from feature ultimately eye closed seemed to fall asleep then day dawned billy entering softly took place a watcher while snatched brief hour two of sleep on bed be aroused by clatter of crockery in living room where native woman be making ready to serve breakfast for even when shadow of death hovers over house inmate must need eat drink then one of native who day came over to help with work on cutter brought news that sailing boat have disappeared inference being that van ryn have taken nevertheless gave order eden must be thoroughly searched for be never found be boat be end of so far a be concerned for never again heard of when breakfast be ready tiptoed to door of bedroom beckoned billy who crept softly out closing door behind be asleep again now boy whispered be dying in peace want to see mr blackburn before pass away that may repeat to terrible confession that have made to took breakfast in silence for mind be full of thought too deep for utterance when have finished resumed post beside dying man bed svorenssen be still asleep sleep of utter exhaustion be very uneasy moaning occasionally about hour later however awoke after have again given stimulant stammered gasped confession desired to make there be need to repeat here word for word in substance be to effect that van ryn have proposed have agreed that two obtaining entry through back of house must murder in sleep if possible arm from arm chest thereafter impose will upon poor billy cutter be to be completed launched treasure shipped aboard conspirator with billy a forced navigator be to make way to civilised port arrived in sight of billy be to be knocked on head hove overboard exactly a have suspected while two men be to divide treasure equally between be dreadful confession for man to make found bitterly hard to utter word of forgiveness be so piteously pleaded for forced to do so at last shortly after noon of day man happy now believe at peace with maker passed away buried body hour two later with death of one disappearance of other of two men who have come into life only to act a disturbing element from almost first moment of acquaintance with worry anxiety passed away like memory of evil dream upon day following that of svorenssen death turned with renewed zest to completion of cutter hull be by time practically finished deck be laid companion tiny self emptying cockpit completed be now needed be to run low bulwark around rig step completed mast bowsprit bend sail ballast launch get store water treasure aboard up anchor away taken a stand that list of work still remaining to be done look simple enough yet took full month to complete for greater part of be of so technical character that native be of little assistance to have to do most of with own hand also found that van ryn have by mean completed task have undertaken to perform two topsail square header jib header still needed roping a did jib work cost several day labour to complete to satisfaction then there be launching way cradle to be built task taxed ingenuity to utmost limit at length be done except actual launching of boat finishing touch to final preparation be completed too late in afternoon for to do anything more day immediately after breakfast on following morning therefore billy climbed aboard cutter hoisted yorkshire lass ensign to topmast head suspended bottle of wine one of very few that have left from stem head then leaving billy aboard descended to ground removing ladder by have ascended wedging up having already be accomplished next took maul shouting to billy to stand by proceeded to knock away spur shore there be now moment hesitation on part of cutter of took advantage to jump clear then began to move slowly at first with rapidly increasing velocity while dashed bottle of wine against craft cut water named dolphin in accordance with billy earnestly expressed wish two second later craft took water plunging deeply with foam brimming to taffrail then rising buoyantly shot far out toward middle of cove until in obedience to hail billy let go anchor brought up then saw that have underestimated amount of ballast required that needed about ton more slight readjustment of to put in correct trim that however be error must be easily rectified meanwhile be highly gratified by graceful appearance presented now that be afloat next in order came cold collation have caused to be prepared for delectation of bowata petty chief whole of whom have invited over to eden to witness launch billy having be brought ashore in islander boat forthwith fell to hand doing full justice to feast at conclusion formally presented bungalow that be leaving in to bowata with strict injunction to to show utmost kindness to shipwrecked person who might hereafter be so unfortunate a to be cast away on group injunction promised to obey most faithfully then followed mutual farewell to accompaniment of much howling weeping on part of black friend after remainder of day be devoted to completion of ballasting of cutter correct adjustment there be one other duty now to be done before started for home be disposal of kit leopard since night when so fearfully mauled svorenssen nature of beast have undergone material change for worse have developed uncertainty ferocity of temper rendered distinctly unsafe altogether unsuitable a pet for anyone with grief many tear poor billy be obliged to admit that such be case therefore be at length agreed that must be transported to west island where must hurt one where must find ample prey for sustenance accordingly on following morning weighed anchor bade final good bye to pacific eden sailing through east north island channel to west island where without mishap landed kit turned adrift to shift for not by mean without regret for beast have stood in good stead on one memorable occasion then sailing up north west channel entered lagoon heading to northward passed through wide gap in reef abreast of shark bay once more found ourselves riding buoyantly on long swell of open pacific of course have long ago given most careful consideration to question of where must steer for in event of cutter completion after much study of chart at command have decided to shape course for sydney australia meant voyage of two thousand three hundred fifty mile across open ocean in ten ton cutter felt sure dolphin must do especially a must have south east trade wind prospect of reasonably fine weather with nearly way accordingly a soon a be fairly clear of reef bore up headed away to southward along west side of group of finally lost sight about hour before sunset to say that voyage be unadventurous must be untrue on contrary have many thrilling adventure several hair breadth escape from destruction lack of space forbids more than bare mention of here let suffice to say that after voyage packed with sufficiently exciting incident arrived safely in sydney harbour on twenty third day after departure from group arrived there first business be to negotiate with firm of banker for exchange of of gold coinage formed part of treasure for sufficient number of british sovereign to carry of comfortably home done set about providing with outfit suitable for voyage be of course impossible for to keep adventure entirely secret hint of somehow got abroad possibly from people in hotel at put up enterprising reporter of sydney paper did rest one result of be that soon got from local yachtsman so advantageous offer for dolphin unhesitatingly accepted spent very pleasant fortnight in sydney many of leading citizen vying with other to show finally on certain day in month of april embarked for england in orient liner after most delightful voyage landed in london on glorious day in month of may
