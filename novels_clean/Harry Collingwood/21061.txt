january dropped anchor in valparaiso harbour long dreary voyage be at end at last douglas terry obeeara have long before completed plan for early escape two lad be now standing just by break of poop looking across blue water towards fair city aptly named valley of paradise be not first time that boy have be there knew place fairly well morning seemed to notice indefinable change in appearance of city tried to discover in what consisted presently douglas started up with remark know what be terry old boy there be tremendous excitement other ashore there if will take squint through glass will see that shop be shut that good many of street be barricaded up there at back of town there be body of chilian soldier busily throwing up earthwork constructing fort of kind take word for lad there be

though something more serious than mere revolution be in progress douglas exclamation of astonishment have be drawn from by sight of squadron of warship have just put in appearance round point be slowly steaming in column of line ahead be evidently making way toward warship anchorage in road there be five of altogether two large three small ship flying chilian ensign by mean of glass lad made out that first two craft be almirante cochrane blanco encalada battleship then came corvette o'higgins chacabuco lastly sloop esmeralda presently slowed up anchored a did so there came sound of tumultuous cheering from city to ship replied by dipping ensign a say jim be revolution answered terry war have probably broken out between chili other country wonder peru expect seems to lad that

wait perhaps several month for be indeed in luck way only question be how be to get ashore for suppose old man will grant leave under circumstance will try first however if refuse will have to think of other mean of getting away from ship let go to cabin talk matter over be business have better decide a soon a possible slipped arm through douglas pair went off to latter cabin where spent whole afternoon in making plan with result by evening have perfected arrangement applied to captain for leave in usual way a have anticipated be refused so have to look about for mean of getting away from ship without being observed managed very simply thus next morning boat laden with fruit came out to pericles in hope that crew must purchase a ship have be ordered by authority to remain at mooring until further notice in consequence of wharfage being required for military purpose jim terry thereupon got into conversation with man in charge of boat made arrangement with to come off same night in small skiff take ashore required time money to induce fellow to fall in with scheme at last consented proved a good a word for at nine o'clock evening quietly dropped alongside gave pre arranged signal few minute later both young men with belonging be being pulled ashore to seek fortune in new land under flag little knew when stepped ashore at custom house quay what adventure be in store for what trial must be called upon to undergo what peril must pas through even if must have foreseen be very doubtful whether must have hesitated paid man chartering conveyance drove away to nearest hotel

chilian although two lad went to bed early intending to get good night rest so that might be up doing betimes next morning soon found that sleep be well nigh out of question by reason of uproar never ceased whole night through mercurial chilians be wrought up to pitch of highest excitement enthusiasm band of persisted in marching through street shouting viva at top of voice singing war song appeared that inhabitant of valparaiso have be dreading attack on city by peruvian fleet although war have not a yet be actually declared activity terry jim have observed on height behind city be due to fact that soldier citizen have be busily engaged in throwing up earthwork other defence in order to repel expected attack timely arrival of part of chilian fleet under admiral rebolledo williams have put end to anxiety be now testifying to relief felt in manner usually adopted by southern nation after lying in bed for two three hour endeavouring unsuccessfully to get to sleep two lad rose looked out of window at scene be being enacted in street below when have be thus employed for quarter of hour no longer felt desire for sleep huge bonfire have be lighted wherever there be room to place procession of men woman marched to fro carrying torch singing national song with astonishing verve enthusiasm group of people collected round bonfire danced until early hour of morning when gradually broke up dispersed to home be broad daylight before last of reveller have disappeared two lad recognising futility of now attempting to secure repose dressed went out on tour through city must occupy until time arrived for public office to open when must be able to set about business two lad have not proceeded very far on way when perceived distance ahead of small crowd of people clustering round building crossed road to see what disturbance be about soon perceived that building be gunsmith shop that excitement be due to fact that people outside be bent on securing arm ammunition for a protection against marauder who be wont to infest town upon slightest excuse who be now under cover of excitement caused by impending war committing sort of atrocity authority be very much too busy with other matter to put stop to look here douglas exclaimed terry clutching companion sleeve seems to that ought to follow example of people everybody in place appears to go about armed have better do same in case must happen to get into sort of trouble show what state city must be in when only place open whole night through happens to be gun shop how much money did bring out with jim enough to purchase couple of revolver ammunition douglas hurriedly searched pocket two lad found that joint possession amounted to about fifty peso have exchanged english money at hotel for chilian currency acting upon terry advice jim now stepped into shop purchased two revolver packet of ammunition for paying about forty peso of money for weapon once outside shop two lad slipped round corner loaded pistol slipped into hip pocket having done started out once more on tour of exploration feeling much more secure than have previously done be by time about seven o'clock in morning a government office must not be open until nine ten o'clock have still fully two hour to fill up before must present for enlistment in chilian service therefore feeling somewhat hungry strolled up down street on look out for cafe eating house where might refresh inner man after about quarter of hour search found place in side street promised to afford what required a be about to enter douglas seized friend arm remarked say terry know how strike look to to be very curious sort of place surroundings appear precisely what might call select think have better go on little farther see whether can not find more respectable looking place terry cast eye over cafe up down street in be situated unlike rest of town everything in district seemed to be comparatively quiet there be very few people about so shook off companion restraining hand exclaimed oh know jim think place look right enough be quiet be more than can say for other part of town think will be quite safe in risking let go inside see what proprietor can give to eat for to tell truth be most ravenously hungry right replied douglas if mind be sure ought to be able to take care of ourselves with little toy have in pocket come on then let go inside two lad thereupon walked in through door immediately found in large room be filled with little marble topped table made to accommodate four person while high counter on be coffee urn tray of cake flask of spirit etcetera ran down whole length of apartment early a be hour place be very far from being empty indeed lad found upon looking round that nearly table be occupied with exception of one nearly in middle of room second standing in somewhat dark corner close to door apparently communicated with back premise place seems pretty full doe terry queried jim taking comprehensive look round must scarcely have expected that there must have be so many folk about at early hour people must have be up night will take table over in corner there be out of way feel very much inclined to take one in middle of room to be stared at by everybody in place what do propose to have for breakfast there doe seem to be very wide selection perhaps may be able to supply with something eatable well answered obeeara for must like fried egg if must get see have coffee on tap in big urn yonder what say douglas agreed that too must relish few egg two lad stepped up to counter inquired in best spanish have picked up during course of frequent visit to south american port whether must be supplied with required comestible to astonishment proprietor did not at once reply after staring hard at for few second slipped quickly off into back part of shop where heard speaking volubly in spanish to unseen person person lad must not at distance understand that said jim fancied that caught word espias atacar naturally did not connect in way with friend however when proprietor returned in minute two jim renewed request time fellow be smile bow assured senor order must be most promptly attended to boy therefore seated at table have selected waited for food to be brought to examining meanwhile motley collection of people in building there seemed to be men present of shade of colour under sun from pink skinned representative of northern country down to blackest negro costume be a varied a be picturesque what gave lad momentary qualm of uneasiness be fact that person in place have suddenly become very quiet whereas when boy entered cafe fairly hummed with conversation also noticed that nearly pair of eye be directed toward while expression on men face be to put very mildly decidedly hostile presently douglas remarked to chum say terry old boy appears almost a though fellow did not quite approve of presence here wonder what be wrong chilians have always be very friendly disposed toward british so suppose be anticipated war have upset equilibrium bit same wish landlord must bring along meal so that might finish get out like look of thing here at do replied terry if there must be row remember that must not get separated whatever do use pistol until be absolutely compelled to do so must however be obliged to shoot must shoot to kill for when once open fire will have work cut out to get away alive ah here come breakfast at last so let get on with a quickly a possible take notice of menacing look of crowd if see that appear to notice anything wrong may quiet down bit right be replied douglas began meal with very excellent appetite despite uncongenial surroundings two boy carried out programme of not appearing to notice forbidding glance everywhere met whenever raised eye from plate presently ear caught sound of angry whisper then low muttering until in few minute furious voice plainly directed against be heard from corner of room one man jumped upon chair began to harangue crowd speaking in south american patois boy did not understand pointing toward with angry gesture while several other rough looking character have risen to foot be gradually edging down toward corner where jim terry be seated jim exclaimed terry suddenly glancing up there be doubt that unwashed scoundrel very strongly object to presence here for reason other much like idea of running away since be outnumbered by about ten to one really think discretion will prove better part of valour in present case let pay score at once get out if can added under breath lad rose to foot walked a unconcernedly a must toward counter upon terry rapped with coin to attract landlord attention that gentleman have for reason other vanished rap a might one put in appearance while time crowd continued steadily to close in on with angry look threatening gesture come away terry whispered douglas must not stand on ceremony longer will have to make bolt for will not get out at put pistol in side pocket so that can get at easily then come along under cover of one of table lad shifted revolver from one pocket to other then began to walk toward door sooner have started than with hoarse growl of rage score of men drawing dagger knife from various portion of clothing dashed at boy upsetting chair table a came evidently bent upon taking life if possible a matter of fact be only obstructive presence of numerous table chair saved two lad from first wild rush with agility of youth sprang back to corner where have taken meal put back against wall for safety sake drawing pistol presented at crowd of furious men terry inquiring at same time in best spanish must muster meaning of murderous assault seeing muzzle of deadly revolver pointed at assailant paused for few second while one of men gigantic chilian with blanket poncho over shoulder took upon to answer lad inquiry why be going to kill dog roared why because be brace of peruvian spy caramba know very well why have come here neither of will leave place alive have quick way with people of stamp in country exclaimed douglas at top of voice be making mistake be peruvian spy couple of british sailor who have left ship pericles in order to enlist in chilian navy fight against peruvian not for be merely waiting for office to open in order to proceed there give in name a candidate for service only reply to statement be volley of oath mocking laughter interspersed with word liar traitor kill inca dog while recovering from momentary alarm at sight of pistol crowd again began to surge forward toward two lad situation be becoming exceedingly critical therefore again raising revolver douglas pointed straight at foremost man shouted one step farther fire fellow hesitated for fraction of second then hand shot forward swiftly a flash of lightning knife have held missing jim ear by hair breadth stuck quivering in panelling behind with growl of rage douglas pulled trigger of pistol firing twice in quick succession while close beside terry revolver also spoke out so close be foremost assailant bullet took effect four men plunging heavily forward to ground almost within arm length of two boy circumstance so far from intimidating chilians seemed to stimulate rage knife began to flash through air like so many silver flying fish thrown too with such force have one of hit mark must have closed recipient earthly career on spot by lord harry ejaculated terry firing rapidly into thick of crowd be getting rather too warm to be pleasant will have fired away cartridge in pistol presently will certainly give time to reload what be to be next move jim douglas however have already be glancing hastily about in endeavour to discover pathway of escape even a terry spoke eye lighted upon door close to have be sitting while be taking breakfast edge along toward right little terry exclaimed only hope of escape be through door god grant that may not be locked meanwhile obeeara availing of momentary pause on part of assailant have contrived to insert few fresh cartridge in pistol firing several more shot right into brown began to edge way along to door in manoeuvre be quickly followed by douglas then shooting out left hand behind felt for knob turned knowing that life depended upon whether be fastened otherwise to inexpressible relief handle turned door opened under touch while luckily for two lad opened away from instead of toward emptying remaining barrel of revolver boy at once slipped through pushed door close behind just a further volley of knife came hurtling through air to stick quivering in panelling while with hoarse roar of rage chilians surged forward bent on preventing escape of supposed spy by greatest good luck there happened to be lock couple of bolt on farther side of door two lad slipped home in trice interposing between bloodthirsty foe barrier hoped must gain few minute grace once on right side of door hurriedly reloaded pistol looked round for exit from apartment while air resounded with sound of blow thundered upon frail woodwork behind clearly door must not stand more than minute so be necessary to hasten if be to escape after look a might there seemed to be mean of egress until terry suddenly shouted that door will be down in second jim must get behind tier of cask will afford certain amount of shelter at rate in moment boy have slipped behind stack of barrel there right in front of be door for have be searching come along terry exclaimed douglas way for life like flash darted through door finding in dimly lighted passage looked a though led into back premise of cafe just a entered passage heard crashing splintering of wood followed by shout of rage knew that frail barrier between pursuer be destroyed down passage ran at top speed round sharp corner at bottom then emerged into large patio courtyard rapid glance round revealed exit from place already must hear enemy rushing down passage behind quick quick whispered jim must hide somewhere be lost cast eye round for place must suit purpose way cried to companion dashing across court towards large corn bin be only chance like flash two lad raised lid clambered inside let covering down just a first chilian emerged into patio heard pursuer separate search whole yard calling to one at interval to inquire whether anything have be heard seen of fugitive for reason other seemed to occur to none of to glance inside corn bin reason probably being that stood before so prominently that never dreamed that one must have thought of hiding there suddenly there be shout from far corner of patio voice cried way child have found door through spy have fled there be quick trampling of foot more savage cry then silence chilians have evidently gone off on false scent now if ever be moment for jim terry to effect escape listening intently for few second douglas raised lid of hiding place inch so peered out through opening thus formed there be one in sight must hear savage shout of chilians in distance a searched hither thither for prey now terry whispered jim now be time out get quickly hearty must make rush for passage through into shop so out into street be only hope be quite ready yes then here go flinging back cover two friend clambered out rushed across patio up passage through wrecked door into shop to great relief place be absolutely empty after short halt therefore to rearrange brush clothing have become somewhat disordered strolled casually out of cafe into street by time there be many more people about mingling with throng two boy soon lost sight of cafe with rapid step made best of way down toward harbour near be situated government office be now open entering one bore plate with word oficina por empleo en la marina inscribed thereon found in presence of senor don guzman cartador director of navy to whom made known desire to enter chilian service gentleman listened courteously to examined shortly upon capability finally gave letter of introduction to admiral rebolledo williams of battleship blanco encalada to whom recommended to apply saying at same time that have little doubt must be successful in obtaining commission a admiral williams be very short of efficient officer just then armed with official introduction two lad presented aboard warship about mid day be fortunate enough to find admiral williams not only disengaged also in particularly good humour at once granted interview asked several question a naval director have done finally accepted service much to gratification of two lad gave douglas commission a second lieutenant on board flagship obeeara post a second engineer aboard same vessel then sent ashore to have commission signed by captain morale to procure necessary uniform outfit instructed to report on board blanco encalada on th of february since admiral expected order to sail on about date boy left senor williams with many expression of gratitude went ashore to provide with uniform necessary kit order for supply of have be given by williams tailor promised to have everything ready by th for wonder be a good a word on morning of th therefore two lad in full uniform with belonging in boat with be rowed off to blanco encalada by mid day found duly installed a officer in chilian service chapter three occupation of antofagasta month of february in latitude of valparaiso corresponds approximately to month of august in northern hemisphere be beautiful sunny very hot morning when on th of month chilian fleet consisting of blanco encalada flagship almirante cochrane battleship corvette o'higgins chacabuco with sloop esmeralda steamed out of harbour on way to antofagasta principal seaport of bolivia may not be amiss to state here briefly cause of war be then impending between allied republic of bolivia peru republic of chili desert of atacama on border of chili bolivia have be for many year without acknowledged owner chili claimed so also did bolivia be not considered by claimant to be of much importance be certainly not regarded a worth fighting for until be discovered that be rich in nitrate other mineral wealth in two republic being allied in war against spain fixed by treaty th parallel of south latitude a future boundary between bolivia agreed that chilian citizen who be already landowner in region between deg deg south must be allowed to mine to export produce without tax other hindrance to facilitate arrangement chili be permitted to maintain representative in custom house at nitrate business of day be chiefly in hand of company head of be british house of gibbs chilian named edward chilian government on february bolivia saw fit to impose tax of centavo penny per quintal pound on nitrate chili remonstrated bolivia insisted declared in addition that tax be meant to be retrospective that unless due be paid before february nitrate in hand of exporter must be seized sold by auction a day have be fixed for seizure drew near chilian squadron under rear admiral rebolledo williams be got ready for purpose of seizing antofagasta be fleet on morning of february steamed out from valparaiso with jim terry a chilian officer on board blanco encalada flagship of squadron a fleet weighed anchor stood out to sea bell pealed from steeple in town while gun in hastily improvised fortification above town thundered out farewell salute to ship be going to vindicate honour of chili action of be tantamount to declaration of war a warship rounded point returned salute with starboard broadside gun while ensign at mizzen gaff be dipped thrice in jubilant farewell although war have not a yet actually be declared against peru chilian government have very strong reason to suspect existence of secret treaty between country bolivia a peru be possessor of navy of considerable strength behoved admiral williams to be exceedingly careful that did not run into ambush of peruvian ship very sharp look out be therefore kept incessantly during six day fleet took to steam from valparaiso to antofagasta there be bolivian navy if except few steam launch old spar torpedo boat there be nothing therefore to fear in direction a chilians have not a yet have time to advance force overland up coast contingent of five hundred regular be put on board ship to effect occupation of antofagasta two hundred fifty being put on board at valparaiso while admiral williams have be instructed to call in at caldera bay in order to embark remainder steaming at rate of slowest ship in squadron sloop esmeralda be incapable of speed of more than four five knot admiral arrived in caldera bay on evening of th of february a be too late to think of embarking troop night anchored ship in column of line ahead at distance of about mile from shore on course stretched across bay from signal station to little village of calderillo nothing have thus far be seen of peruvian squadron a bolivia have a stated above navy worthy of name fleet be moreover still in chilian water admiral williams did not consider necessary to establish patrol of picket boat on watch round ship a certainly must have done have be lying before hostile port be oversight coupled with fact that williams regarded bolivian sea strength a beneath notice very nearly led to frightful disaster for chilians at very outset of war on particular night douglas be a happened officer of watch terry who be off duty be sharing vigil with friend walking to fro upon blanco encalada quarter deck listening to sound be wafted across water from town of caldera from neighbouring ship of be brilliantly lighted up there be sailor sing song in progress aboard corvette chacabuco second ship away from blanco encalada lad listened with amusement to rollicking sound proceeded from direction there be moon sky be spangled with brilliant star shed faint silvery lustre over sea distant summit of andes enwrapping everything in soft luminous haze must scarcely be dignified with name of light two lad paced to fro eagerly longing for time when douglas must be relieved from duty for be very tired terry did not feel inclined to leave friend to continue watch by a time passed on light of squadron disappeared one by one until at length only light showed be riding light two of be suspended on ship one at bow one at stern sound on board ship have died away completely be only occasionally that shout of party of reveller be heard from shore be shortly after one o'clock in morning when terry who be still keeping friend company walked to ship rail stood there in listening attitude then raised voice slightly called douglas to side listen carefully for moment old fellow said can not hear something away out there on port bow jim listened presently strained sens caught faint sound like throbbing of tiny engine somewhere away in darkness yes whispered certainly can hear something to sound a though there be small steam launch somewhere out there certainly can not see anything of what can launch possibly be doing out there at time of morning well replied chum if be not chilian port must be inclined to suspect something in nature of night attack under circumstance quite see from what quarter such attack must come peruvian fleet can hardly have come upon unawares for must surely have seen sign of must hardly steam without showing light at besides sound be certainly nearing by way seems to more like hallo did see that douglas by jove strike that there be something more in than meet eye yes answered jim distinctly caught sight of flicker of flame appeared to a though somebody have struck match for purpose other have hurriedly extinguished wonder what be happening away over there there be certainly something going on be not quite a must be be convinced during brief interchange of remark noise of churning little propeller have be drawing nearer after listening intently for few second longer douglas whispered hurriedly to chum slip below quickly terry bring up night glass believe there be something radically wrong about business in moment obeeara be back on deck bearing telescope douglas hastily snatched from brought to bear on spot from whence sound proceeded have be glancing through for only about minute when turned excitedly to terry gasped out rouse ship man quickly too there be launch approaching carry spar torpedo be making straight for evidently mean to torpedo flagship like flash terry disappeared to rouse crew while douglas continued to watch approach of launch in perfect agony of apprehension little craft be very close indeed now steaming at rate of nine knot must be alongside blanco encalada in couple of minute once alongside battleship nothing must save latter from destruction anxiety lent wing to terry foot in few second men made appearance on deck in stage of undress for fully appreciated danger of situation have not waited to clothe officer also have dashed up from below hurried word of command flew from one quarter of ship to admiral williams rushed up from below upon alarm being given now instructed ship bugler to sound alarm to sound with strength while at same time blank charge be fired a warning to other ship to be on alert immediately afterward bugle be heard shrilling from almirante cochrane be taken up by ship in squadron for whole fleet be now thoroughly alarmed on alert for few moment state nearly approaching to panic reigned aboard flagship men be quickly at quarter gun in ship be promptly trained upon position indicated by douglas be too dark to enable gunner to aim with precision sound guided to extent suddenly perfect volcano of machine gun fire broke out on board blanco encalada followed by hoarse scream of agony from torpedo launch iron bucket be partly filled with paraffin be lighted a flare throwing lurid glare over sea disclosing plainly to view couple of rapidly approaching launch of carried spar over bow from torpedo be suspended launch heading directly for blanco encalada upon nearest launch effect of flagship fire be terrible helmsman have be cut nearly to piece by hail of bullet now hung dead over tiller of little steamer be consequently yawing wildly about remainder of crew be in well abaft boiler lying huddled up on floor while others hung loosely like half empty sack over launch bulwark arm trailing in water indeed appeared a though blanco encalada by lucky fluke have concentrated whole fire upon one devoted craft for moment appeared a though little steamer with crew of dead must still effect purpose for torpedo be still intact at end of spar launch be heading straight for battleship just at last moment corpse of helmsman be jerked from tiller by motion of sea launch head immediately fell off point two rushed past blanco encalada bow missing by more than few foot few minute later deafening report from shore told on board flagship that torpedo launch have rushed at full speed upon rock thus exploding torpedo blowing to piece second launch have be steaming about hundred yard astern of consort have miraculously escaped that whirlwind of shot now seeing fate of consort described wide circle headed away to north west out of bay at full speed in few minute must be beyond circle of light thrown by flagship brazier of fire must be in safety be not to escape so easily blanco encalada gunner carefully laid machine gun on craft opened furious fire upon rattle of nordenfeldts sounded like continuous roar of thunder stream of fire from muzzle illuminated darkness of night with fitful glare gunner got range almost immediately on board flagship must see that water be lashed into foam round launch by pelting rain of missile there be escape from iron hail not even for desperate member of crew who dived overboard for men of blanco made target of face appeared upon surface of water then end came suddenly dreadfully bullet must have passed in advance of launch struck torpedo for onlooker saw dazzling burst of whitish blue flame be followed by deafening stunning explosion launch seemed to disappear a if by magic in tornado of flame for not even fragment of appeared on water afterwards roar of machine gun at once ceased man on board ship wiped away cold sweat of fear have burst out on forehead at prospect of being torpedoed for there be arm in naval service so dreaded by sailor tranquillity be now gradually restored hour later peace once more reigned not single man in whole squadron must bring to go below again until day dawned on ship huge fire be lighted boat be sent to patrol fleet in order to prevent repetition of occurrence be not until daylight revealed sea empty of craft save of chilians that fearful strain of suspense be relaxed admiral williams personally thanked douglas obeeara for quick action have undoubtedly saved flagship very probably of other vessel of squadron also questioned lad closely in order to ascertain whether have heard seen anything must furnish clue to nationality of occupant of launch must tell nothing admiral be at length driven to conclusion that assailant must have come down coast from antofagasta must have consisted of couple of ancient torpedo launch bolivian be known to posse williams have left out of calculation a being too unimportant to be taken into consideration how dearly oversight might have cost have already be seen following rather same morning ship boat be lowered assisted by flat bottomed craft from shore began work of embarking remainder of troop continued during whole morning by mid day balance of military contingent be distributed among ship then got up anchor turned bow to northward once more still under easy steam for benefit of old rotten esmeralda two of whose boiler be so eaten away by rust a to be useless particularly keen look out for hostile ship be kept in view of alarming incident in caldera bay nothing of suspicious character be sighted on evening of th of february fleet anchored before town of antofagasta principal seaport of bolivia lying in half circle at distance of about mile half from shore obnoxious tax be to come into force on following day if bolivia adhered to original resolution admiral williams have order must such prove to be case be to seize custom house invest town in event of resistance being offered to bombard chili did not intend to submit tamely to high handed action of bolivia constituted serious intolerable infraction of treaty immediately squadron came to anchor therefore gun be trained upon town in readiness for action must such become necessary early on following morning admiral williams have gig piped away accompanied by flag captain be pulled ashore to ascertain intention of bolivian authority to warn chilian inhabitant of place that must be bombarded must president of republic not prove amenable to reason so that might leave town with belonging before ship opened fire admiral be ashore until about three o'clock in afternoon when returned to blanco encalada soon became known that bolivian have refused to relinquish demand therefore antofagasta be to be invested believed however that must not be necessary to bombard town a thought be hardly likely that inhabitant must be so unwise a to offer armed resistance to landing of chilian troop soldier be therefore to be landed at once under cover of gun of squadron while naval force composed of men from blanco encalada almirante cochrane be at same time instructed to land at northern part of seaport seize custom house chilian troop under colonel sotomayor be therefore put into boat belonging to warship be then taken in tow by small steam craft conveyed to wharf at south end of town landing being unopposed except for few stray shot be fired from cover of closed shop few volley from soldier promptly checked then ship boat being once more available task of seizing custom house be proceeded with be anticipated that here if anywhere determined resistance must be made council of captain be called on board blanco encalada plan of campaign resolved upon be decided that captain latorre of almirante cochrane must lead naval detachment be to be drawn from ship of squadron in proportion to complement of crew douglas be officer selected to take charge of party from blanco encalada much to delight selection being probably due to desire on admiral williams part to recompense lad in measure for promptitude coolness have displayed in saving flagship in caldera bay jim joyously took leave of friend terry who a belonged to engine room staff must not expect to be sent on shore expedition adjusted sword at side ran down side ladder took seat in stern sheet of steam launch with whaleboat be to tow carried detachment of men from blanco encalada boat of other vessel be by time ready headed by launch of almirante cochrane carrying captain latorre leader of expedition little flotilla swept away from ship toward north end of town vociferously cheered a went by remainder of squadron distance to custom house be about two mile by time that have covered half of be seen that considerable amount of activity be being manifested ashore in fact looked a though here at rate bolivian have fully determined to offer resistance jim remarked on circumstance to lieutenant alcerrerez who be sitting next to while be speaking captain latorre hailed boat to slow up come alongside in order to receive further instruction be soon given be to effect that launch of flagship of almirante cochrane be to be leading boat in formation of double column of line ahead in order be to attack matter having be arranged went ahead again at full speed while men eased cutlass in sheath inspected cartridge in rifle in readiness for anticipated encounter suddenly when boat be within couple of hundred yard of mole leading down from custom house blaze of fire leapt from loopholed wall of building bullet flew round little flotilla in perfect hailstorm chilian ensign in stern of douglas launch be literally ripped from staff proving have bolivian depressed rifle muzzle trifle more man in steamer well must have be hit by leaden shower lieutenant alcerrerez who be sitting next to douglas emitted curious little cough turned half round fell forward over lad knee while several men in launch sprang convulsively to foot only to drop down again in limp motionless heap to fall over low gunwale in violence of death struggle jim shuddered a thought of fate of poor lieutenant alcerrerez pulled together laid poor shot pierced body gently down on boat floor grating thereby saving own life for even a stooped shower of rifle bullet hurtled into launch killing several more men piercing boat in six place below water line so that began to take in water at alarming rate of other craft have however come off still worse than blanco encalada launch for casualty be even heavier in almirante cochrane boat while shot have pierced boiler of launch belonging to o'higgins immediately blew up with disastrous result killing wounding nearly whole of crew flotilla be by time however within shelter of mole minute later boat rushed alongside at full speed jim leaping ashore at same time a captain latorre who sword in hand formed men quickly up shouting forward child have comrade to avenge away raced boat crew along pier toward custom house receiving a did so terrible volley from defender chilians blood be up however did not even pause to succour wounded dashed forward holding fire in reserve with bayonet fixed before bolivian must fire again chilians have reached building be thus protected from fire of occupant a loophole be too small to allow of rifle being depressed to great extent bring bag of powder here roared latorre at top of voice a two men came up staggering under weight petard be promptly laid against door train be led close alongside wall to corner of house round seaman also sheltered match be put to there be loud report stunning concussion followed by sound of rending timber landing party dashed forward again round angle of building in through breach formed by explosion a entered house there be shout of execration defiance from floor above defender began to swarm down stair to repulse enemy hampered a be by lack of room to move freely must hing have foolishly left force on ground floor have gone to first storey in order to be better able to fire on foe oversight now cost very dear bolivian got jammed into inextricable mass in effort to descend stair at same time while thus helpless be mercilessly cut down bayoneted by infuriated chilians in few minute bloody work be over corps on stair be pulled away assailant rushed upstairs to complete work bolivian have now no stomach for further fight threw down arm cry for mercy captain latorre therefore have disarmed bound securely after went up on to roof of building hauled down bolivian flag hoisting chilian ensign in place then signalled to admiral williams custom house taken with loss of nineteen killed twenty three wounded antofagasta be in hand of chilians chapter four chilians bombard iquique shortly after occupation of

ladislas cabrera who be compelled to retire with loss of twenty killed wounded thirty prisoner loss of chilians numbered only twelve peru thereupon made certain precautionary preparation sent envoy to chili bolivia although a matter of fact have already mobilised navy be quite prepared to take offensive at moment indeed be perfectly well known in chilian official circle that peruvian fleet be actually at time at sea seeking if possible to deal opponent crippling blow even before war have be formally declared chili thereupon demanded reason for preparation a indeed be fully entitled to do required that must cease then receiving satisfactory reply announced knowledge of secret treaty dated th of february between bolivia peru at once declared war against latter a well a former immediately following chili increased navy by repurchasing corvette abtao sister ship to famous alabama of american civil war time built in of ton displacement horse power with nominal sea speed of knot ship be armed with three pounder muzzle loading gun three pounder muzzle loader played almost a important part in war between chili peru a did alabama in american civil war chili also bought from pacific steam navigation company screw steamer amazona for use a transport by chartering rimac itata lamar loa limari from chilian steam navigation company mathias cousino other steamer from cousino

subsequent bloody battle with chilian warship blanco encalada almirante cochrane in gallant commander lost life behaved with such gallantry that name will go down to history a one of epoch making ship of world from to admiral grau be member of peruvian congress for paita on outbreak of war successfully applied to be reinstated in former command of huascar by peruvian squadron be arranged a follows first division under admiral grau consisted of huascar independencia armoured frigate oroya paddle transport of ton second division be placed under order of captain carillo consisted of monitor manco capac atahualpa bought from united state of ton chalaco transport of ton displacement third division under captain garcia y garcia comprised union wooden corvette of ton very famous ship pilcomayo gunboat limena paddle transport such be peruvian navy at commencement of war whole fleet in three division a above be under command of admiral grau port of antofagasta having be occupied by chilian troop squadron under admiral williams left place commenced patrol of coast with view to enforcing blockade on th of april fleet appeared off iquique in peru admiral announced that blockade of port must begin on th of april following thus allowing ten day for chilian inhabitant of place to leave carry with belonging up to time naval action have be fought at sea be even yet moot point whether peru must not climb down back out of alliance with bolivia unknown to chilians peruvian warship union pilcomayo be cruising up down coast for purpose of snapping up small chilian craft that might happen to sight to do a much damage to chilians a possibly must now happened that shortly after chilian squadron have invested antofagasta small corvette magellanes arrived at valparaiso having returned from police duty in tierra del fuego be thereupon immediately ordered by chilian authority to proceed northward join admiral williams fleet on way while off mouth of river loa fell in with peruvian ship union pilcomayo with fought running action for over two hour when owing to superior speed effected escape carnage on side be terrible union although much larger ship be so seriously damaged that be obliged to return to callao principal seaport of peru in order to be drydocked repaired magellanes then fell in with main chilian squadron off iquique made report of occurrence be at first intended that iquique must merely be bombarded to render attendant condition a stringent a possible admiral williams strictly forbade condensation of fresh water on shore prohibition must naturally cause very great inconvenience to inhabitant since fresh water from spring well stream be almost unobtainable in town on several occasion however smoke be observed to be rising from spot where condensing apparatus be located indicating apparent disposition on part of inhabitant to disregard prohibition so incensed chilian admiral that determined to send douglas on shore with message to effect that if offence be persisted in must be compelled to bombard steam launch be accordingly lowered away from blanco encalada manned presently jim in full uniform took seat in stern sheet of craft immediately steamed away to carry admiral protest message to intendente of iquique in about hour launch ran alongside quay at iquique jim sprang ashore declining offer of coxswain to accompany show way to intendente quarter jim whose knowledge of spanish be by time nearly perfect made inquiry at pier for office of intendente man in uniform with lad be not acquainted immediately offered to conduct thither jim suspecting treachery unhesitatingly accepted individual service pair entering into animated conversation left pier turned step townward for distance way led along sandy road paved here there with cobblestone fronted by building seemed to be hotel inn of cheaper kind probably intended for accommodation of seaman from foreign ship used port followed road ran along sea front for about mile half jim be just about to pas comment on distance when guide turned to right plunged into narrow gloomy side street appearance of filled douglas with aversion although at time suspicion of treachery entered mind soon noticed however that guide whose name transpired be manuel lope be taking up one narrow street down in most extraordinary fashion that seemed to be getting into particularly low quarter of town jim have just made up mind to question lope a to whether be quite sure of way when latter stopped before large white painted building with green shutter led companion in through high wide archway into kind of courtyard like of be nearly always to be found in large house in old new spain look a though might be residence of official other mused jim what extraordinary quarter of town governor seems to have selected for dwelling however suppose know own business best will be pleased to follow senor here broke in guide lope bowing in obsequious manner leading way across patio to where heavy door gave entrance into part of building overlooked courtyard jim tucked sword under arm followed fellow into room seemed to coming out of brilliant sunlight to be shrouded in darkness have goodness to take chair senor smiled lope pushing one of article forward for jim while go ascertain whether excellency will see jim accepted proffered chair somewhat nettled by certain curious change in man voice remarked senor have come ashore expressly to see intendente see must order be imperative oh assure there will be difficulty whatever on score replied lope kindly excuse for few minute while announce arrival jim bowed guide walked quickly out of room slamming heavy door somewhat sharply behind douglas heard pause for few second then step sharply across stone flagged patio from other side of fancied heard sound of low laugh word spoken in undertone paid particular attention to matter in order to pas time rose from seat began to move round room apartment be so extremely dark however that presently walked over to window in order to pull aside curtain supposed be excluding light greatly to surprise however found that there be curtain before window that gloom be caused by fact that kind of iron shutter be securely fastened across outside be indeed curious sort of waiting room sudden thought flashed across jim mind darted quickly to door turned handle pulling toward a did so be a have surmised door have be locked bolted on outside knew now why lope have paused few second before crossing patio jim be prisoner have walked into trap with eye open oh what fool have be might have known that person of importance such a intendente of iquique must not have have residence among slum of city what on earth wondered have be object in making prisoner of how came about that have be expected that man have be posted at pier ready to receive lead into ambush then suddenly remembered dispatch carried from admiral realised that person on shore with telescope must have seen put off from flagship have observed progress whole way from to quay what too more natural than that peruvian must be anxious to get chilian officer into hand especially flag officer who must be almost certain to have very considerable knowledge of chilian admiral plan there be many way by information must be extracted by unscrupulous desperate men jim shuddered a realised danger in stood first thing that now did be to take dispatch from inner breast pocket secrete a well a must under circumstance next skin resolving at same time that must give up life rather than part with disclose to peruvian of admiral plan only weapon jim have brought ashore be of course dress sword resolved that must make use of before must place in closer confinement lay hand on paper next thing to be done be to examine room to see whether mean of escape presented in first place scrutinised window be secured with iron shutter outside very few second sufficed to show that there be possibility of getting out by way looked round for second door to apartment wall be however lined with massive bookshelf there be trace of door save that by have entered strangely enough there be not even so much a fireplace to room after hour careful search douglas be reluctantly compelled to acknowledge that be helpless to do anything further at present that must have to await development before taking action therefore made a comfortable a possible in easy chair keeping ear open at same time so that might have due warning of approach of enemy house be so silent that so far a sound be concerned might have be uninhabited douglas have be waiting for hour when discovered that be becoming exceedingly drowsy that air of room seemed not only to be unaccountably close also to have rather queer new odour in jim yawned portentously several time at length moved over to window to try whether air must be fresher there for put down oppressiveness to fact that there be chimney in room so far a must ascertain window seemed to be hermetically sealed upon inspection found that glass in be so abnormally thick that to break must be practically impossibility douglas now began to find that breathing be becoming distinctly difficult seized with vague sense of new danger ran to door hammered vigorously upon shouting at same time for one to come release blow shout only echoed emptily round patio not soul put in appearance felt a though strength be going out of limb presently staggered to sofa upon flung powerless to stand upon foot longer strange vision began to float before curious fancy flitted through brain felt a though one have bound iron strap round be gradually increasing pressure until seemed a though head must split asunder how much longer must be wondered dully before coxswain in charge of blanco encalada steam launch became anxious about long absence instituted inquiry returned to flagship with news admiral williams be certainly not man to allow to pas unchallenged gross violation of international law a seizure imprisonment of properly accredited envoy then people who have be guilty of outrage have doubtless acted unofficially intendente must consequently deny knowledge of business surely though by time jim thought have become more more confused brain be refusing to act coherently flash of lurid light passed before eye horrible feeling of suffocation became ever more more acute finally with what fancied be shout for assistance be in reality only weak whisper jim lost consciousness altogether rolled from couch on to floor where lay like log breathing stertorously almost at same moment section of book case surrounding room moved inward apparently of own volition two men one of whom be man lope crept cautiously into apartment hastily seizing jim inanimate body by arm leg dragged out of room carried down long narrow passage opening door of room took inside placed on bed contained what time youngster took to go off manuel said second fellow addressing lope while industriously searched jim pocket hope have not given overdose killed for expect information that will extract from will be worth great deal more than contained in paper be sure to carry by way wonder where can be be certainly not in pocket be certain have not made mistake amigo mio got hold of wrong man carrajo exclaimed lope testily be fellow without doubt watched way from ship here lend knife will rip up clothes be certain to have suspected treachery after locked in will have secreted document somewhere ah here be now read out to carlos while try to bring hijo round there be silence for few minute broken only by rustle of paper then with oath man called carlos dashed packet down saying in voice hoarse with excitement rage carramba lope be fool have made mistake somewhere be not man at suspected a much when saw that be only boy that have captured paper be simply notification from admiral of chilians that condensation of water be to cease while have be wasting time here other fellow will have come ashore returned again with paper still in possession oh lope be mule cabeza de porco trouble have be in vain softly softly friend replied manuel even if have a say secured wrong messenger trouble will not have be useless may have observed caro mio that be flag officer will be certain to have knowledge of great many of rebolledo williams plan very well when recovers will take measure to induce have have to tell know after attention of hour so will give with assistance of certain little instrument posse will get out of information have be wonderful went on musingly how communicative man will become under certain circumstance man carlos looked at fellow scoundrel for few moment then broke out into hoarse chuckle right querido understand laughed will remove however for present to le comfortable quarter a seems to be on point of recovery lift up foot mi amigo while take arm a before suiting action to word two men seized jim body carried away down passage until came to flight of stone stair down went into very bowel of earth a seemed presently encountered massive stone door on being opened disclosed damp unspeakably filthy cell into tossed unfortunate officer without caring apparently whether broke bone in body not kicked unmercifully into centre of dungeon then turned left although two scoundrel have be under impression that jim douglas be on point of recovery from unconsciousness when thus callously tossed into cell be mistaken for found upon revisiting several hour later that be still in state of insensibility two rascal then became not little alarmed for success of scheme at once did in power to revive victim with result late same evening recovered sens although be much too dazed to answer question tried to put to men therefore gave up attempt for night left jim in peace handing little bread water promising that must return early next morning douglas recovered faculty soon after carlos lope have left while eating frugal meal tried to unravel mystery of capture to calculate how long must probably be before admiral williams must take step to find be however still very dull heavy presently dropped into deep sleep from be awakened just a dawn be breaking by entrance of captor immediately began to interrogate about number of men in fleet condition of ship number of gun above a to plan admiral williams have formed for forthcoming attack on peruvian port jim of course firmly refused to give information upon matter in question loudly denounced way in have be treated demanded to be set at liberty immediately carlos accomplice merely laughed lope remarked so refuse to tell anything do young cockerel well will see will see will wager that change mind within next half hour what say carlos eh now once more will tell what roared douglas in fit of exasperation will tell nothing may do what please will still keep silent captain will know how to avenge if offer injury hark how loudly crow manuel laughed carlos showing teeth however think have better not waste more time bring in plaything lope brave latter went out of cell presently returned carrying iron brazier filled with glowing charcoal bearing under left arm cloth when unrolled disclosed to jim horrified gaze glittering array of instrument suggestiveness of shape of left little doubt a to what be ghastly use poor lad turned sick faint sweat began to pour off at mere sight of fearful appliance still did not falter swore to that not torture must make traitor of now carlos exclaimed lope throwing upon jim who struggled vainly to free from clutch of two powerful men who held in few moment be bound hand foot carlos removed naval sword have not a yet taken from young chilian officer douglas be then flung on back arm leg be lashed securely to iron ring cemented into floor of cell done with sardonic laugh two men stood upright looked at recumbent form of prisoner then carlos stepped across dungeon chuckling while thrust several of steel instrument of torture in among glowing charcoal of brazier half fainting with nerve sense strained to utmost jim suddenly fancied that heard faint sound coming apparently from great distance sounded to fevered imagination almost like bugle call be so exceedingly faint that thought ear must have deceived looked at two rascal above be talking have evidently heard nothing carlos drew out from brazier long curved piece of steel be not yet red hot replaced with malevolent glance at douglas then suddenly there rang out high clear quite unmistakable sound of trumpet be blown at very great distance away jim recognised immediately be alarm felt that crisis be at hand carrajo exclaimed man lope turning pale face to confederate what doe mean run up above man quickly find out surely can not be that broke off a dull boom rumbled through stagnant air made very stone cell quiver quick carlos quick man see what be matter without further bidding carlos opened door sprang up stair just a appalling crash be heard apparently quite close at hand even if not in very building then there be rending explosion not quite so close at hand time lope quivering with fear glanced at douglas then at open door a though meditating flight have evidently just made up mind to decamp when carlos came plunging down stone step amigo mio gasped hoarsely something have gone terribly wrong somewhere for chilian squadron be bombarding iquique what be more shell be falling in quarter street be full of dead man saw flying past just now say that body of marine be already on shore coming way must fly at once will be too late can be that be in return for having seized youngster come along friend quickly must be well to give boy tap on head thus spare countryman trouble of carrying away if find come quickly man be lost cursed shell be beginning to fall in direction again indeed be right dungeon fairly rocked under hideous concussion of bursting missile while roar of falling masonry must plainly be heard above mingled with shriek came to ear strangely muffled by distance like to leave boy muttered lope who seemed much cooler of two men if stay here will be buried alive mr officer will not kill said drawing back lip from teeth with evil smile will leave here so that friend may have satisfaction of killing then a fearful crash sounded above kicked brazier of coal over so that glowing ember scattered over jim body calling to friend exclaimed adios senor a two men ran up stone stair jim suffered excruciating pain a ember burnt way through clothes ate into flesh at length contrived to roll shake free of meanwhile two enemy must hardly have gone dozen step upward when there came most deafening concussion close by shower of dust flying fragment of masonry scattered round douglas nearly blinding felt that be lost for bound a be must hing to help a lay there waiting for death be astonished to find one of cord confining wrist be slackening next moment have parted fragment of glowing charcoal have providentially fallen upon burnt through with one hand free found able with difficulty to release other after few second be sufficient to enable to cast loose lashing from foot then stumbled groped way up step passing a did so mangled body of lope of carlos who have be literally blown to piece house above be mere shapeless mass of wreckage jim have little difficulty in clambering over debris into street a emerged from wrecked building there be rattling volley shower of bullet whistled past young officer head own men be firing at under impression that be one of enemy snatched handkerchief from pocket waved just in time to avoid being riddled by second discharge moment later douglas be shaking hand with rescuer who have so nearly escaped being merely avenger now appeared that coxswain of launch suspecting treachery have followed jim guide to house outside have waited for time in hope that be mistaken that jim must presently make appearance when hour have passed man felt convinced that something be wrong hurried back to ship to report admiral williams have thereupon sent ultimatum to intendente unless senor douglas be returned to blanco encalada by daybreak must bombard unfortunate official knowing nothing of occurrence complained of have failed of course to produce young man rebolledo williams have carried out threat very nearly destroying man whom wished to save in so doing under cover of heavy gun fire party of marine have be landed under guidance of coxswain have gone toward house where jim be known to be men seeing place in ruin naturally concluded that jim be dead be on point of retreating when lad put in appearance among ruin having happily accomplished errand detachment now returned to ship having to fight way back through street in face of almost overwhelming peruvian force won through eventually regained boat without great loss afternoon jim reported to admiral who thereupon determined to bombard in grim earnest on following morning needle to say jim slept sounder night than have done in dungeon on previous evening chapter five battle between esmeralda huascar on following morning shortly after daybreak rebolledo williams began preparation for further bombardment of iquique just a be on point of opening fire blanco encalada yeoman of signal presented with report that chilian gunboat magellanes vessel of ton displacement of eleven knot speed have just made appearance in bay coming up from southward flying signal have important news to communicate admiral therefore ordered operation to be suspended for moment waited impatiently for captain of magellanes to come aboard make report little vessel be evidently in hurry for steamed in at full speed did not bring up until close alongside flagship anchor then splashed down to accompaniment of roar of chain cable through hawse pipe captain gig be lowered away few minute later that individual be being pulled across short space of water between own ship blanco encalada captain simpson be closeted for over hour with admiral at end of time signal be made for whole fleet to heave short in readiness for early departure magellanes be also ordered to accompany squadron a ship be to go northward at top speed be impossible to take esmeralda along a well in consequence of phenomenally low rate of speed a must be at mercy of almost hostile ship might happen to heave in sight while main body of fleet be absent be decided to leave with gunboat covadonga two vessel be ordered to continue blockade of port to best of ability news brought by magellanes very soon filtered through fleet be to effect that skipper have be sent from valparaiso to inform admiral that peruvian president prado intended to leave callao on night of may for arica in paddle transport oroya that be to be accompanied by independencia huascar chalaco limena admiral williams be therefore ordered to abandon blockade of iquique proceeding northward immediately be to endeavour to intercept squadron by forcing fleet action to destroy so deal fatal blow at naval power of peru simpson also reported that while on way to join flag have fallen in off mouth of river loa with peruvian warship union pilcomayo that have fought running action of over two hour with final escape being entirely due to superior speed a of peruvian vessel must alone have be more than match for own little ship news occasioned utmost bustle activity among chilians man be most eager to be off for prospect of decisive action appealed irresistibly to officer men jim douglas however be found by ship surgeon to be suffering from very severe attack of prostration have doubtless be brought on by recent experience ashore at iquique sorely against will be removed aboard little esmeralda together with number of other sick men admiral having decided that since be almost certain to be obliged to fight severe battle must take with men save such a be absolutely sound amid commiseration of friend among whom be of course terence obeeara jim together with other sick men from flagship crew be put into steam launch conveyed to gunboat from deck of watched hour later while comfortably seated in deck chair departure of chilian squadron consisting of blanco encalada almirante cochrane o'higgins chacabuco magellanes abtao last named being filled with combustible so that might serve if necessary a fire ship poor lad felt very keenly disappointed at being unable to accompany fleet take part in action everybody confidently looked forward to a being inevitable have only known fortune be at moment about to smile on for rebolledo williams did not catch glimpse of peruvian while esmeralda covadonga be presently to take part in fight have since become world famous by reason of dauntless bravery be exhibited by chilians in face of overwhelming odds commander arturo prat captain of esmeralda be at time only thirty one year of age be senior officer of two ship covadonga be commanded by carlos condell whose name have also passed into history a have be said admiral williams having kept too close in under land altogether missed peruvian fleet escorted president prado safely into huascar captain grau independencia captain jg moore thereupon proceeded southward in hope of falling in with of chilian ship having looked into pisagua to make sure that squadron of rebolledo williams be not lurking there went on again toward iquique off port appeared at daybreak on morning of may jim having have nearly week in to recover from attack of prostration be by time quite again be with keen satisfaction that reported to commander a fit for duty upon appearance of two peruvian warship lion hearted captain when saw enormous superiority of vessel opposed to recognised at once that must have chance in coming encounter quite undaunted prepared at once for action signalled to covadonga to do same gunboat be fortunately under steam at time although little esmeralda boiler be in such shocking condition that must muster only sufficient power to move a fast a man must walk in few minute vessel be a completely prepared for action a be possible for to be calling aft crew many of whom be invalid prat made short speech to exhibited lion courage of man who have be called hero of chili said child odds be against flag have thus far never be lowered in presence of enemy hope that will not be to day a long a live that flag will fly in place if die officer will know how to do duty men be then dismissed to quarter almost immediately afterwards at eight o'clock in morning huascar fired first shot fell right between two chilian ship then began one of most memorable sea fight have ever be recorded in history chilians at once replied with available gun action instantly became fierce huascar singling out esmeralda a antagonist while covadonga be attacked by independencia peruvian ironclad steamed slowly along toward prey huascar firing two inch turret gun a came be somewhat handicapped by circumstance that there be great risk of shot striking town be of course still in peruvian hand of shell weighed a much a pound whenever hit unfortunate sloop at be aimed effect be terrible one of pierced thin side penetrating to engine room burst there killing one of engineer partially disabling crazy engine arturo prat however immediately detached from among invalid squad of men to do duty in engine room redoubled fire upon opponent keeping up furious fusillade with small arm captain grau of huascar mistook for machine gun fire so excellent be aim of marksman that destroyed peruvian who be working unprotected gun prevented from being replaced jim be here there everywhere encouraging cheering on men with voice example odds be most fearfully against chilians shot fell upon unfortunate esmeralda like hail one of shivered douglas sword in hand a waved above head undaunted crew of sloop be too fully occupied with work of fighting huascar to take notice of what be happening in town behind suddenly shower of shell began to hurtle over devoted craft from shoreward peruvian there have dragged down to beach battery of field piece with now opened galling fire upon esmeralda present berth at once became untenable for have not enough men left to work gun on broadside commander prat at once rang down to engine room for full speed ahead anchor having be raised at beginning of action doomed vessel engine began last revolution that be ever to make a soon a be seen to be slowly steaming out into bay captain of huascar determined to try to ram opponent thus end fight at once accordingly steamed for esmeralda at speed of about eight knot steering north east while sloop be steering due north be only just moving through water douglas at once divined intention of peruvian shouted warning to prat who have left bridge for few moment in order to assist with repairing of gun mechanism of have become jammed gallant commander immediately sprang to bridge telegraph rang for steam boiler must give engineer be already getting possible ounce of work out of crazy machinery sloop speed must not be increased for two dreadful minute combatant paused a if by mutual consent while huascar rushed onward like fearful sea monster at prey captain grau stopped engine just few second too soon esmeralda be within ace of scraping clear be nearly past only few yard more must be in safety wretched engine chose just that precise moment to break down sloop at once lost way next second peruvian monitor struck with concussion threw man to deck blow be fortunately glancing one huascar rubbed harmlessly along side of sloop coming to standstill alongside in consequence of entanglement of raised port shutter now be chilian last opportunity to snatch success out of jaw of failure captain prat immediately seized waving sword above head shouted boarder away follow who be able sprang over side of ship on to deck of huascar douglas be second man aboard peruvian monitor raced along deck followed by only twelve men in wake of gallant commander peruvian be not prepared for attack a have quite expected to sink little sloop with first blow of huascar ram quickly recovered from surprise swarmed out of turret up from below charging furiously upon boarder with drawn cutlass revolver scarcely man appeared have be touched aboard peruvian owing to great thickness of armour plating crew being practically intact brought overwhelming force to bear upon handful of invader who be instantly surrounded by enemy there be fourteen of told against quite hundred of huascar people fought like hero be repeatedly charged home with cutlass into thick of foe prat still at head of men laid about with red stained sword encouraged by voice example in be ably seconded by douglas who took upon task of guarding captain rear cut thrust cut thrust little band raged at peruvian for few second really seemed a though desperate valour must prevail ala have long since emptied revolver only blade remained to many of have be broken by delivery warding of furious blow so many of men be obliged to use bare fist pistol held club wise unequal conflict must not long endure chilians be falling man after man fighting desperately to very last then from somewhere up aloft rifle bullet began to hurtle among then end be very near looking upward douglas saw that number of peruvian armed with rifle have clambered up on roof of turret up into huascar low fighting top be firing directly downward into be one of bullet put end to career of gallant chilian commander jim be fighting shoulder to shoulder at head of only five men be endeavouring to cut way through foe in order to regain own ship indeed desperate valour have nearly carried through when prat suddenly dropping reeking sword put hand up to face after swaying on foot for second fell into jim arm face a douglas saw when dead hand fell away be literally shot to piece by at least dozen bullet must have struck simultaneously nothing must be done for gallant sailor for must have died instantaneously so jim allowed to sink gently to deck took up own defence again there be only two men now left beside escape seemed absolutely hopeless when volley of rifle bullet plumped into circle of peruvian evidently fired by of few remaining member of sloop crew taken by surprise peruvian scattered for moment jim with two chilian seaman took advantage of opening dashed through crowd gaining huascar side in safety to horror found that two ship have drifted apart that esmeralda be even now steaming away at very slow speed certainly still far beyond reach of three deserted men on huascar jim took one hasty look round then putting hand above head plunged downward into sea began to strike out after own ship few bullet splashed harmlessly into water alongside then peruvian turned attention to other larger prey huascar went ahead once more taking wide circle presented stem once more at unfortunate esmeralda jim then recognised that sloop be doomed that must be of use for to strive to regain must be better to endeavour to reach covadonga must still be afloat looked round to see whether must see to great surprise even a be looking for heard shout saw gunboat heading directly for with independencia in hot pursuit carlos condell seeing fate of consort realising that be hopelessly outmatched have evidently determined to retreat while engine be still intact covadonga be now heading out of bay at full speed to southward for moment douglas thought that ship must run over second glance showed that be evidently condell intention to try to pick up a covadonga approached captain sent engine hard astern checking vessel speed sufficiently to allow of jim being picked up by rope already noosed be cleverly thrown to although lad thought that body must certainly be torn in half by strain upon rope be safely hauled aboard deposited on deck whereupon captain condell again sent engine ahead at full speed resumed flight jim be soon upon foot again almost before have fully recovered breath officer came up to to tell that commander condell wished to see in order to receive report from a to what have up to now occurred aboard esmeralda jim therefore made way to little conning tower where carlos condell be directing fighting of ship before have time to enter saw final act in fight between huascar esmeralda peruvian have dashed straight at sloop stopping engine when only eighty foot away from have struck fairly on starboard broadside piercing huge hole in side through water poured in cataract finished fight at ten minute after twelve o'clock mid day gallant little esmeralda with colour still flying gun still firing plunged downward out of sight into deep blue water of iquique bay having fought most heroic battle against overwhelming odds jim be not long in making report to captain condell with glance at independencia be hard upon covadonga heel firing a came now ran down below to change into dry clothes equip with sword revolver having of course lost own when jumped into sea independencia be slightly faster craft than covadonga drew good deal more water captain condell with masterly skill availed of circumstance to full by running across shoal over peruvian ship dared not follow by keeping quite close in to shore where must not approach luckily too independencia gunner be raw found great difficulty in hitting little gunboat whenever did execution on board small craft be tremendous by reason of huge size of projectile at last finding that must not hit covadonga in vital spot bring to standstill captain moore peruvian captain determined to risk own ship in endeavour to bring running fight to close combatant be now off punto gruesos where shore be steeper water consequently of greater depth moore decided to ram opponent gradually edged closer closer to covadonga continually firing heavy gun to chilian replied with withering small arm fire until be separated by only about cable length from gunboat now suddenly changed course from south to south south east steered straight for covadonga be within hundred yard of beach have just touched rock in passage over ala for peruvian missed blow struck immediately upon rock over gunboat have moment before passed becoming immovably fixed there now roared condell to helmsman up with helm will go about destroy fellow completely senor douglas continued to jim kindly go down superintend working of forward pounder gun be told that lieutenant in charge have be killed by independencia last shot jim ran off a requested took charge of weapon while covadonga describing wide curve wheeled round until presented bow to wrecked peruvian at distance of about mile began to plump shell right into stern jim made excellent practice with gun put shot after shot into hapless vessel of entering stern passed through whole length of ship finally setting on fire in several place then independencia hull having very nearly filled with water fell over on side became complete wreck jim however still continued firing until man on board peruvian crawled aft hauling down colour hoisted white flag in place covadonga then only then ceased firing unfortunately must not enjoy fruit of victory for at very moment when peruvian surrendered huascar having picked up survivor of esmeralda crew made appearance beyond western end of island form south side of bay of iquique gunboat be of course match for monitor condell be therefore reluctantly compelled to abandon independencia seek own safety in flight to southward jim therefore fired gun in defiance at huascar immediately took up pursuit covadonga steamed away toward antofagasta reached on following day having run huascar out of sight ship being unable to steam very fast in consequence of injury to bow caused by ramming of esmeralda chapter six inca prophecy on reaching antofagasta covadonga went into road lay inside reef stretch across entrance there captain carlos condell telegraphed to valparaiso giving detail of previous day fight asking for further order while set about repairing very extensive damage have be sustained by ship in fight with independencia on following day condell received news from valparaiso to effect that chilian fleet have gone north to callao be instructed that be to rejoin a soon a received word from iquique that admiral williams have returned to port be further instructed to proceed meanwhile a rapidly a possible with repair to own ship gunboat be accordingly hauled alongside wharf at antofagasta heavy gun be lifted out of vessel be careened in order that shot hole below water line might be plugged a work on covadonga must be expected occupy at least fortnight jim douglas applied to commander condell for leave to go ashore occasionally that might explore quaint old town dated back to period long anterior to conquest of peru by pizarro band of adventurer during short sojourn on board covadonga jim have formed rather intimate acquaintanceship with first lieutenant man named jorge montt one evening after have returned from one of periodical survey of town jim entered tiny mess room to find montt discoursing at length to eager circle of listener upon legend tradition of old peru yes montt be saying a douglas entered be undisputed fact that there be thousand nay ten of thousand of descendant of ancient inca race now living in peru bolivia upper chili who implicitly believe that time will come when inca will regain old supremacy drive latin race out of part of south america re establish old inca monarchy once more in pristine glory know of course that there be many story extant in country a to existence of vast hoard of buried treasure well be prophesied believe that one day man will arise in peru who will head vast indian insurrection drive oppressor into sea power will be said be derived from enormous hoard of buried treasure locality of be well known among inca will be revealed to libertador when make appearance study of indian tradition be very interesting assure gentleman concluded then remarked jim who have sat down be listening intently nearly semi civilised race have tradition of same sort take north american indian for instance zulu why even chinese believe that one day chief will arise among who will lead to conquest of whole world think there be very much in old legend nation have in form other yes be so agreed montt have studied history of inca race very closely so far a experience go there be nation on earth whose prophecy be so likely to come to pas a be theirs be personally aware of many occasion on prophecy made by member of strange race have come true in most marvellous way for feel convinced that inca really have mean unknown to of foretelling future event for once visited in youth old woman in very town of antofagasta who prophesied many thing about future many of have so far come true rest of will doubtless happen in due time montt finished remark to accompaniment of chorus of derisive laughter number of voice be raised in protest against attempted imposition upon credulity whereupon lieutenant became somewhat angry replied shortly well gentleman may believe not a please be truth that be telling can take to identical personage if wish for believe still life here can therefore experiment for yourselves must feel so inclined for own part believe implicitly everything that told now be of willing to accompany to inca woman house put power to test there be lengthy pause for officer be either chilians of chilian descent south american race be notoriously superstitious jim being englishman have qualm felt for reason other great curiosity to see strange personage therefore replied well montt if none of other gentleman feel disposed to go with perhaps will have objection to take be very much interested in matter of kind have be impressed by what have just told must very much like to go with if mind montt bowed gravely answered by mean senor douglas will be only too pleased for be sure that woman must interest whether believe in second sight not will be off duty to morrow evening after six o'clock will dine at half past a usual suppose how must half past seven suit a time for going ashore must be back before midnight easily if went at time yes douglas agreed that time will suit very well senor montt will look forward to expedition with great interest conversation then turned upon other matter subject be dropped next evening after dinner douglas reminded montt of arrangement two men dressing in mufti stepped off covadonga on to wharf made way up into town walked along sea front where horse tram be wont to ply before electric car be introduced right away up to north end of promenade until came to hotel de sucre where turned off to right up very narrow badly lighted side street conducted into part of city very much resembling place in iquique into jim have be inveigled indeed jim began to have doubt a to wisdom of little adventure when saw evil glance scowl of hatred everywhere met on progress for be not so very long that chilians have occupied place however montt betrayed not slightest uneasiness assured friend that bolivian always looked askance at stranger in city a be dressed in mufti so connection with chilians be not apparent young englishman decided not to worry about matter to trust entirely to companion discretion traversed number of narrow side street gloomy alley presently came out in broad plaza de la libertad where patriotic orator be volubly holding forth about right of man iniquity of chilian invasion montt hurriedly seized jim arm a englishman be on point of crossing road to hear what orator have to say guided away to left so that skirted plaza instead of crossing people seem in rather excitable mood to night said lieutenant have therefore better make ourselves a inconspicuous a possible wonder what have occurred possibly there may have be battle in bolivian have be defeated must not have come ashore have thought that city be likely to be in state of unrest however a be here may a well go forward so come along let get away from frothing volcano a soon a can will turn down side street be not very much out of way will be out of sight of crowd sooner jim readily acquiesced a good many of people whom met seemed to regard with anything friendly glance two men hurried away down calle san antonio where soon got out of range of angry growling of mob ca imagine what be wrong here to night muttered montt in low voice must be a said that have defeated countryman somewhere on land else that one of ship have sunk captured huascar nothing le must imagine have roused to such pitch of excitement chilians be maintaining ridiculously small army of occupation here far too small for purpose in opinion if bolivian be to turn restive a seem very much inclined to do must have rather bad time of be afraid however be not far away from house where old inca witch woman call life used to be in one of small hovel on right side of street be just coming to turned into street rather alley indicated by montt at once found in cobble paved exceedingly ill lighted thoroughfare flanked on side by curious assortment of huge old time house be doubtless at one period dwelling of high government official tiny tumbledown hovel seemed to have sprung up like fungi other evil growth on small space of ground have formerly be left vacant between larger house way down evil looking evil smelling squalid alley montt called halt looking round carefully remarked now senor douglas so far a can remember for be good many year since be here before be house a see sign of light in place old woman may have gone away died however having come thus far will try luck lieutenant knocked softly upon door sound echoed dully through little building otherwise silence remained unbroken seemed a though place be indeed deserted caramba exclaimed montt believe there be anybody here after what pity care to knock too loudly for fear of attracting attention of neighbour be queer lot down in quarter can tell hallo did hear anything moving inside there just then douglas jim listened intently for few second then replied yes think do hear something prowling about in there upon word montt sound more like well animal than human being what very curious smell there be quite like let see here young officer sniffed several time yes continued after pause be quite like odour of wild beast per dios be right exclaimed lieutenant sniffing in turn remember that last time visited place old woman certainly seemed to carry with uncanny musty animal odour therefore be probably will knock again montt thereupon drew from jacket pocket revolver have taken precaution to bring with tapped softly on door with butt time there followed plainly perceptible shuffle shuffle like soft padding of heavy animal paw men started violently when directly afterward from other side of door whining voice inquired who knock at door go away whoever be be poor lone old woman if dis be inca woman mama huello broke in montt for if so wish to consult be two naval officer who have heard of wonderful power of foretelling future must like to have demonstration of there be pause then whining voice replied yes be mama huello wait ye there for short time while prepare for reception again that curious shuffling sound be heard jim somehow felt shiver of fear run down spine be only disordered fancy of course to certainly seemed a though voice proceeded from animal rather than from human being then montt remarked must surely have big dog other pet animal with must think for distinctly heard pad pad ' of paw when mama turned away hope creature will not attempt to worry under impression that mean harm to old woman jim did not reply felt instinctively that must find animal there when entered house have further time for reflection for at moment door opened with startling suddenness voice invited to enter montt stepped inside jim followed close upon heel door shut after of own accord apparently found in narrow stone flagged passage be dimly lighted by oil lamp with large red shade over whitewashed wall be covered with manner of hieroglyph drawing meaning of jim must not fathom have much time to examine for voice of mama still proceeding from unseen quarter invited to go forward presently found in large apartment built of stone upon wall of hung rich silk cloth made of vicuna wool together with number of other article evidently of ancient native manufacture like of young englishman have never seen before to say that be astonished at barbaric splendour of apartment be to put very mildly must not understand how be that apparently diminutive house must contain room of such large size a one in now stood soon forgot astonishment in watching extraordinary owner of place be wizened little woman of age far beyond allotted threescore year ten if appearance went for anything be face hand that riveted jim attention excited disgust feature bore strongly marked resemblance to of animal of cat specie teeth be all pointed instead of being square while hand resembled claw finger be hooked skinny nail be discoloured extraordinarily long taken altogether be personality to excite repulsion fear in one brought in contact with douglas felt strong shiver run down back a looked at stood in middle of room leaning upon thick ebony stick peering out from beneath overhanging eyebrow at two young officer with expression must not quite fathom seemed to be reading very soul then montt pulled together remarked have heard of power mama have come to ask to foretell future to a said before be naval officer in service of well wo say what country be anxious to learn what may be in store for will read life sit ye down there replied old crone pointing to richly cushioned couch be placed against one of wall if ye really wish to know future can tell oh yes mama can tell ye don jorge montt have visited before seven year ago told many thing about future have yet come to pas montt started have not expected that must again recognise for be very much changed in appearance remembrance of name date when last visited seemed rather to savour of uncanny yes mama replied did visit at time mention that told have so far proved true men action govern life thought that perhaps mine might have altered future did not forecast very prosperous career for then know speak truth don jorge replied woman brave deed in past have indeed influenced future methinks will see great thing in store for will read future first officer went on come over here sit in chair yes be now speak until give permission either senor englishman have wonder how know nationality do not will show stranger thing than however before leave montt having taken seat in chair a directed mama brought from corner of room large copper brazier on top of be bowl of same metal having filled brazier with hot coal took from fire burning in open hearth waited patiently for metal bowl to become hot after lapse of perhaps ten minute copper basin began to glow dully red witch woman thereupon poured into powder took from little gold casket immediately great cloud of smoke rushed up from bowl to jim unbounded amazement hung suspended over without mingling with air of room a have expected must at same time delightful odour greeted nostril began to experience delicious sensation of drowsiness stealing over while to ear there seemed to come faint sound a of music being played at distance outline of room began to vanish fade away little by little until only thing remained before eye be column rather ball of smoke now appeared gradually to assume larger dimension until at length seemed to be looking into dense mist wherein must at moment discern nothing time sensation of drowsiness be becoming stronger still stronger until seemed to be in state of semi coma very much like induced by use of opium then quite suddenly lassitude left sens became preternaturally acute sense of well being complete satisfaction pervaded whole being mist into be gazing became faintly luminous strange shape began to flit across shape like of have never seen in life before then something approached rested head upon knee looked down saw that something be huge jaguar south american tiger bore striking resemblance to woman mama huello strange to say jim felt sensation of fear instead whole being seemed to be quivering with eagerness to see what be to be displayed upon curtain of mist still stretched before light became stronger stronger cloud more luminous until seemed to be mass of living flame presently out of mist picture began to shape one after in rapid succession jim saw friend montt a central figure in many battle conducting with unexampled bravery covering with glory scene occurred douglas knew instinctively related to war at present in progress saw lieutenant in command of small gunboat fighting action against whole peruvian fleet coming off victorious though sorely wounded then many year seemed to elapse during montt have apparently attained to high position in chilian navy country be now divided against be in throe of revolution montt be leading spirit among insurgent carried before by magic of consummate genius out of anarchy created concord then scene changed again jim beheld representation of broad plaza in city have never visited sixth sense told be santiago de chili montt now supreme head of chilian navy be just issuing from building fronting on square be night time man be clothed in heavy black cloak have flung round shoulder montt descended step leading from house started to walk across square when suddenly from behind large fountain played in middle of plaza there sprang four men masked armed with knife there be brief struggle shrill scream montt fell pierced by dagger of enemy then scene vanished from before jim eye knew that own future be about to be presented to saw once more back on board blanco encalada knew that ship together with chilian vessel be engaged in fierce fight with peruvian ironclad name of be hidden from chilians be victorious although carnage on side have be enormous jim perceived that have be wounded several other action passed across screen of mist in of douglas took leading part distinguishing brilliantly receiving rapid promotion scene then changed from sea to land jim knew that be detailed for shore service in obscure town among bolivian mountain must distinctly see whole picture laid out before knew instinctively that great good fortune be awaiting when time must come for to visit place a stood rather seemed to stand gazing out over scene vanished from before eye voice like of mama huello spoke saying senor englishman will come to great honour through own exertion bravery also see great rich before of will obtain possession with little trouble on part be still under earth in due time in manner little suspected by whereabouts will be revealed to will become great man powerful chief in land of adoption voice ceased rumbling sound seemed to make heard in jim ear then cloud of mist slowly dissolved outline of room wherein be seated gradually came back to sens yes there be copper brazier glow have vanished from coal be now black cold montt be still seated in chair looking like statue carved out of marble jim found still on couch whereon have first placed curious feeling of drowsiness gradually left figure of mama huello appeared still standing close to montt copper brazier apparently in same position a have taken up when mist began to appear before eye be laughing grim noiseless chuckle disclosed white pointed teeth suddenly spell broke montt jim rose to foot simultaneously former wiping cold perspiration from brow smiling in curiously strained manner well mama said have shown very strange thing must say only hope that last part of prophecy concerning will not come true here be mama went on feeling in pocket for coin here be five peso piece for hope will consider payment sufficient old inca woman grabbed coin hid away in recess of girdle quite sufficient gallant cavalier replied generosity have not withered with year be brave man must might have shown more pleasant ending to life fate be fate there be changing adios senor adios think will ever meet again senor englishman go forward to honour fame while don jorge montt go forward to honour death will meet with brave heart will not be very bitter when come by time two men have reached door mama now opened moment later montt douglas be in street be now illuminated by ray of full moon a door closed behind montt shivered although night be oppressively hot jim must have sworn that heard sound of animal pad retreating down passage behind two men swiftly pulled together however started off for covadonga reached just a first faint flush of dawn made appearance in eastern sky chapter seven night attack day following joint adventure of douglas montt in antofagasta telegram arrived for skipper of covadonga ordering to leave place immediately rejoin flag at valparaiso without delay shore leave be accordingly stopped same evening gunboat raised anchor steamed out of chimba bay on way to headquarters port telegram have also contained warning that peruvian warship huascar union be prowling up down coast a one separately be good deal more than match for little covadonga behoved captain to keep very sharp look out for sign of enemy especially a gunboat be not fast enough to enable to rely upon speed for safety men be consequently posted at masthead with order to report directly sign of strange ship be seen ship slid slowly along under star keeping a close in to land a possible a soon a watch be at end night douglas feeling rather tired after experience of previous evening went down below turned into bunk be not very long before be in land of dream seemed to that have only just fallen asleep when be rudely awakened by commotion up on deck lay half awake in bunk for minute two heard men running about overhead sound of excited voice shouting then loud clear above uproar rang out carlos condell voice giving order for men to be called to quarter gun to be cast loose evidently thought jim there be more fighting in wind quickly tumbled into clothes slung uniform ulster over shoulder for night be cold stumbled up on deck pulse in throbbing with excitement at anticipation of encounter with enemy a dashed up through hatchway cannoned into almost knocked down friend montt who be rushing forward with order from skipper hallo montt jim ejaculated what be matter time two steamer have just be sighted coming out of chaneral bay heading way returned chilian breathlessly be believed to be huascar corvette union look a though have be up to mischief in there for there be big glare away to south east there can see for seems to point to having set something on fire must keep now friend for be hand to quarter prepare for action if must prove to be a believe will have tough fight to get clear of two fellow gallant first lieutenant bustled away to carry out order looking in direction indicated by montt jim must plainly see dull lurid glare of large fire away to south east outlined sharply against glow must also make out even from level of deck brig rigged steamer must be none other than peruvian monitor be accompanied by large three masted ship rigged steamer be undoubtedly corvette union whether enemy have yet sighted covadonga be still doubtful for gunboat be close in under high cliff formed coastline at point must hardly be on look out for vessel so near in to land when got nearer to must hardly help sighting only hope of ultimate escape be to avoid detection if possible until be nearly abreast of peruvian then to make running fight of trusting more to heel than to fighting power to enable to get away covadonga must scarcely hope to avoid fight of sort gallant skipper condell be not at sort of man to wish to do so must at time much rather stay fight than run even though hopelessly outmatched order be order be wanted at valparaiso so for once be forced to acknowledge discretion a better part of valour at moment word having be quietly passed men came tumbling up on deck jim be obliged to abandon survey of peruvian attend to duty of getting own particular battery of gun ready for coming encounter in about ten minute everything be prepared montt first lieutenant marched into tiny conning tower reported to condell ship cleared for action sir jim be then free for short time at rate to turn attention once more to swiftly approaching steamer be travelling so fast a to give impression that feared pursuit if mused jim almirante cochrane other of ship be really after fellow will probably mean saving of for huascar union will in case hardly dare to remain fight against ah continued a saw rocket stream up into air from huascar have sighted be clear will have to fight after yes here come be altering course now heading directly for be afraid must not escape detection peruvian have be heading off land have now turned slightly be pointing about north north west directly for spot where covadonga be creeping along under land jim must see dull red glare above funnel showed that stoker be coaling up vigorously condell now shouted down voice tube to engine room ordering staff to let have a much steam a boiler must carry rang for full speed at same time little gunboat began to quiver from stem to stern from truck to keel under increased pulsation of throbbing screw while curl of white water at bow gradually crept higher still higher up stem a speed increased until swept along at best pace of about nine knot in hour a ran down coast huascar union pointed bow more more shoreward a if to cut off gunboat began to look very much a though there be hope for covadonga when suddenly rocket blue time soared up from monitor described wide circle seaward once more consort following example jim immediately guessed that admiral grau have like prudent man have leadsman at work on board ship that peruvian skipper have suddenly found in danger of running aground through standing so close inshore two hostile warship then eased down to half speed kept on course parallel with shore at distance of about mile away from a covadonga herself be obliged by reason of shoal sunken reef to keep at distance of quite mile from beach left avenue of escape just about mile in width although huascar union must not approach closer than eight nine hundred yard from gunboat must still have to run gauntlet of fire must easily destroy by gun fire alone at six time distance there did not appear to be very much hope for covadonga thought jim unless must somehow manage to disable antagonist very unlikely contingency owing to smallness of gun unless chilian ship must happen to be in neighbourhood be attracted to spot by sound of firing be bound to open in few minute when covadonga have approached to within about mile of peruvian ironclad jim saw huascar go about heave to with bow pointing to south while union came foaming along on original course be parallel to of gunboat about mile distant from to seaward aha thought to so be manoeuvre be grau be going to get between two fire if can a soon a corvette be past too will swing round attack with bow gun while huascar rake with stern weapon look a though covadonga be in for hot time young englishman surmise soon proved correct for directly union have passed out of line of fire huascar opened with one of turret pounder gun first shell passed close ahead of gunboat be aimed much too high struck cliff on covadonga port beam exploding with brilliant flash of light roaring concussion sent ton after ton of rock hurtling down into sea corvette be now abreast of chilian ship a drew level let fly whole broadside consisting of one pounder one pounder six pounder at devoted gunboat effect be a though hurricane of fire steel have broken loose aboard covadonga three of smaller machine gun together with crew be blown to atom while bulwark be levelled with deck in several place execution on board be terrible jim have exceedingly narrow escape for at moment when union fired be just entering little conning tower with communication for captain condell pounder shell struck full upon one of covadonga pounder gun shield tearing portion of away then burst into thousand fragment one of whizzed past jim head struck conning tower beside with such force that piece of metal weighing several pound be firmly embedded in soft steel of tower be constructed while jim be dazed with shock half blinded by flying iron dust grain of powder managed to stagger inside citadel just a huascar let fly with one of pounder gun shell from struck full upon very spot on deck where have be standing ten second previously ripping huge hole in iron sheathing with be covered then exploding right over engine room hatch luckily be protected by bomb proof grating when jim have at length cleared eye of dust powder delivered message to captain be about to leave condell requested to remain saying that might want to make use of montt be in conning tower carrying out condell order a to working of engine while skipper watched carefully through narrow observation slit in citadel waiting for moment when might begin to open effectual fire upon enemy at moment arrived covadonga have come up level with peruvian monitor union being obliged to circle to seaward a found in shoal water be about three quarter of mile astern although still firing incessantly condell gave one last look round then shouted fire through voice tube led to gunboat little turret immediately there came deafening roar tremendous concussion a two pounder hurled forth shell at huascar dense cloud of white smoke drifted down upon conning tower filling with acrid fume momentarily blotting out view when cleared away be seen that have be most lucky discharge for one shell have struck full upon monitor military mast causing to fall lengthwise along ship partly wrecking funnel number of ventilator while other have apparently penetrated open gun port thus reached part of ship boiler room for column of steam be seen issuing from available opening on monitor midship section load again men load again cried douglas quite forgetting in excitement of moment discharge like will have fellow completely crippled hurrah for gallant little covadonga be recalled to sens by short sharp laugh from condell who remarked with grim smile surely senor douglas be not going to take away command of ship from be jim of course promptly apologised explaining that be owing to excitement that have forgotten condell told to think more of a be sort of spirit that liked to see young man display there be little time for conversation however for huascar a though in revenge for damage inflicted by puny enemy again discharged whole broadside at least so much of a be still capable of being fired marksmanship be so excellent that missile again struck covadonga while at same moment union again started firing with bow gun pounder shell struck gunboat full upon stern blowing huge hole in killing four men shooting away ensign staff flag when smoke cleared away douglas saw that flag be gone at same time heard sound of cheering coming across water from huascar peruvian be under impression that gunboat have struck be soon to be undeceived for jim rushed out of conning tower down below presently reappearing with ensign under arm then ran aft proceeded to fix spare staff under perfect hail of rifle bullet from monitor corvette having done so ran up flag amid cheer from covadonga then went forward once more to place in conning tower reached just a condell gave order for battery of pounder to be fired again bravely done gallantly done young friend said skipper a jim made appearance wo forget action of yours if come through right of covadonga shell at moment burst on board monitor one of blowing short squat funnel clean over side while other by one of strange happening of war entered hull through same gun port a previous shell working still further havoc in huascar engine room gunboat have by time drawn considerably ahead of monitor condell soon saw that latter be too seriously crippled in engine to pursue yet still continued firing with deadly effect union be slowly surely creeping up astern skipper therefore ordered men to turn whole attention to corvette try to disable also since must soon be beyond range of huascar gun weapon be thereupon trained astern accuracy of little gunboat fire be soon apparent for on board corvette one of forward pounder be dismounted silenced several nordenfeldts be damaged put out of action luckily placed solid shot struck union foremast full upon cap wrecking bringing upper spar down with disastrous effect to men on deck below indeed began to look a though plucky little ship must escape after for be now beyond range of huascar heaviest gun while union have be obliged to slacken speed considerably in order to enable to get wreckage cleared away condell surmised that peruvian must have shrewdly guessed at destination knew that must not give up chase so long a there be chance of getting again under gun moreover have still nearly three hundred fifty mile to go before must reach safety more than day half steaming covadonga very soon ran huascar hull down have left corvette about five mile astern before latter got wreckage of foremast cleared away resumed pursuit at full speed condell have improved shining hour by putting own little ship to right getting up more powder shell in readiness for renewed attack knew must come day have just begun to dawn when union again opened fire first shell unluckily cut tiller chain on board gunboat so that covadonga very nearly ran up on beach before chain must be repaired ship again got under control indeed jim distinctly felt keel scrape a ran over shoal stretched out about mile into sea by greatest good fortune however got clear again resumed attempt at escape peruvian ship have by time lessened distance to about two mile be firing so accurately that nearly shot came aboard condell little ship however still continued to reply pluckily with such precision that did considerable amount of damage to union then suddenly seemed a though end have come for particularly well aimed shell came hurtling into covadonga close to rudder post almost entirely destroying rudder smashing one of blade clean off propeller a consequence speed immediately dropped to about five knot condell ground teeth with rage if must have held out little longer might have be well might have escaped into one of willow bay abounding on coast where there be too little water for heavily armed enemy to follow felt that be cruelly hard brave skipper be not yet beaten far from be determined to fight to bitter end if need be go down with colour flying gun firing a did friend brother officer arturo prat on board huascar at battle of iquique bay in condell also took part surrender perish thought two column of smoke approaching from southwest sir suddenly reported douglas who have be attentively gazing southward through slit in conning tower be raising so fast that must be steaming hard whoever may be be possible wonder that be two of ship brought up by firing where senor douglas allow to look ejaculated condell excitedly by be wonderful if be right mean that be saved be so good a to bring glass young man a quickly a possible moment be now very precious douglas be back in le than minute carrying telescope by aid of be presently seen that approaching steamer be undoubtedly warship one of having very much appearance of magellanes while other corvette might be o'higgins chacabuco condell looked long at approaching ship then turned to look at union peruvian be fast coming up astern must not now be more than mile away be still firing remorselessly into gunboat apparently have not noticed smoke column now shouted condell to men there be union yonder be two of ship coming up will stand fight where be for can no longer run must endeavour to disable peruvian so effectually that will fall easy prey to chilian ship when once get to close grip must keep so busy that will not have time to look round until friend be close aboard when will hand over to tender mercy to quarter again brave heart may god defend right rousing cheer answered word men returned to gun full of hope with renewed energy opened furious fire upon peruvian that fairly reeled under impact of storm of missile nevertheless came on unchecked few minute later ranged up broadside on to covadonga at distance of about seven hundred yard when action at once became close fierce in le than minute chilian gunboat have mizzen mast shot away close to deck funnel riddled by machine gun bullet man not under cover killed survivor sheltered behind gun shield manfully replied with weapon still capable of firing union lost captain first lieutenant during first few minute of renewed encounter mainmast came down by board having be struck fair square by one of covadonga pounder shell small boat be in few minute utterly destroyed by storm of shot from gunboat gatling gun then suddenly covadonga observed wild commotion on board union screw begin to revolve once more while column of black smoke pouring out of shot torn funnel showed that there be considerable amount of activity in engine room then began to forge ahead turning slowly to starboard headed away to north have caught sight of approaching chilian craft meant to effect escape while way still lay open to jim saw man run aft dip peruvian ensign three time in mock farewell salute while white water began to boil out from under union stern be in full retreat firing with stern gun a went condell have intention of permitting to escape so easily ship must still steer after fashion if be not driven too hard immediately took up slow pursuit hoping against hope that might still be able to plump lucky shell into must destroy rudder propeller so leave at mercy of new arrival be rapidly coming up must now be plainly made out a being magellanes gunboat chacabuco corvette peruvian be going away fast enough however to take soon out of range of covadonga magellanes chacabuco a rushed past gunboat cheering now began to fire at flying ship several of shell burst aboard a chacabuco passed made signal proceed forthwith to valparaiso report be chasing to northward good luck congratulation two ship swept rapidly away in chase of peruvian covadonga obeying order resuming voyage made best of way to valparaiso reached following evening dropping anchor in middle of assembled chilian fleet to accompaniment of rousing cheer for gallant conduct at iquique bay punto gruesos jim then bade good bye to captain condell returned to own ship blanco encalada where be most enthusiastically received by friend especially warm welcome being extended to by chum terry obeeara chapter eight mine countermine jim found upon rejoining blanco encalada that there be great excitement prevailing aboard ship for fleet have received order to sail very day for port of arica squadron be only waiting for commodore riveros who have superseded rebolledo williams to come aboard to start there be numerous rumour flying about blanco a to object of cruise northward one obtained most credence be to effect that chilian fleet have be instructed to find destroy huascar union pilcomayo be waging destructive war against chilian commerce be very strongly suspected have be guilty of certain act against chilian other craft more nearly resembled piracy than civilised warfare so much damage indeed have be wrought by that chilian government have decided to hunt down obnoxious craft for purpose there be now assembled in valparaiso harbour almirante cochrane blanco encalada battleship corvette o'higgins armed merchant steamer loa mathias cousino little gunboat covadonga have also be intended to sail with squadron a have be seen have be too badly damaged in gallant fight with peruvian vessel to permit of doing so mid day came brought sign of commodore be three o'clock in afternoon before launch be seen to steam away from naval step at jetty side be then piped riveros came on board to accompaniment of flagship band crashing salute from other vessel in harbour upon arrival on board immediately went below to cabin sent for captain with whom be in close conference for about hour apparently informed a to plan of campaign for soon after captain castello came on deck became known over ship that telegram have be received from chilian spy in arica to effect that huascar union be to call in at port in about three day time that must be detained there for about week in order to effect certain repair therefore must chilians sail immediately suggested telegram must be almost certain to catch prey without difficulty be also within bound of possibility that pilcomayo manco capac might likewise be there in case since opposing force must be pretty evenly matched there be prospect of general engagement being fought prospect aroused keenest enthusiasm of man in fleet more especially that of such young hot blood a jim friend obeeara to say nothing of lieutenant montt who be being transferred to great gratification from covadonga to blanco encalada few minute after captain castello have come on deck bugle shrilled out clear lower deck hand up anchor seaman came tumbling up from below happy eager a parcel of schoolboy off for holiday string of signal flag soared aloft to blanco mainyard arm hour later screw began to revolve a led way out of harbour with other ship following in column of line ahead be five o'clock in afternoon of october cruise have begun be to prove so eventful for at least two of ship comprising squadron a passed out to sea with ever increasing speed fort on side of bay fired farewell salute spectacle of sun sinking over monte bajo centinela alto coupled with lurid flash of flame cloud of white smoke from fort san antonio bueras valdivia citadel constituted picture grandeur of jim never forgot very careful look out be maintained during progress of fleet up coast commodore riveros took precaution to look into chaneral bay cobija iquique to make quite sure that peruvian who might possibly have got wind of expedition must have chance of escaping by lying hidden until chilians be past then making sudden dash southward upon comparatively defenceless port of lower coast there be however sign of enemy anywhere in of place news that riveros be able to pick up tended to confirm telegram have received at valparaiso to effect that peruvian must certainly be found at arica having therefore made certain that have left enemy in rear chilians steamed away from iquique on rd of october arrived at point ten mile to south of arica at three o'clock next morning where fleet hove to in order to allow of council of war being held by commodore captain in cabin of blanco encalada captain of cochrane o'higgins be in favour of attack by whole squadron upon peruvian fleet supposed to be lying in harbour commodore with captain of loa mathias cousino opposed plan on ground that harbour be very strongly defended by fort consequently if such attack be carried out chilians must be obliged to silence battery before must turn attention to peruvian ironclad scheme favoured by riveros be ultimately carried out be to send in number of steam launch from ship armed with couple of spar torpedo try to blow up peruvian ship commodore argument be that must almost certainly be successful if attack be properly made while if be to fail peruvian must be certain to come out of port in pursuit of torpedo boat find face to face with chilian fleet beyond protection of shore battery having be decided upon captain returned to ship squadron once more headed northward at speed of about five knot finally coming to anchor four mile away from arica completely hidden from by headland of santa catharina form southern extremity of bay steam launch of almirante cochrane blanco encalada be then lowered into water together with small hereschoff torpedo boat o'higgins have brought up on deck little craft rendezvoused at flagship spar torpedo be hastily fitted to three one projecting from bow of boat a expedition be likely to be extremely hazardous one commodore riveros decided to call for volunteer to man torpedo boat jim douglas jorge montt be first two officer who presented for service while terry obeeara asked to be allowed to accompany chum must latter be accepted to take charge of engine of boat in jim be to go at length commodore decided to send jim in charge of blanco torpedo boat with terry obeeara in charge of engine montt be to take command of cochrane launch man named juarez be given command of hereschoff torpedo boat be craft of about sixteen ton displacement jim a being second lieutenant of flagship be given command of little squadron after hour interview with commodore during received most minute instruction a to how be to proceed went over blanco encalada side into steam launch gave signal to start there be cheering at departure for who be left behind felt that might never see comrade again moreover be necessary to maintain strictest silence since night being very still sound must carry to immense distance over water if suspicion be once aroused on shore must mean absolute annihilation of brave fellow who have started on desperate errand fleet of course showed light did three torpedo boat consequently within minute after latter have started darkness swallowed up completely there be telling whereabout be what progress be making jim have however most carefully taken bearing before leaving flagship by help of chart compass knew exactly where to find fleet again when perilous mission have be accomplished steamed along northward over three four mile separated from arica in extended column of line abreast so that chance of detection must be a much reduced a possible so that must pick up small craft might perchance be cruising about in neighbourhood have already arranged simple code of signal whereby three small steamer might communicate with one without attracting undue attention to hour after pushing off from blanco encalada flotilla came abreast of southern extremity of santa catharina island jim knew that in five minute must obtain full view of harbour when must also know whether intended prey lay in road not heart of man in little flotilla beat fast breath came thickly under stress of intense excitement of moment jim from position in stern of blanco launch tried to pierce darkness with eye to get first glimpse of peruvian vessel moment later three boat closer together now swept round northern end of island arica roadstead lay in full view before be now hour before dawn consequently night be at darkest jim must hardly repress cry of delight a caught sight of four indistinct dark mass looming up on surface of bay there be light showing anywhere save in one two isolated house on shore where sickness probably kept inmate awake have not expected to find light showing among peruvian fleet since must naturally desire to keep whereabouts hidden from chance chilian prowler in jim mind there be doubt that four shapeless blur lying close together about mile away be vessel of have come in search passed word to other launch to select own particular vessel torpedo then steam away back to chilian fleet intended to be responsible for two of peruvian while consort be instructed to take one piece condition thought to must have be more favourable to enterprise so far a must make out suspicion have be aroused that chilians be in vicinity night be dark town seemed to be asleep in fact enemy appeared to be indulging in feeling of security from must awake too late order be now passed for launch to ease down to half speed so that sound of churning propeller might be le perceptible three boat crept forward almost in complete silence upon prey jim must now plainly make out brig rig of monitor huascar three mast single funnel of corvette union two ship intended to account for with own torpedo boat away to right close under fort about four hundred yard from huascar lay what looked like couple of other monitor have quite expected at least hoped to find one other monitor there manco capac not third for according to information received fourth ship must have be pilcomayo gunboat matter must be a easy to blow up ironclad monitor a gunboat jim ordered of other two torpedo boat to select one of monitor lying under fort while steamed toward vessel took to be huascar union after waiting about five minute to allow of other two launch getting close to objective jim inquired in low tone if be in readiness upon being informed that everything be prepared called in whisper to terry obeeara full speed ahead give ounce of steam can carry in response to command little steamer propeller suddenly started to revolve at tremendous rate under pressure of steam terry let into cylinder stern dipped several inch deeper into water with rippling noise like of tearing silk at bow darted toward nearest ship douglas took to be huascar must not have be more than five hundred yard away nearer nearer rushed men in bow craning neck eagerly forward to see where torpedo must strike jim in stern crouching over tiller holding boat bow fair square for middle of prey occurred to for moment a being rather curious that even now must detect sign of life aboard of peruvian ship for have fully calculated on launch being seen alarm raised ere have approached so close suspicion entered mind thanked lucky star that have be fortunate enough to catch enemy totally unprepared must make task so much easier now little steamer be quite close to peruvian monitor in few second more blow must be struck must send warship entire crew to bottom oh fool thought to not to take more care of ship be doomed nothing must now save success be within grasp five second more then three then two now spar with deadly torpedo be almost touching huascar side crash rending sound of ripping tearing timber awful crash came immediately afterward man in blanco encalada launch be hurled off foot thrown into bottom of boat overboard while little steamer bow rose bodily out of water until keel reached angle of almost forty five degree there stuck still quivering in timber from shock in second jim realised terrible truth by mean other peruvian have got wind of intended attack have placed stout boom of timber round ship be upon obstacle that chilian launch have charged at full speed running right up on to with force of blow remaining there immovable almost wreck jim first thought be of how to warn people in other two launch for if enemy have be prepared for attack in one quarter must certainly have taken same precaution in other ah yes there be several blue rocket in locker in stern sheet must serve to show that something have gone wrong might perhaps save others from similar mishap jim scrambled out of seat be just raising locker lid when long streak of flame burst from huascar side there be deafening thudding roar stream of machine gun bullet screeched hummed over head have indeed walked right into cunningly contrived trap peruvian have be on watch for whole time next minute there be dull roar away to starboard jim saw out of corner of eye huge column of water leap up with something dark poised upon top of in second realised that one at least of consort have be successful have torpedoed prey even before column of water have subsided there broke out crash of musketry aboard second monitor spark of fire sprang up in different part of quickly brightened into lurid glare showed that people be lighting beacon fire better to see who attacker might be whereabouts truly be chilians who have be taken by surprise not enemy what mess have made of too there be time now to think about other launch must have to look after for jim whole energy be now directed toward saving of own boat crew after first volley of machine gun fire from ship have attacked peruvian got aim right sent perfect hail of gatling nordenfeldt rifle bullet hurtling into wrecked launch so that men began to fall in direction beacon fire be also lighted in bow stern at amidships so that vivid red glare shed lurid radiance over everything within hundred yard by light douglas saw that ship have attacked be not huascar at be craft lying close to union be pair of old hulk roughly metamorphosed so a to resemble warship heavy barrier of floating timber have be thrown out round while have be armed with machine gun crowd of rifleman monitor corvette have escaped out of arica harbour to continue depredation elsewhere pilcomayo have probably gone with chilians have walked into cleverly set trap be paying dearly for mistake jim quickly recovered presence of mind springing out of launch while bullet whistled about ear started to examine boat in order to ascertain whether be still seaworthy soon discovered that although there be numerous hole in planking be above water line a luck must have although long piece of keel be gone have not started boat timber so far a must see now boy shouted if can get launch back into water may escape after who will lend hand men needed second bidding sprang to young leader assistance worked with energy of despair man after man fell under deadly hail of fire from hulk a fast a fell others took place until at last under furious exertion little steamer began to quiver then moved slightly backward off boom there be ominous cracking of timber for few second a part of splintered planking caught in obstruction then with rending tearing noise gave way launch slid into water of bay shipping ton two of over stern a splashed in be afloat once more must only come unscathed through inferno of bullet few remaining member of crew might even yet hope to escape at last into boat with cried jim into boat four men terry get to engine give steam can while others bale boat clear of water now four men went on be going to ask to help in very dangerous task be not going to leave ship with duty unfinished intend to torpedo at hazard cut loose that spar at once will place along boom in such way that torpedo touch ship side will then cut short length of fuse attach to explosive so that will burn for about minute will just give time to get out of reach before powder blow up will not leave peruvian sufficient to displace torpedo now then grapple hold of spar four men stand by to push together when give word be ready terry boy to go ahead with engine directly scramble on board for second delay may mean that will be blown to smithereens give that piece of fuse carlos there have fixed that up continued douglas a cut placed slow match in opening provided for now then together lift a jim gave word men gripped spar lifted pushed forward until pointed barrel like apparatus at further extremity touched ship side peruvian up above be by time aware of what chilians contemplated turned attention to men engaged upon dangerous task of fixing spar thus giving in launch welcome respite owing to hulk high bulwark great amount of sheer must not fire directly into jim party bullet plugged harmlessly into boom about yard behind chilians jim then ordered men to place weight upon spar having be done clambered nimbly along until came to torpedo then rearranged fuse struck match applied there immediately began violent splutter of spark accompanied by fizzing noise jim knew that power on earth must now avert imminent explosion like cat worked way backwards along spar bent heaved under weight until presently stood once more upon beam now there be time to waste gasped douglas a five men stood in shelter of hulk tall side must make rush together trust to getting aboard launch unhit if of be wounded wounded must remain where be for attempt at rescue will mean death of now then go a one man five brave fellow sprang forward hoping to reach launch before peruvian be ready for latter be on look out a men left shelter rifle machine gun cracked roared once more two men fell literally riddled with shot others scrambled aboard launch jim gasped out go ahead terry not moment too soon launch have not got more than fifty yard away when there be appalling explosion whole side of hulk seemed to fall bodily inward heeled over almost instantly plunged into depth of bay water of at once closed over dragging down living dead in fearful vortex created jim then sent up blue rocket to call other boat away for be hopeless to attempt anything farther that night hour later be rejoined just a day be dawning by almirante cochrane launch be almost in worse state than own brought word that two monitor have be manco capac atahualpa that hereschoff torpedo boat under juarez have blown up latter have be destroyed by manco capac three men only have be rescued from crew be on board cochrane boat have lost nearly three quarter of men taking round however attacking force have not done so badly having destroyed two thousand ton ironclad sunk hulk full of men gun with loss of one small torpedo boat seventeen men killed jim then gave order for wounded to be made a comfortable a possible under circumstance two launch continued journey back to fleet be reached about eight o'clock young man immediately made report to commodore latter who seemed to have mind of own then called council of officer to decide whether must enter bay destroy manco capac fort whether must take up pursuit of other three peruvian warship have eluded in so mysterious way be unanimously decided to pursue so a to prevent from doing further damage riveros therefore divided squadron into two part consisting of almirante cochrane blanco encalada in one division o'higgins loa mathias cousino in other one column consisting of three latter vessel be to steam hundred mile due westward then head south while admiral must proceed in same direction must keep close in along coast arrangement having be made captain returned to respective ship anchor be raised fleet separated into two division one going south direct other going west in first instance chapter nine battle of angamos although somewhat disappointed at failure to find peruvian fleet lying in arica bay men on board blanco encalada looked forward with pleasure of anticipation to time when must overtake marauding warship bring to action destroy commodore riveros offer of hundred peso to man who must first sight enemy only increased anxiety of flagship crew to fever heat men be to be found aloft upon look out at hour of day night have be made known too captain latorre who have be promoted to almirante cochrane have also offered similar reward man aboard blanco made up mind that ship must have honour of bringing peruvian to action leaving arica on th of october inshore squadron with flagship leading way steamed slowly down coast exploring nook cranny where enemy might by possibility be lurking for be evident that must have be hiding somewhere when chilians have steamed northward few day before sign of enemy be seen during day during next in on th fleet steamed into harbour of mejillones de bolivia in order to coal commodore riveros bearing in mind own attempt on peruvian at arica feeling convinced that fleet must be somewhere close at hand gave strictest order that men must be allowed to go ashore that patrol of steam launch must ply up down harbour whole night through in order to prevent attempt of similar tactic on part of enemy have also seen fit to express approval of manner in jim douglas have carried out task assigned to in arica bay therefore sent for to cabin informed young man that be to take command in blanco encalada launch of flotilla be to do patrol duty during night circumstance afforded jim utmost satisfaction emboldened to ask a favour terry obeeara must again be allowed to accompany to request riveros immediately acceded night came on with sign of enemy a mejillones be in bolivia have only very recently be occupied by chilians danger be almost a likely to come from direction of shore a from sea a port be full of bolivian peruvian refugee who must stop at nothing to effect destruction of part of chilian fleet a soon a dusk began to fall launch of two ironclad be hoisted out crew picked at half past six jim friend terry took place in flagship boat steamed off slowly in one direction round harbour while of almirante cochrane started under easy steam in opposite direction launch be provided with gatling gun in bow crew be armed with rifle revolver order have be given that strange craft upon failing to answer challenge must be fired into immediately occupied launch about hour running under easy steam to circumnavigate mejillones harbour jim boat have already made round five six time without suspicious circumstance occurring be beginning to feel very tired sleepy when about mile half away at northern extremity of bay fancied saw spark of light flare up for moment then go out suddenly a though hastily quenched be broad awake immediately with sense on alert strained eye into darkness for there be only very thin crescent moon shining in order to try to make out where light have come from what have caused terry whispered to chum who be sitting drowsily over little engine with starting lever loosely clutched in hand did catch sight of glimmer of light away there to northward just now light saw light replied terry suddenly pulling together did whereabouts be old boy continual going round round have become rather monotonous be afraid be very nearly asleep well be over in direction explained douglas pointing looked a though one have suddenly opened slide of dark lantern a quickly closed again however may of course only have be fancy for like have be frightfully sleepy for last two hour in case must hardly have be enemy for light be quite two mile away from ironclad must have be hallo though there be light again by jingo how quickly be travelling over water too here terry man wake up there be something amiss after go full speed ahead for be worth that light be heading straight for blanco encalada if must be enemy boat be carrying will have work cut out to intercept before reach flagship wonder whereabouts cochrane launch be must be of great assistance to now get knot can out of engine old man for fear foul play terry obeeara needed second bidding for also have caught sight of swiftly moving point of light circumstance reminded very forcibly of own attempt to torpedo peruvian fleet lying in arica bay pushed over regulator to top notch started weary stoker to task of shovelling on coal with possible dispatch tiny screw revolved faster faster churning frothing water up astern launch darted away like greyhound slipped from leash seaman handled rifle revolver to make sure that be loaded opening closing breach with smart click while men in charge of gatling gun moved up forward close to weapon trained up down from side to side to assure that mechanism be in perfect working order for few second douglas heart seemed to stand still with anxiety for appeared a though launch must not be able to intercept rapidly moving spark of light be now convinced belonged to torpedo boat before reached blanco encalada for ship boat be undoubtedly heading little by little a soon a engine got into swing launch drew ahead after about ten minute steaming jim saw that must all being well cross stranger bow before reached flagship launch be showing light torpedo boat if such be be still too far away for hail to reach jim be therefore in hope of taking by surprise ordered men to maintain perfect silence to be ready to open fire directly gave word closer closer two converging craft swept toward other until barely quarter of mile separated then just at critical moment when jim be about to shout challenge across water accident happened have well nigh proved disastrous for chilians seaman who have remained behind in cockpit be ordered to go forward join crew of gatling gun be now discovered be one man short in clambering along narrow strip of deck ran round little steamer man stumbled dropped rifle unluckily weapon fell muzzle downward fixed bayonet dropped edgewise into tiny crank pit there be sudden shock noise of cracking metal screw ceased revolving with jerk shook launch from stem to stern while way of course fell off immediately caramba ejaculated jim keeping one eye fixed upon spark of light be now rapidly travelling past if ca put machinery right in two minute then good bye to blanco quick terry be there hope do think asked dropping on one knee beside chum who have already shut off steam be crouching over machinery wait bit jim replied terry working away like madman with spanner screw wrench if can loosen nut can disconnect bent rod replace in jiffy young man heaved strained at spanner with perspiration dripping off forehead must not get refractory nut to turn stout steel handle quivered under strain terry muscle stood out on bare arm like whipcord still nut must not budge in second jim threw strength into balance spanner showed sign of slipping round nut next second flew round nut gave at last be then only few second work to take out bent rod replace with new one suspected torpedo boat have by time drawn ahead of launch jim however be not sort of man to say die at quick word of command boat leaped forward once more after enemy under increased pressure of steam due to stoppage actually began to gain upon chase douglas put hand to mouth sent sharp challenge ringing across water toward be immediately followed by slight commotion aboard suspected peruvian showed that hail have be heard there be sign of stopping indeed next second strong volume of flame gushed up from funnel proved that engineer have shovelled on more coal turned on forced draught jim almost groaned in agony of mind for seemed a though accident to launch have doomed flagship to destruction be just about to order men to fire gatling gun at dimly seen shape in hope of hitting despite fact that smoke must hide chase from when saw long steel coloured shape glide past bow of own boat heart gave great thump at sight for knew that have have narrow escape from death torpedo boat be not carrying spar torpedo be towing infernal machine doubtless meant to drag under flagship bow be one of newly invented lay torpedo terrible weapon when effectively used alarm at own narrow escape be swamped in feeling of relief for safety of blanco encalada for torpedo boat must be obliged to manoeuvre little to get torpedo into place thus there be just chance that might yet be able to intercept in second have whirled wheel hard over be off along peruvian wake telling men to keep bright look out for torpedo to commence firing in direction of torpedo boat then quick metallic clatter of gatling broke out mingled with whip like crack of rifle darkness be illuminated by vivid flash of flame from peruvian series of hoarse scream oath yell told plainly enough that chilians have made good practice that at least of hailing bullet have found billet craft be too surely drawing away became question whether even now launch must be in time to save blanco encalada suddenly jim perceived speck of fire break out aboard flagship quickly broke into great glow of flame heaved sigh of relief be almost sob for knew that people have taken alarm from firing be prepared in few second beacon fire spread lurid glare wide over water of bay peruvian torpedo boat be plainly disclosed to view together with phosphorescent glimmer indicated position of deadly torpedo now men cried young englishman now be chance while light last train gun on torpedo fire at until hit rifleman do same remember that blanco safety depends upon shooting ay ay sir responded chilians second later gatling in bow began to chatter out deadly message while seaman rapidly loaded fired rifle in hope of destroying infernal machine before must reach blanco encalada try a might seemed impossible to hit fish like object dashed through water ahead of twice chilians have hit torpedo boat helmsman twice have be replaced while shriek came from boat testified to execution inflicted upon crew still be creeping nearer nearer to flagship crew of be vainly trying to depress muzzle of great gun sufficiently to reach peruvian few more short second be needed for latter to complete fell work then in moment end came jim did not know how happened whether be due to own men to on board flagship bullet struck torpedo fair square next instant there be stunning concussion water between pursuer pursued seemed to be blown into great hollow sphere side of then rushed together again while tall column of water heaped up fully thirty foot into air to collapse into spray drenched to skin man in torpedo boat in launch wild cheer broke out on board chilian launch blanco encalada men now turned attention to destroy wasp have just be deprived of sting moment that towed torpedo have exploded be practically powerless for injury turned nose seaward at once hoping by desperate rush to get clear away so doubtless must have not be for launch belonging to almirante cochrane craft have like jim boat several time made circuit of bay be away down at south end of harbour when lieutenant in charge first heard sound of firing immediately guessed cause putting engine at full speed raced along toward spot where must see rifle flashing before have gone very far have blanco encalada beacon fire to help a launch came rushing along toward consort jim blew steam whistle three time to attract attention be only just in nick of time for peruvian must have be in front of cochrane launch in half minute like hawk upon prey cochrane boat dashed forward commander determining to hazard in one stroke instead of using gun aimed straight for point torpedo boat must pas in few second went ahead full speed impact be so violent that peruvian torpedo boat collapsed like eggshell cochrane launch driving right over wreck without doing very serious injury torpedo boat boiler exploded a sank probably killed remaining man among crew for not single living being be to be found when chilians proceeded to search for survivor exciting little episode over jim consort resumed patrol of harbour until daylight when long trying vigil ceased ship finished coaling by five o'clock in afternoon of new day immediately stood out to sea much to douglas relief for felt that night like last must have be too much for once outside harbour two ironclad turned head to south again riveros made signal that antofagasta be to be next port of call be be on th of october when jim be awakened by stentorian cry from deck of two ship ahead galvanised into alertness listened intently heard officer of watch calmly reply where away there be short pause then seaman answered three point on port bow be hull down there be two column of smoke approaching at great speed from south east be about twelve mile away so far a can make out be just abreast of point angamos jim did not wait to hear reply of very good keep eye on smoke report further development jumped into clothes hurried up on deck just in time to hear bugle call hand on deck clear ship for action be quite evident that smoke must not be coming from second chilian division for in case there must have be three column of smoke instead of two therefore stranger must scarcely be other than long sought for peruvian ship huascar union few second after bugle have sounded men came tumbling up on deck full of excitement at idea of fight with many jovial laugh jest hurried away to quarter jim made round saw that men be at station that gun be ready run out that plenty of ammunition have be supplied to turret then reported to first lieutenant that ship be clear for action first lieutenant at once made report to captain who in turn reported to commodore riveros who have already entered conning tower several signal be made to almirante cochrane be steaming about cable length astern two ship surged forward in silence to encounter be to seal fate of peru to destroy sea power to go down to history a battle of angamos jim be wandering from gun to gun seeing that everything be in order waiting for action to commence when heard roar of anger execration coming from deck above running up from below saw that ship be huascar union that have turned tail having evidently discovered proximity of chilians be steaming to southward a fast a must go commodore riveros have anticipated such action a blanco encalada owing to foul bottom must only steam about eight knot sent forward in chase of peruvian cochrane be capable of nearly eleven knot latorre ship instantly leaped forward at full speed upon signal being made jim soon observed through telescope that cochrane be good deal faster than peruvian that must inevitably overtake in few hour time riveros also sent word down to engine room staff that very last knot be to be got out of ship effect of increased steam pressure be soon observable on blanco at about quarter to eight there be change of tactic on part of peruvian corvette union up to time have be keeping station on huascar port quarter suddenly slowed down passed under stern turned to eastward made for arica under full head of steam jim douglas immediately reported occurrence to commodore riveros who after debating for minute two a to whether not must follow corvette finally decided in favour of pursuing huascar a be more formidable craft of two chilian ironclad accordingly be kept on previous course jim then returned to post kept glass fixed upon flying steamer in front of hardly have taken up position again when saw huascar put helm over head to northward steaming toward cochrane chilian flagship second later saw brilliant flash of flame leap from huascar turret there be huge cataract of spray a shot struck water midway between herself cochrane then cloud of greyish green smoke spouted up on board chilian vessel showing that shell have exploded on board somewhere about bow almirante cochrane did not reply for several minute silent grim a death held steadily on course toward monitor then when have approached to within distance of little over mile in turn opened fire with forward turret gun on huascar battle of angamos have begun in real earnest effect of projectile on board peruvian be terrible for shell struck on port bow penetrated armour exploded inside hull thus temporarily jammed turret track covered deck with debris jim closed up telescope with snap made way to forward turret of blanco encalada to ascertain how long must be before gun captain thought might effectively open fire for be most anxious to share in combat before be over at moment officer in fire top shouted news that range have now lessened to yard word be immediately given to fire forward turret gun moment later there be terrific gush of white flame cloud of fleecy smoke tremendous roar a gun spoke simultaneously followed by hoarse screaming roar a shell sped through calm morning air toward mark missile struck on unarmoured portion of huascar bow pierced through through without exploding however a thickness of steel penetrated be insufficient to detonate projectile peruvian at once replied with shot from pounder struck blanco navigating bridge blew to piece meanwhile cochrane have by time circled round be running on course parallel to of monitor at same time driving toward consort so that unfortunate ship be now between two fire crash crash roared gun a two chilian ironclad converged upon quarry so excellent be gunnery that shot told hour after action have commenced huascar tiller chain be shot away at once yawed to starboard almost in track of cochrane captain latorre instantly saw that be opportunity to ram accordingly sent ship straight at helpless huascar aberration of peruvian ship course introduced element of uncertainty defied calculation result be that cochrane dashed past stern missing by short five yard now blanco encalada closed in on other side of doomed ship be already on fire in several place from disastrous effect of chilian shell pounded mercilessly while peruvian on other hand fought sorely pressed ship with desperate gallantry excited utmost admiration of opponent in face of perfect inferno of fire rove new tiller rope be to purpose shell from blanco fired by jim own hand exploded immediately afterwards in stern killing man at relieving tackle causing now almost wrecked ship again to fall out of control be at moment that shell from cochrane exploded right inside huascar conning tower blew gallant peruvian admiral one of lieutenant to piece be clear that peruvian be beaten yet several brave spirit strove desperately to regain control of ship if might be break away to northward get clear be too late for shell have already exploded in engine room have penetrated one of boiler lieutenant garezon sole remaining peruvian officer then called brief council of war at be resolved to sink ship rather than yield order be accordingly sent to macmahon chief engineer to open injection valve thus flood vessel even a scotsman set about task number of peruvian seaman ran forward waved white cloth towel in token of surrender chilian fire immediately ceased of course battle be even yet not quite over for down below in seclusion of engine room be not known that men on deck have surrendered engine be still kept moving chilians therefore reopened fire blanco encalada rushed up close alongside now fast sinking monitor intending to ram be stayed in deadly purpose by exhibition of fresh signal of surrender at length boat manned by lieutenant engineer half dozen seaman four soldier be dispatched from cochrane to go on board take possession of huascar met with resistance jim who in boat from blanco have also boarded at once rushed below just in time to prevent peruvian engineer from sinking ship little longer delay must have be too late for huascar have already nearly two foot of water over engine room floor when rushed in revolver in hand many of shot hole in hull be by time flush with water edge at point of pistol drove macmahon other engineer away from valve closed battle of angamos be over at last huascar men be then secured prize crew placed on board under escort of almirante cochrane blanco encalada went under own steam into harbour of mejillones where be temporarily patched up rendered more le seaworthy two day later three ship left in company for valparaiso where arrived on th of october amid salute of fort frantic cheer of populace who be thankful beyond measure to be freed from menace of huascar have felt might attack of seaport during absence of chilian fleet commodore riveros be promoted to be rear admiral captain latorre to be commodore jim be made first lieutenant of blanco encalada chapter ten gun runner ovation accorded to victorious chilians upon return to valparaiso be enthusiastic in extreme officer be everywhere feted made much of jim douglas terry obeeara came in for very large share of attention owing to fact that be british sympathy of great britain have be decidedly turned in favour of chili by atrocity have be committed by peruvian fleet in war against commerce by english ship have suffered to very serious extent after battle of angamos commodore rather admiral a be now riveros have be greatly exercised in mind a to what course must pursue with regard to corvette union have effected escape before battle commenced when last seen be steaming in direction of most southerly port peruvian possessed be very heavily armed ship be nearly if not quite a formidable a huascar have be thus still constituted standing menace to unfortified port of chili riveros be in quandary for already have more work on hand than knew how to deal with yet chilians resident in coast port be clamouring for to proceed to sea again hunt down cruiser did not in least know where to look for must by most diligent inquiry gain intelligence of might be at one of numerous peruvian port be to go in search of must quite probably slip past again in night a monitor have once before done fleet have be lying at valparaiso for nearly month undergoing repair refit of so sorely stood in need when one morning jim from station on blanco encalada bridge where be on duty observed signal flying from official residence of secretary for war in moment have glass to eye began to spell out signal when completed ran a follows blanco encalada admiral riveros to call here without delay have important order for hallo thought jim what be in wind now more work for somebody will be bound wonder whether union have be up to fresh trick have kept remarkably suspiciously quiet for time now then young man made way down to admiral cabin delivered message with result that admiral barge be piped away five minute later riveros be being pulled across sparkling blue water of bay to learn what be that senor baquedano wanted to communicate to several hour elapsed before gallant chilian returned aboard when finally did so first action be to send for jim douglas request to accompany to cabin arrived there admiral closed door locked then leaning across table toward douglas remarked in low tone senor douglas be paying empty compliment when say that consider remarkably efficient promising young officer have carried out with utmost credit to yourself several exceedingly difficult piece of work for reason be going to detail for service suspect will prove even more difficult than have yet be called upon to perform jim bowed did best not to look too pleased a of course be aware continued admiral smiling lost sight of union corvette before battle of angamos a have more important business on hand at moment be not able to pursue consequently got clear away chilians in coast town have for time be living in mortal dread of appearing fine day off one of port bombarding for week past have be daily expecting order to sail in pursuit of to hunt down have however until to day have definite news of whereabouts upon must work afternoon be summoned ashore informed by excellency general baquedano that peruvian be expecting several cargo of arm from europe have be informed by one of spy that union have be dispatched to mouth of strait of magellan to convoy vessel to callao peruvian port be bound for if then dispatch vessel down to strait be almost certain to fall in with corvette bring to action if be lucky may also secure arm carrying vessel must of course be in service of inestimable value to government since if enemy can not obtain arm ammunition will soon be obliged to give up struggle to make long story short senor douglas be man whom have selected to perform difficult arduous decidedly dangerous task have recently purchased steamer have armed so powerfully that be to intent purpose cruiser will be given command of task be a have just explained to hunt down destroy union if possible to capture gun running steamer have be sent to convoy new cruiser of ours have be named angamos in honour of recent victory will look confidently to to uphold honour of name be quite ready to sail must commission to morrow sail same day be very important service for so young man a from what have already seen of be confident of ability to bring task to successful termination be think have to say to senor douglas except must wish to do so have permission to number friend young engineer among crew now good day young sir best of good luck to jim saluted in silence feeling rather at loss to know what to say by way of thanks marched out of cabin a proud a dog with two tail have never anticipated anything like when entered chilian service news seemed almost too good to be true yet speedily pulled together hurried off to find friend obeeara whom came across in cabin smoking to whom promptly imparted joyful news hour later two lad have packed up slender stock of baggage be quite ready for new adventure bearing in mind admiral order that must lose time in getting new command ready for sea jim accompanied by chum went round of flagship saying good bye to numerous friend who betrayed little curiosity a to reason of englishman somewhat sudden departure jim thought best to keep own counsel only enlightened chilians so far a to say that friend have be selected for special service nature of be not at liberty to disclose shore boat be then signalled for upon arrival alongside two lad got into have baggage conveyed ashore where chartered boat in be rowed out to angamos object of double journey be to keep a far a possible movement secret having arrived on board jim found that everything be in readiness for start except for fact that certain store have not yet come off from shore mustered crew aft however proceeded to read commission to appointment to command be received with cheer of delight for crew be made up for most part of men drafted from other ship of squadron consequently either knew jim personally have heard something of exploit therefore knew what sort of commander be sailing under looked forward to lively adventurous cruise douglas then sent purser few men ashore to hurry up belated store by midnight everything everybody be on board ship ready remembering admiral riveros order a to sailing on morrow waited until daybreak then signalled that everything be in readiness for departure inquired whether be admiral pleasure that must sail at once answer promptly came back that sooner sailed better jim ordering saluting gun to be manned loaded made way with proud step to navigating bridge rang engine to half speed ahead anchor having already be got up there be responsive tinkle from bridge telegraph at young commander smiled for recognised in long continued response hand of mr terence obeeara slight tremor thrilled through hull a screw began to revolve shipping in harbour drifted slowly astern a fine ton cruiser gathered way threaded path out of anchorage then a passed blanco encalada gun roared out salute tempest of cheer burst out on board flagship a crew recognised who be be standing on cruiser bridge jim must see glance of astonishment questioning look writ large upon face of recent companion angamos be past flagship in about minute jim then put engine at full speed cruiser have only very recently be built be capable of steaming at rate of fourteen knot consequently be at least two knot faster than union ship be being sent to hunt down very soon covered length of harbour vanished from sight of fleet beyond punta angeles although from information in jim possession be to be supposed that union be by time several day steam ahead of be yet by mean certain where really be be quite within bound of possibility that might sight at moment douglas therefore took precaution to have man in fore topmast crosstrees with instruction to keep eye wide open to report three masted one funnelled steamer might happen to put in appearance fresh man be sent aloft two hour since weather be hot be distinctly irksome to be obliged to remain aloft exposed to full glare of sun for length of time moreover jim kept man at masthead day night there be therefore absolutely chance of union being missed must come within twenty mile from angamos for man with powerful telescope must be able to cover at least distance from cruiser fore topmast head despite strict look out maintained aboard angamos day passed without sign of union making appearance gun running vessel jim did not expect to meet until several day after arrival off strait of magellan must not quite understand not having yet sighted peruvian corvette past concepcion swept on afternoon of second day out from valparaiso then past valdivia still there be sign of enemy then childe island be dropped astern on fifth day out at about two o'clock in afternoon cape pillar at north end of desolation island entrance to strait be sighted sea be still bare of ship of have come in search still a jim remembered union be very fast boat only two knot slower than angamos herself thought not improbable that might be found lurking somewhere among numerous island make navigation of magellan strait so difficult dangerous young skipper therefore took cruiser into little creek inlet that came to in hope of finding quarry there if water be too shoal sent away boat expedition to explore still there be sign of union week after leaving angamos dropped anchor off punta arena jim went ashore to interview governor of port in forlorn hope that might have seen peruvian pas have heard something of whereabouts then douglas received surprise little expected found senor morale governor in state of great perturbation that worthy man have body of only forty men under command to garrison place gave jim astonishing news that union with brazen effrontery have called in at punta arena very morning that skipper taking armed force ashore with have seized morale placed town under contribution for supply of coal quantity of provision needed there be resisting averred unhappy governor for peruvian numbered quite eighty men be fully armed while corvette gun be trained on town so that in event of resistance being offered must have brought place about ear to make long story short said governor union have coaled taken in supply of provision of have be paid for by way have steamed off down strait to eastward not three hour before chilian cruiser have hove in sight be quite sure that el senor capitan must catch scoundrel if sailed at once moreover carnicero have have audacity to boast that be going to convoy two cargo of arm be coming from europe back to peru that must return through strait that must knock town to piece a went past a payment for article that have received jim ground teeth with anger upon hearing recital of insolence vowed must find union must make captain villavicencio eat word unfortunately angamos be short of coal fresh water several hour very precious hour be spent in getting necessary on board so that be already dark before douglas finally got away having promised governor that must do in power to prevent peruvian from carrying out threat union be by time good many mile ahead navigation of tortuous intricate channel with furious current be not thing to be undertaken at great speed at night consequently douglas be obliged to crawl slowly along at about five knot hour with two leadsmen in fore chain at very time when wanted to be steaming fourteen feared that union must have got lengthy start while daylight lasted that must be very difficult matter indeed to overhaul there be just one hope for reflected that must almost certainly wait at eastern entrance of strait for convoy if be there must find bring to action moment daylight dawned jim whose nerve be by time torn to fiddle string by frequent necessary stoppage during night put vessel at full speed again still with two leadsmen sounding whole time angamos swept along narrow water finally emerging at argentine end of strait fresh disappointment be however in store for young englishman for still there be sign of corvette now did not in least know in what direction to look for finally after cruising to fro off entrance for hour in hope of sighting chase determined to reach over toward falkland island in hope that union might have gone there to meet convoy angamos have by about midnight on next night traversed close upon distance to island jim be almost beginning to despair of ever catching elusive corvette when hail came down from one of men who be still stationed at masthead light ahead bearing about point on port bow douglas heart jumped here surely must be craft of be in search have to wait few second to control excitement then replied how far distant be light what doe look like be about eight mile distant replied seaman look like light at ship masthead can now see two red light one over other arranged just below white one must say that three of shown together a be mean signal of sort for can see port starboard light showing in usual place aha thought jim be not so bad after approaching craft can hardly be friend union must think be more likely that will prove to be one of gun running steamer if so well career a gun runner will close somewhat abruptly think masthead ahoy what be now continued aloud a seaman aloft gave excited yell immediately suppressed why sir fellow answered have just sighted second set of light almost dead astern of first lot have just moment opened there be certainly two steamer approaching sir ah one of have just sent up rocket expect be because have sighted then by jingo soliloquised englishman will be gun runner mistake about how wish knew what light have be arranged for union to show a signal to however so can not be helped aloud went on addressing excited chilian at masthead keep eye on ship pedro report change to at once ay ay sir replied man be still coming way then jim called up lieutenant young fellow named manuel instructed to get ship immediately cleared for action to douse single one of light on board at once then went back to bridge a soon a light on board have be extinguished ordered quartermaster at wheel to turn ship head eight point to starboard thus few minute later angamos be running at full speed on course at right angle to previous one be leaving gun runner on port quarter douglas still continued to watch light intently soon perceived that failure to give signal of sort have occasioned quick suspicion to skipper for gradually slowed up presently light drew close together by jim must guess that steamer have run alongside other to permit of conference between two captain few minute later jim turned angamos eight point to port bringing back to old course at distance of about four mile from supposed gun runner held on in direction until be well astern of then circled right round headed straight after immediately in wake at full speed after pause of about quarter of hour peruvian skipper again went ahead on old course doubtless much perturbed in mind at sudden extraordinary disappearance of craft short time before have seemed to be coming directly toward so simple be that did not suspect jim subsequent move went straight ahead keeping light burning a before thus be able to keep in full view although must not see probably never occurred to of to cast single glance astern jim have reckoned on suspected steamer being slower than own cruiser soon saw that be steaming about three knot to two overhauling fast lieutenant have time ago reported ship a cleared for action look out aloft stated that there be other sail in sight consequently jim reckoned on bringing enemy to book in about hour time dealing summarily with before union must complicate matter by putting in appearance prospect caused little satisfaction a felt that might have have work cut out to deal effectively with three have corvette be opposed to at same time angamos vibrating from stem to stern under rapid revolution of screw plunged along through black night while three mile ahead guiding light shone out clearer clearer moment hour passed cruiser be very very near so near indeed that jim must plainly hear throbbing of gun runner machinery must also have caught sound of for suddenly saw rocket rush up into still night air directly afterwards red glow began to hover over top of funnel showing that be trying to increase speed by coaling up furiously be of use gun runner only gained very few minute grace angamos be much too fast ship for few minute later ranged up on starboard side of sternmost steamer while jim seizing speaking trumpet hailed at top of voice what ship be heave to wish to speak to chapter eleven captain villavicencio catch tartar for space of quite minute there be reply then in response to jim repeated summons steamer a if by previous arrangement began to send blue rocket flying into air while set up most unearthly shrieking on steam whistle have by time recognised that suspicious stranger be not union knowing that must be somewhere in vicinity determined to attract attention by mean other must be anywhere within sight hearing jim smiled grimly to a saw heard despairing effort for have kept man at masthead for express purpose of ascertaining whether peruvian corvette be anywhere in vicinity last report received le than five minute before assured that be nowhere to be seen waited patiently therefore until discordant blast on siren have ceased then hailed again for skipper to heave to vowing that must fire into if did not do so young englishman have imagined that saw by light of rocket number of men scampering about deck concluded that be merely effect of terror astonishment be totally unprepared for gun runner next move fellow have when saw that there be hope of escape hastily prepared ship for action last word be hardly out of jim mouth when perfect storm of machine gun fire broke out aboard flying steamer bullet whistled round douglas like hail killing quartermaster at wheel several other seaman who be not under shelter cruiser immediately yawed wildly in minute must have crashed into gun runner probably sending craft to bottom have not jim seized wheel a spun out of dead man finger brought angamos back to course just in nick of time at same moment saw leading steamer circle round in wide curve head directly for evidently with idea of helping consort in fight against chilian there be time for more palaver thought fellow meant to fight to disable if must must be ready for in voice hoarse with anger at useless slaughter of five of men gave order to fire immediately gun of angamos began to speak be armed with several gatling nordenfeldt gun three pounder breech loader six pounder one inch breech loading armstrong gun throwing projectile weighing pound be mounted forward immediately upon jim command whole broadside crashed out raking foolhardy steamer from end to end making fairly reel under impact of iron shower away forward manuel first lieutenant have observed approach of second steamer now laid big inch gun directly for bow firing when have approached to within about four hundred yard of cruiser gun deep roar rang out loud above din of smaller weapon brilliant flash of white light leaped out on board steamer missile blowing huge hole in starboard bow setting on fire forward a be seen by blaze at once sprang up on board her at same time angamos passed ahead of first steamer by light of beacon fire now lighted aboard three vessel be seen to be named miraflores running alongside second huemul delivered gun of starboard broadside bringing down steel foremast riddling funnel with rifle machine gun bullet killing man on deck who be not under cover at same time pounder shell struck heap of ammunition have be placed on huemul deck to feed pounder breech loader blew up whole lot killing unfortunate gun crew lifting gun bodily over side into sea angamos then slowed down little few second later miraflores overtook discharged available gun into cruiser killing several more men dismounting one pounder two pounder quick firing gun cruiser people have meanwhile again loaded gun on port broadside be not slow in avenging death of comrade did not require stimulus jim sought to impart to by urging in excitement to slap into beggar for worked gun like demon notwithstanding rage fury made such excellent practice that miraflores began to look more more like wreck minute at last in desperation captain actually tried to run ship aboard angamos with idea of boarding cruiser be several knot faster than gun runner jim perceiving fellow intention turned angamos to starboard so avoided collision at same time pouring in broadside with undamaged gun instantly there arose dense cloud of steam on board miraflores accompanied by loud hissing noise speed suddenly slackened douglas knew that one of cruiser shell have penetrated boiler shuddered in spite of at thought of scene be now probably enacting down in gun runner engine room just a be looking at stricken ship through glass to see whether have surrendered be deafened well nigh stunned by appalling explosion came from somewhere astern of angamos piece of wood iron fragment of charred human body exploding cartridge wreckage of description began to hurtle round ear while from shelter of chart house to precipitately retreated saw enormous column of black smoke hanging over place near have last seen huemul have little difficulty in accounting to for disaster steamer have be set on fire forward by one of cruiser shell have exploded quantity of ammunition on deck fire rapidly spreading have communicated to of powder cartridge formed greater part of cargo have forthwith exploded in turn blown up remainder causing most terrible catastrophe for when smoke of explosion cleared away there be not trace of huemul left upon surface of water gallant crew have be blown literally to atom appalled by suddenness extent of disaster miraflores angamos ceased firing for several minute by light of fire be still burning on board vessel jim must see gun runner crew dashing wildly about a though in last extremity of terror while ship herself be almost shrouded from view by dense cloud of steam coloured ruddy yellow in light of brazier still gushed in volume from pierced boiler cruiser men quickly recovered equanimity however running to gun poured in broadside upon demoralised crew of miraflores be more apparently than flesh blood must endure for douglas saw several men immediately rush upon captain who be still inciting to continue fight cut unfortunate man down crew then rushed aft in body hauled down peruvian flag under ship have be sailing hailed at same time that surrendered begged for quarter men frantically waved handkerchief towel in fact anything white that must lay hand upon to emphasise fact that have struck detest being obliged to give quarter to mutineer said douglas to young first lieutenant fellow undoubtedly be such for murdered captain surrendered against wish must accept surrender suppose a must simply be murder to continue firing into now be half crazy with fright have port starboard quarter boat manned lowered senor manuel if please bring off crew of ship take precaution of first putting in iron after have transferred to angamos will put prize crew aboard under command will keep company until return to valparaiso have little plan at back of mind hope to be able to put into execution will tell what be before finally go aboard miraflores now be a quick a can for there have be good deal of firing during action union may put in appearance at moment wish to see just yet manuel saluted ran away aft to give order about boat five minute later be being pulled across water toward now motionless gun runner jim saw manuel climb up tall side then went into chart house to await lieutenant return to think out detail of plan about have spoken to manuel however first sent man into fore topmast crosstrees one into main with order to keep bright look out for appearance of peruvian corvette two hour later manuel returned bringing with whole of peruvian ship crew most of whom consisted of ne'er do well of almost nationality under sun choice looking lot of rascal be jim wisely refused to accept parole of of placed still in iron in cruiser punishment cell took precaution to post strong guard over then received report of lieutenant be to effect that damage on board miraflores be with exception of shell in boiler room mostly superficial must soon be repaired by prize crew several of gun have be badly damaged young man suggested that must be replaced together with damaged weapon belonging to angamos from gun runner cargo consisted in part of number of similar piece jim carefully digested report then unfolded latest plan to manuel be to effect that miraflores with prize crew aboard angamos must impersonate two peruvian gun runner expected by union that must hoist enemy flag go in search of thus getting close enough to bring elusive corvette to action lieutenant be therefore ordered to get aboard at once with prize crew execute necessary repair re arm ship out of cargo carried a boiler be too badly damaged to admit of repair at sea to cut off steam from altogether fire up under remaining three must even then give miraflores speed of about nine knot manuel accordingly selected crew again went aboard gun runner where men worked with such will by mid day repair be complete enough to allow of start being made remaining repair be of such nature that be possible to execute while ship be under way steam be then raised in three sound boiler water being quite miraflores be brought alongside cruiser then replaced damaged gun hoisted fresh one out of gun runner hold with own derrick at length by five o'clock in afternoon of day after battle ship be in condition to proceed much to jim satisfaction there have be sign of union to disturb be now ready to go in search of with two well armed ship under command douglas swore that must pay captain villavicencio in full for injury that have done in past to chilian commerce peruvian flag be then hoisted aboard ship also arranged three lantern upon foremast for use after dark in same manner a have be previously arranged a signal on board gun runner before starting jim also questioned captured crew a to what knew of plan of skipper where have expected to meet union men refused information at first upon being told that must be kept upon half ration until chose to speak said that have expected to meet corvette almost midway between falkland island cape virzins at eastern mouth of strait also that captain have mistaken angamos for union when first sighted jim must not understand how be that in case there be sign of corvette determined not to leave locality until have found brought to action with miraflores steaming along in wake in same formation a adopted by gun running steamer jim started off on search for union heading west south west for mouth of strait of magellan with man at masthead of of two vessel prize of fifty peso to seaman who must first sight did not feel altogether happy at idea of sailing under peruvian flag adopting such ruse even for short period order to capture sink union be precise imperative considered that in case at least end justified mean employed for knew that must never succeed in getting alongside corvette if captain be once allowed to entertain slightest suspicion that two ship be chilians true angamos be faster ship union drew far le water since must probably be found if found at somewhere among shoal water of strait might be able to get away by dodging into willow water among numerous island where angamos with deeper draught must be unable to follow darkness fell very shortly after two ship have started on run toward strait lantern on foremast be lighted after same manner a on previous night while surged along over indigo coloured water at rate of about nine knot hour sharp look out being maintained meanwhile for appearance of union to great disappointment of everybody craft most persistently refused to put in appearance when next morning dawned high rocky cliff of tierra del fuego patagonian coast lay before became evident that peruvian have retreated up strait that be still behind about nine o'clock two ship still flying peruvian colour entered strait immediately slowed down to half speed not only on account of intricate navigation also to give union better chance of overtaking if must happen that really be still astern catharine point be passed left behind two steamer crossed lomas bay into first narrow where jim thought possible that union might be waiting be not there be steaming slowly across elizabeth bay douglas be beginning to fear that corvette have eluded after when voice hoarse with excitement hailed from aloft on deck there can see three masthead showing above hummock of rock at entrance to second narrow there be column of smoke visible too so craft must be steamer will open out in few minute now think must be that detestable corsair be looking for jim be a usual on navigating bridge when hail floated down first act be to seize speaking trumpet shout news to manuel on bridge of miraflores second be to spring up ratline seat alongside seaman in crosstrees take good look at what must see of stranger from elevation prolonged scrutiny convinced that craft must be none other than union hurried down to give final order ship having be kept practically prepared for action ever since moment on evening before when started in company to look for corvette there be consequently very little to do in way of preparation quarter of hour after sighting peruvian masthead chilian ship be ready for fray have not steamed cable length when became evident that sharp look out must also have be kept aboard corvette for mast began to slide along top of ridge of rock showing that be under way few minute later entire ship swept into view flying peruvian ensign so leaving room to doubt that be long sought for union directly hove in sight jim signalled to miraflores to close up come alongside at distance of cable length away ship quickened up speed by such small degree a to be imperceptible to nine knot be a fast a cruiser consort must steam presently long dismal wail came floating across water from union douglas saw that wished to attract attention to signal have just hoisted at once dived into chart house for signal book presently second lieutenant be poring over in effort to read communication to jim intense annoyance signal when translated seemed to have meaning realised that corvette be making private pre arranged signal be of course unable to read confound aranjuez exclaimed angrily to second lieutenant what be to do now did not anticipate if be not careful will take alarm sheer off wish have thought of looking among paper of miraflores captain might have contained key to private signal well senor replied lieutenant must delay making signal of sort until very last moment then when show sign of becoming suspicious sheering off will hoist very slowly string of flag meaning nothing in particular will take little time to decipher flag will gain few minute while try to fathom meaning from own private signal book ought by time to be close enough to for to be able to open fire effectively if men will only keep calm shoot straight must fail to disable with first few shot however will be off may be unable to catch again precisely be best only thing can do aranjuez replied jim gazing steadily through telescope at union be not afraid of being unable to catch if will stick to deep water feel convinced that if take alarm will be certain to run for shoal water at once have got that bunting ready continued for if so have better run up string of flag seems to be slowing down a though did altogether like look quick bend on send up there that be not too fast now not too fast ah have begun to move again aranjuez hoist that signal farther if only keep a be going for ten minute will be under gun oh good luck good luck be coming along at full speed be dutchman jim be right union be coming along at full speed yet captain be not quite such fool a young man took to be have seen two chilians from masthead before have seen have be watching closely ever since with result that have arrived at conclusion that trick be being played on fell into error of mistaking cruiser for huemul of believing that crew of vessel corrupted by chilian gold have seized ship after murdering officer villavicencio therefore promptly made up mind to retake gun runner felt certain be no longer in peruvian hand since signal remained unanswered when have approached to within mile half of two chilian craft very much astonished jim douglas by opening fire upon with heavy inch bow gun although must not account for sudden commencement of hostility on part of union jim on own part have only be waiting for proper moment to open fire now in turn gave villavicencio most unpleasant surprise by returning fire with very much larger gun than peruvian imagined that huemul carried for few second skipper of union hesitated a to whether must not even now turn run for taken altogether matter seemed to be rather in nature of elaborately laid trap villavicencio now that admiral grau be dead be bravest man in naval service of peru hesitation be momentary continued to steam ahead at full speed put helm over to starboard causing corvette to swerve slightly to port thus presented whole starboard broadside to approaching chilians who now hauled down peruvian flag hoisted own ensign then a soon a broadside gun bore on enemy villavicencio fired storm of shot shell came flying round angamos consort hulling latter badly dismounting two of recently replaced pounder breech loader jim ground teeth a saw terrible execution wrought by union broadside exhorting men to keep cool ordered to load fire a fast a must once more cruiser inch gun roared out sending vengeful messenger shrieking toward corvette shell struck right at base of ship foremast there exploded scattering death destruction round huge spar remained upright for second two then swayed slightly forward to one side rigging have be badly cut up by fragment of flying shell suddenly parted mast went over side with crash be plainly audible aboard chilian ship high above crash of rending wood rang loud painfully clear agonised shriek of poor maimed wretch who have be crushed by fall now be time shouted jim be lumbered up with wreck of foremast will not be able to fire big gun until have cleared away fire into now with gun will bear keep at until strike miraflores ahoy pas under stern take up position on union port side when come level with will engage to starboard be style lad continued enthusiastically a couple of pounder shell exploded one on corvette navigating bridge other at base of conning tower be style keep up show how chilians fight peruvian skipper however be quicker in getting wreckage cleared away than jim have anticipated angamos have not fired many round before cumbersome spar be cut adrift went floating astern villavicencio got gun to work again recent disaster moreover have not disturbed aim for next inch shell fired by union blew away miraflores funnel killed helmsman with result that turned sharply to port with smoke flame sweeping along deck from cavity shell have blown in very narrowly escaped ramming angamos latter have by time approached to within mile of union now got machine gun to work mowing down peruvian who be not under cover a with scythe for deck of corvette be crowded with men after ten minute of furious bombardment with miraflores crawling slowly up to take part again in encounter villavicencio brave a be realised that have walked into trap have caught tartar for now recognised angamos for what really be cruiser something have happened to huemul be perfectly clear miraflores be also in chilian hand therefore considered that be not justified in risking union longer in engagement must have one ending considering fact that corvette be now only effective ship peruvian possessed in sadly depleted navy consequently put up helm describing wide sweep to port made off toward entrance to second narrow maintaining however well directed fire a went with inch stern gun weapon dropped shell with remarkable precision aboard cruiser consort jim have just signalled miraflores that be going to chase union that prize be to rendezvous at punta arena when event occurred made rendezvous a unnecessary a be impossible for second gun runner for a though determined to do damage possibly must before slipping away villavicencio have ordered number of broadside gun to be shifted aft to enable to maintain a heavy fire a possible from part of ship so rapidly did now fire from stern port that series of explosion looked almost like continuous sheet of flame while solid shot shell fell round chilian ship like hail miraflores have by time dropped about quarter of mile astern of angamos latter be gaining rapidly on corvette when union fired what be intended to be last shot shell from inch gun shell be saving of for having pierced unarmoured side of miraflores a though have be paper explosion took effect right among tightly packed ammunition case constituted cargo next second went into air a huemul have done with appalling roar followed by tremendous shower of kind of debris from very nature of explosion jim felt practically certain that one must possibly be left alive out of whole company yet there be nevertheless just one chance in thousand that there might be with groan of disappointment at being obliged to abandon chase of union turned ship round began to search for possible survivor found none few poor unrecognisable human remnant be rewarded for attempt at rescue after precious hour lost in way once more turned ship head went off at full speed after union that hour start have be sufficient for corvette have enabled to evade pursuit among numerous island dot strait douglas haunted strait for whole week searching nook corner of for peruvian union captain have done work well fugitive be nowhere to be found at length unwilling though be to give up search anxious not to lose time when angamos might be required for other more important work started back for headquarters arriving at valparaiso just month after have left have carried out one part of task be to prevent two cargo of arm from falling into hand of peruvian union still remained at large be destined to give chilians great deal more trouble before finally closed brilliant adventurous career chapter twelve bombardment of callao when jim reported to admiral be greatly gratified to find that chief be perfectly satisfied with way in have carried out task entrusted to although chilian very naturally regretted that young skipper of angamos have not be able to bring union to book fully recognised that douglas have done be possible commended judgment have displayed in bringing cruiser back to valparaiso instead of waiting about in strait of magellan on off chance of again encountering for a explained to douglas fleet be even then on point of leaving port to harry peruvian coast angamos be required to take part in work be also informed that captain castello must take charge of angamos on coming expedition that jim be for certain particular reason to return to blanco encalada in former capacity of first lieutenant of flagship admiral riveros also hinted that have in mind to depute to in near future difficult extremely important piece of work character of must fully explain to later circumstance be quite sufficient to compensate young man for disappointment may have temporarily felt at finding that be not to retain command of cruiser accordingly jim returned to flagship where be heartily welcomed by old comrade who informed that destination of squadron be thought to be callao that in probability chilians must bombard place then endeavour to take peruvian capital so that there promised to be plenty of excitement adventure in store for everybody at length preparation be completed on nd of april exactly week after jim have returned to valparaiso in angamos fleet consisting of blanco huascar angamos pilcomayo mathias cousino two torpedo boat guacolda janequeo left that port steaming out of bay headed to northward ship have of course be coaled provisioned at valparaiso have need to call in anywhere for store headed direct for callao be openly stated to be destination a soon a be out of harbour on april squadron arrived within couple of hour steam of peruvian port at three o'clock in afternoon of same day two torpedo boat under convoy of huascar went on ahead to scout arriving off port just about dusk lieutenant goni of guacolda rashly determined to make raid on peruvian shipping on own account accordingly slipped away into harbour toward place where enemy warship be known to be lying union be soon identified a one of ship lying at anchor goni promptly headed for when about mile distant from quarry torpedo boat accidentally ran down fishing smack drowning crew except three losing one of own torpedo spar be by time quite dark in confusion precise position of union have be lost goni having rescued three surviving fisherman forced to pilot to spot where corvette be lying only to discover when got close to that skipper have surrounded with boom undismayed by gallant chilian forthwith destroyed boom then discovered that have lost second spar consequently be unable to torpedo ship union then opened smart machine gun fire guacolda be compelled to beat retreat much to lieutenant goni annoyance unfortunately ill timed attack have put peruvian thoroughly on alert a soon a daylight appeared hauled fleet consisting of union rimac chalaco oroya atahualpa into shoal water behind breakwater of stone dock where be also talisman two hulk apurimac maranon have also several new torpedo boat a well a launch tug armed with spar torpedo with patrolled harbour to prevent repetition of attack like of guacolda admiral riveros be extremely angry with lieutenant goni when upon arrival off callao saw that possible preparation have be made for reception that further surprise be impossible that attack must now have to be made openly therefore called away barge under flag of truce visited senior peruvian naval officer for purpose of informing that callao be to be blockaded that since bombardment might at moment become necessary non combatant must at once leave town seek place of safety chilian also sent notice to effect to principal consular agent to senior foreign naval officer of neutral warship lying in road eight day being time allowed for neutral shipping foreigner generally to leave place upon representation of consul however that eight day be not enough admiral increased period of grace to ten day then set to work on task of making fleet ready for bombardment saw be inevitable defence of callao consisted for most part of series of battery arranged in crescent form round shore of bay at extreme south west point of land between bay of callao miraflores stood strongest peruvian battery called do de mayo have only very recently be constructed contained two inch ml rodman gun mounted on united state service iron carriage formidable weapon commanded nearly seven eighth of horizon tarapoca battery faced due south over chorillos bay contained two inch dahlgren gun a also did pierola battery facing callao bay next to pierola came torre del merced revolving turret mounting two inch rifled armstrong then came brick fort called santa rosa containing two inch rifled blakely gun castle very old ruinous structure only strength of consisted of two masonry tower have four inch rifled blakelies seven large bore gun be mounted on mole together with two small very ancient pounder at north end of town be fort ayacucho containing one inch dahlgren one inch blakely then came revolving turret with two inch armstrong finally sand bag battery named rimac mounted four inch dahlgren muzzle loader will thus be seen that chilian fleet must have work cut out if meant to take port of callao a first step toward capture of capital lima by april foreign merchant ship have gone away foreign warship have moved out of line of fire taken up position off mouth of rimac river about two mile to northward of port of callao be half past one o'clock pm on eventful day of april when admiral riveros hoisted signal on blanco encalada for fleet to weigh anchor stand over toward battery in readiness to engage few moment later clatter of chain cable be heard a men o ' war got anchor pilcomayo gunboat be first to move took up position north of middle of bay jim recent command cruiser angamos being next in line with huascar at south west extremity flagship to intense annoyance of crew be held in reserve men must not have grumbled at enforced idleness have known of what be in store for of jim in particular be never tired of speculating a to what be mysterious service riveros have hinted intention of employing upon longed for opportunity must enable to distinguish be roused from somewhat moody reverie by boom of great gun looking up saw cloud of white smoke hanging over huascar have be first ship to fire while brilliant flash of flame on board monitor atahualpa showed where death dealing shell have struck exploded angamos pilcomayo be not slow in chiming in presently air fairly vibrated with concussion of heavy gun for peruvian be now replying with seventeen large bore gun mounted in battery assisted by pivot gun of union several large smooth bore gun from of obsolete ship behind mole stone pier blanco encalada be theoretically beyond range of of enemy gun although several shell exploded in air near be never at time in least danger jim douglas with chum terry have splendid opportunity of witnessing bombardment at close quarter without taking risk of be so unappreciative of immunity that must have infinitely preferred ship to be in thick of fighting instead of lying safely out of range a be presently chilians found that be almost impossible to hit shipping behind mole from position have taken up a admiral riveros principal desire be to annihilate peruvian navy thus render peru harmless at sea signalled for huascar to move closer in to take up position more to north eastward signal be acknowledged presently monitor lifted anchor stood over still closer to mole maintaining terrific fire a went receiving inch dahlgren shell on water line a slight return for damage that be inflicting luckily be well provided with water tight bulkhead nothing must have saved for sea poured into in ton through huge hole shell have made in side nothing daunted however captain carlos condell man who have fought covadonga so splendidly be promoted through several ship to huascar continued to stand on until have approached to within mile of mole when dropped anchor opened still more furious destructive fire upon peruvian ship one well aimed shell set union on fire for few minute jim chum together with other man in chilian navy for matter thought hoped that famous ship have run course villavicencio be a have already be seen man of resource energy in hour have fire under control not so fortunate be school ship maranon although old be armed with newest weapon for instruction of naval men in gunnery though gun be of small calibre therefore of little use against thick armour of ironclad steamed out from behind mole replied heroically to huascar fire killing twelve men who be working monitor machine gun jamming one of turret track cutting one of anchor cable nearly wrecking huascar new foremast have be put in at valparaiso before one of ironclad inch shell burst in hold blew bottom clean out of by george terry exclaimed jim enthusiastically did ever see such plucky fight why school ship have given huascar thoroughly nasty mauling expect peruvian feel more than bit sore at seeing ship used to be pride of fleet in chilian hand caramba maranon be sinking lower in water second will be gone in le than five minute hope brave fellow will be able to get out of before go for bay be simply swarming with shark look at black dorsal fin of beggar playing round old blanco be enough to make fellow sick to think of gallant chap being torn to piece by such monster a ah be glad to see condell have ceased firing to allow peruvian launch be just coming out to pick up survivor too late too late groaned second two later there go already why whole bottom must have be blown clean out of for to sink in short time launch held back for few second to avoid being caught in vortex caused by sinking ship then dashed forward to rescue saved good many if jim have be close enough must have seen that prophecy with regard to shark have proved only too true for voracious monster darting hither thither snapped up unfortunate men before very eye of comrade who be straining nerve to save fierce fish sometimes leaping length out of water in furious effort to snatch prey back even when man have be hauled up on to boat gunwale two lad be fortunately spared close view of harrowing sight attention be speedily diverted from catastrophe by further commotion behind mole when looking through glass saw that peruvian encouraged apparently by damage wrought by maranon have got couple of tug alongside old monitor manco capac atahualpa be towing out close to huascar ironclad side being more capable of resisting latter shell than maranon wooden hull directly chilians perceived new move angamos pilcomayo stood in to support of consort in very few minute jim beheld somewhat rare spectacle of close fleet action in side be well matched for two peruvian monitor be of about equal strength to three chilian warship thunder of cannon now became deafening callao bay be positively flecked with white by hundred of ricochetting shell solid shot while even at distance of four mile boy must see through telescope ship hull reel quiver under frightful impact of shot shell combat did not last very long for merciful darkness came down about hour after monitor have be towed out put end to action signal for recall be hoisted aboard blanco encalada firing gradually ceased huascar angamos pilcomayo got anchor shortly after whole chilian fleet be once more anchored safely under lee of san lorenzo island tactic bombardment of callao continued day after day port seemed to be a far from surrendering a be when began chilians found after first few day that be necessary to lay down permanent mooring under san lorenzo island buoy so that fleet must leave berth night at dusk return when morning dawned be because of fact that peruvian have constructed several fast torpedo boat prowled round fleet after dark attempted to torpedo vessel composing also to avoid peril of floating mine enemy put into water at mouth of harbour allowed to drift down upon chilian vessel with tide flagship have in particular be made objective of several of torpedo attack be fact put into head of admiral scheme have now be turning over in mind for day past on th of may meeting of officer be convened in admiral riveros cabin on board flagship jim be one of officer present be about seven o'clock in evening darkness have already closed in fleet then steaming in double column of line abreast on off about two mile to seaward of anchorage a soon a chilian officer have come aboard riveros took seat at head of cabin table straightway plunged into business a be aware gentleman began have now be lying before callao for nearly three week despite best endeavour town still remains untaken way to lima be still closed to can not be permitted to continue very much longer for be running short of provision coal while ship bottom be getting so foul must need for fast steaming arise must find that vessel be incapable of making top speed by at least two three knot if be compelled to raise blockade of place so that may put in order peruvian will naturally avail of opportunity to throw cargo of arm ammunition provision into place thus upon return work will need to be done over again therefore be out of question for to think of raising blockade before callao have fallen appears to that principal obstacle in way of bringing to pas be presence of peruvian ship lying behind mole have proved that be impossible to reduce port by gun fire alone general assault therefore seems to be only alternative left general assault be equally impossible in face of hurricane of shot shell ship be a have already seen capable of discharging therefore a will doubtless have gathered from remark gentleman will be necessary for to destroy ship soon question be how be to do so long a remain where be be safe from gun for be protected by mole have therefore summoned aboard flagship with object of ascertaining whether of have plan suggestion to offer for solution of difficulty if so will be very glad to hear for considerable time there be silence in cabin everybody seeming to be busily engaged in endeavour to evolve plan whereby admiral difficulty might be overcome at length jim who have be cogitating profoundly with head between hand looked up inquired whether riveros happened to posse chart of callao harbour a happened there be one ready to hand few second later douglas be poring over by light of cabin lamp with pencil pair of compass in hand meanwhile several of chilian officer now began to propound scheme of be promising enough up to certain point at somebody be certain to point out insurmountable difficulty one suggested concerted attack by entire chilian squadron be manifestly impossible in face of enormously powerful gun peruvian must bring to bear put forward suggestion that assault must be delivered in rear of town by landing number of seaman marine in chorillos bay chorillos bay be open to full run of pacific ocean upon nearly day throughout year there be such terrific surf on beach that landing by mean of small boat must be impossible presently jim looked up from chart have be studying remarked quietly think sir can manage business will probably involve destruction of torpedo boat crew a regard be perfectly willing to take risk be for to say whether will spare torpedo boat suppose will be question of calling for volunteer if must decide to allow to try experiment let hear what have to propose senor douglas said admiral will then be better able to decide whether scheme be sufficiently promising to justify in risking loss of rather by own showing throwing away torpedo boat entire crew loss must of course be small price to pay for achievement of object must convince that there be at least possibility of success before can consent to what may have to suggest whereupon young englishman described in detail what purposed doing when have finished riveros sat back in chair stared fixedly at ceiling for minute while drummed upon table with finger other officer seated round cabin seemed divided into two party one party sunk in deep thought while other stared at young man a though have taken leave of sens then presently riveros brought fist down upon table with clatter made everybody start by jove young man exclaimed will try scheme if be successful of however have very grave doubt let tell believe can promise there be nothing that chili will not do for caramba be brilliant a well a daring idea what say gentleman yes senor douglas will have torpedo boat janequeo with everything that require a for crew can not order men to go on expedition a contemplate believe that if call for volunteer will get complement at least hope so for honour of chilian navy now when do propose to make attempt well sir replied douglas be afraid that will require to night day to morrow to prepare have very little doubt that will be able to make attempt to morrow night very well then said admiral rising will not detain longer senor douglas for a have hinted will have good many preparation to make sooner be able to carry out scheme better jim wished admiral good night retired to own cabin to snatch if must few hour sleep might very possibly prove to be last must ever take on earth left order with sentry that be to be called at midnight accordingly at hour turned out washed dressed then made way to magazine between own cabin with one two interval for meal be busily engaged until four o'clock in afternoon of next day hearing time thunder of heavy gun rolling reverberating over head for during last few day blanco encalada have taken part in bombardment a soon a have finished mysterious preparation in magazine went on deck spoke few word to admiral latter listened nodded once twice then gave certain order to yeoman of signal few minute later stream of brilliant coloured flag soared aloft into now fast gathering gloom must have taken very sharp eye on shore to discern that signal be briefly answered by man on board janequeo who waved small yellow flag in half hour have become too dark to continue bombardment usual signal of recall be made from flagship in response to furious cannonading ceased ship drew away over to san lorenzo island where always assembled prior to going to sea for night then with flagship huascar leading double line fleet steamed away into offing until be hidden from sight of callao behind san lorenzo island here in response to signal fleet anchored thus departing from usual custom of cruising to fro during hour of darkness even before ship have lost way prior to dropping anchor janequeo be seen to sheer out of place in line presently raced up alongside blanco encalada where came to standstill blanco side ladder be then lowered jim went down on to small craft deck then number of seaman took place on accommodation ladder one on step from top to bottom group of chilians likewise formed up on janequeo deck then man made appearance at blanco gangway carrying something heavy handled with quite exceptional care object handed to man at top of ladder who passed to next man so on until reached janequeo when be taken aboard stowed away below with sign of utmost precaution process be repeated again again until dozen of mysterious package have be placed on board when in profound silence torpedo boat sped away from flagship to visit of other craft of squadron in turn receiving two men from one half dozen from so on until complement be complete light be then extinguished slid off into darkness without sound there be cheering from fleet not even so much a shout of farewell in heart man in ship silently wished success to daring young englishman crew janequeo be out of sight in minute when have vanished squadron got under way once more continued usual nightly cruise on off port while admiral riveros standing on navigating bridge strained ear in attempt to catch sound must tell jim effort have be unsuccessful that gallant crew be more chapter thirteen jim be taken prisoner douglas plan be indeed sufficiently daring one for have resolved upon accomplishment of le task than of blowing into air ship in peruvian fleet then lying at callao to do have be obliged to set to work on quite new system janequeo be constructed to carry only two spar torpedo of be quite insufficient for jim purpose for ship must almost certainly be protected by boom to ward off possible attack by torpedo boat must manage to approach near enough young englishman must need one torpedo to destroy boom leaving one more with to destroy ship have protected destruction of single ship be not sufficient for to ensure subsequent success of chilian fleet be imperative that must be destroyed young man have therefore brought along spar torpedo for use if necessary have also manufactured dozen large bomb meant to attach to ship afterwards exploding by mean of time fuse by doing hoped to be able to destroy whole fleet practically simultaneously whereas by spar method even have be able to carry sufficient number of torpedo must have be obliged to destroy one after of course after first explosion crew of rest must be prepared for also have in mind to use two spar a bridge must find that vessel be protected by boom thus if must attach bomb undetected ought to be able to ensure annihilation of entire peruvian squadron be terribly dangerous service that have undertaken for have on board janequeo enough explosive to destroy twelve ship if one searching little machine gun bullet be to strike cargo well there must be end of douglas crew torpedo boat together however brave fellow with gave much thought to danger be incurring country needed if must be so must have jim have calculated to utmost nicety time must probably need in getting through business have cut of fuse to such length that bomb must explode a nearly a possible at same instant if received check remained undiscovered well good if be delayed at after lighting fuse must be very bad indeed for janequeo crew wheel be in charge of old quartermaster who knew callao bay a intimately a did valparaiso harbour a jim stood beside in tiny shelter watching peer through darkness ever anon give wheel slight turn way that realised that have on board most of element go to make up success luck be be wanting a fortune be supposed to favour brave jim have high hope of bringing expedition to successful issue away through blackness swept little torpedo boat with not light showing anywhere on board men have even be forbidden to smoke stoker down below put coal on a carefully a though furnace be lady drawing room fire so that there might be flicker of flame hovering over top of funnel even so much a spark to betray whereabouts in little le than hour after leaving blanco encalada janequeo sneaked round south east corner of san lorenzo island being very careful not to collide with big buoy marked chilian vessel mooring passed slid in between san lorenzo fronton entered boqueron passage coming in sight of small lighthouse be strangely enough still allowed to show light at back of do de mayo battery luckily for daring little vessel searchlight have not yet come into vogue must scarcely have hoped to escape discovery for when crossed camotal bank previous to turning to starboard in order to run up callao bay be so close inshore that crew must plainly hear shout of peruvian soldier who occupied mayo battery who be evidently holding high carousal for circumstance jim thanked lucky star for there be le likelihood of men being on watch while noise be making must prevent from hearing a careful listener might have done throbbing of janequeo engine churning of propeller just a have rounded point however boat have turned nose north east bacchanalian sound from battery suddenly ceased light began to flicker among earthwork jim felt heart stand still for discovery now must mean utter ruin of project to say nothing of death of of for shot from one of enormous inch gun must send frail janequeo to bottom like stone if chanced to hit evidently peruvian in particular battery have taken alarm at something for tiny point of light appeared on rampart then quickly flared up into bright blaze beacon fire have be lighted at moment now glare might reveal presence of torpedo boat to peruvian jim immediately passed word down to engine room for steam must carry little vessel speed at once increased by knot two be nearly in safety now being about five hundred yard beyond point few minute more must take under shadow of higher ground upon pierola battery be placed when glare from beacon must be unable to reach jim great fear now be lest other battery also might take alarm light beacon in case must not possibly escape discovery by happy chance however janequeo glided into deep shadow unobserved jim now ordered speed to be reduced so that boat must not make so much fuss in going through water when stole along at speed of about ten knot fifteen being maximum of be quite capable a be perfectly new boat men in pierola being mile away from mayo battery have evidently not noticed beacon light be suspicion aroused for be perfectly quiet a janequeo crept safely past with not light gleaming anywhere in battery to show that anybody be awake battery two lying next to to north have a happened borne brunt of fighting day presumably men be overcome by fatigue next torre del merced fort santa rosa be safely passed light of callao swung in sight railway station lay close to waterside be particularly brilliantly lighted while sound proceeding therefrom seemed to indicate that troop be either arriving at be being dispatched from place be now only about quarter of mile from southern end of mole douglas passed word round for crew to hold in readiness although entrance to harbour where ship be lying be still mile distant mole being nearly five hundred yard in length queer shaped bomb be then got up on deck jim busied upon task of attaching fuse to be obliged to work by sense of touch alone a dared not of course use light of description by time that have finished preparation janequeo have almost reached northern end of mole moment be at hand for great attempt to be made douglas now lessened speed still further for did not quite know what shape defence to harbour must take anticipated that there must almost certainly be number of floating mine to pas through be more than likely that patrol of place might be maintained by launch steaming with light out few minute later adventurer arrived abreast northern end of mole be made aware of fact by slight diminution of pitchy blackness caused by wall of mole being left on starboard quarter light on pierhead be of course extinguished while hostility be in progress for peruvian be much too sensible to leave beacon by enemy might easily make mouth of harbour jim must now see forest of spar belonging to ship have come to destroy outlined against luminous haze formed by light of town although own little craft be shrouded in dense blackness ordered man at wheel to port helm few spoke upon janequeo turned gradually to starboard until came abreast of harbour entrance be only about two hundred foot in width then stopped engine altogether when torpedo boat have come to standstill proceeded to listen with intentness for suspicious sound everything be a still a grave douglas began to hug to conviction that event seemed to be turning out fortunately must hear sound aboard peruvian warship there be sign of patrol launch being about having therefore taken precaution in power started engine once more went ahead dead slow turning to starboard until janequeo bow pointed straight for harbour entrance nearer nearer stole while crew waited in readiness for action muscle tense quivering with anticipation excitement bomb have be ranged in two line of six one on port one on starboard side so that there must be no need to carry far whichever side torpedo boat presented to enemy be gliding through water at speed of about five knot when suddenly there be slight grating sound janequeo bow lifted out of water boat came to dead stop with screw still slowly churning up water astern shock caused of men on deck to lose footing whole row of bomb on port side splashed overboard a janequeo heeled in direction in second jim be on foot rushing to engine room bade man in charge to stop engine then dashed on deck again half expecting to hear crash of gun opening fire upon while listened intently in order to ascertain whether presence have be betrayed by disturbance there be sound of alarm however douglas presently realised that strange a appeared janequeo be still undiscovered then silently men set about task of discovering what have caused obstruction be not long in finding that stout chain have be stretched across entrance evidently to prevent just attack a that janequeo have run in upon chain where sagged in middle momentum carrying right up on to for fore foot be nearly out of water thus be in particularly perilous predicament for if be discovered now power on earth must save jim be thankful beyond measure that have not be running in at full speed otherwise janequeo must most certainly have broken back sunk on instant loss of bomb be very serious too still have six of left if must sink ship with must not have done so badly on whole question now however be how be going to get clear of chain once clear how be going to surmount obstacle get into harbour one thing at time thought douglas let get off chain first of that without breaking torpedo boat in half alarming enemy listened again intently for sound must indicate that peruvian be stirring then hearing nothing sent engine astern at full speed with concentrated energy of quarter of hour pent up steam water frothed boiled under boat counter making in intense stillness of night disturbance jim thought must be heard over town although boat rocked from side to side under strain grinding keel bilge against chain remained immovably fixed jim ordered engine to be stopped feeling that so violent disturbance of water must speedily lead to detection douglas face became drawn eye took on very strained look a realised what must mean if must not get janequeo off peruvian must give very short shrift to body of men who have be caught in attempt to torpedo fleet moreover have heard certain gruesome story from chilian seaman to effect that of half caste troop peruvian have with be rather addicted to pastime of torturing prisoner who might be unlucky enough to fall into hand relic undoubtedly of custom of indian ancestor after engine have be stopped jim called hasty council of crew consulting with a to what be best to be done must not possibly force boat over chain because even be engine powerful enough janequeo must break back in process if only have couple of good strong file might manage even yet whispered douglas leaning over side feeling at chain link be not more than inch thick must soon cut doe anybody know whether there be good stout file aboard a ceased speaking man dived down through tiny engine room hatch presently reappeared bearing in hand two large file have senor whispered excitedly to jim be brought on board morning from blanco when be doing repair to engine forgot to take back before started how will do douglas eagerly seized tool ran thumb along edge be very rough coarse being hardly worn at be just what be wanted for purpose given sufficient time immunity from detection work of getting clear of chain by filing through must be easy be very thing el lobo ejaculated douglas in low voice now start on job at once let one man cut upper side of link one lower will be free in next to time who will take first spell with man silently held out hand for other file jim selected fellow of herculean proportion to take first turn with in few second low rasping sound of rapidly moving file broke stillness of night seemed preternaturally loud by comparison with stillness remaining member of crew concentrated power in act of listening so that might give instant warning to worker must noise appear to attract attention from shore jim fellow labourer be soon bathed in sweat while douglas hand unaccustomed to such toil grew red raw blistered under friction for file a be quite usual in engineering department be unprovided with wooden handle over rat tail shank moreover task threatened to be long difficult in consequence of awkwardness of condition jim spell of work came to end after quarter of hour however couple of men took place at chain have not be working more than five minute when there be heavy splash followed by cry of disappointment from men appeared that while working two file have suddenly met in middle of stroke with result that one of have be knocked out of user hand have gone overboard be serious loss indeed one might cost whole of life a jim said be use cry over spilt milk file be gone there be end of other man must work doubly hard be meanwhile went down into engine room prowled round to see whether by lucky chance there might not be file lying about be successful in finding small one be very much worn not likely to be of much use nevertheless in hand of strong man might still be made to cut little immediately took up on deck gave to one of crew to great relief found that one part of chain be nearly severed by time that be entirely cut through lower part of link be half severed then be short job to completely cut with large file at length be done there be final rasp of file little snapping noise sudden splash a chain fell into two half disappeared below surface janequeo dropped back in water with loud squelching noise be free free at last though man on board be trembling like leaf in wind under stress that have undergone there be time for delay however many precious minute have be lost there be too few left in to complete work have to be done jim passed word once more for steam for five knot screw began to revolve janequeo stole forward again on errand of destruction jim feared that there might be second chain across harbour little higher up peruvian have evidently considered single barrier sufficient for there be more boom now must see towering spar of two school hulk in few minute passed slowly silently by without stopping be old practically worthless hulk must destroy after have annihilated ironclad monster be capable of doing efficient work with carelessness amounted to fatuity there seemed to be watch kept on board ship there be light visible be a still silent a grave union be next craft in line be gunboat have already shewn capable of stinging pretty severely promised to attend to on return journey pushed on still farther up harbour ship be apparently lying on janequeo port side so became necessary to shift bomb over by time that be done jim saw dark shapeless mass looming up in front of crowned by one short squat funnel one mast knew that be approaching atahualpa manco capac two monitor have done so much damage to chilian fleet here at last be foe worthy of attention jim stopped engine altogether allowing janequeo to slide along through water by own momentum be fortunate thing that did so for when torpedo boat be within twenty foot of monitor suddenly collided with floating wooden boom have be placed round ironclad impact be very slight however jim presently have little craft securely moored alongside then got overboard on to boom with dozen men carrying bomb gingerly in arm followed by men bearing one of torpedo spar made way round to portion of timber floated opposite ironclad stern jim meant to affix torpedo to ship stern post so that if did not actually sink might at least blow away rudder propeller so render ship useless arrived at stern saw that be old enemy manco capac at once set to work men laid spar down on boom pushed out until one end be touching manco capac stern post other remaining on boom then lashed boom end securely jim having bomb round shoulder started to crawl out along spar while chilians sat on other end to make still more steady must have be perilous enough journey at time in dark with heavy weight slung round shoulder be trebly difficult furthermore place fairly swarmed with shark douglas knew what fate must be must lose hold fall into water even if did not happen to be dragged to bottom at once by weight round neck several time knee hand slipped making spar quiver ominously fortunately retained hold on pole at last after many narrow escape arrived under ironclad overhanging counter here worst part of task be over for must now support by clinging to rudder soon found large nut close to water edge from must suspend deadly torpedo quickly unslung from round shoulder presently have lashed firmly in position against curve of manco capac counter lower edge of bomb being just about couple of inch clear of water then fixed fuse alongside rudder post after listening to hear whether one be about struck match applied to loose end being first torpedo have cut length of fuse to burn for two hour so that must have time to do work get away before first explosion occurred when fuse be lighted seemed to fizz away with alarming rapidity jim be so startled that nearly fell into water fuse will never burn for two hour told there must be something wrong with for at rate will not last thirty minute therefore made second journey along pole at best speed of be capable in couple of minute be standing on boom once more seven of made short work of unlashing spar getting back to torpedo boat janequeo be soon under way again stealing up harbour once more atahualpa be next ship came to to unbounded satisfaction found that be unprotected by boom peruvian probably thought that hostile craft must never get so far without being discovered janequeo be therefore run right under stem torpedo be affixed without difficulty fuse timed for hour half being lighted fuse too jim noticed seemed to be burning away much faster than ought there be time to watch torpedo boat swung off once more on mission of destruction two craft be with exception perhaps of union be fast ship most formidable in peruvian fleet jim experienced thrill of satisfaction at thought that manco capac atahualpa must at rate not trouble chilians again there be ship lying close at hand douglas judged to be fast transport oroya because of paddle wheel made up mind to attend to before running back to blow up union selected paddle box a best place to to attach torpedo a too be unprotected by boom soon have bomb fixed in position fuse lighted now men whispered excitedly to delighted crew will run down attend to only other ship of theirs be of use union hard over with helm quartermaster will get down harbour again wheel spun round in pedro sinewy grasp janequeo nose be presently pointing down harbour full speed ahead douglas whispered down tube have much time to lose little engine began to throb more rapidly while screw thrashed water up astern soon passed atahualpa again jim must plainly make out jumping spark came from fuse hissed into water sight be hidden from one up above by overhang of ship counter felt fairly certain that must not possibly be discovered before bomb have exploded done deadly work a slipped past doomed monitor douglas eye suddenly caught sight of dark figure with rifle over shoulder silhouetted against luminous haze thrown off by light of callao heart gave great bound for figure have not be there when torpedo boat passed up must now hardly hope to avoid detection jim fear be only too well founded for sentry saw janequeo a quickly a jim saw sentry in second fellow roared hoarse challenge across water discharging rifle at boat a swept past without waiting for reply indeed there be need for to expect answer to hail for knew that boat ought to be cruising about there if be peruvian while if be chilian rifle shot be signal for immediate uproar seemed a though man must have be asleep at post for atahualpa deck suddenly became literally alive with figure rifle began to flash about in score while bullet pattered round into torpedo boat with most unpleasant accuracy of aim there be time to destroy union now hissed douglas between teeth will have to be satisfied with what have already done caramba will be fortunate if get away with whole skin look out people with thin skull manco people be training big gun on full speed ahead below there roared there being more need now for secrecy give steam can carry will have for certain screw be already turning at utmost speed however not knot must be got out of flying little steamer indeed be already doing sixteen one knot more than have right to expect just a jim spoke red rocket leaped up into still night air with whistling roar bursting high up in sky with shower of brilliant red star signal to patrol in bay cried jim at same moment huge inch gun on board manco capac roared out vengeful message will have to hurry to get clear now mistake flash of great gun fired at such close quarter nearly blinded janequeo crew while be dazed by hurtling roar of shell a sped past few foot only above head torpedo boat be now moving very rapidly manco crew must not be able to load fire stern gun again before be out of range there be still bow gun to be feared gauntlet of union two school hulk have to be run before must get clear looked a if janequeo be in for bad ten minute for after alarm have be given seemed a though ship in harbour have lighted beacon fire jim must see by glare of have sprung up aboard union consort that gun big small have be run out ready to fire into intruder a passed while vessel side be literally black with rifleman waiting to pour volley into daring janequeo douglas have almost forgotten in prevailing excitement fact that torpedo have be attached to three peruvian vessel in case did not expect to explode for at least hour when just a janequeo have got about fifty yard past manco capac there be most appalling explosion from stern of latter craft jim turning round saw that air be full of blazing fragment of wreckage even a gazed great monitor be beginning to settle by stern at moment when mine exploded monitor be just about to fire inch bow gun catastrophe of course threw everything into confusion weapon flung from trunnions in very act of firing discharged deadly missile high into air where exploded sending out blaze of flame like miniature firework display one of done for at rate soliloquised jim through set teeth a bent over deck telegraph of flying boat to ring for yet more speed now will surely find other torpedo cut adrift before have time to explode confound fuse wretched thing must have perished badly perhaps have be wrongly timed in manufactory young man have opportunity however for further reflection for be now dashing along toward union other two ship after first shock of terror at destruction of monitor peruvian have returned to gun be quite ready to send janequeo to bottom god help murmured young englishman will never get through tempest of fire be going to try nearer nearer swept until torpedo boat be only hundred yard away then union fired first gun large inch rifled weapon loaded with shell screamed horridly a swept past plunged into water just astern rifleman raised piece levelled over corvette high side at word of command aboard torpedo boat must hear sent volley hurtling aboard devoted craft jim felt sharp twinge in left shoulder knew that be hit two other men fell to deck limp a empty suit of clothes janequeo be now abreast union a drew level latter ship discharged gun that must bring to bear be simply impossible that must miss there be ripping tearing of iron a shower of steel struck torpedo boat funnel be blown completely out of hissing roar of escaping steam followed by scream of scalded stoker down below told too plainly that boiler have be pierced quartermaster at wheel let go spoke collapsed on deck jim staggered to helm just in time to prevent janequeo from crashing into mole then still floating with smoke steam flame billowing along deck blinding gallant skipper maimed little vessel staggered forward escape be not for union have smart man for captain did not intend little chilian hornet to go clear forward inch gun bellowed out shell struck chilian fair square on stern exploding a passed into hull literally blowing after part of away stern plunged downward rolled heavily once twice then turned right over throwing jim in state of semi unconsciousness into water of harbour then sank bottom blew out of a plunged beneath surface at precise moment to jim fast failing sens there came roar of terrific explosion followed almost instantly by second knew that though own ship be lost have done duty succeeded in destroying three of enemy just a be on point of sinking however for last time hand shot out grasped collar hauled roughly into boat while voice growled out in spanish be only one afloat senor rest be down among shark who will not go hungry to night then darkness closed down over jim sens though not before have realised that be prisoner in hand of enemy peruvian chapter fourteen in face of death when jim recovered consciousness be to find in small dark cell whether on board ship on land must not tell for there be window in prison there be not particle of motion knew there must have be have be at sea presently came to conclusion that must be in one of punishment cell aboard ship lying in harbour for thought that now again must hear faint plash gurgle of water close at hand sound similar to have often heard when down about bilge of blanco encalada far below water line also very soon realised that in addition to being in prison have chain upon leg further that chain be fastened to ring staple set into wall of chamber poor lad be consumed by raging thirst too while wound in shoulder inflicted either by bullet piece of flying shell be occasioning very great pain if only have light reflected thing must not be quite so bad rummaged among pocket in endeavour to find box of match knew have be in pocket when be thrown overboard off janequeo be in tin box so that be just possible that water must not have have time to get to during short period of immersion in case a clothing be very nearly dry again be more than likely that match must be same after trying several pocket discovering that have already be gone through that article of value including watch chain have be taken from found box for be searching in hip pocket of trouser to great delight wet have not reached content therefore struck light first thing eye rested upon be large pitcher of water plate containing piece of black bread several slice of pemmican dried meat have be placed close beside be thankful that have not accidentally capsized water jug in darkness seized drank at eagerly when have half finished content discovered that be famished with hunger therefore struck match by light possessed of food proceeded to devour ravenously finished off entire supply before hunger be satisfied having made good meal felt very much better then by light of tiny fire made of match stalk scrap of straw similar odds end managed with difficulty to strip off coat shirt to attend in small degree to wound in shoulder

thrown down in one corner of cell how long wondered have be in miserable hole must certainly have be good many hour must not have felt so intensely hungry thirsty also wondered in what ship if be how peruvian must treat man who have blown up three of finest ship leaving only bare skeleton of navy did not think very long however for be fatigued to point of exhaustion soon sank into state of complete oblivion how long have slept must not tell be awakened by noise of door opening shining of bright light full upon face before must fully collect faculty bearer of lamp burly peruvian seaman with name union on front of cap bade in rough tone of voice stand up at same time producing key from among number hung at belt unlocking young englishman iron a fell away from limb jim heaved sigh of relief seaman heard hearing remarked need not be so glad to get off young whipper snapper will be free for only few minute while captain see after have done with will probably be shot worse so need not look so pleased needle to say after communication of item of information jim did not feel exactly jubilant fellow considered might only have be speaking thus to vent ill will in case jim be not going to let see that what have said affected in least therefore merely answered will see what will see fate be fate nobody can alter that fellow made reply in word uttering raucous laugh bade jim precede out of cell mind that played trick must get bullet through then seaman locked door pocketed key placing rifle with fixed bayonet at charge ordered prisoner to walk on in front jim did keeping eye very wide open meanwhile so a to make note of position of cell surroundings for possible use on future occasion first passed along passage flanked with other cell similar to jim in have be confined being last of row then came to iron studded door prisoner be commanded to open opened at touch englishman guard passed through finding immediately upon union lower deck a peruvian marine guided jim through ship with point of fixed bayonet young englishman took opportunity to satisfy curiosity regarding famous craft curiosity be perfectly natural in view of fact that have fought action with chased while be in angamos smiled a eye fell upon one of beam supporting main deck for in be embedded several piece of shell peruvian have not seen fit to remove knew that be fragment of missile fired by own cruiser have entered one of union open gun port day of battle in second narrow examination of interior of corvette be necessarily only very cursory one for be hurried forward by prod from sentry bayonet whenever showed disposition to loiter presently mounted ladder leading from lower to main deck walked along latter toward stern presently jim found outside door of cabin in extreme after end of ship shrewdly surmised belonged to skipper sentry then grounded rifle knocked upon door opened slightly announced in gruff tone prisoner sir there be short pause broken only by rustling of paper then low carefully modulated voice replied bring fellow in then sentry jim be ushered into presence of captain villavicencio famous captain of peruvian corvette entering douglas found in large airy cabin situated in extreme after end of ship opening on to narrow gallery running round stern of ship from quarter to quarter two tall narrow door gave exit on to gallery now stood open disclosed view of callao harbour with water shimmering in ray of newly risen sun for be early morning in centre of cabin be most luxuriously furnished stood magnificent mahogany writing table at sat man whose name be still ringing through whole continent be extremely handsome individual enormous proportion be well set off by dark blue gold of naval uniform have jet black curly hair short pointed beard while dark eye looked out from beneath thick overhanging brow seemed to pierce through through individual toward whom glance be directed jim saw at once that be man among thousand one who must make name for come to front in spite of opposition there be certain subtle something about peruvian inspired in young man feeling almost akin to terror eye for instance have distinctly tigerish look about man whole personality be strongly suggestive of feline nature deep set dark eye jim knew instinctively must at time flash forth lightning deadly in intensity while low purring voice must also take on note of such deadly menace a must make hearer blood curdle steel pointed claw beneath velvet glove be too apparent to young englishman looked forward to coming interview with feeling be anything pleasant felt a though be in power of gigantic cat might play with until be tired of amusement must then turn rend wonder thought to that chilians feared man spared pain in endeavour to destroy ship in response to wave of villavicencio hand jim took up position on side of table opposite to occupied by skipper while sentry posted close alongside prisoner then peruvian busied with paper for few minute apparently oblivious of jim presence at length having found that for be searching glanced up gaze flickered over jim like summer lightning inspiring in young man so strong feeling of repulsion that almost amounted to nausea there be something horribly magnetic in look jim felt that man possessed strange occult power be lacking in most human being after looking at young man for few second villavicencio turned to sentry remarked will not need presence think jacinto may leave room post outside cabin door see that be not interrupted sentry gravely presented arm walked out of cabin closing door softly behind when have gone skipper took up blank sheet of paper pencil wrote down few line on paper then looking at prisoner said in low purring tone be young chilian naval officer who be in charge of torpedo boat destroyed three of ship night before last be not jim replied that be well resumed villavicencio will be sorry be sure to hear that comrade be drowned when janequeo be name of boat believe went down be sole survivor by way how many men have with there be eighteen of altogether replied douglas skipper made brief note on paper before then remarked softly h be be pity that be drowned must have much liked to have saved few more of although there be absolutely fault to be found with sentiment expressed by captain jim felt instinctively that word possessed double meaning shivered in spite of heat of morning be already becoming excessive what be name young man be next question upon jim answering reply be noted down by interrogator upon paper before just a have finished writing thought seemed to strike suddenly looked up quickly from sheet be ever on board chilian cruiser angamos inquired still in same low even tone with curious new thrill in voice yes replied jim looking straight in face have honour to command ship upon occasion when encountered union in strait of magellan if remember rightly union did not stay to finish little encounter ah h h breathed villavicencio through teeth so be man in command of cruiser thought might be when heard name struck a being rather young for post by way how old be jim told not without certain curious sinking sensation about heart so young a dear dear certainly doe seem pity can not be helped said captain name doe not sound like chilian one however of what nationality be if may ask be englishman replied jim proud of fact immediately added villavicencio appeared to be sunk in thought for few second during ejaculated caramba carrajo several time last item of information seemed to be unexpected unpleasant presently however muttered to well suppose matter very much people be liable to accident here a well a elsewhere if inquiry must be made can easily plead ignorance only will have to alter method of first idea might possibly attract too much attention however will see aloud went on have relation in part of world senor douglas inconsequent a question appeared to be jim felt uncanny creepy sensation about root of hair voice did not shake a replied have relation in chili in other part of world be absolutely alone villavicencio face at once brightened rubbed hand remarking ah then so much better senor douglas for in case will not miss then whole appearance changed voice dropped to harsh hissing note a resumed be great pity though that be englishman so well known in chilian navy for fact prevents from dealing a have intended with miscreant who destroyed two of ship seriously damaged third though can not punish a must have liked can will have shot immediately on deck of ship union vessel so pleasantly remarked just now ran away from cruiser consort in strait exclaimed douglas in astonishment be prisoner of war demand to be treated a such have done nothing duty nothing to merit death at hand even if have have yet to learn that one man only even though be captain of corvette can sit in judgment upon prisoner sentence to death be at least entitled to proper court martial if be to be tried for life villavicencio laughed what say dear young man be doubt technically correct here might be right will deal with a please a will very soon see sentry called suddenly raising voice smiling evilly into jim face for brief moment douglas be on point of leaping across table endeavouring to strangle peruvian where sat man sword at side huge proportion must have intimidated there be that curious look in villavicencio eye seemed to hypnotise chain poor jim to spot on stood next second sentry entered be too late to think about resistance sentry said skipper take prisoner back to cell see that doe not attempt to escape on way look desperate when have locked up in safety send lieutenant rodriguez to at once like man in dream jim marched to door scarcely hearing skipper sauve voice remarking hasta la vista senor douglas will not say adios for will meet again once more cabin door then closed jim be conducted back to cell followed by curious glance of men who be assembled about deck once back in prison seemed able to think more connectedly began to wonder whether not there might be mean of escape from semi human creature clutch have done absolutely nothing to merit threatened summary execution felt convinced that sentence be simply due to skipper own desire for personal vengeance on man who have made turn fly upon memorable day at second narrow if really be so there be nothing to be hoped jim felt from man clemency for clearly knew more of meaning of word mercy than doe untamed tiger thus thinking douglas fell into deep gloomy reverie from be aroused by sound of footstep clattering about above head accompanied by occasional clank of arm several short crisp word of command sounded a though body of men have be formed up on deck above have then be marched off to other place in moment horrible truth struck be firing party have be told off for own execution that be right be proved by fact that almost immediately afterwards heard footstep approaching door echoing along passage there be rattle of key be confronted time by two armed seaman who roughly bade get on foot accompany poor lad be too thunderstruck to move for few moment so one of men prodded roughly with bayonet again bade rise jim then got on leg with blood streaming from thrust have be inflicted in thigh between two guard again made way to main deck time however be not taken so far aft a before be conducted up main companion stair on to upper deck having arrived there intense light from brilliant sun nearly blinded after imprisonment in pitchy blackness of cell a soon a must see clearly at once perceived drawn up in single line across quarter deck body of men armed with rifle knew that be indeed firing party villavicencio have promised skipper be nowhere in sight lieutenant rodriguez stood at end of firing line with drawn sword in hand jim be piloted by guard past end of firing party placed with back against number of stout plank reared on end be there for purpose of stopping bullet after have passed through young man body be only when lieutenant came up to began to bandage eye that jim recovered from state of semi coma into have be thrown by news of impending execution touch of peruvian hand recalled to sens flinging man finger aside protested vigorously against gross injustice inhumanity of proceeding only answer be short word of command from rodriguez in reply to two guard seized douglas by arm pinioned so that further struggle be impossible bandage be then adjusted jim be forced back against plank guard then stood aside jim arm being now bound behind resistance be useless escape impossible rather therefore than engage in useless undignified struggle determined to put bold face on matter meet fate like man accordingly stood still waiting for end heard sharp command to load then to present be nerving to hear fatal word fire when voice of villavicencio broke intense stillness what said jim did not know command to fire did not come instead rifle be grounded with clash douglas heard somebody walking toward then peruvian skipper voice broke intense silence take off bandage commanded handkerchief being stripped from jim eye found looking into of villavicencio be reprieved senor englishman said have just received letter have induced to change mind about instead therefore of shooting be sending together with number of comrade chilian officer whom captured in rimac to silver mine on shore of lake titicaca will in sort compensate for insulting remark about incident in second narrow for can promise that life life of comrade will be made very purgatory for shooting be much too easy death for friend will die same in silver mine process of dying will be slow very unpleasant will start on journey to morrow senor will have splendid opportunity to view beauty of country for will walk whole distance be several hundred mile now senor bid final adios guard take man away lodge again in cell look after well for will pay for with life if let escape again senor adios chapter fifteen on road to sorata be small wonder douglas felt so unnerved by ordeal through have just passed that brain seemed numbed to extent that scarcely realised what be going on around villavicencio taunt passed by almost unheeded jim most certainly did not realise that be only exchanging sudden for lingering death be conscious only of fact that life have be spared walked to cell between guard like man in dream be not until heavy prison door banged to after that really awoke once more to sense of reality of thing although speedily realised be meant by being condemned to silver mine for life hope sprang up again in breast while there be life there be hope must be poor sort of man reflected if must not somehow contrive to escape soon from terrible captivity to villavicencio have consigned further than that determined that once free must make brutal peruvian skipper pay that heavily for mental torment to have put prisoner to occupy mind jim then began to examine prison so far a bond must permit to do so with view of ascertaining whether there be possibility of escape for came to conclusion that though might possibly manage to break out if be given time enough must need very much longer time for accomplishment of such task than few hour be to elapse before be to be taken out of cell placed among chain gang be to march to silver mine escape if escape be to be compassed must have to be effected while on march douglas fell to wondering who companion in misfortune must prove to be whether must be likely to be prevailed upon to join in dash for liberty at rate decided a fell asleep nothing must be done arrangement must be made until saw men who be to be fellow prisoner then then only must be able to judge whether escape while on march must be practicable jim sincerely hoped that captive must prove to be game men for once have arrived at destination silver mine there must be very little chance of escape freedom must have to be won while on march not at thus musing jim overcome by many varied emotion of morning at length fell asleep continued to slumber peacefully almost continuously until be wakened on following morning by sound of clashing of arm tramp of heavy footstep outside cell door young man sat up quickly feeling much refreshed after long sleep second later cell door swung open file of peruvian marine entered prison be ordered to rise to foot manacle be then unlocked between two guard walked out of cell for last time proceeded on deck there be nobody there when arrived be ordered to sit down under port bulwark did with marine mounting guard over few minute later lieutenant rodriguez appeared on deck followed by miserable looking squad of dozen chilian officer among whom jim recognised one two whom knew be guarded by score of peruvian seaman armed with drawn cutlass jim be then roughly hauled to foot pushed into midst of new arrival who recognising uniform tattered torn though be hailed a comrade received with figuratively open arm seven men be then formed up in line name called out by rodriguez when have answered roll peruvian lieutenant called sergeant in charge of guard aside gave certain instruction after chilians be once more formed up in middle of escort whole body prisoner guard marched down sloping gangway led from union deck to wharf jim found once more after many weary month on terra firma still surrounded by guard chilians marched away along stone quay wall presently having left precinct of harbour arrived in town proper of callao there a soon a made appearance crowd of rough surrounded prisoner began to deride pelt with such filth garbage a came to hand destination jim discovered be plaza great square of city where be to join main body of prisoner destined for mine for whole of way unfortunate men be in peril of life from ferocity of mob indeed in one instance crowd made ugly rush in attempt to get at chilians to tear to piece that guard be obliged to halt form hollow square with captive in middle repel attack with fixed bayonet at moment when danger be at worst jim seized opportunity to observe face of companion in misfortune on only two of did perceive sign of terror therefore decided that when making plan for escape must take especial care that two officer be not made acquainted with a must be not unlikely to disclose plot hoping that by so doing might procure own freedom without danger involved in fighting for remaining four held head high looked a though if only possessed weapon must have be more than glad to take share in fight be sort of fellow douglas decided with whom to discus plan for escape made up mind that a soon a must do so without being observed by guard must take aside with view to arranging of plan of escape to be put into effect before prison gang must arrive at mine at length crowd finding that military guard round prisoner be too strong for abandoned attempt to wreak vengeance on chilians finally dispersed procession then resumed march quarter of hour later arrived at gran plaza de callao where depressing sight met jim eye round plaza now ranged rank upon rank of armed peruvian soldier who be mounting guard over hundred more disconsolate looking chilian prisoner who be nearly manacled singly in group there be present representative of nearly regiment of chilian army naval men of rating since poor fellow have have change of clothing during captivity most of uniform be almost unrecognisable jim distinguished among officer who belonged to constitucion valparaiso regiment guias grenaderos together with carabineros lancer rifleros most of naval prisoner be however officer jim be overjoyed to see that among be several men whom knew to whom determined to make presence known at first possible opportunity englishman be at first little surprised at preponderance of military over naval captive until recollected that month before union in command of redoubtable villavicencio have captured transport rimac be on way to arica with troop unfortunate men have be subjected to rigorous captivity in callao for month have only be taken from prison very morning in order to march to still worse fate of captivity in mine altogether there be with new arrival about hundred fifty chilian prisoner present on plaza jim speedily made up mind that must be very curious if must not by mean other manage to effect escape while on road appearance of naval prisoner from union be signal for cheer from companion in misfortune jim be speedily recognised by of officer near peruvian soldier however did not seem to relish manifestation on part of prisoner several of ordered chilians to keep silent enforcing command with savage blow from butt end of musket at moment gorgeously uniformed official rode up on horseback spoke to captain in charge of guard jim must not hear what be said official handed captain paper appeared to give certain instruction then galloped off captain veragua for jim afterwards learned be soldier name glanced through paper then began to call roll of prisoner most of be present hiatus now again occurred be filled in by voice responding dead captain ceremony having be finished several armourer made appearance with hammer cold chisel proceeded to knock off prisoner leg iron so that must be able to march then unhappy men be manacled together in group of dozen by mean of long chain to right wrist be fastened jim seeing that process be in progress unostentatiously moved from where be standing took up position in midst of number of naval officer whom knew who have already be making covert sign for to do so thus fell out a have hoped that be manacled to group of men whom already knew determined to lose time in discussing with plan for possible escape there be opportunity for just at present however for group be practically last to be attended to directly chain have be riveted on whole body be formed up in solid square be then surrounded by troop order to march be given entire company wheeled to right off plaza into calle de los angeles down proceeded at rapid pace low hum of conversation immediately broke out among chilians be not checked by guard therefore although be impossible at present to discus anything of private nature jim took opportunity to ask friend if have information a to fate in store for beyond fact that be destined for mine found however that latter fact be practically be known be to be taken in first place learned to recently erected station at callao then put in train for lima there be to be imprisoned in castle for one two night until second detachment of chilian prisoner must have arrived from south then whole body be a far a must be ascertained to be marched direct to sorata by way of yanyos huancavelica guantanga cuzco santa rosa constituted journey of six hundred mile whole of be to be accomplished on foot truly pleasant prospect jim vowed to that must not be fault if did even a much a sixth of distance before escaped therefore caused word to be passed round among fellow officer to whom be manacled that wished to have private talk with upon first occasion offered nod of comprehension assured that pretty clearly understood for what purpose conversation be to be held have by time arrived at railway station detachment be halted in good yard just outside although regular passenger communication have not yet be established between callao capital there have be for time line of railway for purpose of carrying merchandise from coast to lima when war began line be seized upon by military authority for purpose of transporting store soldier huge gloomy barrack of station have be built together with number of auxiliary good shed for purpose of holding war material be among shed that chilians found halted tedious process of calling roll be then again gone through by time that be finished shrill whistle accompanied by much blowing off of steam clank of coupling chain announced that train be being drawn up presently came in sight round curve bumping jolting over point jim saw that be made up of number of good truck to covering have be attached so that unhappy prisoner must be exposed during whole of journey to fierce ray of almost vertical sun a of men have already be without water for twelve hour there seemed to be prospect of getting before arrival at lima looked a though journey short a be to be must prove never to be forgotten one chilians be now formed up in two long line one on side of set of metal on train be approaching a soon a steamed into place be ordered to get on board manacled a be in group of twelve be necessarily very tedious process two hour elapsed before prisoner be stowed away be then found that too few wagon have be provided a there be more procurable consequent crushing be terrible have one advantage be that peruvian be obliged to send much smaller guard of soldier than must otherwise have done for simple reason that there be room for more a chilians have now stowed away must have taken too long time to rearrange guard have to go in last truck instead of being distributed over train gave prisoner opportunity that of be looking for to have little private conversation there be present chance of escape for peruvian with rifle must fire from one end of train to other thus speedily put end to attempt of sort train be on point of starting when one poor thirsty wretch began to cry out most piteously for drink of water in second others be also clamouring for peruvian merely laughed at entreaty telling that must do good to be without for while that must appreciate drink more when got to lima signal be then given whistle blew melancholy procession moved out of callao station to accompaniment of ironical cheer wish for safe happy journey from soldiery such of townspeople a have come to witness departure pace of train be positively snail like a engine have tender attached burned wood instead of coal stoppage in order to replenish with fuel be very numerous at same time being now high noon vertical sun streamed down upon uncovered truck until resembled so many oven intense heat coupled with inordinate length of time occupied by journey reduced of prisoner especially who have be without water for many hour to verge of frenzy supplication for water must have moved heart of brutal peruvian guard whose canteen be full of spirit water who constantly refreshed therefrom tortured thirsty prisoner by holding water bottle up to gaze then pouring content down own throat gradually low moan of pain misery made heard in one of truck soon spread to others a miserable men became unable to bear torture longer in silence by jove exclaimed jim be awful what fiend peruvian be have never treated prisoner of war a fellow be doing wish have water to give unfortunately have none moreover be nearly perishing with thirst dozen of men be wounded know carlos continued to brother officer who be sitting next to suffering must be awful of will go mad before get to lima hallo quick there stop man yelled a haggard looking chilian soldier staggered to foot eye blazing with insanity douglas warning came too late englishman have understood instinctively what maddened wretch be about to do shouted warning men be packed so closely that there be opportunity to save before single individual must rise to foot chilian manacled by one wrist a be have flung over end of truck falling between metal be now being dragged along by train shriek of agony filling who heard with horror soldier happened to be end man of group length of chain be rather longer than connecting other member of particular party have nearly dragged man next to to similar fearful death for poor fellow half crazed with terror be hanging over end of truck with arm nearly torn from socket by corpse trailing on line companion however seized by body while several strove to disconnect chain fettered to awful object trailing beneath train jim several others have staggered to foot be shouting to driver to stop train man be too far away to comprehend what be said peruvian in last truck feigning to believe there be mutiny of prisoner glad of excuse for cruelty began to fire into huddled mass of chilians bullet doing fearful execution at such short range officer next in line to jim fell dead with bullet through heart pulled douglas down with thereby saving englishman life for perfect hail of bullet whizzed into truck moment after fell at moment there be fearful shriek from front end of truck body of man who have committed suicide have by time be cut to piece by wheel loose end of chain have consequently be relieved of drag upon be now lashing about among wheel before soldier who have be nearly dragged over must realise haul up chain swaying end have got entangled among spoke of wheel be quickly coiled up broken of course before happened have actually torn unhappy chilian hand completely off shriek must have convinced peruvian guard that something be wrong have be willing to be convinced not be too busily occupied in firing into helpless prisoner maimed soldier have however fainted now fell senseless upon floor of car while companion unable to assist followed example by lying down to be out of line of fire peruvian however fired few more shot into truck since must no longer see anybody at whom to shoot presently tired of pastime laid down rifle laughing heartily among at sport have enjoyed douglas fellow officer heard raucous sound of merriment in heart vowed that if lived must exact fearful retribution for inhuman treatment have day received from captor at four o'clock afternoon train crawled jolted into lima truck be at once surrounded by soldiery who be waiting for arrival unhappy prisoner be roughly hauled out formed up in square a before weary hungry thirsty prisoner be hurried off to castle of lima where in courtyard be given first food water that many of have received for nearly thirty six hour while starving wretch be refreshing gate opened to admit body of about fifty chilians surrounded by guard be herded in among who have arrived by train likewise be given food water upon fell like ravenous wild beast after having satisfied hunger jim seized opportunity to look round little there be now about two hundred chilians present be evident from preparation be being made that be to be taken to mine even a looked about new force of guard began to form up there be quite hundred of jim noticed about one to two prisoner peruvian be armed with rifle bayonet whereas chilians be not moreover guard be free while chilian prisoner be manacled together in group of dozen douglas have be led to expect that must be kept day two at lima now saw that have be mistaken in surmise apparently second body of prisoner have arrived sooner than be expected consequently authority have decided that chilians must commence march without delay captive be now ordered to stand up be formed into one company of five men deep after be done number of peruvian brought in couple of wagon at once began to unload taking therefrom number of pickax shovel be then served out among prisoner man be given one of tool reason for jim discovered be that there be not sufficient implement at sorata to supply new labourer so prisoner be compelled to carry with tool wherewith be to do work when reached destination carrajo exclaimed douglas under breath a watched fellow prisoner shoulder pickax shovel do fool of peruvian know what be doing why be absolutely delivering into hand be wondering by what mean must be able to overcome hundred armed soldier while on march now that have got thing will be easy be aroused from reverie by receiving heavy blow on shoulder hearing rough voice exclaim now then wake up stand there dreaming day what be thinking about here catch hold of spade pickaxe be share have have be good idea excellent joke to make rascal carry tool with be going to make work when reach mine be now get into place look sharp will be on march in few minute hope honour wo find weight too heavy for will come off rather badly if do jim clutched tool with grasp of drowning man there be joy in heart a shouldered for did not regard a tool rather a precious mean by to regain liberty find too heavy well rather thought not must not part with now that be on account for scheme of escape have come into mind believed must easily put into practice if must secure co operation of fellow prisoner there be more time at present for thought column be on point of departure bugle rang out shrilly from somewhere in courtyard stentorian voice barked out certain order peruvian guard closed up round captive then just a dusk be falling gate be thrown open column of three hundred men marched out of lima castle into broad street on road to sorata nothing must be done night jim decided week elapsed before must even speak to companion upon subject be uppermost in mind then one evening shortly before midnight when vigilance of guard have somewhat relaxed jim found opportunity softly wakened man next to whispered earnestly to for about ten minute chilian officer listened intently then awoke companion in turn passed idea on to thus word percolated through sleeping camp before morning one of chilians who must be trusted have be informed of jim plan have agreed to be on watch for signal young englishman have promised to give upon very first opportunity presented a being likely to promise success chapter sixteen red day of cuzco fortnight have passed since memorable night upon jim communicated plan of escape to fellow prisoner still opportunity have come for chilians to make bid for freedom for day after douglas have communicated with weary men have brightened up considerably spark of hope glimmered in midst of darkness gave strength to bear up under many misfortune a day after day came went without signal being given dull despair have taken place of hope many worn out soul sick man fell down in dusty road never to rise again belonging a bulk of prisoner did to southern race be very easily cheered up cast down despair be deeper for short interval of hope have be given majority of seemed to have almost resigned to fate be looking forward to nothing better than lifelong captivity in mine of sorata to extent indeed be case jim realised that unless opportunity must very shortly occur whereby must put scheme into execution companion must be too profoundly dispirited to attempt to make use of chance of escape when must actually arrive have told however at outset that must be folly to make attempt while crossing mountain for even must contrive to get away must be in heart of hostile country where might easily be recaptured young englishman plan have be to wait until got farther south when must again be comparatively close to coast so that might escape thither trust to being able to get away in boat long protracted waiting coupled with intense cold experienced up among mountain be fast taking heart out of prisoner jim saw that unless attempt be made almost at once everything must be lost be now nearing cuzco having travelled nearly distance to sorata weary men hoped to sleep very night in ancient capital of inca jim have managed to interchange few hasty word about mid day with officer of own group men of high courage of advanced rank have come to conclusion that escape must be attempted very night must fail to reach cuzco night after leaving that city must happen to arrive there day few be only men who have retained courage unimpaired jim felt that must rely upon must not do decided to wait longer although cuzco lay among mountain must be better to make attempt there trust to being able to get away to sea coast than be obliged to defer indefinitely word to be on watch ready be therefore passed round immediately after mid day halt be astonishing to see how news brightened up weary men made new being of indeed jim almost felt sorry that have not delayed message until evening for felt alarmed lest guard must observe change guess at cause seemed however to take notice of forlorn procession moved forward slowly along great dusty road have not be repaired since time of pizarro conquest hour after hour went by there be still sign of city of sun so that by time that four o'clock arrived douglas decided that escape must have to be attempted very night just before dusk cloud have be covering heaven day long broke glorious setting sun shone out in majesty there before in distance fifteen mile away beam fell on city of cuzco gilding glorifying until actually did present appearance of city of gold be magnificent sight drew exclamation of admiration delight from chilians weary a be hoped that view have just obtained of place be that must ever see of a must be if fortune must favour night be now perfectly evident that must not be able to reach cuzco that evening a darkness be fast coming on peruvian began to look about for suitable place in to camp for night about mile farther on must be seen through gathering gloom small hillock crowned with great rock boulder apparently remains of ancient inca fortification struck douglas a place might have be made on purpose for attempt must guard be induced to pitch camp there be casting about in mind for scheme by might be induced to select spot a halting place when officer in command of troop rose in stirrup pointing to hillock with sword exclaimed there over yonder be place for mi hijos will encamp among boulder will be a comfortable there a in city of cuzco forward guerreros will soon be there will have good long rest to night ay that will inhuman scoundrel muttered jim will not be sort of sleep of be thinking however prisoner guard pushed forward in about ten minute time group arrived at foot of little hill at once began to climb now wonder thought jim whether next time tread road will be a free men once more god grant success night for if fail there will be second chance for other officer seemed to be occupied with similar thought for examined whole place surroundings very carefully a ascended evidently in order must attempt be successful might be able to find way down in darkness at last summit be reached before weary men must enjoy rest of stood in such great need be obliged to unload tent provision from pack mule peruvian being much to lazy to do anything for be therefore about eight o'clock by time that tent be pitched evening meal prepared when food be ready prisoner ate a much a must for did not in least know where must obtain next meal having be done pot pan have to be cleaned put away so that be tolerably weary company at last sought tent to lie down rest not to slumber there be not single chilian among to whom plan have be revealed who closed eye lest must fall asleep thus not be ready when momentous signal must be given long before have be ascertained that there be four key for purpose of locking unlocking prisoner manacle one being held by captain while other three be distributed in turn among soldier being given to three different men day for better security of prisoner to make sure that there must be tampering with guard jim have be keeping eye very wide open through day have noticed of peruvian be men who have key in possession that night while have also carefully marked position where have thrown down to sleep two of soldier have retired to tent third have fortunately elected to sleep in open a night be very warm plan arranged be for jim group of manacled fellow officer to crawl forward kill stun one of gaoler must be too risky to tackle more than one secure key unlock own fetter then to go silently round setting free companion when be at liberty be to seize shovel pickax with attack slumbering soldiery killing a many a possible before be fully awake must seize rifle must be discovered before work be complete who be free be to keep off peruvian while remainder be set at liberty sounded rather barbarous scheme jim must think of other must be at likely to be successful be by time rendered altogether too hardened by privation ill treatment to feel very much pity for callously brutal peruvian guard besides be life theirs have difficulty in choosing young englishman waited until midnight in order to allow soldier to get well asleep then silently nudged companion to make sure that be awake be very wide awake too after few low voiced instruction from douglas little body of men began to crawl away through darkness taking utmost care that there must be clanking of chain to betray movement forward on hand knee went moving together soon passed through rank of comrade who did not make single movement while gallant little band crawled past soon have left chilian part of encampment behind few minute later jim who be leading man of party came abreast of first peruvian tent night be pitchy dark although there be young moon for sky be covered with dark low lying cloud be better for lessened probability of being seen by sentry have to exercise great deal of caution to avoid colliding with so disturbing soldier who have elected to sleep out in open now whispered jim a came abreast of certain tent looming up dim ghostly in darkness pedrillo be sleeping just outside tent forward men carefully for life one false step now will be lost come along remember must be quick silent at at work have to do there must not be so much a single struggle companion now came up abreast of douglas instead of following in single file still abreast crawled toward slumbering custodian of key nearer nearer drew until only few yard separated from prey then only few foot be almost within arm length of now silently crept forward again then paused only sound be that caused by heavy breathing of victim soft hissing breath of executioner now crept forward again until be close to man jim plucked sleeve of chilian nearest to together leaned over gaoler now hissed jim four men flung upon fellow body at same moment that douglas hand clutched throat there be short quick scuffle be over in second have snatched key from dead man girdle be feverishly unlocking comrade fetter then in turn unlocked in le than five minute twelve men be free back sped to own portion of camp be soon unlocking friend manacle with result that in le than twenty minute at least chilians be free stood grasping pickax shovel ready for fight be inevitable before must get away then horrible thing happened among chilians be naval petty officer surly cunning faced creature whom nobody trusted from whom therefore particular of plot have be kept secret jim have just inserted key in manacle when traitor shrieked at top of voice help help chilians be escaping why fellow did nobody ever knew be surmised that being too much of craven to attempt to escape have hoped to purchase own freedom by betraying comrade must have be mad to do thing surrounded a be by chilians for might have felt certain that before assistance must reach must be dead mischief however be done slumbering camp be effectually alarmed sentry squibbed off rifle then reloading began to blaze away into chilian encampment captain harsh voice be heard giving order in few second peruvian soldier have formed up in line fixed bayonet be prepared to charge quick exclaimed jim seize shovel pickax repel attack will help manuel take key free others while who be already free keep peruvian at bay be cool keep calm will be well will defend tossing key to manuel jim seized shovel put at head of men charge charge roared fifty free chilians charged straight at place where peruvian be known to be next second sanguinary ferocious struggle have commenced in darkness peruvian hearing chilians approach have levelled rifle poured withering volley into charging men with murderous effect rifle once emptied condition be somewhat more equal for quarter of hour combat raged furiously such unequal contest must not last very long soldier be able during pause in struggle to reload rifle being done mowed chilians down by dozen manuel did work well liberated men who straggled up by two three did not prove very valuable reinforcement for prisoner then to crown misfortune moon came out flooded battle ground with light light be that peruvian needed to enable to turn one sided combat into massacre chilians mowed down by score at last threw down primitive weapon called for quarter soldier rendered still more ferocious by sight smell of blood continued to fire into defenceless prisoner until be sated with slaughter then hapless band be surrounded once more unhurt least seriously wounded men be manacled afresh mortally wounded be simply bayoneted a lay friend being unable to stay murderer hand at last be over casualty be counted up roll called peruvian have lost eleven men killed whereas chilians be reduced to forty told scarcely one of whom did not bear more le serious wound on person peruvian captain be furious at what called dastardly attack of chilians on men swore to take full complete revenge when next morning must arrive wretched men be then allowed to lie down once more sleep if must thus remaining hour of ghastly night passed slowly away next morning a soon a day dawned captain garcia y garcia having appointed sergeant corporal to assist constituted two assistant into what called court martial then proceeded to try prisoner jim promptly pounced upon a ringleader subjected young englishman to short examination however be merest farce for captain have already determined upon fate after trial lasting perhaps five minute therefore jim be condemned to be shot before mid day a be nine more of unfortunate companion remaining thirty chilians be sentenced to receive flogging of hundred lash a soon a arrived at mine captain garcia y garcia promised that must be man to supervise punishment ten men who be condemned to death be then separated from rest of troop be told to seat on ground at little distance away where be at once surrounded by guard garcia y garcia then selected squad of twenty peruvian soldier told off for firing party be then formed up in single line ordered to load rifle with ball cartridge when everything be in readiness ten unfortunate prisoner be brought forward made to stand also in line with back against huge rock be to serve a background jim found for second time in life facing firing party condemned to death time there seemed to be hope possibility of reprieve be surrounded by cruel men who have feeling save of brutal nature seemed a though power on earth must save jim be very thankful that attempt be made to blindfold for have have bandage round eye on previous occasion knew from experience that suspense of waiting for squad to fire not knowing what be doing meanwhile be worse than death must possibly be at last fatal moment came unlucky men shook hand with one in sad farewell doomed men then stood to attention soldier examined breech of rifle to make sure that be properly loaded then came word ready twenty rifle came up to soldier hip a though by machinery at second word of command barrel glinted in sun a men planted rifle butt in hollow of shoulder jim involuntarily cast eye skyward a waited for final word lip be seen to move slightly painful pause then garcia y garcia voice rang out loud clear triumphant fire there be simultaneous crash a rifle be discharged jim felt sharp stinging sensation in left side in arm a fell back upon ground body fell second after own lay right across face jim have actually put up hand to push away corpse before realised that be not at severely hurt be recalled to sens by hearing captain voice commanding men to reload fire again into heap of corps to make assurance doubly sure a put jim have presence of mind enough to abstain from making further movement though suffered agony of suspense while waiting for second discharge came at last douglas escaped yet second time although body lying above own be riddled with bullet englishman must feel now that bullet struck have passed between left side left arm grazing inflicting injury worth speaking of must escape after must have brain blown out a lay question be soon answered for even a be thinking about body be hauled off face soldier shouted why captain here be man who be still alive garcia y garcia ran up stood over jim looking down at with eye glittered with savage menace half turned away to give order for jim death when checked expression gradually changed presently spoke think will shoot to day senor chileno although know may not change mind later however will spare once for deserve to escape death after having be shot at twice get up hardly able to believe ear jim rose to foot be immediately secured to chain once more then still in dream heard command given to march sadly depleted company moved down side of knoll leaving nearly seventy unburied corps lying on summit how very differently thing have looked yesterday at hour thought jim how sadly everything have changed between now yesterday lay blood red day of cuzco day jim knew must never forget so long a lived chapter seventeen curious discovery after dreadful episode near cuzco heavy gloom settled down upon poor remnant of prisoner group marched forward ever forward in sullen hopeless silence jim made several effort to put fresh heart into comrade to persuade that everything be not lost even yet if must pull together told that mine be still distance away that second attempt at escape might perhaps be so engineered a to be successful be to purpose unhappy chilians have completely lost heart moreover seemed to think that ill success have attended effort at cuzco be in measure due to young englishman who have a put misjudged time jim soon found that be everywhere greeted with sullen look instead of with cheery smile be once accorded therefore gave up idea of inciting to attempt came to conclusion that must have to make escape alone if be to be made determined that henceforth must keep intention secret from others must not even invoke assistance for feared treachery on part in temper that then possessed watch a might however young man must find opportunity for guard have redoubled vigilance kept especially sharp eye on jim for be considered by peruvian to have be ringleader of cuzco affair indeed soldier quite failed to understand why captain garcia y garcia have shown mercy on occasion young englishman also kept eye open carefully marking in mind route by have come so that might find way back along upon future occasion have now left strictly mountainous region have entered upon flat dusty tableland in midst of lake titicaca be situated be for northern end of lake that party be now heading then one day at dawn beheld magnificent sight there before lying at slightly lower level than surrounding country lay blue water of lake shimmering in sun whose beam have already gilded snowy summit of mount sorata lay little to south eastward be at foot of giant among mountain that village of sorata be situated jim realised that long journey of seven hundred mile be nearly ended be exactly one month after tragedy of cuzco that way worn troop marched into village fearful looking lot of scarecrow prisoner be by time in truth have scarcely rag to back while boot stocking have long since worn away from foot have to tramp along barefooted be lean gaunt with scarcely ounce of flesh on poor starved body in fact presented appearance of squad of skeleton rather than of living men tanned a be to deep mahogany colour by fierce sun strong air with hair growing down upon shoulder with coarse matted beard one must have believed that few short month ago many of men be among smartest best dressed officer in chilian army navy jim looked a bad a rest have one advantage others have not for under tattered rag brave heart beat a strongly a resolutely a ever whereas chilians have entirely lost courage sun be just setting long day work be over when chilians arrived be just in time to see prisoner who be already there taking evening meal few half starved cur have run out to meet new arrival now jumped barked savagely around in transport of fury at seeing few new face village if such must be called consisted simply of number of long wooden hut roofed over with corrugated iron of hut be used a barrack for convict a quarter for guard still larger number a engine boiler machinery store house for purpose of extracting storing silver from ore whole place be intersected by narrow gauge tram line upon be run little wagon couple of men must push for bringing raw material from mine to smelting house several of standing about in various part of village added to general uncouthness desolation of scene jim felt that if be compelled to stay here for very long must go mad with very dismalness horror of surroundings be not allowed very much time for reflection for directly much diminished roll be called prisoner be conducted to shed containing large number of sack of crushed indian corn staple food of indian in peru here small quantity of unappetising stuff be served out together with tin can to man corn made into sort of porridge by boiling with water be to constitute prisoner evening meal be given to understand that other meal must consist of same food unfortunate men who have be freed from shackle a soon a arrived at destination then took tin making a comfortable a must in prisoner compound proceeded to boil eat unwholesome looking porridge by time that be done darkness have fallen village be lighted up by mean of rough paraffin lamp hoisted on pole by light of prisoner be now herded together once more marched away to long iron shed in be told must have to sleep before entering hovel number of peruvian soldier brought out quantity of clothing made on purpose for convict chilians be ordered to strip put on jim be very glad to have suit although consisted of only pair of rough blue serge trouser kind of jersey jacket for own garment be so torn ragged that be hardly sufficient to cover be then told that pair of clog must be served out to of next morning at daybreak when work must commence now be expected to turn in for night according to rule governing little convict settlement iron roofed shed looked even more uninviting inside than outside down side be ranged narrow platform be divided into bed by narrow strip of wood about three inch in height covering allowed be pair of very old dirty blanket of mattress there be sign not even loose straw being provided whole interior be dirty odoriferous beyond description however considered jim philosophically prisoner can not be chooser having arranged blanket a comfortably a be possible under circumstance turned in slept sleep of utterly weary next morning be awakened by hideous clanging noise proceeded from huge gong hung in courtyard everybody immediately sprang out of bed folded up blanket streamed out into courtyard where jim noticed there be narrow stream of running water availed of to have good wash proceeding excited laughter of gaoler many of whom looked a though have never touched water in form during whole of life having be done procured tin daily allowance of meal prepared breakfast for have excellent appetite when be over prisoner be told off in group of ten soldier with loaded rifle mounting guard over section be marched away one by one until only one group remained jim have not yet be apportioned to party soon found that captain garcia y garcia have represented to governor a being most dangerous character so that be to have guard to not to be allowed near other prisoner arrangement suited jim admirably for have already made up mind that if be to escape at must be alone must have much better chance of getting away while working by than must get if be one of gang for must be strange indeed if strong able bodied young englishman must not get better of mere peruvian soldier therefore accepted situation with much satisfaction however took care not to show marched off toward mine with guard when arrived at place where be to work saw that word mine hardly described place for be not in least like english mine so called mine consisted of number of ancient inca working after having lain idle for hundred of year have be again started by peruvian instead of shaft being driven down into earth gallery being cut in various direction from shaft mine simply consisted of tunnel driven horizontally into side of hill be primitive method one adopted by inca ground be so rich ore so plentiful that method be found a good a other cheaper than most there be score of tunnel of have be exhausted abandoned while ore be being taken out of others by truck load at time little narrow gauge tram line running from tunnel mouth right down into village by time jim have arrived at allotted post fellow prisoner have disappeared elsewhere found to great joy that be working on side of hill remote from other convict must hardly conceal satisfaction for everything be falling out much better than must possibly have expected under influence of newly awakened hope became quite chatty affable with sentry who gradually thawed under englishman flow of talk high spirit douglas now found that be not expected to extract ore for indeed there be tram line here whereby must be carried away particular tunnel have be closed up by fall of rock a long ago a sixteenth century have never since be worked a peruvian thought that there might still be good supply of ore there have determined to open once more then be jim task approached blocked up tunnel mouth determined to do a much work a possibly must thus endeavour to earn sentry good will for that decided must be first step on road to freedom by time dusk have fallen work have ceased for day douglas have cleared away several cubic yard of rubble from tunnel mouth have also impressed sentry so favourably that latter not only thought lucky in having charge of so docile prisoner also decided that must not be necessary for to exercise quite so much vigilance a have expected to be obliged to do morning after morning englishman peruvian went up to tunnel two soon became to appearance very excellent friend jim steadily worked way farther farther into tunnel sentry sat at entrance thereto smoking dozing instead of standing close beside prisoner during whole day a have done at first douglas be delighted for be precisely what wanted soldier suspicion be being lulled to sleep very effectively jim told that time be fast approaching when might try to hoodwink fellow still further however in order not to act too hastily allowed few more day to elapse then one morning during mid day meal entered into conversation with peruvian adroitly keeping conversation a personal a possible leading fellow on to talk about be easy task that jim have before a very soon found sympathised with man in little trouble advised what to do to make matter easier for consequence being that douglas passed whole afternoon sitting down talking with soldier with result by evening two be a friendly together a even jim must wish peruvian government now appeared be in habit of giving prisoner small bonus for cubic yard of rubble ore be removed above certain fixed quantity bonus jim laid out to earn with result that very soon have nice little hoard of peseta laid out on such comfort a village provided also took care to keep gaoler well supplied with cigarillo proved best prescription for keeping in good temper so that by time three month have slipped by man have ceased to keep guard over prisoner at left to excavate tunnel unwatched while sat down on shady side of rock to enjoy tobacco thing be now indeed shaping very well for jim having lulled gaoler suspicion young man next set about getting together small store of provision secreted little by little behind great boulder found about fifty foot inside mouth of tunnel month later have accumulated what considered to be enough provender to last with care until must reach sea coast nearest chilian outpost at time be lying somewhere near caraguara next thing told be to wait for favourable opportunity to escape while waiting put energy into work so that might have a much money a possible when time came for to make attempt be quite usual thing now for guard whose name jim have ascertained be carbajal to lie down behind rock sleep smoke while charge laboured in tunnel one day jim crawled over to rock where lay took good look at fellow be sitting with back against rock fast asleep rifle be lying about three foot away from peaked cap be tilted over eye if must only go to sleep like in morning thought jim must be well for escape must have to be made very early in order that fugitive might get good long start before absence be discovered when roll be called at douglas have now quite nice little stock of money soon made up mind what to do one evening before going to sleeping barrack bought bottle of aguardiente from indio with whom have made friend procured large quantity of coca leaf put into bottle of spirit to soak overnight knowing that by morning strong liquor must have absorbed cocaine out of leaf next morning extracted leaf recorked bottle carefully secreted under coat for have determined to make escape very day then went up to tunnel followed by guard who lay down behind usual rock directly arrived at work jim considered for few second whether must offer man bottle at once later finally determined in favour of latter in order to avoid arousing guard suspicion to give opportunity to get thoroughly thirsty in hot sun jim then went into tunnel walked down to far end not to work however for determined to save up a much a possible in view of future contingency therefore sat down with back against one of tunnel wall must not close eye lest must inadvertently drop off to sleep have be staring abstractedly at opposite wall for minute when dawned upon that one of block of stone of be composed have very curiously symmetrical appearance longer gazed at more convinced did become that slab be not nature handiwork at that of man in moment sort of legend vaguely flashed through mind knowing that tunnel have be originally used by inca have not be opened since began to wonder whether curious circumstance be worth investigating soon decided that be seizing pick inserted point at edge of slab attempted to lever stone away resisted for so long however that be beginning to think stone be after more than part of natural rock when under more than usually vigorous pull saw move forward slightly now wrenched at more determinedly than ever in few second have satisfaction of seeing heavy slab totter then fall outward on to floor of tunnel douglas be provided with match lantern for purpose of work lost time in exploring cavity stone have disclosed with eager finger searched probed about for time found nothing then hand suddenly encountered something that felt metallic heavy upon bringing to light found that held in hand small golden image three inch high evidently representing god rimac spurred on to new effort in few minute have extracted five other little figure from same place jim believed that have now emptied cache be on point of abandoning further search since time be flying be just feeling round hole for last time when hand came in contact with something else last object brought to light proved to be nothing le than roll of inca paper coarse material made of wool of vicuna priest be accustomed to use in keeping record be probably prize of considerably greater value than gold jim thought carefully opened with trembling finger a quite expected must make nothing of for be written in ancient inca character few white men have ever seen only small number of indian directly descended from ancient peruvian race be able to decipher there be not much of douglas guessed that value must be great must not have be hidden so carefully away therefore folded up carefully put together with little gold figure in pocket then left cave with bottle of aguardiente meant to present to carbajal fellow be already very nearly asleep a happened be moreover very thirsty consequently jim offer be accepted with almost indecent haste a matter of fact carbajal put bottle to lip moment jim held out to only removed when be nearly gone ah senor sighed soldier a wiped lip that stuff be good always be good when one be thirsty what curious flavour have with not that be disagreeable taste mind indeed rather like be somewhat different from stuff one usually get here ah replied douglas can see that be unused to taste of aguardiente be perhaps long time since tasted however there be plenty more where came from so be chary of using besides can see that be thirsty after having offered jim taste of spirit declined much to carbajal satisfaction that worthy again raised bottle to lip finished content flinging empty bottle away a soon a have done so then composed a comfortably a must against rock tilted cap over eye again after preliminary grunt two announced that felt tired wished to be left alone jim be not slow in taking hint instead of returning to tunnel took up position from must watch fatigued warder kept eye fixed on fellow very soon have satisfaction of seeing carbajal fall over on side completely overcome by potency of drug with spirit have be doctored jim at once left hiding place crept cautiously forward presently reaching carbajal side then proceeded to shake lightly at first afterwards more vigorously until saw that nothing must wake for at least dozen hour next thing be to carry man into tunnel once there douglas lost time in stripping off fellow uniform clothing therein then fastened on leather belt with cartridge pouch attached possessed of carbajal carbine completed jim transformation flattered that must now be very easily mistaken for peruvian soldier be of course what desired took one last look round tunnel felt in pocket to make sure that have transferred to golden image document a well a other belonging marched boldly out of cavern clang clang clang clang at moment there came rolling up from village sound of alarm bell cutting sharply into jim meditation knew in moment have occurred perverse fate have prompted prisoner to seize precise moment in to make dash for liberty alarm be being given for few second jim hesitated considering then with hurried look round started off down hillside at full speed leaping rock boulder everything else came in way soldier be already pouring out of barrack chapter eighteen escaped be indeed sorry trick fortune that perverse jade have played meditated jim chance be too that fugitive must take same direction a douglas in case must probably be captured thought gave wing to young englishman foot went bounding away down hill like startled deer thinking of nothing getting to cover a quickly a possible unfortunate fact be that there be place within at least mile where man must be concealed jim knew well that long ere must reach strip of forest on be keeping eye must be in full view of pursuer must happen to come way be more than probable stay though be fugitive taking same direction there be not so much clamour perceptible now jim pulled up suddenly to listen at same time looking back along way by have come for few second dead silence reigned jim be beginning to congratulate that chilian have taken course when round corner of hill saw figure emerge flying along at tremendous pace leaping obstacle came in way moment later heard renewed uproar of shout curse observed that other fugitive be heading directly for doubtless with pursuer hard on track then at critical moment idea flashed through jim brain did not believe that fugitive have yet caught sight of while soldier must not reach corner for few second hoped like man shot jim flung prone on ground commenced to crawl toward large boulder have just caught sight of in le than minute be ensconced behind rock be just big enough to afford concealment to one man if man have sense to remain perfectly motionless then stretching flat upon ground jim cautiously peered round edge of boulder in order to keep eye upon escaping prisoner for plan have come into head thought might possibly be successful be certainly only one offered hope of being able finally to get clear away douglas have suddenly remembered that be wearing peruvian soldier uniform idea be to allow fugitive to pas then join in chase trusting to luck that pursuer must mistake for one of must of course take care not to overtake chilian let poor man get away if must by mean thought that if must lead pursuit so to speak might be able gradually to out distance rest of soldier thus finally get clear away by allowing peruvian to imagine that be still keeping up pursuit must man be caught however jim trusted to being able to slip away unseen amid excitement especially if capture must happen to take place anywhere near strip of forest country mile so ahead very few second sufficed to show jim that have not be seen by chilian that latter did not intend to avail of insecure hiding place a rock afforded for went dashing past at full speed leaving jim about hundred yard to left just a man fled by heavy gasp for breath sounding marvellously loud in still air first of pursuer put in appearance round corner of hill quarter of mile away carrying carbine at trail be immediately followed by about score more soldier who began to shout hoarse a came in sight of quarry then several of peruvian pulled up dropping on knee levelled carbine began to blaze away at running man douglas prayed that unhappy creature might not be hit for if be must bring pursuit to end in precise spot where jim must not possibly avoid being discovered need not have be alarmed shooting be execrable bullet flew everywhere near fugitive several of flattened against face of boulder behind douglas be lying one nearly blinded with dust threw up a plugged into earth just in front of face peruvian did not keep up target practice very long for found impossible to hit runner realised that gained lot of ground when pulled up to fire therefore rose to foot dashed along in pursuit once more only occasionally discharging weapon pistol wise in hope of lucky bullet finding billet now be approaching rock where jim be concealed in very few second must be prepared to act to act quickly too evidently have idea that second prisoner be so close to for to young man great relief be aiming to pas rock at distance of quite eighty yard closer closer came a did so jim gradually edged way round rock in such manner a to keep out of sight a far a be possible moment suspense leading soldier have passed rock without giving so much a glance then man panted past until presently rearmost peruvian went grunting gasping by in second jim have sprung to foot be scudding along in wake of rearmost soldier at same time edging away to right of rock in such manner a to bring directly behind group of peruvian then put on pace little found that must easily outrun of soldier since be quite fresh while be already somewhat winded soon overtook last soldier began to pas heart in throat with apprehension lest fellow must recognise a one of chilian officer shout discovery to rest fellow although somewhat astonished to find that there have be comrade behind while thought that be rearmost man paid little attention to supposed comrade being too much out of breath to do much thinking douglas passed unsuspected meanwhile kept eye on chilian who although obviously failing in speed be rapidly nearing belt of forest jim then put on spurt passed second soldier then still without attracting particular attention to few minute later found that be leading entire party of pursuer so far so good back be now presented to have therefore opportunity to recognise feature yet while ran have very unpleasant feeling that might expect bullet to strike between shoulder blade at moment bullet did not come must tell by diminishing sound of trampling foot that be still steadily drawing ahead of rest of soldier at moment chilian plunged into thick brushwood be in few second lost to sight while yell of angry disappointment execration went up from pursuing soldiery now muttered douglas to if fellow only know what be about keep cool must be able to make escape without much difficulty too plunged forward at top speed in order that also might get into wood well in advance of soldier for own chance of escape depended upon being able to give comrade slip few second more jim saw small opening among brushwood disclosing indian bush path be along that chilian have gone douglas now dashed into wood tearing hand face clothes on sharp thorn with path be bordered once inside wood be out of sight of peruvian hope lent wing to foot fairly flew along narrow pathway until felt must soon catch up chilian if fellow be still ahead even when jim came to comparatively long length of straight path be unable to see one soon came to conclusion that man have very wisely slipped away into thick undergrowth to wait until pursuit have gone past darkness must come on douglas resolved that must do likewise increased pace still more so that might be out of sight before soldier must enter straight length of path where of course must be able to see distance ahead englishman be lucky in finding opening in thick wall of brushwood plunged into brake just second before pursuing soldiery came in sight making tremendous noise a broke way for fervently trusted must not be heard amid uproar that peruvian be creating a soon a have got about ten yard from path flung down at full length upon ground in little open space be clear of thorn to recover breath listen to sound of pursuit at same time examined breach of carbine finding empty loaded wondering at carelessness of guard from whom have so recently taken for second two noise of runner came nearer nearer then suddenly there be loud cry of halt followed by terrific shouting hubbub snapping of small branch crackling of undergrowth trodden down then report of carbine carrajo muttered jim have sighted that unfortunate chilian then wonder how be that passed without seeing poor beggar be afraid that wo show much mercy if catch added there be more shooting from various part of wood men be heard calling to other so jim surmised that must have be false alarm that chilian be still undiscovered soldier be yet rather too far distant for jim to hear what be shouting to one presently approached near enough for to catch word found that be inquiring of one whether there be sign of fugitive whether one have seen that swift running man who entered wood first reply be to effect that chileno have not yet be sighted that runner be of course jim have also mysteriously vanished that latter must be somewhere about that must soon come across douglas be beginning to fear that last part of remark might very soon prove only too true for be evident that peruvian be slowly surely working way through wood toward place where be concealed observing therefore that undergrowth be fairly thin ahead of started to crawl along so a if possible to get out of course of beater before must arrive on spot grasping carbine so that hand covered trigger guard in order to avoid accidental discharge in consequence of trigger becoming caught in trailing twig began to creep forward making a little noise a possible being particularly careful to avoid disturbing bush more than must help soldier luckily for kept up incessant shouting so that be able to guess pretty well relative position after about five minute slow progress through brushwood came to conclusion that have at last got out of way there be too nice little open space wherein must lie hidden without being in momentary fear of being bitten by snake particularly deadly specie of be known to swarm in locality by time jim have recovered breath be eagerly awaiting moment when must be safe to move wondering whether not have better remain where be until darkness set in when be dumbfounded to hear one come crashing through brake apparently quite close by making straight toward must not be chilian for must never be making disturbance unless indeed have gone mad under stress of being hunted so must necessarily be stray peruvian soldier jim at once sprang to foot began to poke about among bush with muzzle of carbine a though searching for somebody who might possibly be hidden among at same time turning back on approaching man who be still pushing way through bush singing softly to a came presently noise sounded very close indeed then still closer when suddenly stopped altogether jim knew that other have seen be doubtless wondering what be doing there dared not turn round for fear of being recognised so continued to poke about among bush a though unaware that one be present then rough voice jim at once recognised a of old enemy captain garcia y garcia broke silence with explosion of spanish profanity desire to be informed why particular unit of force must be thus wasting time instead of joining in pursuit of fugitive douglas at once realised that captain must have come along time after men that have probably only just entered wood also realised that directly turned round garcia y garcia must infallibly recognise in spite of peruvian private uniform be wearing must also see out of tail of eye glitter of drawn sword man carried in hand be necessary to act at once for at moment fellow suspicion might be aroused soldier might come back like flash douglas wheeled round bringing carbine up to hip a did so looked officer full in face while forefinger curled caressingly round trigger captain life hung by thread knew for have recognised jim a escaped prisoner moment that latter showed face ah gasped garcia face turning ghastly white be that scoundrel of englishman from whom have stolen clothes senor went on at same time taking fresh grip of sword hilt moving slightly nearer to douglas be lucky thing for jim that have never removed eye from of garcia for saw murder be lurking in garcia be trying to put off guard by asking question jim saw have barely time to raise carbine when officer sword flashed in air next second must have smote full upon douglas head young man caught blow on barrel of weapon turning blade aside at same instant pushed muzzle of carbine into garcia face pulled trigger there be sharp ringing report peruvian fell backward among bush with head blown to piece jim hastily pushed corpse out of sight reloaded rifle then started to run a hard a must for knew that explosion must not possibly pas unnoticed in echoing wood indeed immediately heard chorus of excited shouting coming from somewhere away on left therefore picked up heel ran for life luckily came upon path running at right angle to main path into plunged stripping off long military overcoat a ran after running for about ten minute getting thoroughly out of breath stopped to listen to great relief found that sound have died away that part of wood where found be a still a grave therefore pressed on again not so fast a before in hour time fancied that wood be beginning to grow le dense that be therefore coming to boundary proved to be only large wind gap in forest across made way a quickly a possible striking into still denser part of wood on other side be by time beginning to grow dark jim be considering ruefully prospect of having to spend night in forest when thought heard slight noise somewhere among tree near at once brought rifle to ready glared about searching wood with glance to see who what intruder might be next moment sprang behind tree for be certain that there be somebody close at hand must hardly be peruvian soldier so far away from friend thought jim moreover individual be treading stealthily a though in fear of being heard next moment fugitive chilian pushed way cautiously into path looking warily to right left a did so douglas immediately sprang out from hiding place nearly scaring man to death for moment chilian proved to be officer who have formerly be on board o'higgins douglas recognised other instantly at once sat down to talk matter over jim soon found that friend knew part of country very well having be there before that have decided to make for arica be at time in chilian hand jim readily fell in with plan after good long rest two men started away upon arduous journey camped for night on outskirt of wood reached about midnight there made meal off provision have be thoughtful enough to bring provision lasted week by time be approaching region where might hope to find chilian outpost have miscalculated distance chilians have retreated for be week before finally came into contact with chilian force at tacna meanwhile have have to procure food at muzzle of jim carbine for country folk soon perceived that two fugitive be escaped chilian prisoner a soon however a fell in with colonel barros in command of first company of taltal regiment stationed at trouble be over at once provided with mule small escort at same time lending a much money a must spare after stay of three day with hospitable kindly man took departure arriving at arica two day later there before eye a came in sight of harbour lay blanco encalada chilian flagship sight jim thought finest that have ever seen o'higgins be there also together with three other ship two scarecrow lost time in repairing on board respective vessel jim douglas reception on board be one will remember life be instantly shouldered by brother officer carried off to ward room where be made to detail adventure captain admiral being at moment ashore be nearly midnight before jim have finished admiral being still ashore retired to bunk slept sleep of utterly weary next thing knew be that be being violently shaken while voice cried rouse up amigo rouse up admiral have just come on board having be informed of return desire to see immediately hurry up for believe from look of old gentleman that have something good in store for be just nine o'clock breakfast in ten minute so look sharp jim did look sharp dragged uniform out of chest slipped on in le than ten minute be standing shaking hand with admiral riveros chapter nineteen guerilla stronghold buenas dia senor douglas said old gentleman heartily sit down tell about doings since memorable night when left blanco encalada feared that with rest of crew of janequeo have perished in callao harbour fallen into hand of peruvian be even worse so tell be indeed glad to see back again young friend now proceed with report senor if please thus commanded jim plunged into fairly full detailed recital of have befallen since have left flagship only pausing in narrative when riveros wished to be enlightened upon point other admiral continually nodded approbation of what douglas have done lad noticed that paid particular attention to account of silver mine at sorata jim description of country thereabout when young englishman have finished report did in course of about hour riveros suddenly said then may take senor el teniente that be pretty well acquainted with country about sorata did by chance see hear anything of village called coroico during captivity while be escaping coroico mused jim let see yes sir seem to remember hearing place spoken of by warder with whom contrived to become friendly man whose uniform took small liberty of appropriating will remember said that bolivian force be collecting near there for purpose believe of making raid into newly acquired chilian territory exactly just so replied riveros be matter in nutshell now listen to for few moment please a be aware have practically destroyed naval power of peru have also made short work of army wherever have come into contact with in word peru be almost at end of resource government be ready to come to term allowing to keep territory have newly acquired along sea coast namely that strip of land reaching roughly from papos to arica so far so good small portion of territory however belonged to bolivia be a know ally of peru now bolivian government be also ready to surrender land large portion of population will not hear of being given up since only port antofagasta be situated upon rebel suppose may call be trying to displace president of bolivia in order to put in power man who will not accede to chilian demand dr ladislao cabrera be too strong for rebel still retains office having therefore be foiled in direction force of bolivian have be collected by noted guerilla leader named bajos force amounting to about couple of thousand men have entrenched in strong position near coroico whence frequent destructive raid be being made into newly won territory burn slay wherever go in fact leave trail of blood ash behind plain enough for anybody to follow mercy seems thing absolutely unknown among desperado instead of carrying on warfare in civilised manner be committing most dreadful atrocity on chilians civil military who fall into hand now men be menace can not tolerate for unless band be rooted out utterly destroyed there will never be peace safety in northern part of chili have be somewhat long introduction to what have to say teniente be necessary in view of remark be about to make a say work of navy be practically finished be very short of men in army for army have to cover large extent of country have therefore decided to transfer from navy to army to send at head of five hundred men against outlaw be acquainted with country have always carried out most satisfactorily such work a have given to do more than number of men can not a understand be spared five hundred against two thousand be heavy odds admit much will depend upon man who be in charge of smaller force have hesitation in saying that think must have chosen better man for purpose than jim bowed murmured thanks now resumed riveros force be actually ready be waiting to start on march if have not turned up in nick of time must have be obliged to send man for be matter can not wait since be here however will be glad if will start for coroico at once be sorry to be obliged to send away so soon for deserve long rest after that have gone through perhaps commission a captain in army have procured for may be slight recompense for what have be obliged to endure must bring expedition to satisfactory issue think can promise that will be raised to rank of major be think now senor douglas sooner get away better dios guarde al usted further particular may desire to know will be given by captain simpson will find in cabin dios senor ma ver kindly extremely busy old gentleman pushed jim out of cabin without giving opportunity to express gratitude felt for promotion trust reposed in made way at once to simpson cabin in order to get information possible relative to forthcoming expedition when emerged hour so later be beaming with joy pleasureable anticipation for found that task be likely to be very difficult one in consequence of have be provided with squadron of guias cavalry together with couple of field piece simpson have told must find very necessary quickly packed up slender baggage after saying good bye to comrade have rowed ashore there first move be made to establishment of military tailor where procured new uniform weapon then paid visit to cavalry barrack selected charger for inspected troop gave order for to be ready for early start on morrow be fine looking lot of men jim felt that be just sort of fellow for expedition of kind following morning at seven o'clock douglas rode into parade ground found men already drawn up together with two field piece hour later little army clattered out of barrack yard into street past plaza out of north gate swung into road led north eastward toward lake titicaca reaching la paz four day after leaving arica stayed here one day leaving on following morning by force be at foot of mountain must have to traverse before reaching sorata here camped for night pushing forward next day right into heart of mountain at altitude be clothed with thick pine forest cut up by mountain torrent spanned by narrow frail bridge across be very difficult supremely dangerous task to transport horse gun have be among mountain week be approaching fairly close to coroico jim therefore took precaution to throw out scout in direction round little force in order to prevent surprise one evening just before darkness began to settle down one of men came riding in to say that have caught sight of small body of bolivian hovering among hill about mile to right of main body evidently thought young commander guerilla be expecting such expedition a have thrown out outpost there will therefore be little hope of taking by surprise however a there be further alarm a darkness be fast closing down order be given for camp to be pitched for night very soon horse be picketed men be under canvas sentry be posted everything be made snug comfortable for night about nine o'clock feeling greatly fatigued jim turned into tent wrapping in heavy overcoat threw down on ground determined to get to sleep early that might feel fresh fit for next morning when might reasonably expect to get into touch with enemy try a might tired a be sleep refused to visit harder tried wider awake did become also found that be rapidly becoming obsessed by horrible feeling that be not right that there be unknown terrible danger hovering over sleeping camp strove to dispossess mind of such fancy by assuring that sentry be posted everywhere that therefore camp must be early alarmed in event of attack being made be to purpose presentiment only held more firmly in embrace have just looked at watch discovered that be midnight that have be tossing tumbling for three hour when ear caught very faint sound coming apparently from distance away douglas sprang to foot in moment striding to flap of tent bent energy to task of listening intently yes there be again be coming from direction of wooden suspension bridge spanned broad ravine force have crossed about quarter of hour before camping down took form of heavy muffled blow of iron against wood hallo exclaimed douglas there be something wrong here what be sentry doing in second have belted on sword revolver plunged out of tent in direction from sound be coming few minute later arrived at place where sentry must have be standing there be sign of man be nowhere to be seen caramba exclaimed jim believe there have be foul play here began to hunt about among undergrowth for sign of missing man next moment stumbled over something soft fell upon knee putting out hand to save came in contact with rough overcoat in instant jim knew for of sentry somewhat incautiously jim struck match saw at once what have happened to poor fellow have be murdered by having dagger driven between shoulder by jove gasped englishman there have be foul treachery here aha continued starting to foot what be that exclamation be occasioned by sudden booming crash coming from direction of suspension bridge over force have passed before camping with sense of imminent disaster clutching at heart dashed forward in direction of chasm leaving sentry to tender mercy of vulture jim came in sight of bridge rather remains few second later saw at once what have happened dull chopping noise have first attracted attention have be caused by axe stroke bridge have be cut through from farther side allowing to fall into ravine in moment significance of occurrence flashed into douglas mind what if place whereon be camped must prove to be sort of island between ravine suppose farther bridge only way of escape must also have be destroyed like hare jim doubled on track fled back to camp found already alarmed by noise of falling bridge few second sufficed to warn men of what have occurred to arouse in sense of imminent peril horse be saddled bugle rang out tent be struck gun limbered up in ten minute force be dashing along at top speed toward next bridge now realised must not be very far away a galloped jim suddenly caught sound of chopping in distance ahead urged men to greater speed column sweeping along over rough ground like whirlwind be only just in time round bend in road douglas caught sight of score of flickering light saw ravine looming dim black in semi darkness be in time be bridge still intact wondered englishman halt halt yelled halt for life with clatter scraping of hoof chorus of hoarse shout terrific whirl of dust trooper pulled up jim saw on opposite edge of cleft party of bolivian guerilla hacking furiously away with ax at bridge forward with gun be now word few second later two field piece be dragged to front fire opened on outlaw to replied with furious fusillade of rifle bullet several of chilian cavalry falling under murderous fire jim now ordered gun to be loaded with canister shot instead of solid guerilla be unable to face storm of missile men with ax dropped tool took to heel into forest of who be unwounded be to say while greater part fell dead dying into ravine then gradually rifleman retreated keeping up galling fire whole time from evident reluctance to retire douglas guessed that must have strong reinforcement somewhere close at hand there be therefore time to be lost if be to get across unmolested jim be first to go over to other side examine bridge to see whether be still in condition to bear passage of horse gun luckily guerilla have only just begun operation upon structure be hardly weakened at therefore gave signal to men on opposite side in hour whole force be safely across be quite evident that be in very perilous situation completely surrounded by bolivian jim therefore called council of war composed of officer result of be unanimous decision to press forward at hazard strike paralysing blow at guerilla before be fully prepared for if possible jim force must not be very far away now from bolivian stronghold indeed might come upon at moment for gigantic peak of sorata be well in sight jim took bearing from forward pressed therefore going a fast a horse must carry over rough rock encumbered ground taking care to keep scout thrown out round main body strangely enough saw further sign of outlaw jim be beginning to wonder where force be trying to destroy bridge must have hidden when away in distance ahead heard piercing shriek of intense agony there be then pause of few second immediately afterwards scream after scream went wailing up into air jim clenched teeth drove spur into horse cry a did so follow dozen of there be more foul work going on ahead of six men immediately spurred horse out of press followed jim at full speed little squad of men experiencing difficulty in finding direction in to go for piercing shriek be now becoming incessant after five minute so of hard riding jim came within sight of ruddy glare of light shining ahead among tree at once guessed what be going forward almost directly afterwards seven horseman burst into open glade at far end of be gathered group of men who immediately fled into thick brushwood at approach of cavalry not however before jim have caught sight of uniform be worn by bolivian guerilla at end of clearing large fire have be built in form of circle in centre of stood stout wooden stake driven into earth to stake be lashed indian who poor creature be being slowly roasted to death jim men threw from horse drawing sword promptly began to clear away burning wood with blade moment that circle be broken jim dashed through opening cut rope bound wretched indian to stake carried out into open where poor creature be laid down on ground given canteen of water drained eagerly immediately begging for more be given douglas proceeded to examine injury just a chilian main body rode up to satisfaction jim found that man be suffering from nothing more serious than severe scorching guessed that must have be anticipation of torture have made indian send up heartrending scream a soon a poor wretch have recovered from shock have sustained jim questioned a to how came to be in such situation be told that man whose name by way be jose have be guide in guerilla service bolivian believed that be impossible for anybody to find way to stronghold unassisted therefore a soon a chilian cavalry appeared have suspected treachery on part of somebody suspicion focussing in case upon unfortunate jose have therefore put to torture partly a punishment partly to make disclose strength of attacking force guerilla averred must certainly know since there be doubt that have be in communication with be useless said indian for to assert innocence inability to supply information required be simply not believed perhaps be that bolivian be glad of excuse for exercising cruel instinct latter thought jim be more likely cause jose having finished recital of adventure now flung at douglas foot praying that el senor capitan must not abandon in place where must certainly be again captured that excellency must take into service if must do jose averred must be faithful true servant to rescuer for remainder of life must ask reward for service must only ask to be allowed to be near jim to be own private bodyguard in short to do everything that possibly must to show gratitude for timely deliverance jim listened in silence to outburst then somewhat inconsequently inquired do know whereabout guerilla fort be situated jose yes senor do replied man be not more than mile away from here can lead to place by way of road bolivian must never suspect of knowing then said jim will take into chilian service a guide can be own personal servant a well if choose only be careful that play trick with will hang from nearest tree now think be well enough to walk be not yes very well then lead way jose to road of speak sooner root out nest of rebel outlaw better jose did not a jim have expected burst into torrent of protestation of fidelity simply bowed head placed young englishman hand upon in token of submission then said quietly if excellency will follow also give order for men to ride a silently a possible will lead undiscovered to fort in le than hour road be not very good be true everything have be prepared for reception at other approach can tell that must never have stormed stronghold have gone by route being now in readiness men again mounted with indian walking in front swung away to right finding in few minute upon rough wide road traversing edge of ravine inner side of path being bounded by high cliff leaned outward until top edge actually overhung chasm so that be impossible for one at top to molest force passing along road by hurling rock down upon a indian have remarked road be undoubtedly rough must not therefore get along very rapidly half hour have not quite expired when jose laid finger on lip held up hand a sign for troop to halt now mi libertador said man have managed to make journey undetected fort be round bend see in road lie among brushwood little to left of there be broad slope leading up from road to gate in fort be small very seldom used guerilla will not expect attack from quarter for be looking for to approach from opposite direction horse will be of little use for attack if can run up gun will be able to blow in small gate rush into fort over ruin before boliviano can offer resistance jim accordingly dismounted men telling however to take carbine with horse be hobbled gun be then unlimbered loaded when piece be dragged quietly along road by men presently whole force drew up just out of sight of fort ready to make rush a soon a douglas gave signal did by waving sword so a to obviate necessity for shouting command then swiftly men swept out beyond concealment of cliff into open space fronting fort dragging field piece with be immediately levelled at gate fired when chilians dashed into view there be sentry on roof of fort immediately squibbed off rifle alarm be given too late report of rifle be drowned in roar of gun splintering rending of fort gate be first intimation afforded guerilla that enemy be upon from different quarter from whence be expected over ruined gate dashed chilians discharging carbine a went a entered fort threw down rifle drew sabre then began fight most grim terrible bolivian outnumbered assailant by about four to one latter have advantage of complete surprise mowed down savage guerilla by score there be passage leading from gate to interior of fort be soon very nearly choked with dead wounded jim therefore rallied men for charge before way must be quite closed with cheer brave fellow forced passage through for cutting down who opposed so completely be outlaw taken by surprise that many of have not found time to arm be therefore slaughtered like so many sheep promise of success on other hand spurred chilians on to still further effort in ten minute have struck such terror into heart of defender of stronghold that guerilla flung down arm cried for quarter thus at last tide of death be stopped guerilla be then disarmed imprisoned in batch in prison cell have so carefully prepared for others while arm be collected destroyed fort be in hand of chilians terror of surrounding country have be brought to nothing at last there must be no more savage raid midnight massacre messenger be at once dispatched to la paz to acquaint government with fact of capture downfall of guerilla band with request that body of bolivian troop might be dispatched to take charge of prisoner jim determined however not to hand over fort although be situated in bolivian territory until must receive definite instruction so to do from headquarters for did not know what new boundary chili proposed to arrange a limit to country have acquired by conquest from two republic thought more than probable that government must decide to retain fort since occupied such very commanding position therefore in due time handed over eight hundred prisoner rest of band having be killed to bolivian troop who immediately returned with to la paz meanwhile jim repaired fort sufficiently to provide accommodation for own troop with whom temporarily garrisoned place then sent messenger on horseback to arica to report success have be obtained to ask for instruction a to what be to do with fort meanwhile young englishman made up mind that be in for at least fortnight sojourn in fort until such time a messenger must return from arica began to cast about for mean by to while time away chapter twenty fulfilment of prophecy well jose what do make of eh why surely man there be nothing in to frighten be there so spoke jim douglas to indian guide one morning three four day after messenger have be dispatched to arica englishman have found time hanging somewhat heavily on hand up there in lonely mountain fortress therefore having nothing better to do have brought out roll of parchment have found in tunnel at sorata have set to task of deciphering meaning failing entirely however to make sense out of yet somehow convinced that document be of importance have called jose into tent asked whether knowledge of various native dialect be sufficient to enable to translate effect of sight of document upon jose have be peculiar to say least of moment that eye have fallen upon parchment face have turned that peculiar greyish tint dark skin take on in lieu of pallor hand have trembled with excitement other emotion whole demeanour have be so strange a to call forth exclamation from jim above recorded indian made reply for several second sat gazing at document with eye seemed to threaten moment to start out of head then turned parchment over over in hand holding tenderly even reverently a though be extremely precious sacred thing finally pulled together in voice trembling with emotion replied o senor there be nothing in document to frighten have idea at senor continued after lengthy pause what writing refers to of course have not answered douglas somewhat impatiently if knew content must not be under necessity to ask to translate must pardon senor spoke foolishly replied jose let senor however listen to while recount few fact to will then see perhaps why have be so utterly astonished at sight of document long age ago ay long before conquistador appeared in peru indian worked silver gold mine a know abound in country also gathered enormous quantity of precious stone from river bed for purpose of adorning person of inca lord of noble whom deigned to favour a well a for adornment of temple of royal palace by time then that pizarro horde of robber overran land there be million upon million of dollar worth of precious metal precious stone in possession of inca noble have heard of ransom pizarro exacted from atahualpa how large room be twice filled with gold to value of fifteen million of pound well spaniard knew that ransom be small fraction of enormous wealth peruvian possessed did not know a did how very small fraction be have not time enough to secrete treasure for arrival of spaniard be unexpected hid away enormous quantity of gold silver jewel of have be lost irretrievably fear through sudden death of men to whom secret of hiding place have be entrusted peruvian still know whereabout of good deal of vast hoard be being kept for time when new inca will arise who will set at head of army sweep invader of land into sea preparation be made only await arrival of man document into possession of have so strangely come relates to burial of one of hoard tell secret of hiding place a also mean whereby that hiding place may be found be why be so greatly overcome with amazement when showed paper senor be one of descendant of ancient peruvian race since document be written in secret character used by inca can read can say now where treasure be located phew whistled jim be strange story mistake did not think when brought document away that must prove of quite so much importance value although to be sure there be several small gold silver image buried with image ejaculated jose excitedly where be where be oh preserver if really have sign in possession then show senor show pray thus exhorted jim dived into chest have brought with to accommodate belonging produced little image have found in tunnel at sorata jose fell upon knee before in perfect ecstasy of mingled reverence delight turning over over in hand speaking to a though be in very truth alive then presently recovered placing jim hand upon head in token of submission said in trembling voice oh deliverer be prophesied of old that man who possessed figure must also posse treasure for man must be destined to do great thing for benefit of race in addition to have found document there can be doubt therefore that master be man who be destined to receive great treasure for sign point way be willing therefore to translate writing to senor to show way to place where treasure be hidden so that may obtain possession of by jove exclaimed douglas leaning back in chair wiping forehead be most extraordinary affair have ever come across let think what be that old inca witch woman told about treasure being in store for ah yes remember said that one day must come into possession of great wealth that be still hidden in ground that secret of hiding place must one day be revealed to caramba really seems a though inca prophecy be about to come true now jose went on aloud be very curious tale indeed hope be not playing trick with senor saved life only few day ago replied indian be likely must deceive man who rescued from horrible death besides treasure be situated only very short distance from here about day journey so excellency can easily prove whether be telling truth not by accompanying to place seeing treasure with own eye h be said jim yes be of course most satisfactory way of proving matter messenger can not possibly return for eight ten day yet so must have plenty of time to make journey can leave fort in charge of lieutenant munoz a there be really nothing in way of duty to keep here yes think will be best very well jose continued englishman will start early to morrow morning will show way to wonderful treasure house of speak have better not talk too much however about matter whereon will be engaged for there be need to excite undue amount of curiosity about movement make necessary preparation to day will of course know what ought to take with for expedition will let be understood that be setting out for hunt of two three day duration can make early start travel during day encamp on spot for night start work on second day returning here on third ought to give enough time to do what have to do ought not plenty of time excellency returned indian senor need not be afraid that will disclose secret of journey have better take rifle with senor let take one too for be just possible that might be obliged to defend treasure after have secured jose then went away to make preparation while jim remained in tent thinking over very curious train of incident have led up to of morning later in day sent for munoz handed command over to lieutenant during absence giving instruction how to act in eventuality be in least likely to arise next morning just before daybreak set off in company with indian for spot where inca treasure be asserted to be concealed two mule have be loaded with provision tent cooking utensil blanket etcetera in middle of blanket have be concealed couple of pick same number of shovel jim indian carried ordinary army rifle slung over shoulder have bandolier of cartridge strapped round waist so that be well prepared for might befall treasure be buried said jose in cave in side of ravine at spot about twenty mile north eastward of coroico road thither be difficult dangerous one to travel consisting a did for most part of narrow path just wide enough for one man mule to pas skirting edge of tremendous abyss whose bottom must not be seen because of mist veiled many time came to portion of cliff path be so narrow that jim thought must be impossible to get farther managed somehow mule stepping along a though have be used to kind of road life a indeed very probably have for hour two treasure seeker continued to ascend scenery growing more more gloomy country more more barren until at mid day reached summit of pas began to descend then character of scenery rapidly changed left region of bare rock entered upon of forest leaving that in turn for lower land region of tropical foliage with deep ravine crossed by frail bridge made of rattan light branch be just becoming dusk when jose threw up hand a sign for little cavalcade to halt then took careful look round observing formation appearance of surrounding country then made long close scrutiny of document have of course brought with frown of perplexity made appearance between jose eye what be matter mi amigo demanded jim noticing look well senor replied jose paper say that from here one must be able to see close at hand large pinnacle of rock in shape of pyramid be from pinnacle that bearing of treasure cave be to be taken can see such rock anywhere about here be awkward said douglas doe paper say whether be big small column of rock say that be about height of two men excellency replied indian oh then may very easily find hidden away somewhere among thick brushwood replied jim sure enough found rock after hour search during have become almost dark completely covered with thick growth of tropical foliage be able to hing further night light having completely gone by time that rock be finally identified so camped out where be began search again next morning from rock jose now carefully paced off certain distance by ten o'clock in forenoon announced that have discovered spot where treasure lay at foot ran stream approach to have be made by way of gentle grassy slope opposite side of torrent be nothing more than sheer wall of rock hundred of foot in height seemed to jim a though have reached uttermost confines of world have come so far be manifestly impossible to go farther however be not necessary to do so for on opposite side of stream jim saw when jose pointed out to black round opening said indian be mouth of treasure cavern douglas thought that must have be impossible to secure better hiding place for approach to spot be difficult beset with many danger have one arrived at bank of stream whereon two men then stood must never have guessed that little inconspicuous hole on opposite side be entrance to chamber wherein be contained ransom of not of one many king stream though swift flowing be willow adventurer have little difficulty in getting across whereupon found standing on narrow ledge of black rock while four foot above head be lower edge of hole proved to be much larger than have appeared from other side be work of few second only for jim to mount on indian shoulder secure foothold in mouth of cave after assisted jose to climb up a soon a be inside jose seemed to be overcome with awe at idea of standing on such sacred ground jim have such feeling kindling torch bade indian lead way latter soon recovered equanimity after have hauled up pick shovel led way into interior of cave widened out a receded from entrance until assumed enormous dimension light of torch being quite insufficient to disclose boundary of cavern now began to meet with trace of former civilisation along rock wall be ranged stone image of inca wife at foot of figure be to be seen large package wrapped in raw hide secured with strip of same material package jose said contained gold brick jim quickly proved truth of statement by slitting open one two with hunting knife be however toward row of huge chest ten in number that indian led jim telling that real treasure be contained in although strong be quickly broken open by well directed blow of pickax upon lid being raised there burst upon jim eye such vision of wealth that be positively dazed by immensity of particular chest opened be full from bottom to top of solid gold ingot black with age on surface showing dull red metallic lustre of gold when scraped with knife there must have be million pound worth of jim guessed in one chest alone there be nine others two men then opened second box at random chest contained manner of gold silver ornament of most exquisitely delicate intricate workmanship cup necklace finger ring clasp sword hilt breast plate latter studded with rough uncut jewel of enormous size filled chest to very brim took away jim breath with magnificence lavish abundance of other case be opened in turn disclosing to astounded eye veritable treasure of inca jim immediately saw that removal of such vast accumulation of wealth must necessarily occupy considerable time that treasure must have to be conveyed away piecemeal on mule back therefore selected from hoard of uncut jewel a many of finest a believed that jose must conveniently carry wrapped up in two parcel giving one to jose to carry took charge of other done two men closed up chest left cavern returning to spot where have camped on previous nigh during long silent hour while jose be asleep jim kept guard over spoil have already secured made plan for removing rest of treasure decided to dispose of whole of jewel rather a many of a might find necessary with money thus obtained fit out expedition to cavern to bring away remainder of spoil while be wondering how must elude watchfulness of bolivian authority who must pounce upon whole if must get to hear of existence fell asleep be nearly eleven o'clock when awoke next morning two men then secured gem to person started off on toilsome journey back to fort safely reached two day later utterly worn out with fatigue have undergone jim be so completely exhausted that spent whole of day after return upon narrow camp bed by following morning be quite rested burning with impatience for messenger to return so that might sooner get back to civilisation prepare for expedition to treasure cavern be day however before soldier returned having ridden hard night day to deliver jim report to return with order to young commander be to effect that douglas be to leave force in fort chilians have decided to hold for present to return with remaining half to arica a soon a possible therefore set off with reduced company upon following morning jose insisting upon accompanying reached arica week later reporting arrival at military headquarters there where be complimented upon success with have carried out little campaign against guerilla where received promotion to rank of major a have be promised by admiral riveros in event of bringing expedition to satisfactory conclusion there be very little more to tell for by time douglas returned to arica war be practically over a peace negotiation be already in progress hostility have ceased almost everywhere fortnight later treaty be signed whereby bolivia ceded whole of sea coast to chili peru be forced to give up mile of hers to conquering republic peruvian navy have be utterly destroyed with exception of one two ship bolivian army have be cut to piece ally have be obliged to bow knee to chili have everywhere be victorious a fighting be now over jim resigned position in chilian army went to valparaiso where eventually disposed of jewel for very handsome sum of one hundred fifty thousand pound be very much more than have idea must fetch yet considerably le than be actually worth then made journey into mountain accompanied only by jose small escort in order properly to survey place where treasure cave be situated before led expedition there for purpose of recovering remainder of gold jewel to utter consternation found when reached locality that earthquake have recently occurred have changed whole character of surroundings be however at length able to locate spot where cavern have be took such elaborate complete bearing of that felt sure must one day when thing have quieted down little be able to get at chest again despoil of content for moment have a much money a actually needed so returning from coroico bought estate in lovely spot near quinteros bay settled down comfortably there with jose a faithful henchman jim have never married although be now getting somewhat on in year say be quite contented happy with horse dog jose who have never left master side for whole day since eventful night when jim rescued from guerilla for ten long year jim lived in house near quinteros named casa coroico then chilian revolutionary war broke out again took up commission a major fought in rank of congressionalists how fared in campaign be however story a also be that of subsequent adventure in quest of inca treasure be lost during earthquake douglas be now man of nearly fifty year of age declares that be in very prime of life if care to visit in magnificent house overlooking sea there be nothing will give greater pleasure will find than to talk to about wild day of ' when fought against peruvian particular of campaign remembers a precisely a though have occurred yesterday will yarn for hour together about prat condell lynch simpson williams rest of men of english descent for most part who have adopted chili a home country who helped to make republic what now be credit to herself to worthy protege of greater country across sea from sprang noble gallant gentleman who raised chili to position of first of south american republic
