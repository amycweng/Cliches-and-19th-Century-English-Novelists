pirate slaver story of west african coast by harry collingwood be very well written book especially from nautical point of view be written a by midshipman in british warship patrolling west coast of africa especially congo area to try to prevent slave trader especially portuguese from succeeding in effort to get poor captured african over atlantic to cuba in most miserable condition doe work out a simply a for hero harry dugdale be captured in action must have be killed for interest taken in by slaver captain son from there sprang deal with slaver that harry must assist with navigation watch keeping must go below deck when there be action in progress wo tell much more than can not refrain from commenting that book be at least a good a best by kingston though in book action be almost entirely at sea at least on board sea going vessel pirate slaver story of west african coast by harry collingwood chapter one congo river land ho broad on port bow cry arose from look out on forecastle of britannic majesty gun brig barracouta on certain morning near middle of month of november vessel then being situated in about latitude degree minute south about east longitude be heading to eastward close hauled on port tack under rag that crew must spread to light almost imperceptible draught of warm damp air came creeping out from northward so light be breeze that scarcely wrinkled glassy smoothness of long undulation upon brig rocked swayed heavily while lofty truck described wide arc across paling sky overhead from star be vanishing one after before advance of pallid dawn at lee roll canvas flapped with rattle a of volley of musketry to mast sending down smart shower from dew saturated cloth upon deck to fill again with report of nine pounder great slatting of sheet block a ship recovered rolled to windward brig be just two month out from england from whence have be dispatched to west african coast to form portion of slave squadron to relieve old garnet from phenomenal lack of speed have proved utterly unsuitable for service of chasing capturing nimble slaver who despite precaution be still pursuing cruel nefarious vocation with unparalleled audacity success have relieved garnet have looked in at sierra leone for latest news result of visit being that be now heading in for mouth of congo river have be strongly commended to especial attention by governor of little british colony captain commander henry stopford be by mean communicative man being theory of that be mistake on part of chief to confide more to officer than be absolutely necessary for efficient intelligent performance of duty hence have not seen fit to make public exact particular of information thus received have of course made exception in favour of mr young popular first luff a henry dugdale senior mid of barracouta happened to be something of favourite with latter learned from in course of conversation of circumstance be actuating movement intelligence however be of very meagre character simply amounted to large number of african slave be being continually landed on spanish west indian island two boat with crew have mysteriously disappeared in congo while engaged upon search of river for slaver that small felucca named wasp tender to british ship sloop lapwing have also disappeared with hand three month previously after having be seen in pursuit of large brig have come out of river circumstance leading to inference that congo be haunt of strong gang of daring slaver whose capture must be effected at cost be for service that barracouta have be selected being brand new ship especially built for work on west african coast modelled to sail at high speed upon light draught of water be immensely beamy for length very willow drawing only ten foot of water with store ammunition on board very heavily sparred too heavily of thought a for canvas topsail have hoist of of frigate of twice tonnage be certainly beautiful model of ship far away prettiest have ever seen when first stepped on board while speed especially in light wind tolerably smooth water be such a to fill fore aft with most extravagant hope of success against light heeled slave clipper whose business be ours to suppress be flush decked vessel with high substantial bulwark pierced for nine gun of side mounted fourteen pounder carronades four long nine pounder two forward two aft must be used a bow stern chaser respectively if need be although certainly did not anticipate necessity to employ of gun in latter capacity crew told numbered one hundred sixty five be in first lieutenant watch happened to be on deck when look out reported land upon morning upon story open remember circumstance a well a though have occurred yesterday have only to close eye to bring whole scene up before mental vision a distinctly a picture brig be a have already said heading to eastward close hauled on port tack under everything that must set to royal wind be so scant that even light upper sail flapped rustled monotonously to sleepy heave roll of ship be only by glancing through port at small iridescent air bubble that drifted astern at rate of about knot half in hour that be able to detect fact of own forward movement at have be on deck just hour for two bell have barely be struck when first faint suggestion of dawn appeared ahead in shape of scarcely perceptible lightening of sky along narrow strip of eastern horizon in midst of morning star beamed resplendently while air although still warm assumed freshness compared with close muggy heat of past night seemed almost cold so that involuntarily drew lapel of thin jacket together buttoned garment from throat to waist quickly yet by imperceptible gradation lightening of eastern sky spread strengthened soft velvety star lit blue black hue paling to arch of cold colourless pallor a dawn asserted more emphatically while star dwindled vanished one by one in rapidly growing light a pallor of sky extended insidiously north south along horizon low lying bank of what at first presented appearance of dense vapour became visible on barracouta larboard bow presently when cold whiteness of coming day became flushed with delicate tint of purest palest primrose supposed fog bank assumed depth of rich purple hue clear cut sharpness of outline that proclaimed what be land most unmistakably look out be smart young fellow who have already established reputation for trustworthiness more than half suspected character of cloud like appearance when first caught attention therefore kept eye upon be sooner assured of nature than raised cry of land ho broad on port bow first luff who have be for time meditatively pacing weather side of deck from binnacle to gangway with hand clasped behind back glance directed alternately to deck at foot to swaying main royal mast head quickly awoke from abstraction at cry from forecastle springing lightly upon carronade slide with one hand grasping inner edge of hammock rail looked long steadily in direction indicated ay ay see answered when after long steady look have satisfied of character of what gazed upon wheel there how be head east south east sir answered helmsman promptly lieutenant shut one eye raising right arm with hand held flat vertically pointed toward southern extremity of distant land held there for moment murmured point half east half south distant what will say twenty mile ay about that a nearly a may be mr dugdale just slip below let master know that land be in sight on port bow bearing east half south distant twenty mile touched cap trundled down to master cabin door of be hooked back wide open permitting cool refreshing morning air came in through open scuttle free play throughout full length of rather circumscribed apartment in mr robert bates lay snoring anything melodiously entering cabin grasped worthy man by shoulder shook gently calling by name at same time in subdued tone in order might not awake occupant of contiguous berth ay ay be answer a snoring abruptly terminated in convulsive snort ay ay what be matter now youngster have ship tumbled overboard during night have skipper cow gone aloft to roost in main top that come here disturbing with mr bates mr bates sir answered with low laugh at specimen of worthy master quaint nautical humour first lieutenant directed to let know that land be in sight on port bow bearing east half south distant twenty mile what already exclaimed companion scrambling out of cot still more than half asleep landing against with force sent spinning out through open doorway to bring up prostrate with crash in cabin of doctor opposite half stunned by concussion of skull against bulkhead by avalanche of ponderous tome came crashing down upon a worthy medico tier of hanging

in measure recovered scattered sens so scrambled to foot a re hung book shelf replaced book hurriedly explained to good man nature of mishap winding up with humble apology for having so rudely broken in upon what be pleased to call beauty shlape understanding at once that involuntary incursion into privacy of cabin have be result of pure accident paddy a irreverently called baptismal name be william very good naturedly accepted explanation apology composed to sleep again whereupon retreated in good order re entered master cabin old boy have by time slipped on breech coat be bending over table with chart of africa west coast spread out thereon pencil parallel ruler in hand indulged in one two of grimly humorous remark be characteristic of in reference to disturbance of doctor slumber then pointing to dot that have just made upon chart observed if first lieutenant bearing distance be right that be where be about twelve mile off shark point therefore in sounding did see land mr dugdale what be like made a long stretch of undulating hill sloping gently down to horizon at southernmost extremity extending beyond horizon to northward replied ay ay be right be quite right agreed master be that range of hill stretching along parallel with coast on north side of river reaching a far a kabenda point indicating marking on chart a spoke well let go on deck get cast of lead be time that ascertained exact position of ship for deep water channel be none too wide although there seems to be plenty of water for over bank on side have fancy for trusting to sounding laid down here on chart african river be never to be depended upon shoal be constantly shifting where may find water enough to float line of battle ship to day may ground in same ship launch month hence rolled up chart tucked under arm gathered up parallel ruler pencil divider together left cabin made way up hatchway to deck where found first luff still perched upon carronade slide anxiously scanning horizon on bow under sharp of hand a reached deck spark of golden fire flashed out upon horizon on lee bow sun disc soared slowly into view warming tint of long low lying broken bank of grey cloud stretched athwart course into crimson fringing skirt with gold a first beam shot athwart heaving water to ship in tremulous path of shimmering dazzling radiance lieutenant caught glimpse of out of corner of eye a emerged from hatchway at once stepped down off slide on to deck good morning bates said well here be with land plainly in view see be glad that have come on deck to tell just where be for part of world be quite new ground to be closer in than thought be for just before sun rose horizon ahead cleared caught sight of what looked like top of tree on port on starboard bow ca see now for dazzle will presently when sun be bit higher there seemed to be opening indentation of sort between take to be mouth of river ay ay answered bates will be doubt sprang on to slide that young have just vacated took long look at land then turning to helmsman demanded how head east south east sir answered man for second time with information master in turn took approximate bearing of southernmost extremity of range of hill after stepped down on to deck again going to capstan spread out chart upon head of calling to help keep roll open lieutenant followed stood watching a master again manipulated parallel ruler divider yes remarked bates after few moment diligent study be just about where be pointing to mark that have made upon chart while in own cabin see continued glancing out through nearest lee port have reached river water look how brown thick be more like cup of captain chocolate than good wholesome salt water will try cast of lead mr young if please just to make sure though if be fair in channel a think be will get bottom a yet will make headway until wind freshens sea breeze spring up for be already within influence of outflowing current at season of year be rainy season run very strongly little further in lead be hove a bates have anticipated no bottom be found whereupon master rolled up chart again gave order that ship be to be kept going a be returned to cabin while watch mustered bucket scrubbing brush proceeded to wash deck generally make brig toilet for day worthy master be right did not make particle of headway until about nine o'clock when wind gradually hauled round aft freshened to piping breeze before boomed along in fine style until came abreast of low narrow point on port hand protected from destructive action of atlantic breaker by shoal extending three quarter of mile to seaward abreast of point hauled up to northward entered sort of bay about mile wide with low point before mentioned on port hand wide mud bank to starboard beyond be island of considerable extent fringed with mangrove covered with thick bush lofty tree on low point on port hand be two factory trading establishment abreast of be lying two brig barque one of brig flying british other spanish colour while barque sported dutch ensign at mizen peak rounded to just far enough outside craft to give clear berth let go anchor in four fathom of water be queer spot that now found ourselves in queer to at least who be now entering upon first experience of west african service be riding with head to north west under combined influence of wind tide together with low point named banana peninsula so master informed though why must be so named never must understand for there be not single banana tree upon whole peninsula a subsequently ascertained let see where be have gone adrift among non existent banana tree oh yes be going to attempt to make word sketch of scene surrounded after have let go anchor furled canvas sea breeze be piping strong from westward while tide be ebbing down creek from northward under combined influence barracouta be riding with head about north west banana peninsula lay ahead of trending away along larboard beam slightly away from to southward for about mile where terminated in sandy beach bordered by broad patch of smooth water athwart marched endless line of mimic breaker from wall of flashing white surf thundered upon outer edge of protecting shoal three quarter of mile to seaward point be pretty thickly covered with bush tree chiefly cocoa nut other palm except in immediate vicinity in front of two factory where soil have be cleared sort of rough wharf constructed by driving pile formed of trunk of tree into ground wedging few slab of sawn timber in behind point for distance of perhaps mile from southern extremity be very narrow not more than from one hundred fifty to two hundred yard wide beyond that widened out considerably until merged in mainland on opposite side of creek on starboard quarter astern of be what at first took to be single island subsequently found to be group of about dozen island of smallest may have be mile long by about third of mile broad while largest be nine ten mile long by about three mile broad island really constituted northern bank of river for distance twenty four mile up stream being cut off from mainland from other by narrow canal like creek running generally in direction more le east west land about here be low to great extent swampy margin of creek being lined with mangrove presented very curious appearance a stood up out of dark slimy looking water trunk supported upon network of naked twisted root strongly suggested to idea of spider leg swollen knotted with hideous deforming disease tree however apart from twisted gnarled knotted root presented very pleasing appearance for have just come into full leaf fresh green foliage be deeply grateful to eye satiated with long wearisome repetition of panorama of unbroken sea sky beyond belt of mangrove island be overgrown with dense bush interspersed with tall tree of be rich with violet blossom growing in great drooping cluster like flower of laburnum while others be heavily draped with long trailing spray of magnificent jasmine of there be two kind one bearing pinky flower other much larger star like bloom of pure white euphorbia acacia baobab calabash tree be in bloom here there through opening between trunk of mangrove glimpse be caught of rich splash of deep orange colour standing out like flame against dark background of shadowed foliage subsequent investigation proved to be clump of elegant orchid appeared that have entered river at precisely right time of year to behold at brightest best for spring rain have only recently set in nature be rioting in refreshment of welcome moisture bursting forth into joyous prodigality of leaf blossom of colour perfume of life glad activity forest rang with call cry of pairing bird flock of parrot parrakeet love bird be constantly wheeling darting hither thither kingfisher flitted low across placid water watched motionless from overhanging branch for passage of unsuspecting prey wydah bird flaunted gay plumage in brilliant sunshine where must be seen to fullest advantage butterfly like living gem flitted happily from flower to flower astern of three mile away lay boolambemba point southernmost extremity of group of island to have already alluded where embouchure of river may be said to begin stream here being about three half mile across while immediately below abruptly widens to breadth of about five half mile at indentation leading to banana creek in narrow approach to be lying at anchor of course be not possible for to distinguish from where be lying much of character of country on southern left bank of river appeared to be pretty much same a what saw around be to say low land densely covered with bush tree along river margin with higher land beyond about mile beyond broad on starboard bow a be then lying anchorage narrowed down to width of le than mile western extremity of group of island already referred to there converging toward banana peninsula in low mangrove wooded point beyond however must be seen stretch of water about mile half wide subsequently learned ran for several mile up at back of island between mainland in form of narrow willow canal like creek bates master seemed to think might well repay trouble of careful inspection since narrow maze of channel to gave access offered exceptional facility for embarkation of slave choice of route for light draught slaver from place of concealment into main channel of river chapter two receive important intelligence have barely got canvas furled deck cleared when saw fine handsome whale boat painted white with canvas awning spread over stern sheet portuguese flag fluttering from little staff at stern shove off from wharf pull toward be manned by four krumen in stern sheet sat tall swarthy man whose white drill suit white broad brimmed panama hat swathed with white puggaree caused suntanned face hand to appear almost a black a skin of negro crew boat swept up to gangway in very dashing style owner ascending accommodation ladder stepped in on deck with genial smile disclosed splendid set of brilliantly white teeth beneath heavy glossy black moustache good morning sar said to first lieutenant who met at gangway velcome to banana with flourish of hat vat chip dis be eh britannic majesty brig barracouta answered young be portuguese consul here suppose not de consul be answer dere be consul at banana be senor joaquin miguel lobo portuguese trader at savice sar have come off to say dat will be happie to supply chip wid anyting dat may require vattare fresh meat vegetabl ' feesh fruit de fruit not ripe yet plenty fruit by by not ripe yet parrot monkey kind of bird animal yes curiositie plenty curiositie sar here skipper who have be below for few minute re appeared on deck seeing stranger advanced toward whereupon first lieutenant introduced senor joaquin miguel lobo in proper form glad to see senor remarked skipper genially will step below take glass of wine with lieutenant young ver ' happie captain be sure answered senor with sweeping bow flourish of panama forthwith trio disappeared down hatchway to unbounded astonishment for be not quite like extremely dignified skipper to be so wonderfully cordial a to mere trader ah be afraid that wo wash remarked bates catching look of astonishment perplexity on face a turned regard away from hatchway captain mean to pump portuguese if can from cut of senor jib fancy there be not much to be got out of look to be far too wide awake to let become a wise a will be bound that must put up to many good wrinkle if must bless youngster be not going to spoil own trade professes to be honest trader of course deal in palm oil ivory what not of course have doubt doe must mind betting farthing cake that ship precious sight more black ivory than white out of same river look at brig for instance one flying spanish colour mean just look at did ever set eye upon more beautiful hull than look at sweep of run see how come curving round to stern post in delivery so clean that wo leave single eddy behind drag there boy look at side round a apple not inch of straight in do suppose that brig with line like be built for purpose of carrying palm oil not must like to have look at bow will be bound be a keen a knife will see by by when swing at turn of tide yet if brig be overhauled a probably will be nothing whatever of suspicious character must be found aboard except maybe whole lot of cask must say be for stowing palm oil in well here be will have to keep eye open night day to weather upon rascally slaver be a sly a fox always up to new circumventing trick with reflection followed by deep sigh at wily genius of slaving fraternity in general worthy master turned upon heel retired below portuguese remained in cabin for over hour when came on deck again accompanied by captain first lieutenant thought that two latter looked decidedly elated a though despite master foreboding have succeeded in obtaining important information captain be particularly gracious to visitor going even to length of shaking hand with ere passed out through gangway first luff of course following suit a in duty bound then may rely upon to send off fresh meat vegetable early afternoon remarked young a stood at gangway yais yais dey will be alongside by tbee o'clock at de lates answered portuguese a soon a have receive dem have better veigh leave de creek give dat point indicating boolambemba point bert ' of mile veel be right yes thanks will remember returned first lieutenant where be to pick up hus s sh dear sair not so loud if please answered lobo hastily leaving boat coming half way up gangway ladder again dere be leetl creek about two mile pa de point on de nort ' bank of de river vill be on de look out for dere in small canoe vid two men dat can trus mu ' pick up queevk because if eet va known dat have consent to pilot t'roat must be cut before va mont oldaire never fear answered young will keep sharp look out for get on board without anybody being penny wiser good bye portuguese bowed with flourish of hat seated in stern sheet of boat gave word to krumen few minute later be on wharf walking toward factory into open door of disappeared come thought there be something afoot already captain first luff have between evidently contrived to worm intelligence out of portuguese must go tell bates news before must do so however captain who have be standing near gangway listening to what be passing between young lobo caught sight of said mr dugdale be good enough to find mr bates tell that will feel obliged if will come to for few minute in cabin touched hat dived down hatchway gave message whereupon master stepped out of cabin made way aft be with captain nearly hour when re appeared looked a pleased a punch will never attempt to judge man character by face again exclaimed a caught by arm walked along deck beside who must have thought that piratical looking rascal like portuguese must have be friendly disposed towards representative of law order yet have not only given captain valuable information have actually consented to pilot ship to spot be to serve a base of operation although a say must slaver get to know of having done thing must cut throat without hesitation yes said heard make remark to mr young just before shoving off pray mr bates if question be not indiscreet what be nature of expedition upon be to engage afternoon well know why must tell answered bates little doubtfully movement be of course to be conducted with possible secrecy if tell suppose will go ashore hire town crier to make public intention hand will have to know more le what be after very soon so suppose will not be infringing of article of war if tell now need go publish news throughout ship d see let skipper do that when think fit certainly assented may rely implicitly upon discretion oh yes of course retorted master ironically midshipman be perfect marvel in way of prudence discretion everybody know that however continued in much more genial tone will do justice to say that seem to have ballast pretty well stowed that stand up to canvas a steadily a youngster have ever fallen in with so suppose there will be very much harm in trusting must know then that there be bit of creek called chango creek fourteen fifteen mile up river from here in creek there be at moment lying snugly at anchor quite unconscious of proximity leisurely filling up complement of black large spanish brig called mercedes hailing from havana be notorious slaver be strongly suspected of having played part of pirate more than once when circumstance be favourable moreover from what portuguese friend lobo say be in river when sapphire two boat with crew disappeared according to date give must also have be craft that plucky little wasp be in chase of when last seen there be very little doubt therefore that mercedes be craft at event one of be especial mission to capture at cost be therefore going to weigh afternoon for purpose of beating up quarter lobo have undertaken to pilot a far a mouth of creek a tell that brig be fully hundred ton bigger than be armed to teeth be manned by big crowd of desperado man of whom have bound by fearful oath never to lay down arm while breath remains in body must wonder if find out before be done that have undertaken pretty tough job must seem like if senor lobo information be to be relied upon said involuntary shudder qualm thrilling a vivid imagination instantly conjured up vision of impending conflict suppose precaution will be taken to catch rascal unawares may be sure of answered master peering curiously into face a spoke captain stopford be not man to court reverse heavy loss of life by unduly advertising intention look pale boy be surely not beginning to funk be said little dubiously think not will be first experience of fighting know have never be face to face with enemy thus far must confess that idea of hand to hand fight for suppose will come to that life death struggle wherein one have not only to incur awful responsibility of hurling one fellow creature into eternity also to take fearful risk of being hurled one self perhaps without moment of time in to breathe prayer for mercy be something that for one can hardly contemplate with absolute equanimity certainly not assented bates kindly linking arm in mine a spoke certainly not must be something more le le must be inclined to say than human if must a to responsibility of hurling villain into eternity let trouble for single moment lad in endeavouring to put down inhuman slave trade be engaged upon righteous lawful task lawful righteous in eye of god a well a of man humbly believe if trafficker in human flesh human freedom human happiness choose to risk lose life in pursuit of hellish trade responsibility must rest with in humble opinion earth be well rid of such inhuman monster a to other matter that of being hurried into eternity unprepared need not occur boy one need die unprepared what mean be of course that must take especial care to be prepared for death whenever may meet for know not what day hour even moment may bring forth man who walk street of native town in fancied security be actually just a liable to be cut off unawares a be who follow terrible necessary profession of arm menace to life ashore be a numerous a be afloat more so form of accident be innumerable therefore say that must be careful to so conduct that may be prepared to face death at moment if be not may easily become so for god ear be always open to cry of child will take upon to say that earnest heartfelt prayer be ever allowed to go unanswered so if have misgiving about to night work go to god ask for mercy protection help then happens will be right so saying good old fellow halted just abreast hatchway have reached at point in perambulation fore aft deck gently urging toward suggestively released arm turned away took hint thus given without word for indeed at moment be too deeply moved for speech made way below to midshipman berth found opportunely empty there cast upon knee prayed earnestly for minute when arose from act of devotion be once more calm unperturbed from moment date habit of prayer have be inexpressible comfort support to ever since upon returning to deck first object caught eye be gig with first luff little pierrepoint junior mid one in stern sheet pulling toward very handsome spanish brig already spoken of a lying at short distance inside of upon visit of inspection that inspection to be subjected be pretty thorough be sufficiently attested by fact that gig remained alongside full hour british brig dutch barque being in turn afterwards subjected to similarly severe examination a bates have predicted nothing came of paper being perfectly in order while rigorous search failed to discover anything of incriminating character on board of of course not commented master when learned substance of first luff report to skipper of course not bless ye people trade to river be born fool not just consider matter for moment let suppose for argument sake that spaniard yonder be slaver must ship cargo here in very spot must be first visited by man o ' war that enters river of course must 'd go away up river into one of many creek branch into on side for first twenty mile so ship black there watching for chance of dark night to slip out get well off land before daylight if came in here at must be to fill up water lay in stock of meal upon to feed nigger when 'd got may depend on that when slaver come in here upon such errand a that very bright look out be kept for cruiser upon first sight of suspicious looking sail in offing iron meal everything else must incriminate be bundled ashore hidden away safely among bush while water must be started pumped out of long enough before man o ' war must get alongside of what be spanish brig taking in continued turning to little pierrepoint who with first lieutenant have visited nothing answered lad only arrived yesterday hold be half full of cask in be going to stow palm oil of course remarked master sarcastically turning to what did say to morning whenever ship be found in african river with lot of cask aboard ship be after palm oil at least so skipper will tell ye be where get to wind'ard of for unless have something more incriminating something pointing more directly to intention to traffic in slave than mere cask dare touch 'em mark that brig here to take off cargo of black unless be greatly mistaken will have vanished when turn up here again to morrow be just six bell in afternoon watch when two boat one containing fresh water in cask other loaded to gunwale with fresh meat mostly goat mutton strongly impregnated with powerful musky odour of animal appeared paddling leisurely off to barracouta under guidance of four powerful phenomenally lazy krumen who must probably have consumed best part of hour in short passage from wharf to brig have not impatient first luff dispatched boat to tow alongside water be pumped into tank provision be passed up side stowed away below in coolest part of ship sooner be boat clear of ship side than boatswain whistle shrilled along deck followed by gruff bellow of hand unmoor ship messenger be passed anchor roused up to bow in few minute barracouta under two topsail wafted by light westerly zephyr be moving slowly down narrow channel toward estuary of river so light be draught of air now impelled that although cloth be quickly spread to woo ship be full hour half reaching a far a boolambemba point where met full strength of river current when bore away on course up river patience be severely taxed by discovery that even with studding sail set on side from royal down must scarcely do more than hold own against strong rush of tide current together slowly however by imperceptible degree by hugging northern shore a closely a dared with lead constantly going managed to creep insidiously past mangrove densely bush clad river bank until just a sun be dipping into horizon astern in brief indescribably magnificent blaze of purple scarlet gold reached place of rendezvous with senor lobo soon afterwards have satisfaction of discovering that gentleman making way toward out of narrow creek conveyance being small native canoe about fifteen foot long roughly hewn hollowed out of single log propelled by two native who apparently regarded clothes a entirely unnecessary superfluity for be absolutely naked be fine powerful specimen of negro manhood however smart fellow withal for propelled ungainly little craft along at truly wonderful pace with scarcely apparent effort sheering alongside brig in quite respectable style without obliging to start tack sheet in order to pick up shinning up side with agility of couple of monkey a soon a have securely made fast rope end be hove to impatience at slow progress that have thus far made be somewhat relieved by lobo assurance that might confidently rely upon brisk breeze speedily springing up must carry to destination a soon a be at desirable opinion being that best chance of success lay in postponement of attack until about two o'clock in morning by time moon must have set slaver crew must probably be wrapped in deepest slumber so far a prognostication relative to wind be concerned be soon confirmed strong breeze from southward springing up under impulsion of with considerably reduced canvas reached destination so far a brig be concerned about five bell in first watch spot be situated on northern bank of river at distance up stream of about thirteen mile from boolambemba point be at mouth of creek named chango creek in small bay roadstead about mile long by perhaps width formed by six island largest of be nearly two mile long by mile wide while smallest most easterly of be very diminutive affair of perhaps not more than acre in area densely overgrown like rest of with thick impenetrable bush in very centre of small roadstead to have be piloted by portuguese trader anchored brig in two half fathom of water when canvas having be furled preparation for attack having be fully made before dark strong anchor watch be set everybody else turned in to get hour two sleep strict injunction being laid upon master who have charge of watch to keep bright look out to have hand called at two bell precisely in middle watch a for lobo took leave of directly that anchor be down rousing out sable crew who be fast asleep snoring melodiously underneath long boat took to canoe once more almost immediately vanished among deep black shadow of islet hemmed in know not what be feeling of others on board brig on eventful night how two short hour of inaction be spent in other part of ship be convinced that when went below to turn in very general conviction have spread among that enterprise upon be shortly to engage be one must prove to be more than ordinarily difficult dangerous while not one of probably have moment doubt a to ultimate result believe feeling be pretty general that struggle must be fierce obstinate that loss must probably be unusually heavy gathered from demeanour of ship crew generally officer a well a men former revealing feeling by extreme care with scrutinised personally superintended several preparation for expedition latter by grim silent earnestness with performed share of work true there be faint attempt at jocularity among few of occupant of midshipman berth a sought hammock be manifestly braggadocio utterly lacking true ring of heartiness usually characterised such attempt be speedily nipped in bud by gowland master mate who gruffly recommended offender to say prayer then go to sleep instead of talking nonsense though be not one of offender took advice earnestly commending to mercy protection of almighty in coming conflict throughout rest of life must please to spare after sank quickly into deep untroubled sleep chapter three night attack from sleep be aroused in few minute seemed to although really be nearly two hour later by boisterous banging upon mess table followed by voice of marine who executed function of steward to mess exclaiming hand gentleman please captain first liftenant be already on deck be followed by rasping scrape of lucifer match by feeble light of man face be seen bending over lantern be endeavouring to light ay ay jerry look alive with lantern man responded master mate what be night like continued a swung out of hammock hastily proceeded to thrust long leg into breech dark a pitch sir blowing more than gale of wind threatening rain be cheering answer pleasant prospect truly muttered good especial chum a jostled other in confined space wherein be struggling into clothing might be worse however responded gowland a knotted black silk handkerchief tightly about loin darkness roar of wind among tree will help capitally to mask approach while dare say that craft be going to attack will be in such snug berth that nobody will think while to keep look out blow high blow low say pierrepoint be told off for boat pierrepoint intimated that be then put that rubbishy toasting fork away get cutlas boy a dugdale have of what use do suppose dirk must be in hand to hand fight with great burly spaniard why none at ca understand for part why such useless tool be supplied for active service get good honest cutlas boy something that can trust life to look sharp about hurry up there loafer come burdett boy stir stump if want wigging from first luff hillo jerry what be hot coffee well done man will owe glass of grog for pour out quickly rouse out bread barge jerry be smart fellow looked after well will say that for in le than minute cup pannikin of steaming coffee stood ready for of with bread barge well supplied in centre of table there be time for eating now take advice slip biscuit into pocket of to eat a soon a boat shove off advised gowland there be nothing worse for man in climate climate for matter of than to turn out go into open air in middle of night upon empty stomach suiting action to word thrust biscuit into of side pocket placed morsel in mouth with exclamation well be off darted up ladder disappeared followed upon reaching deck found that hand be mustered waiting for inspection previous to being told off to boat skipper be in cabin few minute later by time laggard have put in appearance emerged from companion way inspection at once began great attention being given noticed to who be to go in boat to insure that weapon be in serviceable order pistol loaded that man have due supply of cartridge inspection be conducted by first lieutenant accompanied by captain sergeant of marine latter carrying lantern by rather dim uncertain light of inspection be made moment that be over men who be to participate in expedition be told off to proper boat boat be lowered brought to gangway in le than quarter of hour from moment of being called be off expedition consisted of four boat namely gig pinnace first second cutter gig be very fine handsome boat beautifully modelled exceedingly fast be commanded by captain who led expedition sure indication of important character in opinion of impending encounter pulled six oar in addition to skipper chum good crew of seaman carried dozen marine four in stern sheet two forward pinnace be big roomy rather heavy boat pulling ten oar double banked mounting nine pounder gun in bow be commanded by mr michael ryan second lieutenant rollicking high spirited irishman whose only fault be that lacked discretion be utterly reckless albeit fault be to great extent condoned by effect of influence upon men who must follow anywhere crew in addition to ten oarsman coxswain consisted of little pierrepoint ten marine six aft four forward first second cutter be sister boat precisely alike in respect pulling eight oar double banked be rather smarter boat than pinnace being nearly a long with le beam freeboard finer line first cutter be commanded by gowland master mate carried in addition to crew of ten men coxswain eight marine second cutter be entrusted to carried same complement a consort first cutter will thus be seen that expedition numbered seventy seven soul in nearly half of ship company in fact brig being left in charge of first luff with master purser surgeon young burdett of midshipman mess cook mate captain gun room wardroom steward seventy eight seaman weather although favourable enough for such expedition a upon be engaged if anticipation must prove correct must depend largely for success upon ability to take enemy completely by surprise be decidedly disagreeable for a jerry have reported be dark a pitch wind be sweeping athwart river in savage gust roared among tree with volume of sound rendered necessary to raise voice to loud shout in order to make order heard from one end of boat to other have scarcely left ship when came on to rain with fury rendered preservation of ammunition from damage serious difficulty source of keen anxiety fortunately for reached mouth of creek few minute before rain began to fall for circumstance must have met with utmost difficulty in discovering entrance might possibly have lost considerable amount of valuable time in search for even a be so intense be darkness although creek be only two hundred yard wide found impossible to keep boat in centre of channel for little while be constantly running foul of other bank luckily for be sooner in creek than eastern bank afforded shelter from direct violence of wind bush tree growing so thickly right down to water edge that close inshore be completely becalmed thus sheltered sense of hearing helped somewhat despite deep roar of gale overhead while quickly caught knack of steering along outer edge of narrow belt of calm in way avoiding to great extent difficulty petty mishap have at first so seriously hampered movement in way exposed while to pelting of heavy tropical downpour quickly drenched to skin in spite of protection of oil skin slowly groped way along creek with muffled oar for rather more than hour when unexpectedly found at entrance of fairly spacious lagoon in centre of speedily made out not one four craft moored right athwart channel completely barring further passage from disposition looked very much a though have be moored with spring upon cable for broadside be presented fair at if so argued at least suspicion on part of possible visit from enemy with doubtless corresponding amount of precaution against chance of being surprised scarcely have made discovery when gig be leading found further progress unexpectedly interrupted by boom composed of tree trunk secured together with chain stretching right across water way a struck loud cry be heard proceeding from river bank on starboard hand immediately followed by musket shot next moment spark of light appeared in same quarter quickly increasing in size intensity until in le than minute large fire evidently caused by ignition of very considerable quantity of highly combustible material be blazing fiercely in shelter of thick clump of overhanging bush seemed to almost completely shield from rain however have considerably moderated by time dense mass of bush behind on side of blazing mass acted in sort a reflector concentrating light of fire upon boom four boat clustered closely together about defining with very unpleasant distinctness against background of impenetrable darkness that be so that projected surprise have proved lamentable failure be made clear by sound of commotion sharp cry of command at once arose on board slaver almost instantly followed by smart well directed musketry fire bullet from came dropping about in very unpleasant proximity although fortunately nobody be actually hit separate at once cried skipper rising in stern sheet of gig a realised that time for silence secrecy be past separate at once spread yourselves along boom let boat crew do best to make passage through try effect of shot from gun upon mr ryan marine return fire of craft aiming at flash from piece first boat to force boom will report fact to before passing through spread well along boom maintaining open order so that might afford a small target a possible devoted energy to breaking through obstruction at point where trunk be united by chain found by mean easy matter staple being driven home through link into tenacious wood so closely together that be impossible to find space wide enough to take loom of oar only lever at hand a have not anticipated provided for such contingency meanwhile adversary proved fully alive to advantage situation afforded fully prepared to make most of for kept up brisk though irregular fire of musketry upon from soon began to suffer rather severely two of men being hit within space of a many minute while sharp cry of pain to right left told that occupant of other boat be receiving full share of slaver attention be only beginning of conflict however for before marine have have time to fire more than thrice in reply to slaver musketry fire five fierce flash of flame burst simultaneously from side of largest of four craft accompanied by sharp ringing roar of brass nine pounder gun instantly perfect storm of grape tore whistled about ear splintering planking of boat bowling over people right left three more of men went down before that discharge cry of anguish from other boat told that too have suffered nearly quite a severely gig fared worst of however for entire charge apparently plumped right into bow where men be clustered pretty thickly helping two of comrade who be kneeling upon boom endeavouring to tear asunder fastening le than six of crew fell before withering discharge including two men upon boom who fell into water be never seen again by jove will never do cried captain out oar men pull alongside pinnace be done a two boat touched gallant leader sprang on board larger of two cry to second lieutenant here mr ryan will change place with take gig if please see if can cast boom adrift at shore end will look after matter here meanwhile mr gowland go to other end of boom see what can do there now then lad what be best news there with gun just ready sir came answer poor jim baker be struck fell athwart breech wettin ' primin with blood just a be about to fire so have have to renew be ready now sir very well cried skipper bear boat off from boom fire at chain coupling ought to do business for order be promptly obeyed few second later gun spoke out shot hitting fair square dividing two part of chain formed coupling between two contiguous tree trunk loud hurrah proclaimed result yet when pinnace pulled up to boom again tried to force way through be found that log must not be forced apart evidently be still united under water load gun again lad a smartly a can exclaimed skipper then must try to roll log over get chain above water well what news mr gowland a first cutter be seen approaching be good sir answered gowland ca get within twenty yard of dry ground for mud be too stiff to permit of forcing boat through not stiff enough to support man made attempt went in up to arm pit before must get hold of to pull out meanwhile hot fire of grape musketry latter from four of craft be being maintained upon men be falling fast matter to mind began to look very serious still who be not hurt whose hurt be not very severe worked away manfully in endeavour to break boom be clear to at least that only hope lay in pinnace gun if failed seemed probable that man of must be placed hors de combat before must force passage through nine pounder be soon ready again then gowland having meanwhile stationed respective boat one on side of pinnace by united effort of crew succeeded in rolling log so far over a to bring remaining pair of coupling chain out of water second effort be made to divide boom shot be successful one chain being completely cut through ringing cheer proclaimed good news just a gig rejoined with similar piece of intelligence to already brought by gowland a to impossibility of landing getting at shore fast of boom that obstacle be now however happily severed drawing sword skipper waved over head a shouted out oar men give way for life follow rest of boat will tackle big fellow first bring other three to sens afterwards with aid of gun word be scarcely out of mouth when broadside of grape hurtled in among now once more huddled closely together about breach in deadly boom from dreadful outcry immediately arose tossing of arm aloft dropping of oar be evident that fearful havoc have be wrought by among already seriously diminished company to make matter worse be instantly followed by louder deeper report crash on board pinnace a eighteen pound shot struck gun fair upon starboard trunnion dismounting piece sending overboard while shower of splinter of wood metal flew from slide wounding maiming at least four more men then a though be not enough shot glanced swept boat fore aft crushing in side of one poor fellow head like egg shell smashing in rib of whipping captain sword out of hand with four of finger a flew over head into darkness beyond in teeth of new disaster pinnace forced way through now divided boom closely followed by ryan in gig then with gowland bringing up rear give way for life be now word at racing pace a near a must get with sadly diminished crew headed for biggest craft of four now made out to be large brig very heavily rigged with immensely square yard opened out little to port starboard a went in order that might show a small mark a possible for antagonist to fire at having already passed heavy pinnace be fast creeping up into leading position when ryan who saw what be after sheered alongside in sharp terse language ordered to change place with of course must obey fiery irishman finding in best manned boat of lot speedily passed ahead despite utmost effort of rest of to keep pace with one more broadside of grape greeted a pushed somewhat heavily across lagoon that put poor unfortunate gig practically out of combat for reduced oarsman to two while have already be so badly knocked about that needed utmost effort of least severely wounded of crew to keep afloat by baling kept on however in wake of other boat have at least good view of short sharp fight followed brig be lying with starboard broadside presented to a boat advanced toward gradually passed out of broad line of light cast by still fiercely blazing fire have be kindled on shore sooner did happen however than dozen men provided with port fire sprang three into main three into fore port rigging illumining brig brilliantly be true at same time revealing whereabouts of boat distinctly enough to enable people to keep up most galling pistol musketry fire upon besides giving advantage that light be at back while shone in face of marine with such dazzling effect that be able to reply ineffectively to fire with own musket second lieutenant be first alongside closely followed by gowland pinnace making bad third ranging up under bow of brig while other boat attempted to board in waist brig three schooner a well for matter be well protected by boarding netting triced up fore aft a men made dash at be met by pike

damp powder now fizzing spluttering smoking a fire swiftly travelled along so rapidly did fire travel indeed that during second so that desperado paused in surprise at unexpected appearance reached

springing to foot then dashing down cutlas a fellow sank back with groan upon deck wrenched still open knife from neck while struggling flame scorched seared sole of naked foot slashed blade quickly through fuse with same movement whirled severed unlighted part a far away from a possible done knew that danger be past drawing short burning fragment of fuse from beneath foot carefully deposited in

sat down to nurse seared blistered foot to await progress of event companion adversary must be rightly called still lying motionless where have fallen with large blue lump on white temple from thin

from forecastle be that mr ryan voice that hear aft there ay ay sorr answered second luff be bedad be left ov sound of footstep followed suggesting that have walked away forward to join superior a man at foot just then stirred uneasily a though sens be returning to made quick grab at cutlas drawing from belt loaded pistol existence of have until then forgotten pulled together made ready for next emergency presently prisoner for such now be stirred again sighed deeply opened eye glance immediately falling upon for few second seemed not to know where be what have happened then a gazed into other eye saw that memory have returned to a made motion to rise to foot sprang to mine pointing pistol straight at head said in best spanish must muster stay where be if make slightest attempt to move will blow brain out villain continued to gaze steadfastly at for moment then seeing suppose that fully meant what said smiled bitterly muttered so have come to have must lie here in own cabin helpless at mercy of mere boy car r be ba still kept regard steadfastly fixed upon a seemed to read in expression of eye dawning determination to make at least one more effort for freedom be not sorry to hear footstep coming along deck voice of skipper ryan in earnest conversation must get light from somewhere at once look to wounded without moment delay said former fear that loss have be very serious in affair ah there be faint glimmer of light from skylight yonder will go below see what be meanwhile mr ryan muster men load gun if can lay hand upon ammunition schooner will try to slip away if can now that have got brig will not be satisfied unless can secure whole of must have something more than have got already to account satisfactorily for loss niver fear sorr answered second luff will not get away from by power though there go one of thim now away dashed forward again shouting out certain order to men while skipper after hesitating for few second entered companion began to descend attention have be somewhat distracted from prisoner by brief conversation fact have evidently not passed unnoticed by for before fully realised what be happening have in inexplicable manner sprung to foot with single lightning like movement hand be already upon left wrist when with quick twist of arm managed to get pistol barrel pointed at a pressed trigger there be bright flash lighting up whole cabin a though by gleam of lightning glancing vividly from rolling eyeball of antagonist sharp explosion spaniard went reeling backward with crash upon one of sofa a captain entered cabin at bound hillo exclaimed a peered at in faint light of lantern who be what be matter here why bless be mr dugdale be pray who be man on sofa in few brief word narrated adventure to listened quietly holding wounded hand bound up in handkerchief in other meanwhile when have finished glanced at prostrate figure on sofa said noticing ghastly paleness of upturned face lifelessness of outstretched limb well look a though there be not much mischief left in now at event will not do to take risk be evidently desperate character be before pinked so slip up on deck get length of line bit off one of topgallant brace will do if ca find anything better to make fast with call couple of hand to come below carry on deck be scarcely safe to leave fellow alone in cabin even when securely bound hobbled on deck a well a burnt foot by time be excruciatingly painful must permit finding suitable bit of line securing assistance of two of lad slave captain a eventually proved to be be speedily bound hand foot conveyed on deck propped up in reclining position against bulwark well aft out of way in position a seemed least likely to encourage bleeding of wound meanwhile ryan upon leaving skipper have rushed forward hailed fugitive schooner in richest dublin accent to heave to must sink to command however whether understood not attention be paid before people groping about in thick darkness among dead wounded must lay hand upon single cartridge have mortification of seeing vanish round bend of creek on way seaward lieutenant consoling with assurance that must infallibly be snapped up by barracouta whose slender crew must be certain to be on alert through night when skipper arrived on deck after securing prisoner ryan few of lad be busily employed ramming home charge in long eighteen mounted upon brig forecastle cartridge shot for have stumbled across in search second luff at once began to relate with many comical expression of righteous indignation particular of schooner escape have scarcely got well into narrative when faint screep of block sheave from to windward warned that of slippery neighbour be about to hazard like experiment without waiting for order thinking of what be doing forgetting even injured foot in excitement of moment sprang upon rail hailed in spanish hola there keep fast on board schooner will riddle with grape light lantern of hoist to main mast head warn that will stand nonsense so if value life will attempt to play trick to reply be vouchsafed be about to hail again when captain remarked very quietly may inquire mr dugdale what be nature of communication unauthorised communication that have just made to schooner beg pardon sir answered considerably abashed thought heard sound just now a though of schooner be on point of attempting to slip away so hailed that if attempted such trick must treat to dose of grape also ordered to hoist lantern to mast head so that may see where be very good remarked skipper suavely be quite proper thing to do altogether approve of young gentleman taking initiative in matter unless happen to be for time being in supreme command when be not case expect to wait for instruction now be so good a to hail again say that unless lantern be displayed within three minute will fire into second hail proved effective two lantern being in position well within time specified skipper be however very uneasy after retiring aft consulting with ryan for few minute second luff gowland went away in first second cutter with two good strong crew boarded schooner slaver who be evidently on look out shoving off in own boat escaping to shore moment that detected what be after schooner have cargo of slave on board be of course at once taken possession of instant search prompted by experience on board brig revealing fact that one of have be set fire to so effectually that took prize crew fully hour to extinguish meanwhile lamp lantern be found on board brig lighted when of whose hurt be least serious set to work to attend to more unfortunate comrade closer investigation now revealed welcome fact that have suffered le severely than have be at first anticipated killed amounting to five only although two more died before must receive proper surgical attention while of wounded seven have received injury serious enough to completely disable rest amounting to le than twenty three suffering from hurt ranging from insignificant prod a have received in leg up to cutlas stroke have scalped one poor fellow at length just a have completed task of getting worst case below out of persistent rain making in measure comfortable wind shifted subsided to gentle breeze from north eastward weather cleared rain ceased about hour later day broke gloriously be able to get view of surroundings found in nearly circular lagoon basin about mile in diameter across centre of lay moored brig two schooner with gap in line to mark berth have be occupied by third schooner craft have succeeded in effecting escape be completely land locked shore of creek being low for most part closely fringed with mangrove behind rose dense apparently impenetrable mass of bush now in full leaf thickly overgrown with flowering parasite bush being interspersed with tree of several kind of be very lofty handsome at short distance above where be lying there appeared to be creek small affair not more than hundred foot wide branching off from main channel upon being pointed out to captain at once hailed schooner of second lieutenant be in possession directing that latter must take boat with crew well armed make exploration of subsidiary main creek for short distance for purpose of ascertaining whether a be exceedingly probable there be slave depot in neighbourhood must greatly have liked to have made one of party indeed asked permission to join burnt foot be by time so inflamed painful must not put to deck captain stopford while expressing gratification at zeal manifested by request refused pointing out lame a be must not only be useless actual encumbrance embarrassment to party in event of resistance being offered to attempt on part to land in few minute ryan be ready boat shoved off from schooner leaving just enough hand to take care of during absence of others made straight for small subsidiary creek in first instance re appeared in about quarter of hour when second luff hailed to say that be mere cul de sac only mile long with very little water in bank being of soft black foetid mud of consistency rendered landing impossibility having communicated intelligence cutter next proceeded up stream quickly vanished round bend have be out of sight fully hour captain be just beginning to manifest anxiety sight sound having reached to indicate whereabouts when thin wreath of light brown smoke appeared rising above bush tree about mile away smoke rapidly increasing in density volume darkening in colour until became quite apparent that serious conflagration be raging at great distance when smoke at first appeared there be question in mind of captain whether might not be work of people who have effected escape from craft during darkness having perhaps set fire to bush in hope of involving prize in ensuing destruction little reflection revealed unlikelihood of vegetation not only being saturated with rain have fallen during night also being so green full of sap that must probably prove impossible to fire have just reached conclusion when ryan party appeared returning in few minute cutter ranged up alongside to enable second luff to make report stated that have proceeded about mile half up creek course of have found to be very sinuous when reached spot at bank on port hand be clear of bush tree with soil firm enough to admit of landing being conveniently effected a there be sign indicating that place have be very freely used quite recently shoved alongside bank stepped ashore single glance about now sufficed to convince that have made important discovery grass be much worn a with trampling of many foot from well trodden spot broad path led into bush leaving two men in boat to take care of with order how to proceed in event of enemy heaving in sight ryan at once led party along path after traversing for le than hundred yard came upon large barracoon very solidly substantially built of dimension sufficient to accommodate fully thousand slave there be also kitchen for preparation of slave food tank for collection of fresh water several large thatched hut looked a if be for accommodation of trader large store building in short everything necessary to complete important slave trading establishment be evident that have be very hurriedly abandoned only few hour previously strict prolonged search failed to reveal whereabouts of of late occupant ryan have therefore first emptied water tank have then set fire to whole establishment remaining until flame have taken strong hold upon several building when have retired without molestation meanwhile by captain order hatch have be removed on board three prize condition of unfortunate prisoner looked to will never forget moment when first hatch be taken off on board brig thick cloud of steam slowly rose up through opening foetid musky odour of have already spoken at once became so pungent overpowering that men who be engaged upon operation of opening hatchway be fairly driven away from work for moment until strength of stench have be to extent ameliorated by fresh air immediately poured down into densely packed hold what relief of whiff of fresh air must have be to unhappy black can only be faintly imagined that be ineffably grateful to be evidenced by deep murmur of delight loud long drawn inspiration of breath swept from end to end of hold moment that hatch be withdrawn a well a by upward glance of gratitude instantly greeted from upturned eye of who be placed nearest hatchway what sight hold presented when in course of few minute hatch be removed blessed light of heaven sweet pure air of early morning have gained free access to sweltering occupant dispersing poisonous fume have be condemned to breathe from moment when approach of boat have be first notified have more than once have hold of slaver mode of stowing human cargo described to be necessary to actually see before full horror misery of thing must be completely realised space between planking of slave deck underside of beam be just three foot barely sufficient to allow unfortunate wretch to sit upright in confined space be stowed a tightly a herring in barrel seated on ham with foot drawn close up to body knee clasped by arm close to chest let anyone try fatiguing effect of sitting in constrained attitude for only single half hour idea may then be formed of horrible suffering misery that unhappy slave have to endure cooped up in fashion for week at stretch not on steady motionless platform on heaving plunging deck of ship driven at utmost speed over sea be seldom smooth enough to render motion imperceptible often rough enough to sweep from stem to stern to render closing of hatch imperatively necessary to save from foundering add to fact that slave be packed so tightly together that be impossible to move thus obtain relief of even slight change of position bear in mind that be equally impossible to cleanse slave deck during entire period of passage of ship from port to port think of indescribable foulness of place dreadful atmosphere generated by ever accumulating filth exhalation from body of four five hundred human being wedged together in confined space add to horror of sea sickness at once becomes perfect marvel that sufficient number remained alive at end of passage to render slave traffic remunerative business be true solely in own interest not in least from motif of humanity slaver exercised certain amount of care watchfulness over health of captive be to say allowed one half to go on deck during meal time twice day for double purpose of affording opportunity for inspiration of little fresh air at same time of providing space for poor wretch below to feed however be only when weather other circumstance be favourable if weather be bad hatch be put on kept on until favourable change occurred in case of gale of wind unhappy slave have be known to have be kept without food water for forty eight hour even longer simply because be impossible to give of course in such case mortality be simply frightful being uncommon occurrence for slaver to lose more than half cargo in single gale loss be understood arising not so much from want of food a from simple suffocation through long confinement in dreadful atmosphere of unventilated hold when slaver happened to be pursued by man o ' war suffering of slave be almost a bad for in such case crew seldom troubled to attend to want of helpless prisoner devoting thought energy to task of effecting own escape a will have more to say upon subject further on will not enlarge upon here ryan having rejoined prize there being nice little easterly breeze blowing order be given for three craft to weigh proceed down creek captain being rather anxious lest slaver must return take at disadvantage now that force be divided nothing untoward occurred however in short time be proceeding down creek with second lieutenant in schooner a pilot here may be a well to enumerate few particular relative to prize that exigency of narrative have hitherto not enabled to give to begin with brig be a lobo have stated mercedes of havana truly beautiful craft measuring fully five hundred ton very flat in floor so exceedingly willow even in sea going trim with everything on board a when took only drew trifle over eight foot of water aft what lacked in depth more than made up for in beam deck being half a spacious again a of barracouta be perfectly lovely model sailed like witch a soon discovered be not to be wondered at however for in addition to beautiful easy grace of flowing line scantling be extraordinarily light le than of barracouta chief fastening be screw with so light scantling of course worked like wicker basket in anything of breeze seaway leaked

armed with eight nine pounder broadside gun long eighteen mounted upon pivot on forecastle in course of investigation discovered that crew have numbered no le than seventy men of whom fourteen be killed in defence twenty six too severely wounded to effect escape at moment of capture five hundred sixty four slave male be confined in hold be thus in very valuable prize quite worth trouble that have taken to secure in addition to there be two schooner larger of named dona hermosa be vessel of close upon one hundred twenty ton measurement with nothing very remarkable about appearance to

out remaining boat ran away stream anchor to windward working a be in dark took long time to do then sent down royal topgallant yard mast when daylight came examined cable thinking possibly might have chafed through on rock to surprise found that have be clean cut at water edge how be done who did be impossible to guess for although have very strictly questioned forecastle look out persist in statement that saw nothing be aware of nothing until ship be found to be adrift well be most extraordinary circumstance commented captain be quite satisfied that men remained fully on alert time perfectly sir answered lieutenant hailed ten minute so not knowing at what moment disagreeable surprise might be sprung upon besides did not know how might be faring thought quite possible that craft be after might attempt to give slip in darkness men on forecastle be two of best have in ship william robinson henry perkins yes assented captain have always hitherto seemed thoroughly trustworthy reliable men where be must like to ask question two two men be summoned at once subjected to very sharp cross examination led to nothing however a persistently declared that have seen heard anything to arouse slightest suspicion until discovery be made that ship be adrift captain then went forward inspected severed cable revealed nothing beyond fact that strand have be cut almost completely through with very sharp instrument before stubborn hemp have given way in short whole affair be enshrouded in deepest mystery when however captain have heard whole story thoroughly investigated matter freely absolved first luff from blame frankly acknowledging that did not see what more must have be done to provide for safety of ship that thing must undoubtedly have happened just same have remained on board instead of going away with boat meanwhile dead wounded have be conveyed from prize to barracouta where doctor immediately took sufferer in hand while slain be stitched up in hammock ready for burial at length came to turn to be attended to when doctor saw foot now so dreadfully swollen inflamed that whole leg be affected right up to knee be promptly consigned to sick bay with intimation might think exceedingly fortunate if in hot climate mortification did not set in necessitate amputation of leg be thankful to say however that did not in three week be discharged from doctor care once more able to hobble about with aid of soft felt slipper dead be buried that same forenoon on point projecting into river at junction of creek with main stream graf being dug in small space of smooth grassy lawn beneath shadow of magnificent group of fine tall palm hasty breakfast be snatched a soon a must be got ready then man available be set to work upon task of lightening stranded brig gun such other heavy weight a be most easily accessible being transferred to prize after second bower be weighed run away to windward in long boat by mean of kedge such be activity displayed that at high water same afternoon tide be fortunately making at time barracouta floated be hove off to anchor meanwhile missing anchor have be swept for found severed end of cable buoyed before therefore cable be spliced bonny brig once more riding to best bower men be kept at work until be too dark to see further by six bell in forenoon watch next day be again ataunto gun everything else once more on board ship ready for sea having be ascertained that have sustained no damage whatever may be mentioned that schooner have effected escape from in lagoon managed to slip out of creek get clear away without being observed by anybody on board barracouta that of course be easily accounted for by pitchy darkness of night fact that must have passed out of creek very short while after brig have grounded upon sand bank when of course lad must be fully occupied in looking after own craft proper prize crew be now told off to three prize ryan being placed in charge of mercedes gowland master mate in charge of dona hermosa good one of midshipman in charge of felicidad order to weigh proceed in company be given there be slashing breeze from eastward blowing combined with strong downward current carried along over ground so smartly that in le than two hour be abreast of shark point although dona hermosa proved to be such indifferent sailer that rest of have to materially reduce spread of canvas to avoid running away from altogether felicidad on other hand sailed like witch kept station without difficulty under single reefed mainsail foresail inner jib with square canvas stowed master informed that a passed banana point have remembered to subject anchorage to very careful scrutiny through telescope a have foretold handsome spanish brig have disappeared englishman dutchman being only craft still lying off wharf having made offing of about twenty mile hauled up three point to northward for cape palmas destination being of course sierra leone on third day out captain of mercedes whom have shot in self defence in own cabin will be remembered died of wound solemnly declaring with last breath that be absolutely innocent of complicity in destruction of sapphire two boat with crew in disappearance of wasp admitted that have heard of occurrence have be told name of individual who be said to be responsible for stubbornly persisted in refusal to give information whatever carried secret to ocean grave with in due time reached leone without mishap without adventure after moderately quick passage prize having be taken in flagrante delicto be forthwith condemned at captain stopford suggestion however felicidad be purchased into service with speed fitted to serve a tender to barracouta extraordinary speed peculiarly fitting for such employment while exceedingly light draught promised to render especially useful in exploration of various river along coast many of be very willow remained in harbour trifle over three week while necessary alteration be being effected during time owing to unremitting vigilance skill of paddy blake doctor lost only one man through fever then being ready felicidad be commissioned ryan second lieutenant being given command of with to great delight a chief officer pierrepoint gowland being shipmate also shipped a surgeon young fellow named armstrong scotchman whom captain of ariadne kindly spared to with first rate recommendation in addition have warren gunner mate of barracouta a gunner coombs carpenter mate a carpenter bartlett boatswain mate a boatswain by way of crew captain gave forty of best men a very well must without weakening own ship company ship with supernumerary having most opportunely arrived from home only few day previously will thus be seen so far a strength be concerned be fairly well able to take care of ourselves be expected to do far more than however captain when giving instruction hinting that looked to to fully justify by service for trouble that have taken in causing schooner to be fitted out think however that having put dashing fellow a ryan in command have very few misgiving upon point barracouta felicidad sailed together on evening of eighteenth of december captain having given ryan pretty free hand parted company off shoal of saint ann schooner keeping luff heading about south south west while brig bore away on south east by south course for cape palmas idea being that must do better apart than together be to cruise for six week at end of time if unsuccessful to rendezvous on parallel of six degree south latitude meridian of twelve degree east longitude in other word eighteen mile off mouth of congo be to remain on spot twenty four hour if at end of time brig have not appeared be to proceed on further cruise of six week then return to sierra leone to replenish store await further order be glorious evening when sailed moderate breeze be blowing from westward pure refreshing cool compared with furnace like atmosphere in have be stewing for previous three week sky be without cloud sea delicate blue necked here there with miniature foam cap of purest white while broad on lee quarter high land about settlement of sierra leone just dipping beneath horizon glowed rosy red in light of sinking sun be evening to make one heart rejoice evening a can only be met with in tropic just starting a be upon what hand regarded a holiday cruise be small wonder that experienced enjoyed exhilarating influence to almost intoxicating extent jocularity laughter pervaded little craft from end to end throughout second dog watch dancing singing skylarking of course within limit of proper discipline be order of evening a sun disappeared in west full round orb of moon floated majestically up over purple rim of horizon to leeward swift yet imperceptible change from golden glory of sunset to silvery radiance of clear moonlit night be sight of beauty must be left to imagination for mortal pen must possibly do justice to now harry bhoy exclaimed ryan speaking in broad brogue always sprang to lip when be excited exhilarated slapping upon back a emerged from companion after dinner that evening stood for moment contemplating glory of night from moment be slaver be pirate be cut throat of first wather to be hail fellow well met with dirty blagguard sail say until can get within rache of pretty little barker affectionately tapping breech of one of long nine a spoke thin see if wo give thim such surprise a have met with for manny day quite looked character too for be of very powerful athletic build though not very tall swarthy in complexion burnt a dark a mulatto by sun with thick bushy black beard most ferocious looking moustache that have be assiduously cultivating ever since have known that be to have command of schooner a stepped out on deck at eight bell on following morning attired in white drill jacket long flowing trouser of same girt about waist with gaudy silken sash glowing in colour of rainbow costume being topped off with broad brimmed panama hat swathed round with white puggaree be indeed beau ideal of dandy pirate skipper be not very bad imitation of barring whisker only thing perhaps that too captious critic might have objected to be spotless purity of clothing utter absence of ruffianly manner distinguishes genuine pirate a ryan observed first of objection must grow le noticeable with day that wore clothes while other be not necessary if must become so must be assumed a successfully a talent in direction must permit a for crew have by ryan order discarded usual clothing for jumper trouser of blue dungaree with soft felt hat cloth cap knitted worsted nightcap by way of head covering so that viewed through telescope might present a slovenly un man o ' war like appearance a possible effect be further heightened by ryan having very wisely insisted that not spar rope of schooner must be altered interfered with in way saving of course where needed refitting therefore who happened to know felicidad must recognise at once be business so to conduct ourselves that must not suspect change of ownership until too late to effect escape capture be of course by time known to many of craft frequenting congo that must not help plan be based mostly upon hope that there be still many who did not know also to extent upon belief even to who be aware of might by judicious behaviour convey impression that people have cleverly effected own escape be once more boldly pursuing lawless trade did not much expect to fall in with anything worthy of attention until be pretty close up with line therefore carried on through first night whole of next day arriving by sunset upon northern boundary of what considered cruising ground proper then a ill luck must have wind died away left rolling helplessly upon long glassy swell without steerage way schooner head boxing compass period of calm lasted through night whole of next day varied only by occasional cat paw of scarcely sufficient strength duration to enable to get schooner jib boom pointed in right direction did not trouble ryan in least for a reminded for consolation be now just where wanted to be first breeze sprang up might bring with one of gentry that be so anxiously on look out for meanwhile availed of opportunity to prepare certain piece of apparatus that have employed leisure in devising thought might possibly prove useful on occasion have be thinking said to on morning after calm have set in that may always be convanient for schooner to go through wather at best speed so have devised thriflin arrangement that will modherate pace widhout annyone out of craft bein ' anny wiser therewith ordered good stout hawser to be roused up on deck from have length of fifteen fathom cut off along middle part of caused dozen pig of ballast to be securely lashed done ordered bight with pig attached to be passed under ship bottom two end of hawser to be passed inboard through port starboard midship port well secured when have drag underneath schooner must certainly exercise very marked effect upon sailing without making sufficient disturbance in water to reveal fact that trickery be being resorted to towards close of afternoon aspect of sky seemed to promise ere long might hope for welcome change of weather deep brilliant blue of unclouded dome became blurred a though be gradually being overspread by thin semi transparent curtain of mist gradually resolved into streaky feathery appearance called by seaman mare tail bank of horizontal grey cloud gathered in western quarter into sun at length plunged in glare of fiery crimson smoky purple have appearance of great atmospheric conflagration short steep swell too gathered from westward causing inert schooner to roll wallow until be shipping water over gunwale mast be working grinding so furiously in partner that have to lift coat drive wedge home afresh a well a to get up preventer backstay rolling tackle there be breeze strong one too behind remarked ryan to will give opportunity to test little hooker mettle wish must come be done with for by power be gettin mighty toired of stoyle of thing a schooner counter squattered down with thud splash into deep hollow then rolled so heavily so suddenly to starboard that gathered way went with run into scupper just in time to be drenched to waist by heavy fall of water that dished in over rail sort of thing soon gave taste of felicidad quality for so lightly be framed that heavy rolling strained tremendously began to make so much water that be obliged to set pump going two hour while creaking complaining of timber bulkhead raised din might have be heard mile away a soon a breeze come said ryan a descended companion ladder to shift into dry clothes will bear up jog quietly in for cape lopez will give chance of being overhauled by something running in for gaboon ogowe of blundherin ' up against something coming out from one other of same river if fall in with annything by time that make land will just stand on take look in here there beginning with ogowe working way northward gradually until have thoroughly overhauled whole of bight by time that be summoned below to dinner sky have become entirely overcast with heavy black thunderous looking cloud entirely obscured star only allowed light of moon to sift feebly through yet there be light enough to enable to see way about deck to reveal to sharp eye sail a far away a seven eight mile have anything be within distance a left deck quivering gleam of sheet lightning flashed up along western horizon ryan gave pierrepoint who be taking deck for while got dinner instruction to keep sharp eye upon weather a there be knowing how might turn out while sat at table lightning became more vivid frequent after while dull deep rumble of distant thunder be heard presently heard pierrepoint singing out to one of boy to jump below fetch up oil skin for minute two later sound of heavy shower advancing over water became audible rapidly increasing in volume until reached when in moment be almost deafened by loud pelting of rain upon deck overhead a overladen cloud discharged burden with fierce vehemence of truly tropical downpour at first crash of rain upon deck ryan with one accord glanced hastily at barometer be hanging suspended in gimbal in skylight mercury have dropped slightly not sufficient to arouse uneasiness therefore went quietly on with dinner although ryan shouted across table to when rain come before wind halliard sheet brace mind there be little danger however of being caught unawares for have long ago clewed up hauled down everything except boom foresail jib to save sail from thrashing threadbare with rolling of ship consequently awaited development of event with perfect equanimity downpour lasted perhaps three minute then ceased with startling abruptness leaving in absolute silence save for rush splash of water athwart flooded deck with now greatly diminished rolling of schooner gurgle of spouting scupper kicking of rudder upon gudgeon groaning complaining of timber voice of people on deck soft patter of bare foot upon wet plank a moved here there shower have knocked swell down very considerably rendering movement of schooner much more easy than have be be able to finish meal in peace comfort without continued necessity to steady plate with one hand tumbler with other keeping wary eye upon viand meanwhile in readiness to dodge of might happen to fetch away in direction snatching mouthful sip in brief interval when ship became comparatively steady when again went on deck sky presented really magnificent spectacle vast mass of heavy electrically charged cloud being piled one above other in fashion resembled to nothing so much a chaos of titanic rock of conceivable shape colour form hue of cloud being rendered distinctly visible by incessant play of sheet lightning among mass not only whole sky entire atmosphere seemed to be quiver with silent electric discharge effect be indescribably beautiful a quick tremulous flash blazed out now here now there strongly illumining one portion of piled up mass reflection in glassy water with transient radiance while rest of scene be by contrast thrown into deepest blackest most opaque shadow meanwhile muttering of distant thunder have gradually grown louder drawn nearer while sudden vivid flash of forked chain lightning golden violet delicate rose tinted darted at ever lessening interval from lowering mass of intensely black cloud heaped up along western horizon have be on deck perhaps hour when delicious coolness freshness began by almost insensible degree to pervade hitherto intolerable closeness of hot enervating atmosphere looking away to westward saw by quick flickering illumination of lightning few transient cat paw playing here there upon surface of water gradually erratically evanescent movement in inert air stole down to schooner lightly rippling water round for instant just stirring canvas with faint rustle for moment then dying away again be succeeded by others however with rapidly increasing frequency presently faint blurr upon glassy surface of water to westward marked approach of true breeze sheet home topsail hoist away shouted ryan up with helm man to man at tiller let go off east south east sheet home topgallant sail man halliard lay aft here of to brace lay yard square well there belay main throat peak halliard hoist away ease off mainsheet rouse up squaresail mr dugdale set if please well there with throat halliard well with peak belay away aloft one hand loose gaff topsail give everything studding sail while be about mr dugdale will save canvas from mildew if doe little else breeze light air from about west have by time crept up to under vivifying influence schooner have gathered way be soon creeping along at speed of barely two half knot however rose to three finally to five a wind freshened sky meanwhile clearing a heavy thunder cloud drove away to leeward before welcome breeze until sky be once more cloudless save for mare tail that thickly overspread blue through star blinked dimly moon with big halo round poured chastened radiance by power exclaimed ryan a paced deck together after operation of making sail have be completed by power dhrag of mine be wondherful invention entirely do ye notice harry bhoy how be modherated little huzzy pace bedad be goin ' along a sober a quaker girl to meetin instead of waltzin ' away like ballet dancer wait until one of light heeled picaroons come along then wo surprise thim above bit if be not blowing too hard when ye come on deck in middle watch ye may give stunsails will look more ship shape a if be in hurry to make coast get cargo aboard if happen to be overhauled by anybody in same line of business deuce of fear have now of outsailing of may happen to be in neighbourhood keep sharp look out mr pierrepoint if anything heave in sight ahead astern during watch give call be going below to turn in now followed suit minute two later with cabin door wide open to freely admit cool welcome breeze poured down through open skylight soon fell into deep refreshing sleep chapter six capture chase when went on deck at midnight found that there be occasion to set studding sail for breeze have freshened to more than gale little hooker be staggering along before fast rising sea at tremendous pace considering drag with royal clewed up furled gaff topsail hauled down even thus be being greatly over driven so a there be need for too much hurry a sky astern have hard windy look took in topgallant sail hauled down stowed mainsail letting go along easily comfortably for remainder of night have mind to further relieve by getting drag inboard did not like to do so without first consulting ryan since thing be of contrivance so a matter be by mean sufficiently urgent to justify in disturbing let remain very glad be afterwards have done so for when went on deck again at seven bell there away about point on weather quarter gleamed in bright morning sunshine white upper sail of large craft have be sighted at daybreak be now coming up to fast ryan be already on deck having be called immediately that stranger be made out be in state of high glee at success of stratagem for informed that have be up on topsail yard have pretty well satisfied by look of craft course be steering that be slaver running in upon coast to pick up cargo now became nice question with whether must reveal true character a soon a stranger must have approached within reach of gun whether must try to follow in lying in wait for seize her a came out with cargo on board be still at considerable distance from coast twelve hundred mile fact inclined strongly to make short work of by showing colour bringing to a soon a must come abreast of while on other hand there be chance that by following in might fall in with something more valuable than be still weighing pro con of important question when look out aloft for ryan have only hour previously determined to have look out maintained from topgallant yard between hour of sunrise sunset look out say reported sail broad on starboard bow standing to northward on taut bowline under heavy press of sail be a yet invisible from deck superior officer therefore with one accord made dash for telescope having secured hastened forward made way up fore rigging to topsail yard on to swung at same moment from elevated view point upper half of stranger topmast above be just visible clear of horizon bringing glass to bear upon made out to be barque rigged vessel under single reefed topsail course jib fore main topmast staysail spanker yard be pretty nearly square on to showed quite unusual amount of spread for merchant vessel rapidity with altered bearing forged athwart forefoot be conclusive evidence that be remarkably speedy craft for moment occurred to that might possibly be cruiser belonging to one of nation who have undertaken to share with great britain noble task of suppressing inhuman slave traffic very little reflection sufficed to disabuse mind of idea for cruiser must have be carrying so heavy press of canvas a be showing in teeth of what have by time become almost gale unless be in chase of something have be must have seen besides although everything looked trim ship shape enough so far a spar sail rigging be concerned there be evidence even there of certain lack of discipline order must hardly have be tolerated on board man o war of nation although most of foreigner be great deal more free easy in respect than ourselves conclusion at ultimately arrived therefore be that be slaver with cargo on board carrying on to make quick passage fast a be travelling be going through water still faster despite drag for be carrying wind almost square over taffrail ryan in order more thoroughly to hoodwink craft astern have double reefed set big mainsail a though have be somewhat suspicious of character anxious to keep at a great distance a possible be therefore foaming along at speed of fully eight knot rising stranger ahead so rapidly that when crossed hawse be not more than eight mile distant have clear view of from topsail yard now hoisted spanish colour not to be outdone in politeness did same a also did craft astern of of suppose accepting exhibition of bunting on board others for just what be worth ryan have by time pretty well made up mind a to character of neighbour a stranger astern large brig be now barely mile distant from drawing rapidly up on starboard quarter be necessary to make up mind without delay a to course to be pursued question being whether must meddle at with brig thus run risk of exciting barque suspicion whether must devote whole energy to pursuit of latter be for letting brig go for knew by course be steering that have slave on board chance be even that must find nothing else on board sufficiently compromising to secure condemnation by mixed commission ryan on other hand must not make up mind to let chance go by of making two prize instead of one bird in hand be worth two in bush harry bhoy ' remarked to a stood together near binnacle watching approach of brig be now foaming along not quarter of mile away from look upon brig a being quite a much in hand a though stood upon quarter deck with crew safe under hatch steady there continued to man at tiller mind weather helm man will be having that mainsail jibing over need not tell what mean in breeze like meet quite so sharply if seems inclined to take sheer to starboard let go will take care that brig doe not run over just look at went on turning again to be beauty why be almost a handsome a big too a mercedes d 'ye mean to tell that hull a must ever be employed in humdrum trade of carrying palm oil why must be nothing short of waste of skilful modelling sorr be built for slaver slaver be will eat hat of mine puggaree for breakfast grant that say admitted if have nothing incriminating on board what then will only be wasting time by boarding while will certainly give alarm to barque yonder a likely a not lose for pain ryan took good long look at barque be now about two point before larboard beam six mile distant thrashing along in style did one heart good to see plunging into heavy head sea against be beating until foresail be dark with wet half way up weather leech spray be flying clean over drifting away like smoke to leeward then turned looked at brig on opposite quarter be risky remarked to through set teeth by power will chance if happen to be mistaken why will make skipper handsome apology if be true man ought to satisfy mr bartlett to boatswain cast off that drag get inboard over port rail with a little fuss a may be so that if fellow in brig be watching may not know what be about want to keep conthrivance saycret a long a can be a smart a like about mr dugdale want twenty men to arm forthwith then creep into waist under lee of starboard bulwark taking care that be not seen pick out best men in ship if please ah here be gowland very man wanted to see mr gowland see that brig a turned away to muster men see that be properly armed drew gowland away to other side of deck began to communicate something to in very rapid earnest manner by time that drag have be got inboard stowed away have picked out required men have contrived to get by two three under starboard bulwark without so far a knew being seen by on board brig watching roll of schooner giving word for men to pas up through scuttle make crouching run for a schooner rolled to port hid deck from brig craft have by time overhauled be far enough ahead to permit of reading name conquistador of havana upon stern while helmsman taking ryan hint have steered so wildly that have sheered schooner almost to within biscuit toss of neighbour meanwhile now that drag be no longer impeding be gradually lessening small space of water separated from brig must see that schooner movement be exciting much curiosity speculation if not actual suspicion in mind of three men who stood right aft on monkey poop intently watching go for'ard hail said ryan to want to get little closer if can without unduly exciting suspicion can affect to be deaf if like perhaps will give chance took speaking trumpet in hand clambering leisurely into fore rigging hailed in spanish ho brig ahoy what brig be that conquistador of havana be reply what schooner be turned to one of men who be standing near asked in most natural manner in world what did say conkistee something of hawaner sounded like to sir answered man what did say yelled at brig raising trumpet again to mouth con quist dor of havana what schooner be that assumed most utter look of bewilderment must upon spur of moment then waving arm impatiently at helmsman to sheer still closer alongside brig whose quarter be now fair abreast of fore rigging repeated question what did say interlocutor who be evidently skipper of brig stamped on deck with vexation a raised hand to mouth yelled at top of voice con quist dor of havana sheer so close to if please senor will be foul of if look out will do mr dugdale shouted ryan in english to evident astonishment consternation of brig people can manage now stand by to jump aboard with will want to act a interpreter for deuce word do understand of confounded lingo a spoke waved hand to helmsman while at same moment gowland who stood close by hauled down spanish ran up british ensign to peak there be shout of dismay from on board brig quick trampling of foot a crew rushed to station hurriedly threw coiled up brace halliard sheet off pin with confused notion of doing something to evade even at last moment be altogether too late somers quarter master who have seen what be afoot have gradually worked way aft sprang to tiller jamming over to port sheered very cleverly alongside brig in wake of main rigging into ryan instantly leaped followed by twenty armed men surprise be so sudden so complete that there be time for resistance even have spaniard be disposed to offer in moment have reached brig deck be in possession schooner instantly sheering off again to short distance in order that two craft might not do damage to other having taken so very decisive step a to board carry brig there be now of course nothing for to go through with affair in same high handed fashion therefore demanded at once to see ship paper after many indignant protest be produced flung down upon cabin table for inspection fully established identity of brig a examination of hold revealed that be fitted with slave deck large copper for preparation of food for unfortunate black captain hoped to secure stock of water farina ample enough to meet want of large cargo abundance of slave iron be fully justified in taking possession of did forthwith hour sufficed for to secure capture put prize crew on board under gowland command then parted company brig to stand on for hour a be going so a not to needlessly alarm barque then to haul up shape course for sierra leone while at once hauled wind in pursuit of new quarry bore by time well upon port quarter a have hitherto be going with topsail just showing above horizon have sooner trimmed sail in chase of barque than found to unspeakable gratification that be still far enough to windward to lay well up for being at commencement of chase not more than point half upon weather bow while from superiority of rig be able to look quite that much higher than did question now be whether in strong wind heavy sea that have to contend against must hold own with craft so much more powerful than have of course taken precaution to get down couple of reef in topsail same in foresail a well a to haul down squaresail get bonnet off jib before leaving conquistador be not until have hauled wind put schooner on taut bowline that be able to realise how hard be actually blowing up to then wind have seemed no more to than brisk pleasant breeze while schooner rode long creaming surge lightly a gull now however have to doff straw hat in hurry to save from being blown away to don close fitting cloth cap instead a well a oil skin while be positively hard work to cross deck against wind a for schooner behaved like mad thing careening to gunwale a soared to crest of wave cleft foaming summit in blinding deluge of spray swept deck from weather cat head right aft to companion plunging next moment into trough with strong roll to windward very bedlam of yell shriek aloft a gale swept between straining mast rigging shuddered a if terrified at headlong plunge that took while milk white spume brimmed to level of figure head roared away from bow in whole acre of boiling glistening creaking groaning of timber bulkhead raised din that novice must have be quite justified in fearing that little hooker be rapidly straining to piece while more than one crash of crockery below faintly heard through other multitudinous sound told that wild antic of barkie be making very pretty general average among domestic utensil with creaking groaning schooner now proved to be truly superb sea boat scarcely shipping so much a bucketful of green water despite merciless manner in be driving way in surmounted sea after sea turning up streaming weather bow to receive buffet gaily shaking feather after plunge be enough to make sailor heart leap with pride exultation be not to be lessened even by awe inspiring spectacle of mountain of water that in continuous procession soared up from beneath keel went roaring away to leeward with foaming crest towered to height of cross tree first anxiety of course be to ascertain whether be gaining upon chase whether be maintaining distance from a soon therefore a have secured morning altitude of sun for determination of longitude measured a accurately a must angle subtended by portion of barque main mast showed above horizon task be one of very considerable difficulty owing to violent motion of two craft when have done best be by mean satisfied with result thought might possibly be help to so when have at length agreed upon actual value of angle clamped instrument taking below stowed carefully away in bunk where there be not much danger of coming to harm through frantic plunging of schooner purpose of course being to compare angle then obtained with to be measured hour two later if second angle must prove to be greater than first must show that have gained on chase if on contrary must prove to be le must show that chase have increased distance from be shortly before noon when again brought sextant on deck opinion being meanwhile strongly divided a to whether not be gaining asserting positively that be while others a stoutly maintained that be not even sextant failed to settle question for if there be difference at in angle be too minute for detection be left in almost same state of suspense a before only relief afforded be assurance that be practically holding own with barque that unless weather grew still worse than be stood fairly good chance of catching eventually one thing be certain light a draught of water be small a be schooner area of lateral resistance compared with of barque be slowly certainly eating way out upon weather quarter main foremast having be visible to leeward of mizenmast when chase commenced while now just showed clear of other to windward thus conclusively demonstrating that be gaining weather gauge of despite heavy sea be certainly most comforting reflection greatly helped to console for otherwise slow progress that be making in chase ryan seemed to be most disappointed man among be very impetuous hot headed liked to do everything on instant with rush upon discovery that be not gaining perceptibly muttered something about giving schooner more canvas luckily before giving order paused long enough to allow fact to be borne in upon that mast be already whipping bending like fishing rod gear taxed to utmost capacity of resistance being despite characteristic above mentioned reasonably prudent careful officer sight restrained forbore to attempt anything so risky a further over driving of already greatly over driven craft not so with skipper of barque be of course impossible for to know whether have observed capture of conquistador hoped believed not however may have be be certain that have be keeping eye sufficiently open to promptly become aware of fact that schooner have altered course be standing after under very heavy press of sail if surmise a to character be anywhere near truth that circumstance alone must be quite sufficient to fully arouse easily awakened apprehension to urge to keep at arm length at risk be that a may have just made noon when quarter master called attention to fact that barque people have loosed main topgallant sail be sheeting home over double reefed topsail be imprudent thing to do however for sail have scarcely be set ten minute when topgallant mast went over side snapped short off by cap skipper instantly availed of pretext afforded by accident to bear away three four point while clearing wreck object doubtless being to determine beyond question whether really be after not if be purpose did not leave long in doubt upon point own helm being put up instant that saw what be about realising by move on part true state of affair now squared dead away before wind shook out reef set fore topgallant sail a well a topmast lower studding sail be piling on canvas with vengeance ryan be not man to be bluffed by such move a glass have be now levelled at barque sooner be people seen in rigging than away went own so much smarter be people than belonging to barque that own studding sail be set dragging like cart horse while theirs be still being sent aloft experiment be tried for about hour by time became evident that schooner be fully a good off wind a be barque if not trifle better seemed to fairly fly while at time when breeze happened to freshen trifle really seemed a though must be lifted out of water altogether be quite persuaded that for preventers have rigged for purpose of relieving mast when be rolling so heavily during preceding calm still remained aloft be doing splendid service must have lost stick be reduced to sheer hulk long before half hour have expired have said that be doing quite a well a if not trifle better than barque for while held own with so that be unable to appreciably alter bearing from be steadily edging up toward gain in respect being so great that ere next manoeuvre be attempted have risen high enough to get momentary glimpse of whole length of rail when floated up on crest of sea be clear therefore that barque have gained nothing by running off wind on contrary have neared fully mile skipper therefore having given unsuccessful experiment fair trial suddenly took in studding sail again reduced canvas once more to couple of reef braced sharp up to wind a before here again have advantage of through superior smartness of own crew for sooner began to shorten sail than did same handling canvas so quickly that be ready nearly five minute before result being that have gained half mile upon have placed ourselves good quarter of mile upon weather quarter by time that have sweated up top sail halliard now felt that barring accident barque be ours must escape to leeward to windward instead therefore of continuing to jam schooner a close into wind eye a must sail with object of weathering out on barque pointed little vixen jib boom fair square at chase checked sheet brace few inch fore aft put along for be worth be astonishing to note advantageous effect be produced upon sailing of ship when becomes possible to check sheet brace even few paltry inch be distinctly noticeable in case of schooner movement be perceptibly freer easier no longer drove keen cut water into heart of sea receiving blow upon rounding of weather bow with force sufficient to shake from stem to stern almost to stop way for appreciable instant of time now slid smoothly up breast of wave taking stroke fairly in wake of fore rigging where have little retarding effect upon surmounted crest with long easy roll then sank with equal smoothness down into trough along sped lightly swiftly a petrel added good half knot to speed be soon apparent that even comparatively trifling advantage on part have not escaped notice of wary friend skipper of barque suggested to yet one more experiment be not slow to make keeping ship away about point half

apparent apathy people hoped to lull into condition of equal carelessness be of course impossible for to say if so signally failed for immediately that barque outline faded into indistinct blur in growing darkness went to work shook out reef round never doubting that be at moment doing precisely same thing supposition be most probably correct ryan indeed who have sent for night glass brought to bear upon declared that must detect increase in area of shadowy canvas for even after have made sail must not perceive that be in wise decreasing distance between two vessel a swift tropical night shut down upon eye in ship became strained to utmost power in effort to keep sight of chase for now that there must no longer be doubt in mind of people that be after felt convinced that must

own person superiority in art of mystification be rendered more anxious by fact that with sky became overspread with thin canopy of cloud while not sufficiently dense to wholly obscure star so dimmed lustre that became difficult to distinguish even through night glass form of wave at greater distance than mile while a for chase be at length reluctantly compelled to admit to other that have lost sight of altogether at least that must not be absolutely certain whether must still see not sometimes be confident that must at other time utterly failed to make out be while be in painful condition of uncertainty that ryan who like have remained on deck diligently working away with glass utterly deaf to more than once repeated statement of steward that dinner be on cabin table turned quickly to said do see that greenish looking star just glimmering through cloud right over jib boom end here stand exactly where be when pitch will see showing about ten degree above horizon there do see star mean yes said catching sight of pale green glimmer a placed in position yes see what of just carry eye from down to horizon at angle of about forty five degree in easterly direction tell if see anything particular did so after two three attempt thought caught faint gleam like light of lamp shining through red curtain yes answered fancy can just make out dim something described what saw precisely exclaimed ryan delightedly there now have in glass be gone again jump of sea render almost impossible to use one telescope on deck of such lively little hooker a not that have word to say against god bless be beauty inch of wish 'd remain steady for second two there have again yes be light in barque after cabin have drawn curtain never suspecting that light must show through yes there be mistake about can see quite plainly now upon word believe be overhauling now that breeze have dropped bit mr pierrepoint d see light where away sir be pointed out to lad after searching prying for be so very dim that be almost impossible to distinguish with naked eye caught sight of very well then remarked ryan with return to old humorous manner showed how great relief to be appearance of faint ruddy gleam keep eye upon bhoy until give ye shpell mr dugdale oi be now goin ' below to dinner if ye lose soight of loight bedad will will keelhaul ye ye shpalpeen be edgin ' away off wind d see blagguard must be surprised if be to up helm shquare away before in minute two hopin ' to run out of soight before moon rise so let oye go off light for single inshtant if ye value shkin keep away bit to man at helm let go off point so steady a go there masther freddy light be right forninst jib boom end now mind that ye kape there be certainly gaining on patting lad affectionately on shoulder warm hearted irishman turned beckoned to follow down into cabin have be below about hour be getting well forward with dinner when heard voice of pierrepoint quarter master in earnest conversation over open skylight occasional word two reached seemed to indicate that be in doubt about something pricked up ear little presently heard pierrepoint ejaculate in tone of impatience with stamp of foot on deck will be shot if can understand at somers will call captain really think must sir if be believe be barque at be circumwenting trick that have be playing be opinion at ryan started to foot hailing through skylight asked what be matter mr pierrepoint have lost sight of light sir answered poor freddy in tone of distress light be still straight ahead of seem to be nearing fast ca make out anything like loom of sail hull of barque if be there think ought to see by time red light show quite plainly in glass will join on deck have look at exclaimed ryan rising from table sprang up companion ladder three step at time following close at heel yes there be light sure enough right ahead of glance aloft a well a feel of breeze on face told in instant that schooner have be further kept away be now running well off wind although change have be so gradual that have not noticed while sitting in cabin ryan took glass from pierrepoint brought to bear on light yes remarked with telescope still at eye be light beyond doubt a say mr pierrepoint can see sign of barque yet must be there for light be obviously moving observe that have very properly kept away to follow surely continued with accent of impatience perplexity have not be following other craft have hove above horizon since darkness set in even so can see nothing of craft obviously however be nearing light whatever be fast for can see quite distinctly in glass even fancy that can see rising falling take glass dugdale tell what can make of took glass after long patient scrutiny of mysterious light pronounced opinion to sir said have appearance of ordinary ship lantern wrapped in strip of red bunting hung from pole something of sort for if will look at closely will notice that sway with wash of sea now then seems to swing for instant behind slender object like light spar must almost take oath that there be barque other kind of craft there once again ryan took telescope after further prolonged scrutiny exclaimed by power believe be right if so have be done certainly have very much appearance that describe what in world can be be moving object beyond doubt for see how have be obliged to run off wind in chase of however be close to now for can make out swinging of lantern lantern be with naked eye be confounded contrivance for leading astray be what be since be so close to may a well ascertain character if only to be awake to trick if ever happens to be played upon second time hand by brace here stand by to back topsail get two three lantern ready to swing over side so that may see just exactly what thing be have by time approached mysterious object so nearly that three four minute sufficed to bring within couple of hundred foot of schooner weather bow when topsail be laid to mast way checked sufficiently to permit of careful examination of thing whatever be by time that have forged ahead far enough to bring on weather beam be close aboard of then light of lantern disclosed nature of contrivance by have be so cleverly tricked be in fact nothing more than raft composed of five nine inch plank laid parallel to other with space of about foot between firmly secured together by couple of stout cross piece nailed athwart whole concern fore end of plank have be sawn away to shape of sharp wedge to facilitate movement of raft through water on foremost cross piece have be rigged oar for mast upon be set hastily contrived squaresail made out of piece of old tarpaulin to head of mast be securely lashed old lantern with short length of candle still burning in lantern being cunningly draped in red bunting to represent appearance of lamp shining through curtain whole contrivance be rendered self steering by attachment of few fathom of line to after end of middle plank at other extremity of drogue consisting of short length of plank be attached drogue have effect of keeping raft running dead before wind travelled at very respectable pace too quite five knot hour estimated speed at for sail be quite big one for so small affair since have be steering for for just about hour meant that have be decoyed five mile to leeward of proper course question now be where be barque did not take very long to make up mind upon point be pretty evident that since skipper have be at so much pain to entice away down to leeward must have held wind time to windward therefore must look for whether however have tacked stood away to westward immediately after launching raft whether have held on upon port tack to northward must not possibly tell for diligent prolonged use of night glass failed to reveal slightest indication of whereabouts ryan however be not long in arriving upon conclusion in matter argued that if have tacked ought also to tack forthwith because if stood on a be going until moon rose might run out of sight of whereas if have not tacked must be at moment somewhere about broad on weather bow if therefore have tacked must be doing right thing to tack also since must then be standing directly after while if have not tacked must still be doing right to heave about since even in case must probably see something of from mast head when moon rose a must in le than hour therefore at once put helm down hove round on starboard tack keeping schooner a close to wind a must lie while still allowing to go along through water faint brightening in sky by by announced welcome approach of moon upon scene shortly afterwards beautiful planet considerably shrunken from full orbed splendour rose slowly into view above horizon curtailed disc showing of deep ruddy orange colour through dense humid vapour of lower atmosphere two hand be at once sent up to topgallant yard to take look round even after have be there hour by time moon have risen high enough to give plenty of light failed to discover sign of barque anything else be at length reluctantly compelled to admit that have be very cleverly tricked that cunning neighbour have fairly given slip will not give up even now exclaimed ryan when conviction have fairly forced upon come down below dugdale let reason thing out accordingly descended to snug little cabin seated ourselves at table ryan producing sheet of paper scale pencil wherewith to graphically illustrate line of reasoning now here said drawing arrow near one margin of paper be wind coming out at west a nearly a may be here laying scale upon paper measuring off distance making two pencil dot be position of barque schooner when former be last seen now estimate that barque be going about eight half knot be reeling off nine by log at time state of affair continued at least until light be seen be about hour after lost sight of friend consequently when light be first seen schooner be here making dot barque there making fourth now what must blagguard be most likely to do when have safely launched raft knew that must go skimming away to leeward taking with therefore think most probable that must tack at once going off in direction laying down line upon paper meanwhile raft went scudding away to leeward until met there making dot then tacked laying point higher than can stood along line ruling one carefully in a spoke now have be travelling along line say hour quarter brings here where be barque if have tacked continued to stand on until now must be there eleven twelve mile away must see supposing however that continued to stand on a be going when last saw must now be there twenty eight mile away phew be long way out of reckoning when thought that must still have in sight even if tacked have lost harry bhoy be fact however know where be bound to be island of cuba be dutchman very well having given slip will make best of way there without further delay be opinion that if be still standing to northward will not continue to do so for very much longer because d 'ye see bhoy will be afraid of falling in with of cruiser if stand in too close to coast therefore a can hug wind closer than can will just stand on a be going for day two longer until wind change in fact will shape course for cuba if fall in with again within next seventy two hour will give up meanwhile wind be dropping fast so will get more muslin upon little hooker a ryan have said wind be dropping fast so rapidly indeed that when eight bell be struck at midnight schooner be under canvas that must set even then be only creeping along at speed of two half knot per hour oh how fervently wished then that must see even a much a mere masthead of barque for felt certain that in such light air schooner must make short work of overtaking nothing hove in sight when next morning dawned be still alone upon face of vast ocean with rising of sun small draught of air still remained to fell dead have calm whole day well on into succeeding night then weather became unsettled thundery with light baffling air interspersed with fierce squall from quarter of compass during made scarcely sixty mile in twenty four hour be about midnight of third day after have lost sight of barque seventy two hour that ryan have allowed in to find again be fully spent without affording glimpse of hand from ryan down to smallest boy in ship be dreadfully disgusted crestfallen at want of success be only waiting for breeze to spring up from somewhere to enable to shape course back to cruising ground weather however be still very overcast lowering with sign not wanting that heavy thunderstorm be brewing must probably bring desired breeze there be not much swell running sufficient nevertheless to tumble schooner about good deal have accordingly taken upon to clew up haul down furl stitch of canvas in order to save sail from battering to rag thunder have be gradually working up ever since sunset in fact even before when eight bell struck at midnight watch below came round weather have curious portentous look atmosphere be moreover so close heavy determined to stretch out standing on stern grating instead of going below so that might be ready in case presence must be required be shortly after two bell when pierrepoint came roused out with remark be sorry to disturb dugdale think be going to rain very shortly if remain there stand very good chance of getting soaked to skin what do think of weather be merely thunder squall have be brewing time what be just look at cloud overhead edge look quite red a though there be fire somewhere behind do think must call captain be a have said sky be banked up from horizon to zenith round with enormous cloud pile black a ink in body of fringe edge have curiously tattered appearance be of distinct fiery red hue time there be not breath of wind save what be created by schooner a rolled heavily on gathering swell not sound save arose within a bulkhead timber creaked groaned dismally cabin door rattled rudder kicked a water swirled gurgled about under counter with heave of jerk of spar aloft slatting of brace a swayed pendulum like from side to side what doe glass say inquired in response to pierrepoint last question walked to open skylight peered down through at barometer tube of be just sufficiently illuminated by turned down cabin lamp to permit of condition being noted have fallen inch since last looked at during watch on deck phew ejaculated there must surely be something matter with thing can never have fallen that much in scarcely two hour hurried below turning up lamp subjected instrument to careful examination a far a must make out there seemed to be nothing wrong with fall have appearance of being perfectly genuine whether not be certain that captain ought at once to be made acquainted with state of affair therefore went forthwith to cabin aroused ay ay answered sleepily to call what be mr dugdale have barque hove in sight such luck sir be sorry to say replied think ought to know that weather have very peculiar threatening appearance glass have dropped full inch within last two hour inch ejaculated ryan starting up in bunk inch surely dugdale must be mistaken indeed sir be not said examined barometer very carefully satisfied that have made mistake before calling by jove then be high time be on deck exclaimed leaping out of bunk just put match to lamp harry lad will ye will find box there on shelf be there wind not breath sir will not be surprised if have great deal more than want before long answered um said well almost anything short of hurricane must be better than exasperating calm swell seems to have risen bit since turned in have quite perceptibly said seems to be coming more out from northward than at first well said thrusting bare foot into slipper let go on deck take look round leading way forthwith trundled up companion ladder stepped out on deck seemed to have grown blacker more threatening than ever during short time have be below although may have be due to contrast between light of cabin darkness on deck ruddy tinge on cloud edge however be even more pronounced than before colour having slightly changed grown more like hue of red hot copper ryan be evidently much astonished thought somewhat dismayed by what saw by power ejaculated did right to call dugdale if be in indian ocean now must say that cyclone be brewing now come to think of there be act of parliament against one brewing here how be glass now have dropped anything since last looked at went to skylight once more peered at mercury yes indeed sir have answered have gone down nearly one tenth then by piper be in for something out of common sooner set about preparing for better exclaimed ryan ah see have already furled everything well leaf so much le to be still done call hand however for may have upon at moment by look of thing up there pointing to frowning ruddy sky rig in jib boom send down lower yard on deck topmast a well set of men to secure canvas with double gasket close reef boom foresail set let carpenter look to hatch see that be securely battened down have better examine pump also life may depend upon before be over where be boatswain oh be that bartlett give eye to boat gripe will see that be right have known boat to be blown clean from davit before now hurrah men look alive with yard let have down here on deck a quickly a possible schooner be by time a busy a beehive in swarming time men working with will since knew from sharp incisive tone in ryan issued order a well a by menacing aspect of sky that occasion be pressing fortunately in so small lightly rigged craft a felicidad task of preparing for forthcoming battle with element be not heavy one being well manned for size be soon ready none too soon however for hardly have finishing touch be given to preparation gun boat made thoroughly secure than be momentarily dazzled blinded by terrific flash of blue lightning seemed to dart from cloud immediately overhead to strike water close to filling dead heavy air with strong odour of brimstone while simultaneously be deafened stunned by most awful ear splitting crack of thunder made schooner quiver from stem to stern a though have be struck by heavy shot ryan pierrepoint be standing close together near companion at moment when lightning flashed out illumining whole scene for instant with light a brilliant a of noonday sun while be still in process of recovering from shock produced by terrifying crash of thunder heard fellow mid exclaim to captain there did see that sir there be craft of sort away out there pointing in north easterly direction saw a distinctly a possible be about six mile away be stripped to close reefed topsail did see that ship out there on port quarter sir hailed one of men from forecastle interrupting master freddy in tale answered ryan sharply be looking way what did look like be square rigged craft of about three four hundred ton under close reefed topsail lying end on to sir answered man surely ca be old friend barque have drifted within view of again during darkness exclaimed ryan excitedly keep good look out for lad when next flash come added in eager tone of voice showed conclusively how secondary matter impending outburst of element have already become to in view of new discovery second flash came however instead of almost a last word left ryan lip cloud above burst there descended from heaviest downpour of rain have ever up to time witnessed who have never beheld tropical thunder shower can form conception of what be like imagine to be standing immediately under large tank of warm water then further imagine that content of tank be suddenly capsized right on top of multiply quantity of falling water million time suppose descent of water to be continued for from three to six seven minute will then have imperfect conception of sort of drenching that received on occasion of be now speaking deck be flooded in instant before must wriggle into oil skin be soaked to skin warm water be washing above ankle with roll of schooner scupper be wholly inadequate to occasion be obliged to open port to get rid of water prevent from getting below downpour lasted four minute so ceasing a abruptly with a little warning a have commenced in time have beaten down swell so effectually that motion be scarcely more perceptible than must have be in well sheltered roadstead effect of sudden cessation of noise have be so recently sounding in ear of crash of downpour be very weird curious dead silence now being broken only by occasional faint creak jar of bulkhead boom loud gush gurgle of water pouring from scupper silence be of long duration however for have scarcely found time to become sensible of when faint moaning sound arose in air coming from one knew where presently with still louder moan sudden furious scuffle of wind swept past causing reefed foresail to flap loudly be gone moanings grew louder more weird sounding now on port quarter now on starboard bow then broad abeam anon high over masthead be clear that small partial current of air be in violent motion round that crisis be at hand pirate slaver by harry collingwood chapter eight caught in cyclone watch below have be dismissed upon completion of work of preparation not man have left deck anxiety to see know worst of what be to befall having completely overcome usual propensity to make utmost of moment allotted to for necessary rest be now huddled clustered together upon forecastle discussing situation in low murmured tone holding in readiness like hound in leash to spring into activity at first word of command moaning wailing sound be now floating round presently making rapidly audible above became conscious of deep fierce bellowing roar seemed to be approaching on starboard beam schooner head being then about north west here come exclaimed ryan in hoarse tone of suppressed excitement get hold of belaying pin two will stand very good chance of being blown overboard starboard helm hard over with man get under lee of starboard bulwark men carpenter be ax ready in case must be obliged to cut anything away ready sir came reply scarcely audible above roar of tempest be now close upon a man spoke fierce gust of wind laden with salt mist swooped down upon careened schooner almost to covering board a filled foresail with jar report like of nine pounder blast be only momentary however be upon gone again in instant be quickly succeeded by others then away in gloom right abeam of appeared white spectral glimmer swooping down upon schooner with speed of race horse spreading momentarily wider athwart blackness a came be line of white foam churned up on surface of sea by advancing hurricane behind ocean be white a milk air be now in violent motion about fierce eddy swooping hither thither generally in same direction a from gale be approaching heavy salt laden gust struck lasting just long enough to give schooner way render obedient to helm then deep bass roar rose into deafening yelling medley of indescribable sound a gale struck poor little schooner bowed beneath blow until water poured in over lee gunwale thought that be going to turn turtle with foresail stood strain for just instant then split to ribbon be torn from bolt rope a cleanly a though work have be done with knife good sail have already done work before hurricane proper have struck in that have imparted life even though ever so little to schooner be already paying slowly off when first stroke of hurricane beat down continued to do so until a got dead before rose suddenly to even keel went scudding away to leeward like frightened sea bird awful volume of sound given out by fierce headlong swoop of wind a bore down upon quite prepared to see mast blown clean out of schooner gear fortunately happened to be sound good loss of foresail be full extent of damage sustained by having satisfied upon point ventured to raise head little above bulwark to see how strange sail be faring pierrepoint have reported a being visible in north eastern quarter if be so ought now to be somewhere astern of since be running off about south west sure enough there be about point half on starboard quarter just visible in midst of ghostly glare of phosphorescent foam be like running dead before gale thought must make out that topsail have withstood tremendous strain of outburst be still doing duty if be so since be scudding under bare pole must soon overtake pas quite a closely a must be at consistent with safety of two craft must be afforded opportunity to learn something of character to judge whether be barque that have be so industriously seeking made way over to ryan who be standing a well a must against violence of wind threatened to sweep off foot close to helmsman pointed toward stranger clinging to companion stood watched for minute two half suffocated with difficulty of breathing in so furious tempest be now about four mile from soon became apparent that be overhauling fast although by mean so fast a expected be so nearly end on to suggested to ryan advisability of showing light a looked very much a though have not yet seen might approach so closely a to put craft in imminent peril in good time shouted captain in ear in response to suggestion believe that have seen yet be not of much consequence since of be steering a steadily a pleasure boat on river will take care to make acquainted with whereabouts if there appears to be slightest danger of running over want to pas a near a possible so that may have good view of for there seems to to be something familiar looking about a though have seen before between harry believe to be old friend barque again if so must keep up with at cost until weather moderate sufficiently to bring to so just step for'ard will lad get fore trysail on deck bent ready for setting in case need let one hand bring aft lantern not lighted mind ye can take below light there leave at foot of companion ladder ready to show light if yonder stranger seems likely to sheer too close to in passing went forward a requested found that watch below have already returned to hammock crisis having passed schooner scudding a comfortably a must be before gale trysail be got up from below bent halliard sheet hooked on in short made ready for setting returned aft to ryan side having to claw way to along rail in preference to creeping along deck upon four seemed to be only alternative method of making headway against wind sea be by time getting up air be full of spume scud water caught up from surface of sea crest of wave swept along in blinding drenching shower by gale superior officer be still clinging to companion with eye intently fixed upon strange sail astern now that dense mass of cloud overhead be torn into shred of flying scud by fury of wind be pretty distinctly visible at distance of about mile half by dim misty moonlight that filtered through have be trying to get peep at through night glass exclaimed ryan with wave of hand toward dark blotch in midst of white foam there be holding in breeze a have to keep tight grip on thing wind will take away from altogether be pretty certain that be barque if so will stick to a long a schooner will hang together do think that have seen yet asked yes fancy so answered ryan appears to to be edging away trifle so a to pas to starboard giving a wide berth a possible even although may have seen believe that be recognised a yet indeed how must be at distance end on a be with canvas set topmast struck must look like little more than dot on water be quite true fully believed with ryan that have not be recognised for although companion have indeed manifested sign of inclination to edge away from tendency be only to sufficient extent to insure passing in safety have suspected of being enemy must not have be positively dangerous for to have altered course fully point although blowing a then did must have be exceedingly imprudent to have attempted more than in about hour after have joined ryan strange craft overtook while be yet half mile astern of have made out to be barque of just about same size a one that have be hunting for when came up abreast of at distance of not more than quarter of mile saw that main topmast have gone just at cap people be still busy with wreck of pretty tough job seemed to be having with too that be much more strongly manned than be usually case with merchantman of size be also evident for must see that while one gang be at work clearing away wreck be busy securing fore topmast by getting up preventer backstay so on how managed to work aloft at in such terrific weather passed comprehension there be at least trying to do something a ryan remarked showed conclusively what resolute set of fellow be on board afforded clue a to sort of resistance be likely to meet with must ever come to game of fisticuffs between having once overtaken seemed to very quickly pas ahead when be once more about two mile distant ryan gave order to set storm fore trysail step that might then very well take without exciting very strong suspicion on board barque a to ulterior intention since sea be by time getting up to extent made exhibition of small amount of canvas on board schooner not only justifiable absolutely necessary sail be accordingly set risk of being pooped be for time at least done away with be almost of equal importance in eye now appeared to be holding own with sail ahead watch have just be called when noticed that wind be backing further round from northward pretty conclusive indication that be cyclone revolving storm that have encountered ryan began to be exceedingly anxious upon subject of heaving to since a explained to mile that now travelled carried nearer to terrible vortex eye of storm still must not bring to do so while barque held on thus allowing to effect escape from second time assuming of course that really be a very strongly suspected former acquaintance be therefore with feeling of considerable satisfaction that shortly afterwards saw start fore topsail sheet with evident intention of clewing up sail if possible preparatory to heaving to ah exclaimed ryan admiringly that fellow be fool scent danger ahead have be in cyclone before to day will warrant seems to know exactly what be about there go topsail clean out of bolt rope a expected must suppose ever seriously hoped to save sail now over go helm there round to ah h look at on beam end by be be righting again good very prettily done v e r y prettily done indeed now luff excellent capital be safe now man will run down to harry bhoy heave to about mile to leeward of then perhaps will not suspect will gradually settle down towards a will lie closer than will when wind drop will have to do a like with be very anxious moment with when having run down to spot selected by ryan eased helm over to bring schooner to on starboard tack that being correct tack upon to heave to in cyclone in northern hemisphere will never forget feeling of absolute helplessness seized when a little craft gradually presented broadside to gale felt going over over over until water poured in raging cataract over lee rail laid down beneath strength of howling blast now seemed to have suddenly increased to twice former fury until lee side of deck be buried almost to combing of hatchway a bow came round presented more obliquely to gale righted somewhat although still careened until lee rail be awash rode furious sea a gallantly buoyantly a gull ryan have displayed very considerable amount of judgment in conducting schooner down to berth have chosen for have placed there in so natural manner that scarcely believed possible that presence so near barque must be likely to arouse suspicion of intention in mind of crew a have never be very near during time of former pursuit of be in hope that must not now be recognised have taken up position exactly to leeward of neighbour a ryan have anticipated soon found that schooner be looking up full point higher than bigger craft be very evenly balanced by greater amount of lee drift that made in consequence of much lighter draught therefore contrived to maintain position with almost perfect exactitude except that schooner manifested greater tendency to forge ahead thus placing gradually further upon barque lee bow wind continued to blow with unabated fury when day broke be able to look about scene be grand awful beyond power of description sky be of uniform deep slaty purple grey hue across face of careered constant succession of lighter grey smoky looking cloud shredded torn to tatter by headlong sweep of gale colour of sea be dirty green deepening in tint to purple black in hollow capped by long ridge of dirty yellowish foam be continuously snatched up by wind hurled through air in drenching sheet cut stung skin like lash of whip sea although not so high a might have be expected from force of wind be still formidable enough to be almost terrifying in aspect a swept down upon schooner in long steep mountain like ridge soared to nearly height of main cross tree with hollow of fully one hundred eighty foot in width between wave crowned with roaring foaming crest reared above low hull a though eager to hurl upon destroy a day wore on received temporary addition to company in shape of brig hove in sight in eastern quarter about six bell in forenoon watch first sight that got of revealed that jib boom topmast be gone be showing storm staysail at first sight supposed to be hove to drove down towards so fast that soon came to conclusion that there must be something wrong with steering gear a drew nearer became evident that be unmanageable falling off occasionally until be almost dead before wind must see whenever happened sea made clean breach over when within about mile of showed russian ensign upside down in main rigging to responded by hoisting spanish colour to lull doubt might possibly be lurking in mind of friend on board barque who did not condescend to favour with sight of bunting a for brig drove straight down towards occasioning considerable amount of anxiety for so erratic be movement that when have arrived within couple of cable length of became impossible to say whether must pas ahead astern of only thing that must do to avoid be to fill upon schooner forge ahead out of way must have done for possibility that after having done so brig might take sheer in wrong direction fall foul of when destruction of schooner if not of vessel must inevitably have happened at length became evident that something must be done for be settling bodily down upon two minute must bring two craft into collision ryan therefore ordered helm to be shifted be just forging clear a thought leaving room to pas under stern when terrific sea swept down upon throwing quarter round sweeping from stem to stern driving crew into rigging in instant there be driving along stem on right for rather for spot that must occupy when reached there be now only one way of avoiding disastrous collision be by putting helm hard up at risk jibing round upon other tack accordingly did missing brig by hair breadth springing foremast head so badly a trysail jibed over have to get in sail at once set close reefed main staysail instead a for brig be little better than wreck for a drove past saw that rudder be gone bulwark carried away on side from cat head to taffrail deck swept of everything be movable be of course utterly impossible for to help in way in wind sea that then raged must follow in helpless progress to leeward stand by damage to foremast being so serious a to utterly preclude possibility of getting headsail upon schooner until have be at least temporarily repaired while little hooker having again be brought to on starboard tack absolutely refused to pay off under staysail only be perhaps just a well so far a be concerned since attempt on part to run to leeward must almost certainly have resulted in swamping of schooner what became of brig whether outlived gale not never knew for continued erratic course to leeward lost sight of in about hour half from time when so nearly fell on board saw no more be driving in direction must carry right into track of vortex of storm to encounter in wrecked helpless condition must infallibly mean destruction a day wore on wind gradually shifted round further from eastward by nightfall be blowing from about east south east showing sign of moderating although still blew very heavily much too heavily indeed to justify in sending hand aloft to fish sprung mast head nevertheless preparation be made for commencement of operation at earliest possible moment a have detected sign on board barque indicative of intention to send new main topmast up without delay might might not mean that suspicion a to true character have begun to dawn upon by midnight gale have moderated to strong breeze sky have cleared sufficiently to permit of little moonlight percolating through between denser cloud be then able to make out to inexpressible chagrin that barque people have already got new topmast aloft ridded be getting main topsail yard across having be hard at work doubtless ever since darkness set in though how have managed to perform task be puzzle to be however evidence of resolute character of skipper hint to that must have work cut out to bag carpenter be therefore at once sent for set forthwith to task of fishing mast head with possible expedition task be not half executed however when have mortification to see neighbour sheet home double reefed topsail make sail to westward sight put men upon mettle must vividly picture to laugh that slaver must be enjoying at expense must have suspected intention toward before barque be absolutely out of sight from aloft chip have managed to make such job of work a enabled to make sail also daylight brought with clear sky dappled with high fleecy white fine weather cloud moderate breeze from south east with very heavy confused sea still running however a barque royal be still in sight above horizon cracked on after although carpenter have warned ryan that work done during night be scarcely a satisfactory a might be that mast head be hardly to be trusted fellow be thoroughly good man eager to avoid possibility of being said that have lost chance of prize through a soon therefore a be light enough to see be aloft again by eight bell have finished work reported that might now pack sail upon schooner to heart content forthwith did giving everything must draw from royal down wind being very nearly aft be to say about two point on larboard quarter by noon became apparent that be gaining although slowly on barque royal half topgallant sail being by time above horizon now be anxiety on board schooner a to character of coming night for have doubt seeing a now must that be following ever vigilant suspicion of barque people must prompt to avoid must night prove dark enough to permit of manoeuvre indication be for fine weather however glass be rising steadily sky be becoming of deeper clearer blue white cloud be melting away promising clear star lit night between hour of sunset moonrise what be equally a much in favour wind sea be going down steadily toward eight bell in afternoon watch sighted sail schooner time be beating up to eastward crossed hawse of barque at great distance exchanging signal with although what be nature must not see even have be near enough to have made out flag be exceedingly improbable that must have understood have suspicion however that in way referred to for shortly afterwards schooner tacked stood towards crossing bow at distance of about mile exhibiting french ensign replied by showing spanish colour a before upon stranger threw out signal that must not understand after displaying for few minute hauled down hoisted thought must never do to display total ignorance of signal ryan therefore ordered signal bag to be produced strung flag together haphazard hoisted signal schooner acknowledged tacking at same time standing toward once more be far too busy to wait for for although have look of slaver knew from course be steering that must have slave on board be therefore altogether unworthy of attention with so promising craft a barque in plain view made attempt to follow in hour be out of sight to northward by sunset night weather be everything that must wish have risen chase to topsail everybody on board felicidad be therefore in highest spirit hope ran high that by daybreak on morrow must have neighbour under gun be able to give overhaul star came out brilliantly although moon must not rise until after midnight must not give much light even then since have entered fourth quarter soon found that must have light enough to prevent barque from giving slip provided that kept eye open nevertheless darkness have sooner set in than made effort to do so by edging off to northward couple of point move however soon detected frustrated by steering directly after during night wind breezed up again somewhat gave chase so great advantage at daybreak be still about eight mile ahead shortly after sunrise however dwindled away again gradually dropped to gentle air barely fanned along at speed of five knot by noon have brought chase to within five mile of ryan deemed that time have now arrived for to declare accordingly hoisted british colour fired gun a signal to barque to heave to only notice taken of be exhibition of spanish colour by chase firing of shotted gun of defiance so now at last knew other meanwhile wind be very gradually dropping schooner a gradually gaining upon craft ahead until at length late in afternoon have reached within mile half of then began one of barbarous practice have heard of have hitherto be scarcely able to credit a sober truth namely throwing of slave overboard in order to retard pursuit by causing pursuer to stop pick up poor wretch a british men o ' war invariably did whenever be at practicable mode of procedure be generally to launch unhappy black overboard securely lashed to plank piece of timber large enough to float a be dropped exactly in track of pursuing man o ' war be certain to be seen by one on board effort made to pick up in water infested by shark however have be found to be of very doubtful utility since happened a often a not that long before unfortunate wretch have served purpose for be sacrificed shark have found torn to piece in order therefore certain hundred of good dollar value might not be wasted not from motif of humanity to slave desire to give better chance for life merely that might last long enough to delay man o ' war to extent of picking up improved plan have be devised for use on occasion where presence of shark might be expected plan consisting simply in heading black up in cask be plan now adopted by people on board barque chapter nine governor communication at distance now separated from barque movement of crew be distinctly visible to with aid of glass of course be scarcely off for moment accordingly witnessed launching of first slave overboard unhappy creature be placed in cask a have said before headed up therein aperture being cut in two half of head just sufficient to admit neck cask be then slung by whip from main yard arm secured by toggle withdrawal of at right moment by mean of lanyard enabled cask to be dropped gently right end up in water where floated with inmate helpless prisoner to be picked up not a case might be to render ruse of real service smart breeze must be blowing because under condition pursuer have not only to lower boat to pick up floating black have also to heave to wait for boat however smartly operation of lowering picking up hooking on again may be performed still absorb quite appreciable amount of time during fugitive craft increase lead more le according to speed in present case however condition be by mean favourable to pursued craft for since be only moving through water at speed of about three knot be easy matter for to drop boat into water send on ahead to pick up man pull alongside again without detaining schooner for instant slaver tried trick four time in succession then finding that did not answer gave up sun be just dipping beneath horizon in magnificent array of light cirrus cloud painted by last ray in tincture of most brilliant purple rose gold wind have died away to merest zephyr when arrived within gun shot of chase ryan at once ordered long eighteen between mast to be cleared away shot fired a close to barque a possible without hitting just by way of gentle hint that be disposed to stand more nonsense that time have now arrived for to surrender without giving further trouble evidently last thought in mind of skipper be to yield for instead of hauling down colour like good sensible man blazed away at in return with couple of twelve pounder that have run out through stern port shot be well aimed did not quite reach striking water twice fair in line with then making final scurry sinking within about thirty yard of bow by piper believe fellow intends to fight exclaimed ryan a rule gentleman be particularly careful of skin have fancy for hard knock giving in when find that only choice lie between fight surrendering there be occasional exception to rule fancy that fellow will prove to be one of now harry bhoy must be careful what be after when come to boarding carrying yonder gintleman for if happen to be one of reckless desperado kind may play scurvy trick have heard of men who blew ship everybody in into air rather than allow to be captured for aught that can tell to contrary fellow who command barque may be one of stamp now if be may rest assured that will hing desperate until capture of ship be certain until then will be foremost man in fray so must keep sharp look out for put hors de combat before have chance to do harm hope breeze will hold long enough to enable to get alongside must be becalmed have to attack with boat will give important advantage perhaps result in loss of of men hope of ryan be destined to disappointment for wind continued to dwindle after sunset until finally died away altogether left craft without steerage way by time however have drifted within range of barque gun have opened rather desultory well directed fire upon whenever of gun must be brought to bear result of be that one of men have already be hurt by splinter while schooner rigging be beginning to be good deal cut up meanwhile be precluded from returning barque fire lest must injure kill of unhappy wretch pent up in hold at length round shot entered schooner bow traversed deck passed out over taffrail glancing hither thither a went although did material damage affording several of men very narrow escape why will never do exclaimed ryan a shot made exit after passing between leg of man who be standing at now idle tiller few of fellow a well aimed a one be must make very pretty general average among will have to get out boat stop yes think that will be better will arm men make ready for boarding gun with double charge of grape then man sweep sweep schooner alongside firing gun a heave grappling iron boarding in smoke will thus have hand available when get alongside bulwark will meanwhile afford men certain amount of protection necessary order be accordingly given few minute later men stripped to waist have rigged out heavy sweep be toiling away at now advantage of schooner light scantling light draught fine line made fully apparent for having once overcome inertia of hull put in motion men found little craft very easy on sweep capable of being moved at quite respectable pace through water barque be of course much too large unwieldy craft to be moved by same mean nothing of kind be even attempted crew however maintained smart fire upon a approached a be careful to keep end on so that only two stern chaser must be brought to bear upon a kept up hot musketry fire upon particular part of did not suffer very severely without further casualty at length arrived near enough with good way on to permit of sweep being laid in preparatory to ranging up alongside ryan now divided boarder into two party one to be led by from aft while be instructed to head other party from forecastle idea being to pin slaver crew between two party thus attacking simultaneously in front rear a might be ryan conned schooner alongside when be within ten yard of barque gun having previously be trained well forward whole of small broadside be poured in upon deck with terribly destructive effect must seem from outburst of shriek groan curse immediately arose on board fire be instantly returned in such partial irregular way a only tended to confirm impression that slaver crew have suffered severely yet gave tolerably clear idea of what must have be result to have withheld fire for just second two longer then while craft be still enveloped in motionless smoke wreath felt schooner side rasping against of barque with shout to little party to follow sprang upon own bulwark from thence to of barque so down on slaver deck for slaver be a olfactory nerve now assured beyond dispute be by time quite dark at least a dark a be likely to be at night sky be cloudless atmosphere be clear star be shining with lustre quite unknown in more temperate clime therefore have little difficulty in seeing what be about in distinguishing friend from foe still must confess that felt little awkward having commenced by discharging pistol into thickest of crowd found opposed to confined pretty much to random system of slashing right left with cutlas principle if have one being to strike blow leaving to others task of warding if must fight now ensued be brief sharp slaver disputing inch of deck with fellow be not to be resisted there be brief space of time during air seemed full of sound of clashing steel popping pistol shout shriek groan execration barque be ours crew throwing away weapon cry loudly for quarter of course be granted to fight being over at once made way aft be greatly shocked to find that during brief struggle poor ryan have be badly wounded in hand to hand fight with skipper of barque whom have at once singled out engaged afterwards appeared that a soon a matter seemed to be going badly for barque people skipper have attempted to slip out of fight slink below ryan suspecting sinister object in projected movement have stuck to man so closely getting between companion that object if have one be frustrated in desperation have struck blow at ryan clove unfortunate irishman skull open only to be impaled upon dashing captain sword at same moment ryan have thus fulfilled purpose of putting slaver skipper hors de combat at serious cost to poor fellow be so desperately hurt that must hing murmur gratification at finding have emerged from fray unhurt injunction to to take command when fainted at once have carefully conveyed to own cabin on board schooner where armstrong surgeon immediately took in hand capture be named san sebastian hailed from havana have four hundred twenty one slave on board out of total of four hundred seventy six that have brought out of gaboon river only ten day before be very fine handsome vessel of three hundred forty five ton measurement recent experience with have proved that sailed like witch secured prisoner conveyed own wounded amounting to nine in on board schooner then having put pierrepoint prize crew on board barque vessel made sail in company for sierra leone where arrived safely after passage of exactly week where be rejoined by gowland prize crew of conquistador vessel have arrived six day before here a repairing of damage provision of new foremast for schooner threatened with considerable amount of delay ryan went ashore to hospital where made pretty fair progress toward recovery although improvement be not so marked rapid a have be on board schooner at sea intense heat complained be against first inquiry morning when went to see be when did think schooner must be ready for sea again be therefore with feeling of intense satisfaction be at length able to inform that day must see out of hand of shipwright rigger that might sail on day following if so pleased news acted like cordial upon spirit brightened up wonderfully improved more rapidly within ensuing twenty four hour than have done during whole time of sojourn in hospital for firmness of doctor must at once have taken discharge actually busied about final preparation for departure however insisted upon joining in acceptance of invitation to dine with governor that evening at appointed hour called for sauntered slowly to government house together party be not very large one did sit very late a other guest be taking leave excellency intimated that desired to have word two with in private accordingly deferred departure when at length be alone host invited to light up cigar setting example proceeded to cabinet stood in corner of room opening produced folded document from drawer unfolding laid before gentleman said be rough sketch chart of embouchure of congo doe not profess to be drawn to scale be told that show with approximate accuracy relative position of various creek indentation discharge into main river up to narrow now individual from whom obtained chart informs that at distance of about two half mile up certain creek on south bank one mouth of be indicated by star there be rather considerable native settlement ruled by savage known to few european who posse doubtful honour of acquaintance a king plenty if informant be to be depended upon potentate whose chief characteristic be avarice brutal ferocity have discovered very simple method of combining business with pleasure by making ruthless war upon neighbour after lust for slaughter be satisfied disposing of prisoner to certain slave dealer who have established on southern bank of creek where have erected barracoons factory convenience for carrying on nefarious trade be told that within last six month spot known only to select few have be frequently visited large number of slave have be carried away from natural characteristic rendering especially suitable for traffic for instance must appear that creek like most of others discharge into congo like african river generally have own little bar at mouth upon there be only one three quarter fathom of water be therefore unapproachable by of men o ' war on station excepting perhaps barracouta be away cruising just now while character of bank be such a to afford facility for galling continuous fire upon flotilla of boat advancing up creek have therefore thought that breaking up destruction of slave trading station must be piece of work admirably suited to felicidad gallant crew ryan simultaneously bowed appreciation of compliment because be especially case wherein valour discretion must go hand in hand service being of especially hazardous nature feel that in one be two quality have mentioned more admirably combined than in person of captain ryan ryan bowed again remarked be obliged for excellency good opinion of still more so for information that have be good enough to give to night have be very fortunate so far in schooner suppose may reckon upon promotion a certain be eager to have further opportunity of distinguishing if can only be lucky enough to find two three slaver up creek to capture must afford just opportunity that require will sail to morrow will hope to be back here again in month six week with two three prize in company assurance that establishment in question be completely destroyed sat few minute longer drank final glass of wine then took leave walked down to schooner together ryan having determined to sleep on board night sailed from sierra leone on following day a ryan have resolved must a usually happens when matter be hurried met with endless succession of petty delay at last moment detained at anchor until nearly occasioned vast amount of trotting about in broiling sun to put life into dilatory people who be keeping waiting consequence of be that when at last lifted anchor stood out of bay with very last of sea breeze to run into calm when have attained offing of two mile felt altogether too tired knocked up to eat drink while a for ryan be in state of high fever once more got land breeze about eight o'clock night stood away to southward westward until midnight in order that might obtain good offing when hauled up on south east course for congo remained on deck until midnight at hour be relieved by pierrepoint then be obliged to send for doctor who after feeling pulse ordered to bunk at once when be there administered to tremendous dose of frightfully bitter concoction telling at same time for comfort that must not be in least surprised if when next visited must find suffering from severe attack of coast fever happily anticipation so far a be concerned be unfounded by daybreak poor ryan be in state of raving delirium with three men in cabin told off to keep in bunk prevent from inflicting upon injury a for medicine have taken threw first into profuse perspiration afterwards into deep sleep from awoke next morning cool free from pain with quiet steady pulse very weak did not fully recover strength until day two before made land about congo mouth did after long passage be uneventful in everything save persistency with be beset by calm light baffling air by time ryan too have recovered to certain extent be to say be able to leave bunk to stagger up on deck for hour so at time be still frightfully weak often appeared to from rather wild talk in sometimes indulged that have not thus far fully recovered mental balance made land about six bell in forenoon watch stood straight in for shark point hugged pretty closely in order to cheat current a usual at time of year be running out pretty strongly sea breeze be blowing gale however despite current little felicidad slid over ground bravely arriving abreast mouth of creek to be bound about four bell in afternoon watch here cleared schooner for action sent men to quarter with leadsman in fore chain on port on starboard side with ryan sketch chart in hand conning vessel steered boldly into creek sounding obtained at entrance proved chart to be so far correct with confidence thus strengthened glided gently forward over glassy water of creek eye being directed anxiously ahead for knew not at what moment might encounter enemy in what force might be to appeared that be acting in rather foolhardy manner in thus rushing blindfold a be upon unknown earlier in day in fact just after have entered river have suggested to ryan advisability of taking schooner somewhat higher up stream anchoring in snug well sheltered spot that have noticed when last in river in barracouta sending boat away at night to reconnoitre happened to be one of captain bad day by mean that be one of day when fever from have be suffering seemed to partially regain hold upon making impatient irritable unwilling to receive anything in shape of suggestion from anybody proposal be therefore scouted a savouring of something approaching to timidity have long ago got over such feeling however even now when momentarily expected to come face to face with enemy found sufficiently calm collected to note admire many beauty of scene a creek opened up before for scene be beautiful exceedingly with wild tropical lavishness of strange in case grotesque form rich magnificence of colour that word can adequately describe even artist palette must be taxed to utmost capacity to merely suggest creek be a usual in congo lined with almost unbroken impassable belt of mangrove multitudinous root gnarled twisted springing from thick mud stained water presenting confused inextricable tangle to eye from deep shadow of flitted kingfisher of many specie brilliant plumage while above swayed rustled in gentle breeze delicate grey green foliage of tree now in full luxuriant leaf affording delicious contrast of cool green shadow with glint of dazzling sunshine streamed here there through verdant mass great cluster of magnificent orange tinted orchid gleamed like galaxy of golden star between mangrove trunk at frequent interval clump of feathery bamboo swayed gently in soft warm breeze dense background of bush displayed conceivable tint of foliage from brilliant gold to deepest purple bronze magnificent forest tree towered in stately majesty over

grassy space reached down to water edge stately antelope stepped daintily down into water a though to slake thirst catching sight of approaching schooner bounded off again into contiguous bush where be instantly lost sight of in sombre green gloom at distance of about two mile from mouth of creek reached spot where forked one arm wider of two running in due east by south direction while other trended away to west south west communicating a afterwards discovered with creek although too shoal for navigation by sea going craft must have afforded excellent facility for reconnaissance with boat at point southern shore of creek exhibited sign of cultivation small patch of bush having be cleared here there planted with maize sugarcane yam small reed hut thatched with palm leaf usually standing in one corner of plot with tethered goat close by few fowl other trace of being inhabited of human inhabitant however strangely enough nothing be to be seen be clear that be nearing goal word be passed along deck for men to hold prepared for instant action there be several memoranda jotted down upon chart for guidance among be intimation to look out for clump of exceptionally tall tree on southern bank of creek under broad shadow of slave barracoons be stated to be built few minute after passing branch creek already referred to arrived at bend a schooner glided round entered new reach tree swept into view there must be mistaking for lifted majestic head there be five of fully fifty foot clear above of brother moreover stood quite close to margin of creek thus confirming statement made upon sketch chart have there be lurking doubt in mind about matter must have be quickly dispelled for a glided forward small sandy beach also referred to in chart be made out projecting from southern bank at twenty thirty large canoe lay with bow hauled sufficiently out of water to prevent going adrift that vigilant watch be being kept upon water of creek became quickly apparent for have scarcely made out canoe when saw several negro rush down to one of launch paddle swiftly away up creek round bend while a advanced crowd of naked black armed with spear shield musket gathered upon

vanished at length when only short half mile intervened between beach projected boldly nearly half way across channel main mast of schooner crept into view beyond concealment of hitherto intervening bush tree bringing glass to bear upon detected sign of great bustle confusion on board made out that crew be busily engaged in tricing up boarding netting otherwise making preparation for defence ryan now ordered ensign pennant to be hoisted thus boldly announcing at once nationality fact of being enemy announcement must have deemed perfectly justifiable to defer until last possible moment schooner at once replied by hoisting french colour firing gun of defiance greatly amused people to whom act seemed piece of ridiculous braggadocio for stranger be bigger than ourselves laugh left face be succeeded by look of grim resolution when presently opened out larger schooner heavy handsome brigantine first flying spanish colour brigantine black flag be not for before arrived abreast beach have opened out still schooner with spanish flag floating from mast head by what saw going on board four craft became evident that have by mean caught bold rover napping that might confidently reckon upon

precaution to insure safety four craft being moored in pair with spring on cable stern to stern right across stream so that fair way being very narrow must have to be fought taken in succession

blindfold into hornet nest from nothing coolest courage determination must extricate while have long ago completely conquered feeling of trepidation anxiety that almost everybody experience more le

slender figure by crimson sash entered demanded in spanish can do anything for senor what be name lad said answering question with be called pedro senor well then pedro said can do two thing for if will in first place can get something to drink if will be so kind in next can tell name of ship captain will willingly do senor with pleasure drink first answered lad with bright smile disclosed array of small beautifully regular ivory white teeth turning on bare heel retired a noiselessly a have entered only to reappear moment later with tumbler in one hand large glass jug full to within inch of brim with lemonade upon surface of floated two three slice of fruit curl of rich golden green rind filled handed bumper instantly drained begged for lad laughed handed second tumblerful also drained liquid be deliciously cool of peculiar acid slightly bitter flavour seems so ineffably refreshing when one be parched with fever yet senor asked pedro with laugh a handed glass back to well n o not just now think thank answered now pedro boy tell about ship captain how came to be here be easily done senor answered lad in first place brigantine be named francesca after mother hail from havana be commanded by father don fernando de mendouca be brought here by when found lying apparently dead upon deck of requin after people have be driven off compelled to beat retreat what exclaimed driven off compelled to retreat certainly senor lad answered proudly surely did not seriously expect to capture four of with paltry schooner of yours so small force a brought against did well admitted must confess that when saw what have to contend with have doubt a to issue then see be not captain captain must have be mad to have attacked in broad daylight a did indeed seemed to be mad by desperation with fought never saw anything like in life exclaimed again do mean to say that took part in fight certainly senor why not demanded pedro haughtily true be very young be strong be bigger than little officer who be fighting near when french sailor struck down with handspike yes be very true agreed knowing from lad description that be referring to freddy pierrepoint so be in fight saw captain eh pedro can tell became of be shot by one of men believe think be killed be not quite sure be carried back into own schooner by two of men after fight have lasted about two minute longer very handsome light haired officer appeared to take command seemed to order retreat for men steadily retired to own vessel fighting to very last cast adrift set sail retired hotly pursued by requin phew exclaimed seem to have made rather mess of time poor ryan be sorry for very sorry indeed be right pedro captain be mad poor fellow be badly wounded in head not long ago have by mean recovered from injury now be wounded again if not killed outright be very sorry for now pedro can tell how father proposes to dispose of senor can not can at present think answered lad be at entreaty that brought on board here otherwise must have be thrown overboard to crocodile swarm in creek just here said that prisoner be only useless encumbrance embarrassment somehow liked look a lay white still upon french schooner deck begged so hard to save that must not deny be sure that will be friend will not there be one on board here that can be intimate with except father of course be so much older than can scarcely look upon a companion besides lad stopped embarrassed besides what demanded well perhaps ought not to say see be stranger yet have often said that be great mistake to be confidential with stranger other day perhaps may feel that can speak more freely that reminds have let talk far too much already need rest perfect quiet at present if be to escape bad attack of fever so will leave for little while to sleep if can first let bathe wound for bandage afresh be very kind pedro remarked a lad with singular deftness proceeded to remove stiff blood stained bandage from head must not allow to leave until have thanked a now do very heartily for having saved life perhaps may have opportunity day to show gratitude in more convincing form than of mere word if so may depend upon to do so meanwhile see reason why must not be friend good friend too if father be willing that must be so at same time there can talk about too when know little more of other understand other better thanks pedro be very soothing comfortable indeed now drink of lemonade if please by way may a well leave jug glass within reach then if insist upon running away why good bye for present lad left fell into rather gloomy reverie upon fate of poor ryan that of gallant fellow who have fallen in ill planned attack upon occupant of unlucky creek a well a upon own future uncertainty of stood out more clearly longer looked at think must have become slightly light headed eventually for twice thrice caught muttering aloud in rather excited fashion now imagining to be in thick of fight once more anon fancying to be one of slave be imprisoned in brigantine noisome hold until finally idea became so hopelessly jumbled together must make nothing of then followed period of oblivion from awoke to find state room faintly illumined by turned down lamp screwed to ship side near head of bunk by more brilliant ray of lamp in main cabin light of streamed through lattice in upper panel of state room door ship be heeling slightly knew by gurgle wash of water along side that be under weigh still in perfectly smooth water for be unable to detect slightest heave rising falling motion in there be intermittent faint murmur of voice overhead occasional footfall on deck now then creak clank of wheel chain following call from forecastle of led to conclusion that brigantine be effecting passage of creek on way seaward state of thing continued for perhaps quarter of hour when felt vessel lift a if to small swell wash splash of water along side became more pronounced then came light plunge with corresponding roar of bow wave heel perceptibly increased pipe of wind took more sonorous sound expression two in tone seemed to indicate feeling of relief satisfaction passed between person overhead then string of order pealed forth from one of followed by clatter of rope thrown down on deck cry of crew a made sail upon vessel movement of craft now rapidly grew more lively heeled still more steeply under pressure of wind splash rush of water alongside grew momentarily more confused bulkhead began to creak cabin door to jar rattle upon hook two people overhead began to pace deck to fro wind whistled blustered with increasing loudness through rigging a craft plunged more sharply caught sound of occasional clatter of spray upon deck forward went on for considerable time then became aware of sound of surf booming distantly rapidly increasing in strength volume until after period of perhaps ten minute thunder seemed to suddenly fill air a brigantine brought square abeam then rapidly died away again until be lost altogether in tumult of wind sea now stormed about vessel knew that have passed close to shark french point be fairly at sea conviction be confirmed few minute later by descent of one presumably captain into cabin where a must tell by clink of bottle glass gurgle of fluid mixed tossed off glass of grog after retired to state room on opposite side of cabin closed door then lulled by motion of ship sound of wind sea gradually sank into feverish sleep from did not fairly awake until sun be streaming strongly in through glazed scuttle of state room next morning shortly afterwards pedro entered bade good morning with cheery smile be looking better senor remarked eye be brighter there be more colour in face hope be not greatly disturbed last night by noise of getting ship under weigh not at answered on contrary did not awake until be clear of mooring passing down creek remained awake until ship seemed to be fairly at sea then went to sleep again suppose be out of sight of land by time yes thanks be to blessed virgin hope will see more until make be reply anegada queried where be that what exclaimed pedro do not know anegada then have never be to west indie be very true admitted have never be to other side of atlantic be certain of must know anegada answered pedro anegada be most easterly of virgin island father always endeavour to pick up on westerly run make good landfall enables to continue rest of run with confidence to dodge pestilent cruiser of yours anegada once sighted father know inch of rest of way must take ship from thence to havana blindfold believe while be talking water be cooling want to bathe wound bind up afresh so be hurting not at answered touch be a light a woman by way where be clothes pedro will turn out a soon a have done with if will kindly send somebody with water ewer seems to be empty can soon be filled however remarked lad a to clothes be forward drying be so stained stiff with blood that must not possibly have put on again so have washed see clothes must not be big enough for while father must be too big so will be obliged to make shift with what have until reach havana be glad that feel well enough to dress for be anxious that must meet father a soon a possible fervently hope that will succeed in impressing favourably why demanded laughingly be so very formidable personage then formidable enough for one in situation if must happen to take dislike to lad answered gravely not that have very much fear of however continued in case father be right except when anything have occurred to vex well suppose that hold good of most people remarked however must hope for best now since have coopered up so nicely if will let have water clothes will make toilet a far a can upon leaving bunk found that be still very shaky with tendency to giddiness added to head be aching most distressingly thought possible that disagreeable symptom must perhaps pas off a soon a found in open air therefore dressed a quickly a possible made way on deck morning be brilliantly fine with slashing breeze from about east trifle northerly brigantine be bowling along before with studding sail set on starboard side in manner fairly made stare with astonishment although have be accustomed to fast vessel francesca be exceedingly fine handsome vessel of enormous beam sitting very low upon water pace at be travelling conclusively demonstrated that beamy a be line must be very perfection of draughting indeed be proved by ease with appeared to glide along surface of rather than through water progress being marked by singularly little disturbance of element considering very high rate of speed sail be magnificently cut setting to nicety drawing to perfection be white enough to have graced spar of yacht noticed too that inside of bulwark deck fitting brass work gun be scrupulously clean bright while rope be carefully coiled upon proper pin principal halliard sheet being flemish coiled on deck in fact whole appearance of vessel be far more suggestive of british man o ' war than of slaver watch on deck consisted of about dozen men one two of whom looked remarkably like englishman did not escape that one have look of resolute reckless fellow who must be quite ready to fight to last gasp if need be be impressed at very first glance with fact that be quietly steadily going about work talking quietly together behaving without single trace of lawlessness have expected to prevail among slaver crew chapter eleven don fernando de mendouca most striking figure in ship however be beyond question tall well built man with firmly knit powerful frame movement of be eloquent of health strength inexhaustible endurance while be characterised by light easy floating grace be only to be acquired by habitual treading of such unstable platform a ship deck be very dark hair moustache beard being coal black wavy while skin at least exposed part that met eye be tanned to so deep bronze a to give quite complexion of mulatto there be not drop of black blood in nose alone thin shapely slightly aquiline be evidence enough of that be clad in inevitable suit of white drill girt about waist with crimson cummerbund head covering be equally inevitable panama broad brimmed hat otherwise naked foot be thrust into pair of turkish slipper of red morocco embroidered with gold thread early a be hour held half smoked cigar between large even white teeth a emerged from companion be standing to windward near helmsman critically eyeing set of brigantine beautifully cut canvas upon seeing without moving from position offering hand bowed with stately grace of spanish hidalgo exclaimed in spanish in firm strong decidedly musical voice good morning senor congratulate upon being sufficiently recovered to leave cabin suppose ought by rule of good manner to bid welcome to ship have discarded conventional form of speech among other thing now make practice of speaking only strict truth a pedro have probably told have little to do with being here beyond mere issue of order for transfer from deck of french schooner if can not at moment truthfully bid welcome can at least say that sincerely hope will be good friend must come about will be welcome not only to ship a spaniard say to house be in thank don fernando answered can easily understand that find exceedingly difficult to regard a welcome guest believe be not going to be so foolish a to feel hurt at frankly telling so heartily unite with in hope that a long a may be compelled into intimate association with other will be able to forget that profession be antagonistic personally may be quite possible for to be good friend now senor permit to seize first opportunity have presented to express to most grateful thanks for having saved life yesterday stop senor if please interrupted holding up hand have already explained to that have absolutely nothing to do with beyond mere issuing of order to be perfectly frank with be in mood to show mercy to one just then for pestilent meddlesome crew fought like fiend cost several good men must ill spare gratitude therefore thought detected echo of something very like scorn in voice be due solely to boy pedro whose whim of saving did not even then care to thwart enough of be guest may if will become friend hope accommodation be to liking excellent indeed answered glad enough to get away from topic seemed to be somewhat distasteful to host excellent indeed far more luxurious than anything to have be accustomed on board own ship yes smiled english be clearly anxious that officer will not become enervated through overmuch luxury have be on board several of ship saw little to admire in accommodation provided for arrangement made for comfort of officer how long have be on west african station senor told conversation gradually took more agreeable turn host proving not only thorough man of world also surprisingly well educated well read for spaniard be well acquainted with several of best english writer professed admiration for literature a great thorough a be evident hatred of ourselves institution a nation have very considerably thawed out of original coldness of manner be discussing with much animation in well chosen language british drama especially shakspeare when be summoned to breakfast found pedro waiting for in cabin lad be very demonstrative in delight at finding so much better must see that be also greatly pleased thought relieved at prospect of amicable if not cordial relation becoming established between father have said that morning be brilliantly fine so be have noticed even when first went on deck that there be certain pallor haziness in blue of sky appearance of did not altogether like when after breakfast went on deck mendouca with sextant in hand for purpose of finding ship longitude first glance aloft showed that large halo have gathered round sun certain cloud have risen above horizon be carrying windgalls in skirt drew mendouca attention to portent agreed with that be probably about to have bad weather sure enough have for afternoon came on to blow heavily from eastward after running before a long a dared indeed good deal longer than in opinion be at prudent be compelled to heave to thus remained for sixty two consecutive hour during mendouca fumed raved like madman for sea be making clean breach over brigantine during whole of time so that considerable portion of bulwark everything be not securely lashed be washed away worst of be imperatively necessary to keep hatch battened down during entire continuance of gale thus depriving unhappy slave pent up below of air save such a must penetrate through small opening in fore bulkhead communicating with forecastle used for purpose of gaining access to hold in bad weather in order to supply slave with food water a however sea be breaking more heavily over fore deck than anywhere else utmost care have to be exercised in opening fore scuttle favourable opportunity having to be watched for hatch whipped off on again in moment very little air therefore be obtainable from source none from elsewhere black therefore be dying below like rotten sheep of suffocation a be reported by who came up from time to time after attending to most pressing want of miserable creature to make what be already bad enough still worse be impossible to remove dead from among living so long a bad weather continued when at gale moderated sea went down sufficiently to permit of sail being once more made hatch be lifted never to dying day will forget awful poisonous stench arose from brigantine hold fume must be actually seen rising through hatchway in form of dense steam continued to pour up for several minute when men be ordered below to pas up dead body even toughest most hardened of recoiled from task staggered away forward literally a sick a dog at length however after lapse of about quarter of hour gang ventured down into now comparatively pure atmosphere work of passing up dead body began stood to windward a near hatchway a must get without being sickened by still pestilential effluvium that even now arose from hold watched operation not from feeling of morbid curiosity in order might become aware by evidence of own eyesight of of blacker horror of most foul accursed trade sight then witnessed literally beggar description unhappy wretch have be packed so tightly together that have be unable to move more than inch so while slave deck be so low that sitting posture with head bowed to knee hand clasped in front of have be absolutely necessary miserable creature have died stiffened in cramped painful posture be gruesome enough therefore to see body passed up thrown overboard in so woeful attitude worst sight of be in case where in dying agony unfortunate wretch have writhed head back until looked a though neck have become dislocated thus revealing distorted feature with eye ball rolled back until only white be visible mouth wide open a though gasping for air brigantine have left congo with four hundred fifty five slave on board about three fifth of whom be men remainder being young woman child of woman child one hundred twenty seven men have succumbed leaving out of grand total miserable moiety of only one hundred forty six survivor be horrible beyond power of word to express to crown a work went on water in ship wake became alive with shark who fought struggled with other for prey literally tearing body limb from limb in frantic struggle to secure morsel be sight one might have thought must have excited pity in breast of arch fiend with mendouca only have effect of goading into state of mad ungovernable fury see exclaimed at last stalking up to grasping savagely by arm see result of thrice accursed meddlesome policy of wretched contemptible little england country who have united with in hopeless task of suppressing slave trade for that negro might have be comfortably stowed in three four ship instead of being packed like herring in barrel in hold of one only then loss of life money might have be avoided by infernal mishap be loser to extent of over thirty thousand dollar for what why simply because british with sickly sentimentality choose to regard black a human being like yourselves be virtuous indignation because forsooth slave trader have bethought ourselves of plan of removing from own country where life must have be passed in condition of lowest most degrading barbarism transporting to where can be rendered useful valuable where in return for labour be fed clothed tended in sickness provided with comfortable home where life may be passed in peace comfort perfect freedom from care where if indeed be human like very much doubt may be converted to christianity violently object to amelioration of lot of negro savage shut eye to fact that thousand of own countryman woman be actually slave of most abject type made so by own insatiable contemptible craving for cheap clothing cheap food cheap thing to satisfy to at same time gratify own perfectly legitimate desire to make living employer of labour have to grind employes down in matter of wage until life be living lingering death to in comparison with future of black down below will be paradise bah such hypocrisy sickens yet in support of disgusting pharisaism hundred more like claiming to be intelligent being willingly endure hardship face peril of sickness shipwreck shot steel with persistent heroism that almost compels one admiration despite mistaken enthusiasm be animating cause nay speak senor know exactly what must say have heard until have become sick of canting jargon of meddlesome busy body who knowing nothing of actual fact of slavery for own purpose hunt out exceptional case of tyranny hold up to public execration a typical of system have heard so often have long passed point where be possible to listen to with even faintest semblance of patience so attempt utterly useless impossible task of trying to convert pray lest in anger must say word must offend good heaven did man suppose that have not offended already saw however that might a well attempt to quell hurricane a argue with in present mood moreover be poor hand at argument therefore bowed in silence turned away went below fully determined to have matter out with fiery spaniard first time caught in more amenable temper pedro must have followed indeed attempted to do so a entered companion heard father call back bid remain on deck with moderating of gale wind have come out dead ahead brigantine be consequently on taut bowline on starboard tack when hatch be opened body of suffocated negro be passed up on deck thrown overboard remained so for rest of day when awoke next morning at once became aware from steady long pendulum like roll of ship that be once more before wind naturally concluded that wind have again become fair to great surprise however when emerged from state room caught glimpse of tell tale compass hanging in gimbal in skylight opening of main cabin saw that ship be heading to eastward wondering what might be meaning of went on deck mendouca pedro be visible did not choose to question mate surly hang dog cut throat looking scoundrel who have chosen to manifest implacable hostility to from moment that eye have first met however have not be on deck long when mendouca made appearance in response to salutation said good morning captain see have shifted helm during night saw when be too late that remark be unfortunate one for mendouca scowled a replied yes be not worth while to make trip across atlantic back for mere purpose of landing one hundred forty odd negro even must have got over without further loss greatly doubt so be going back to coast for more unless can pick up without going so far added after momentary pause with peculiar look must not at moment fathom loss of life money time extra risk be forced upon by meddlesome policy of great britain great faugh must see a others see must for very shame strike out that vaunting prefix take obscure place among nation properly befits senor dugdale do value life well yes to certain extent do replied be only one have see be to lose loss must occasion considerable amount of distress to friend for reason therefore if for other attach certain amount of value to feel bound to take care of so far a may with honour very well then remarked mendouca with sneer so far a can with honour refrain pray from thrusting nationality into face for may a well tell have utmost hatred contempt for english must sweep one of off face of earth if must day when feeling be particularly strong upon may blow brain out if happen to remember that be englishman hope will not come to don fernando for many reason remarked with rather forced laugh among may just mention base cowardice of murdering unarmed man rather regret that must be so completely a appear to be under dominion of feeling of hatred for nation must be a unpleasant for a be for that be thus forcibly thrown together need not last long can put out of ship at first land that touch must take chance of making way to place of safety will be unpleasant for of course will remove from constant source of temptation to commit murder mendouca laughed be rather harsh jarring laugh certainly said upon honour a spanish gentleman appear to be mightily concerned to preserve from crime of bloodshed young gentleman do suppose must not be murder to put ashore a suggest at first land that reach why boy be to do so within six hour must be in hand of native lashed to torture stake must not death then be just a much act a though be to shoot through head moment to astonishment somewhat to consternation must admit whipped pistol out of belt levelled full at head cocking with thumb a did so presume must answered steadily on whole believe that to shoot must be more merciful act of two so fire by mean senor if must take life by living god carry thing off bravely young cockerel exclaimed do dare to fire yes exclaimed stoutly dare to fire if can bring to perpetrate so rank act of cowardice well returned laughing a lowered pistol uncocked replaced in belt be right can not at least not in cold blood dare say be pretty bad according to opinion worst enemy can not accuse of cowardice a to putting ashore will hing of kind on contrary widely a opinion at present diverge upon subject of calling hope yet to induce to join can be useful to added in pure english to intense astonishment want just cool daring young fellow a yourself for right hand to be pair of extra eye ear hand to to take command in absence can make well worth while so think over want answer now must answer now returned also in english can not allow single minute to elapse without assuring don fernando that altogether mistake character if suppose capable of participation whatever in traffic abhor detest beyond power of expression traffic inflicts untold anguish upon thousand not infrequently must imagine entail such fearful waste of human life a witnessed yesterday moreover have just occurred to that when attacked friend in creek brigantine be flying black flag if mean anything mean presume that be pirate a well a slaver precisely assented be day when know other better will tell story unlikely a may now think undertake to say that when have heard will acknowledge have ample justification for being believe don fernando answered story be doubtless that of real fancied wrong that have suffered at hand of society wrong can justify man to become enemy to race will hear story of course if will afford satisfaction to tell warn that anything that can possibly say will have effect of converting to view think so now of course answered with laugh will see will see meanwhile there be steward poking ugly visage up through companion to tell that breakfast be ready so come below friend take keen edge off appetite be on day one after about four bell in forenoon watch one of hand having occasion to go aloft to perform small job of work on rigging reported strange sail ahead brigantine be still running before fair wind breeze have fallen light looked rather a though be in for calm spell with thunder perhaps later on be going about four maybe four half knot at time report of strange sail created a much excitement on board a though have be man o war for time there seemed to be considerable amount of doubt a to course that stranger be steering for a seen from aloft appeared to be heading round compass be eventually concluded that in general direction course be same a own a morning wore on wind continued to drop while heavy bank of thunder cloud gathered about horizon ahead piling steadily imperceptibly higher until by noon be a much a mendouca must do to get sun for latitude by time have risen stranger until have brought hull up on extreme verge of horizon nearer that drew to more eccentric did manoeuvre appear to be be heading round compass for fact that must see from time to time that yard be being swung of canvas hauled down hoisted again in most extraordinary manner must have set down a derelict ought by way to have said that be small brig of apparently about one hundred forty ton mendouca be thoroughly perplexed at extraordinary antic glass be scarcely ever off when removed from eye be only to hand to impatiently demand whether must not make out something to elucidate mystery at length after witnessing through telescope more than usually extraordinary performance with canvas remarked think there be one thing pretty clear about brig be that be in possession of people who have not remotest notion how to handle eh what be that say demanded mendouca know how to handle well certainly appears that a fore topsail halliard be started yard slid slowly down mast leaving topgallant sail royal fully set above by jove have suddenly continued slapping thigh energetically yonder brig be in possession of cargo of slave who have somehow be allowed to rise overpower crew yes by heaven must be explanation of at event will run down see blow good breeze blow whistled energetically after manner of seaman in want of wind breeze however utterly refused to blow on contrary be growing more languid minute while speed have dwindled down to bare two knot thunder cloud be piling up overhead blacker more menacing minute at length when be bare three mile from brig helmsman reported that no longer have steerage way a francesca slowly swung round upon heel bringing brig broad on starboard quarter mendouca stamped irritably on deck cursed weather brig brigantine in fact cursed everything above inch high a say in navy when wish to describe thorough comprehensive outburst of profanity at length having given free vent to impatience stood for moment intently studying lowering heaven strode across deck glanced through open skylight at barometer then turned to said in english what think dugdale must be safe in opinion to send away couple of boat to take possession of brig glass have dropped nothing to speak of since be set morning that stuff up there promise nothing worse than sharp thunderstorm pelting downpour of rain boat must reach in forty minute when crew must take possession shorten sail wait for to join will be bound there be sufficient black ivory aboard there to spare necessity to return to coast to make good loss in turn too looked at sky intently hardly know what to make of answered at length may be a say that there be nothing worse than thunder brewing up there yet there be something in look of cloud altogether like colour for instance be too livid purple for thunder alone according to idea like way in be working why be a busy a barrel of yeast depend on senor there be wind plenty of up there a to how long may be before outburst come have have more experience than of part of world ought to know weather better than do well dare say do assented with apparent relief again raised eye anxiously scrutinised cloud will risk at length exclaimed decisively forthwith turned issued necessary order to chief mate who trundled away forward bawling to men a went in few minute be bustle activity about deck arm chest being brought on deck selected boat crew coming aft receiving weapon from mendouca while gunner served out ammunition rascal be smart active lot will give credit for so much in le than ten minute from announcement of mendouca decision boat two of with ten men in be in glassy water crew stretching out lustily for brig be perfectly evident to that mendouca be possessed by feeling that eagerness to acquire brig cargo of negro have warped judgment egged on to unduly risky course of action in sending boat so many of people away in face of threatening sky boat have sooner shoved off than became consumed by anxiety oblivious of suffocating heat closeness of atmosphere proceeded to pace deck to fro with hasty impatient stride halting abruptly at frequent interval to scrutinise aspect of sky anon to watch progress of boat crew of latter be evidently quite aware that expedition upon be engaged be by mean free from peril for until have reached distance too great to enable to distinguish action must see first one then glancing aloft over shoulder at sky action being invariably followed by exhibition of increased energy at oar be clearly doing utmost one in fact boat be making downright race of for brig men bending back throwing whole strength into stroke churning oily looking surface of water into foam with oar blade leaving long wedge like wake behind while two mate in charge who have hold of yoke line be bowing forward at stroke in true racing style yet rapid a progress be did not satisfy mendouca who time that paused to watch progress stamped upon deck with impatience cursed oarsman for set of lazy good for nothing lubber there be ample justification for anxiety for scarcely have boat reached quarter of mile from francesca than there be sudden very perceptible darkening of heaven followed by vivid flash of lightning low down toward eastern horizon low muffled boom of thunder coming reverberating across glassy water with sound of cannon shot rolled slowly along timber floor chapter twelve awful catastrophe presently after one of frequent halt mendouca turned gave order to shorten sail clew up haul down fore aft stow everything except main staysail see that make snug furl of men cried adding a turned to might a well be snugging down a doing nothing perhaps sight will put life into movement of lazy rascal yonder pointing with cigar a spoke towards boat possibly agreed in case appears to that time have fully arrived for commencement of such preparation a may think fit to make for coming blow in humble opinion be going to be rather sharp while last yes doubt mendouca assented curse lazy hound have eye in head to see what be brewing if wake up will have squall upon before reach brig in case said may say good bye to brig to slave in may think lucky if be able to recover boat know whether heard not think probable that did made reply turning back upon keeping glance alternately roving between boat sky latter have by time assumed most sinister threatening aspect so much so indeed have be in mendouca place must have recalled boat without moment delay must see that have set heart upon securing possession of brig be willing to run considerable amount of risk in effort to do so at length when boat be according to estimation little better than half way to brig flash of lightning vivid blinding blazed forth time from almost overhead only very smallest perceptible interval of time elapsing between accompanying thunder crash be so appallingly loud startling that for moment felt fairly deaf stunned with before have fairly recovered dazed sens rain came pelting down in drop a large a crown piece rain lasted for only three four second however then ceased again abruptly while almost at same instant brief scurry of wind swept past just lifting staysail be by time only sail remaining set on board causing to flap feebly for moment when be once more calm again must trace puff long distance to westward by track along oily surface of water mendouca turned to with oath when come will come to dead on end from brig exclaimed be just like cursed luck do think be too late to recall boat yes answered decidedly be now nearer brig than be to best chance certainly be to keep on a be going mendouca turned bestowed upon boat yet long scrutinising glance then said with eye still fixed upon agree with think be quite a near to a be to brig if keep on squall burst before reach brig will have to pull against may perhaps not fetch after whereas if recall be overtaken before reach will have wind in favour instead of dead against be very true assented appears to however that whole question hinge upon point whether be nearer to to brig in opinion be much nearer to latter for fully minute mendouca continued to watch boat then suddenly exclaimed will recall clear away bow gun there fire with blank cartridge pedro get out recall signal stand by to run up to main truck at flash of gun signal be made boom of gun seeming to echo with hollow long drawn out reverberation between sea sky within minute boat with seeming reluctance have turned be pulling back to brigantine meanwhile heaven have continued to darken until by time that boat have turned whole scene have become involved in murky twilight through gloom of brig still with stitch of canvas set must with difficulty be made out still although seemed to that brooding squall might burst upon at moment atmosphere maintained ominous condition of stagnation until boat have reached within four cable length somewhat le than mile of when a be intently watching progress saw sky suddenly break along horizon just above cloud appearing a though rent violently apart for length of ten twelve degree of arc while rent be filled with strong yet misty glare of coppery yellow light in very centre of brig stood out sharply defined a black a shape cut out of silhouette paper here come at last exclaimed a word passed lip felt spot of rain upon face in instant down came regular deluge only for about minute when ceased abruptly looking toward brig saw long line of white foam sweeping down towards god help poor unhappy black cried if craft spar rigging happen to be good will turn turtle with probably not one of will escape be just punishment upon for rising against crew exclaimed mendouca savagely if have only succeeded in laying hand upon must have inflicted worse punishment upon than drowning must have ah look at now squall strike over go taken flat aback by heaven be a mendouca have said brig when struck by squall happened to be lying head on to topmast bent like reed ere yielded to pressure snapped short off by cap then gathering stern way paid off until be nearly broadside on to must see that stern be becoming more more depressed a be forced against comparatively stubborn unyielding water while bow be raised proportionally high in air foot by foot second by second stern sank deeper deeper into water until latter be flush with taffrail then with aid of telescope saw go foaming boiling in upon deck driving dense crowd of negro forward foot by foot by time forefoot be raised clear out of water enveloped in mist spray though be must see bright glassy glare of sky beyond below for second remained thus then bow rose still higher in air with long sliding plunge disappeared stern foremost gone to bottom mother son of a richly deserved exclaimed mendouca with savage curse if loafing vagabond of mine bestir will follow in double quick time what do think dugdale will be able to save shook head must not give very much for chance replied be pity that recalled think must have have time to reach brig must at least have got before wind even have time to do more yes assented a happened must how be man to know that squall be going to hold off so long then burst at most unfortunate moment possible must be understood have happened in very much shorter time than have taken to tell of squall have not reached a far a boat when brig disappeared while a for be lying motionless in still stagnant atmosphere with starboard broadside presented fair to approaching squall a last word left mendouca lip squall swooped down upon boat in instant be lost sight of in smother of mist spray while roar of approaching squall have come to at first a faint low murmur grew deeper hoarser more deadly menacing in overpowering volume of tone then air suddenly grew damp with distinct taste of salt in roar increased to deafening bellow with fierce yelling shriek squall burst upon brigantine bowed beneath stroke until lee rail be buried water foamed in on deck from cat head to main rigging thought for moment that too be going to turn turtle with believe must have staysail stood luckily at very moment when seemed up with sheet parted with report sounded even above yell of gale there be concussion a though ship have struck something solid with single flap sail split in ribbon blew clean out of bolt rope meanwhile mendouca have sprung to wheel lent strength to effort of helmsman to put hard up after hanging irresolute for moment a though undecided whether to capsize not francesca gathered way in obedience to helm gradually paid off until be dead before when suddenly righted began to scud like terrified thing boat be of course left far behind made up mind that must never see again squall be a sharp thing of kind a have ever beheld be fully three quarter of hour before became possible to bring ship to wind again mendouca did moment that must with safety wind continued quite fresh for half hour after squall have blown out then dwindled away to very paltry breeze again cloud cleared away sun re appeared shone with heat be almost overpowering weather became brilliantly fine again much too fine indeed for mendouca purpose being anxious to get back again a quickly a possible to spot where have be obliged to abandon boat lingering hope possessing perchance might have outlived squall that might recover men may perhaps be doing man injustice in saying so much firmly believe that desire on part be prompted not by feeling of humanity regard for men simply because loss of so many out of ship company must leave very short handed seriously embarrass until must obtain others to fill place formed opinion from fact that many expression of regret at being blown away from boat be one of coupled with petulant repetition of remark that hand must be completely tied must fail to recover crew so persistently did hang upon phase of mishap at length ventured to ask whether there be none of that must be sorry to lose for own sake apart from question of inconvenience in reply to stated with brutal laugh that be one lazy set of worthless rascal of whom must have rid in case on arrival in havana however be motive what might cracked on stitch of canvas that brigantine must bear a soon a strength of squall have sufficiently abated to permit of bringing to wind making sail from time to time a wind further dwindled until have under everything must draw from truck down to add to anxiety be about two bell in first dog watch before must bring ship to wind feared not without reason that must be dark before must work back near enough to spot at have left boat to see again always supposing of course that still floated however did everything that seaman must do sending hand aloft to royal yard to keep look out a soon a ship have be got upon wind making short board to windward first one of quarter of hour duration others of hour so a to thoroughly cover ground previously passed over a long a daylight lasted when too soon sun went down in blaze of golden crimson purple splendour sign of boat have be seen mendouca therefore worked out calculation of distance run by brigantine from spot where squall first struck subtracted from distance that boat must probably traverse in same time having worked up to spot a nearly a must calculate hove to for night with bright lantern at main truck firing signal rocket at interval of quarter of hour wearing ship round on other tack two hour night be brilliantly star lit without moon still there be light enough upon water to have revealed boat at distance of mile while weather be so fine that shout raised at twice distance to windward of ship might have be heard on board above soft sigh of night wind gentle lap of water along bend moreover apart from rocket fired might have be plainly seen against sky at distance of fully three mile from boat while progress through water be so slow that must have pulled alongside without difficulty when therefore midnight arrived without news of gave up for lost turned in not so mendouca must not give up moreover refused to leave deck declaring now have lost two mate have nobody on board that must trust in charge preferring to have mattress laid for upon skylight bench where snatched catnap between interval of wearing ship round however matter be cleared up shortly after sunrise next morning when mendouca again sent hand aloft to look round for fellow have only got a far a foretop when reported two object that looked like boat about five mile to leeward adding that if be boat be capsized topsail be accordingly filled ship kept away when after about hour run first one boat then other be found first being capsized while second be full of water floating with gunwale awash one drowned seaman be found under capsized boat rest be nowhere to be seen boat be easily secured found to be undamaged several of oar loose bottom board be also recovered being found floating at great distance from boat drowned seaman may a well mention be not brought on board instead of boat be sent away with canvas bag containing three nine pound shot secured to poor wretch ankle so sunk mendouca now in very amiable mood resumed course toward coast same afternoon having meanwhile be engaged apparently in tolerably successful effort to recover temper approached with proposal that must tell story of life to of course cheerfully assented will not inflict upon reader tale that told because have direct bearing upon present history suffice to say that now learned with astonishment that be born englishman moreover have begun career in british navy from if story be strictly true a afterwards have opportunity of learning be case have be ousted by quite unusual piece of tyranny most singular deplorable miscarriage of justice be latter gathered even more than former have soured warped everything that be good out of character for appeared that have keen sense of justice very exalted idea of have undoubtedly be most cruelly ill used have in fact be adjudged guilty of crime that have never committed appeared to have utterly ruined character of man who might otherwise have be ornament to service distorted view of right wrong filled to brim with wild unreasoning insatiable desire for vengeance much for man story however soon found have be told with purpose purpose being nothing le than inducing of to join take place of lost chief mate whereby according to showing might speedily become rich man have proposal come before have heard story must have resented a insult recital to have treated sentiment expressed during narration convinced that sense of honour have be so completely warped that must see disgrace in abandonment of service country capable of treating other man for instance a carefully pointed out a have be treated therefore contented with simple refusal coupled with assurance that step must be wholly discordant with sense of right wrong utterly irreconcilable to conscience not at in accord with view have expected to be furiously angry at refusal to great surprise be not on contrary frankly admitted that have be fully prepared for refusal at first that still believed view might alter upon more mature reflection meanwhile said see how be situated have lost officer have one on board in least capable of taking place saved life spared come to same thing now ask to make only return in power by assisting in difficulty before give answer to said must ask to explicitly define accurately set forth nature of assistance that desire to render certainly said mendouca ask of at present be to relieve by taking charge of watch assisting to navigate ship with regard to latter consider capable of taking ship anywhere have a much confidence in a man ought to have to err be human ' increase one confidence confers feeling of security to have one to check one calculation a to watch unless will consent to keep one for will be compelled to keep deck night day now be great thing be asking of in return for life will do give hour to consider matter will then have reply said so be answered then matter ended for moment be question found by mean easy to decide here be officer in service of country pledged to do utmost to suppress abominable slave traffic actually invited to assist in navigation of ship avowedly engaged not only in traffic according to acknowledgment of captain also in at least occasional act of piracy what be to do on one hand be fully determined to hing must be construed into even semblance of tacit acquiescence in mendouca lawless vocation while on other undoubtedly owed life to man therefore shrank from idea of behaving in manner might appear churlish moreover appeared to that by rendering trifling service demanded of must find in position to very greatly ameliorate in many way condition of unhappy black down in dark noisome hold end of be therefore that at expiration of half hour have determined perhaps weakly foolishly to accede to mendouca request accordingly went to said senor mendouca have considered request have decided to accede to upon certain condition name answered mendouca be said first that service will be strictly confined to keeping of watch checking of astronomical observation secondly that undertake to perpetrate act of piracy while be on board thirdly that will allow to leave ship upon first occasion that happen to encounter sail of nationality friendly to great britain be that demanded mendouca by faith appear to attach somewhat high value to service senor midshipman spared life yet doe not appear to be sufficient reason why must afford small amount of help require without hedging consent about with ridiculous impossible restriction be surprised that while be about did not also stipulate must abandon slave trade while ship be honoured by presence be obliged to senor dugdale for condescension in giving distinguished consideration at to request term be too high can do better without help than with if be to be bought at price of such restraint a demand turned back upon walked over to other side of deck presently turned re crossed deck to side remarked in english look here dugdale be fool in coupling consent to help with restriction doubtless suspected of intention to involve in of act deem unlawful then to renew proposal that must join well if did be not so very far from truth confess do wish to join have somehow taken fancy to despite old fashioned absurd notion of yours about conscience duty like why if must only put away from must be making of must be just sort of fellow want be pluck through once free from trammel of thing that call conscience must stick at nothing with a right hand must feel free to undertake deed have only dared to dream of thus far while with view brought into accord must be a brother to other be ambitious dugdale tell that if will join can will revive glory of old buccaneering day make ourselves feared reverenced over globe will be sea king what need be there for hesitation in matter nay held up hand a saw that be about to speak inflict upon musty platitude about conscience duty have heard so often in old day have be made excuse for so many act of gross tyranny injustice that gorge rise in loathing whenever hear mentioned what be conscience inward monitor point out duty to god restrains try to restrain from doing wrong will perhaps say well let accept that a answer will then ask question do really believe in existence of being call god be sure can not dear fellow remain consistent for what be conception of god rather what be picture of that ghostly adviser teacher have drawn of be not assured that be personification quintessence of justice love mercy very well then if being really exists must tyranny injustice cruelty suffering have afflicted poor humanity from adam down to ourselves have be permitted certainly not therefore unhesitatingly say that can not exist that belief in be mere idle foolish superstition unworthy of entertainment by intelligent reasonable reasoning being if there be god whence do derive conception of duty tell dugdale there be such thing a duty save to one duty of protecting providing for avenging one self a be doing a may do if choose to join have finished asked a paused looked eagerly into face very well then will answer in few word if fact be a so confidently state to be might possibly be induced to cast in lot with yours fortunately for humanity be not so must therefore most emphatically decline then presume said with sneer still believe in existence of god power to work will here on earth certainly answered without hesitation do believe that be more potent than be really must decline to answer so absurd question said turned away to leave stop thundered eye suddenly blazing with demoniac fury answer yes if be not afraid if faith in be a perfect a must have believe answer hesitated for moment confess with shame for felt convinced that in man present mood reply in affirmative must assuredly provoke to dreadful act in proof of contrary hesitation be momentary however that moment past replied yes believe to be omnipotent on earth in heaven be a have expected reply have provoked to murder for a word left lip for second time drew pistol from belt cocked deliberately pressed muzzle of barrel to temple exclaiming a did so very well then let see whether have power to save from bullet glaring like madman straight into eye held there while one might perhaps have slowly counted ten then pulled trigger there be sharp click little shower of spark a flint lock fell be missed fire by fury exclaimed dashing weapon violently to deck where instantly exploded well have proved faith at event have escaped with life by mere accident of pistol having missed fire there be end of for present here take hand be plucky young dog mistake did wrong to provoke take advice do again lest worse befall said will not take hand saved rather spared life once be true have threatened twice be thanks to that be alive at moment be now quits for last act of yours have wiped out whatever obligation may have owed for former clemency will not take hand warn will leave ship on first opportunity present turned away left shortly afterwards mendouca went below few minute after disappearance steward came up to informed supper a evening meal be called at sea be ready will not go below steward said if captain mendouca will allow to do so must like to bring cup of coffee biscuit up here very well senor man answered will bring disappeared returned after interval of minute two handed note scrawled on small slip of paper be written in english read a follows be last fellow must ever have suspected of so contemptible weakness a sulking come below like sensible lad have to say to choose to say on deck in presence of men mendouca oh thought so have returned to right mind have very well will go below hear what have to say for must certainly be unpleasant to be in ship for length of time with captain of one be not on speaking term accordingly descended companion a entered cabin mendouca rose from sofa locker upon have flung again stretched forth hand want to forgive dugdale said with great earnestness nay must will take denial be not prone to feel ashamed of anything do frankly confess that be ashamed of behaviour to afternoon ask pardon for to tell whole truth believe that there be taint of madness in blood for there have be occasion when have felt irresistibly impelled to action for have afterwards be sorry of afternoon be one of believed really believed that a have said there be touch of madness in composition that be not always fully accountable for action therefore somewhat reluctantly accepted proffered hand reconciliation went with with suggestion that perhaps must be a well henceforth to avoid theological argument took accustomed seat at cabin table later in evening while mendouca be reading in cabin friend pedro joined on deck with many expression of poignant distress at father behaviour to endeavoured to excuse upon plea of irresponsibility already urged by mendouca poor lad assuring that even be not always safe from consequence of father violence during half hour chat that ensued learnt enough to convince that mendouca be in very truth afflicted with paroxysmal attack of genuine undoubted madness that in future dealing with must have to bear that exceedingly alarming disconcerting fact in mind chapter thirteen how mendouca replenished cargo must see that mendouca be pretty thoroughly ashamed of for despite utmost effort there be perceptible shrinking embarrassment of manner apparent in during progress of meal nevertheless exerted manfully to obliterate exceedingly disagreeable impression that knew have be made upon by late conduct be evident that be sincerely desirous of re establishing friendly relation between whether from selfish motive not can not of course say think not believe pride be hurt at late lamentable exhibition of weakness be chiefly anxious to recover own self respect whatever motive may have be demeanour be perfect blending of politeness cordiality won upon in spite of before meal be over have determined to render small amount of assistance that have asked of reserving to myself right to withdraw at moment might deem fit seemed sincerely grateful for offer accepted frankly cordially with reservation have attached to having accompanied on deck turned hand up informed have offered to temporarily perform duty of chief mate that be to obey order a implicitly a must from own lip after a have offered to take charge until midnight said that be tired must try to get little sleep so retired below to own cabin breeze continued easterly very moderate frequently dropping almost calm on occasion be almost invariably treated to deluge of rain with occasional thunder lightning progress to eastward be therefore slow for three whole day night nothing occurred to break monotony of voyage on morning of fourth day however when went on deck just before eight bell having be eight hour in night found brigantine once more before wind with slashing breeze blowing after with rag of canvas packed upon must be induced to draw to exceeding surprise be heading to westward hull down about ten mile distant be craft dead ahead of also carrying press of canvas turned to mendouca for explanation in answer to look of inquiry said yes want to overtake brig if can be ashamed to say that among let slip past in darkness of early part of last watch so missed opportunity of speaking believe know if surmise a to identity prof correct think will have difficulty in persuading skipper to transfer cargo to so save trouble risk of returning to coast for one risk be day growing greater a drew nearer to ground haunted by lynx eyed cruiser to fall in with one of just now with nigger down in hold must mean inevitable condemnation a need scarcely tell quite so assented must fail to overtake yonder craft will lose good deal of ground will not oh will overhaul if be brig believe to be have very little doubt upon point answered mendouca be smart craft admit francesca can beat upon point of sailing in breeze blow that being case distance that may have to run to leeward before getting alongside be matter of indifference to since will be so much of voyage accomplished have gained anything on since bore up in chase asked about couple of mile must think then wind have be light with until within last hour if breeze hold expect to be alongside about four bell in afternoon watch by time will have run close upon seventy mile to leeward remarked nearer eighty observed mendouca be going close upon thirteen now a said before doe not trouble in least since will be that much nearer cuba be serious news to for cuba be about last place desired to visit at least on board francesca for foresaw that if once got over there difficulty of effecting escape from accursed craft must be very greatly increased indeed have quite reckoned upon being fallen in with captured by one of cruiser while standing in for fresh cargo of slave when coming out again with on board to chance alone must look with reason for prospect of deliverance from present embarrassing disagreeable situation true there be just possibility of being picked up by one of west indian squadron have not much hope of vessel on station being mostly slow deep draught craft altogether unsuited for pursuit capture of swift light draught slaver who unless caught at advantage in open water must laugh to scorn by simple expedient of taking short cut across shoal seeking refuge among willow lagoon abound among island be especially plentiful spacious along northern coast of cuba however there be use in worrying over state of thing have power to mend therefore assumed charge of deck allowed matter to take course since need must breeze continued to freshen a sun increased distance above horizon went bowling along at most exhilarating pace overhauling brig ahead slowly surely when at one o'clock steward summoned to cabin to dinner space of barely two mile separated two craft have just hoisted portuguese colour of however mendouca took notice somewhat to surprise since reiterated statement that be craft have believed to be that captain of be old friend be afternoon watch below so when rose from dinner table said captain mendouca have wish to identify in way with transaction be about to negotiate must excuse therefore if being watch below retire to cabin very well dugdale answered quite good humouredly can manage business perfectly well without if therefore conscience with just faintest suggestion of sneer will not permit to take active part in be quite welcome to stay below until affair be at end when will call even thought that spoke with air of relief a though withdrawal have smoothed away difficulty about hour later be awakened from nap by sound of hailing in language did not understand from decided resemblance to spanish concluded to be portuguese must not hear what passed did attempt to do so being of opinion that le prominently be mixed up with affair le knew about better hailing soon ceased then brigantine be hove to a must tell by difference in movement have curiosity to rise from bunk take peep through scuttle at sea be bare a far a eye must reach so a state room be to windward a francesca then lay came to conclusion that brig be hove to to leeward of moment that topsail be backed heard creaking of davit block other sound of boat being lowered few minute later heard roll of oar in rowlock a be pulled away from ship then hatch be taken off fore aft in about hour from time of having hove to became aware that first boat load of slave have arrived alongside be being driven down into hold boat now began to arrive in rapid succession there be good deal of bustle confusion on deck lasted until close upon sunset in midst of laid down went to sleep again for want of something better to do when awoke dusk be thick upon glass of scuttle steward be lighting lamp in main cabin must feel that be once more under way again concluding therefore that exchange have be completed rolled out of bunk slipping foot into shoe left state room went on deck where found mendouca in jubilant spirit rather disconcerted thought at appearance hillo exclaimed in english where deuce did come from how long have be on deck came from state room have moment emerged from companion why do ask said because answered to tell truth startled making appearance in quiet manner thought be going to stay below until called be who said that not answered to tell truth felt tired of being below so finding that be under way again came on deck brig be about five mile astern a far a must see in fast gathering darkness still hove to struck a being so peculiar that made remark to effect oh nothing strange about at answered mendouca carelessly people be getting supper probably be too lazy to start tack sheet until have finished meal bless have idea what lazy rascal portuguese be laziness be absolutely phenomenal be positively too lazy to live long so most of die early more over expect skipper be still below poring over chart trying to make up what be pleased to call mind what spot to steer for in order to get cargo very possibly assented with laugh by way be curious must almost fancy deeper in water than be doe not strike so deeper in water exclaimed sharply can not say that doe even be such thing possible must need uncommonly sharp eye to discern in such light a may be however for rascal jose wrung enough good spanish dollar out of for rubbish to sink to waterway come here be steward so suppose supper be ready if so may a well go below get for must plead guilty to being most ravenously hungry notwithstanding statement must not avoid noticing that toyed great deal with food ate very little be not to be wondered at under circumstance for afterwards learned that while be below in berth suspecting nothing worse than purchase transfer of cargo of slave from one ship to most atrocious cold blooded act of piracy have be committed that too under shadow disguise of british flag mendouca having coolly hoisted british colour moment left deck in guise of british cruiser compelled portuguese brig to heave to disgorge cargo after have confined crew below bound hand foot have scuttled ship leaving to perish in when went down of have not faintest suspicion until tale be told time afterwards by one of francesca own crew with setting of sun wind evinced very decided tendency to drop growing steadily lighter through first watch until when mendouca relieved at midnight ship be moving at rate of barely five knot although be carrying studding sail on side when went on deck again at four o'clock next morning be flat calm ship be lying motionless upon water with head swung round to south east swell too have gone down there be appearance of calm lasting for several hour at least appearance of sun a rose also confirmed impression sky being for wonder in latitude perfectly cloudless of clear pure soft crystalline blue into great luminary leapt in dazzling splendour palpitating with breathless heat promised to soon become almost unendurable be custom to indulge in saltwater bath morning in ship head one of men playing hose upon for quarter of hour so never did that bath seem greater luxury to than on particular morning for heat came with sun envied fish ability to escape by sinking deep into cool blue crystalline depth indeed must most probably have be tempted to imitate a far a possible by plunging overboard swimming twice thrice round ship have not happened to have noticed large shark under counter when to test clearness of water happened to lean over taffrail to look at rudder stern post even men dawdled over job of washing deck that morning using much greater quantity of water than usual placing where there be chance to get hose played upon bare foot leg if be hot on deck what must have be down in crowded hold be be habit to have grating put on hatchway secured night when weather must permit of use of instead of solid hatch in order to prevent anything in shape of rising on part of negro night long thin pungent vapour have be rising through telling eloquent tale of frightful closeness heat of atmosphere down there while at frequent interval must be heard sound of restless stirring on part of living cargo accompanied by long drawn gasping sigh a if for breath there be usually good deal of carelessness remissness manifested by men in removal of grating in morning have frequently gone on deck at seven bell when be eight hour in found still on although be well understood that be to be taken off at four bell be always very particular when be morning watch on deck to have grating removed prompt to time on particular morning however did not wait until four bell took upon to have hatch thrown open a soon a there be daylight enough to enable to see clearly be sure that poor wretch below be grateful for even so small measure of relief a day advanced heat grew intolerable consequent suffering of black more intense be custom on board slaver believe at least be so on board francesca to feed slave twice day food consisting of fairly liberal quantity of boiled rice farina calavance bean latter being used on account of great fattening power whereby slave be maintained in tolerably good condition of body with pint of water at meal mendouca made rule to vary diet of slave a much a possible on three article one other of be given third day having found that poor wretch thus thrived better took food with more enjoyment than when fed during entire voyage upon one kind of food only whenever weather be sufficiently moderate to permit of always have one half of slave on deck for airing during time that other half be being fed below thus allowing room for men who dispensed food water to move about also for slave to use hand in process of feeding on particular morning of be now writing be unspeakably moving pathetic to note a did feverish eagerness longing with unhappy creature waited watched for arrival of moment when might come on deck breathe for few brief minute pure to cool refreshing outer atmosphere heart ached with pity for determined must utilise presence on board accursed ship by doing everything in power to ameliorate a far a possible condition of unfortunate be imprisoned within made up mind to begin on very morning if when mendouca made appearance seemed to be in temper amenable to persuasion when came on deck however condition appeared anything promising for be in frightfully bad humour at calm cursing weather own ill luck everything else that must think of to execrate allowed to give unrestrained vent to ill humour for minute when at length have calmed down somewhat said yet appears to that calm about be complaining so bitterly may be made excellent use of if will to benefit increase value of property indeed in what way pray demanded well said there be sail trimming to be done in weather must be downright cruelty to send men aloft to work about rigging in blazing heat why not therefore spread awning aft here set entire watch to work beneath shade to patch up such of canvas a need repairing while be engaged upon job will see if approve of plan whether can not get negro to take bath in batch in studding sail rigged on fore deck thus rid of of filth be fast accumulating on body will do more good tend more to keep in health than double allowance of food for remainder of voyage when have done that can be divided into two gang one on deck to draw pas water other below with scrubbing brush swab can be mustered to give slave deck thorough cleansing be what must do be property well said musingly dare say must do rascal lot of good must certainly make ship sweeter will be bound that must be scented mile away in present condition who be to undertake supervision of such work not tell frankly believe hand must refuse to man be to attempt to set to such work if will rig studding sail old fore course for'ard will do rest try to do said will exclaimed mendouca in surprise then be sure may heartily wish joy of job very well then will set about first thing after breakfast said did got poor wretch forward in batch of thirty induced to stand in basin like hollow of sail then set dozen of number pumping drawing water playing upon fellow with hose sluicing bucket of water over exquisite enjoyment unspeakable luxury of bath a cool sparkling liquid dashed upon filth sweat begrimed body be sight to see enjoyed why revelled in so that be with difficulty must get out stony look of hopeless utter despair faded temporarily out of eye of actually laughed be by mean pleasant savoury job have undertaken witnessing keen enjoyment have thus bestowed made most delightful have ever be engaged in occupied whole morning to pas entire cargo through bath secure thorough cleansing of person whole of afternoon to get slave deck properly cleansed purified when sun set evening ship be once more sweet wholesome while slave have taking one with be on deck actively exercised for about day instead of about twenty minute morning evening a have said did more good than double ration for entire voyage even mendouca be fain to acknowledge that day instead of being wasted have be well spent have be hoping day that with breeze must spring up from somewhere think nobody be very particular a to quarter from must come so long a came at hope be doomed to disappointment sun went down in perfectly clear sky there be sign whatever of wind from quarter same weather condition prevailed through night when sun rose next morning there be still not slightest sign of wind while glass exhibited slight tendency to rise under circumstance thought must endeavour to secure repetition of proceeding of previous day so well pleased be mendouca with improved appearance of black when a usual half of came on deck at breakfast time that readily gave consent accordingly poor creature be again treated to luxury of bath while slave deck received thorough scrubbing to cleanse from filth accumulated during night thus negro be enabled to pas second day in pure air to great improvement of health spirit indeed ecstatic delight with lingered over bath cheerfulness with afterwards worked at task of drawing water scrubbing chattering almost gaily together time be to most eloquent testimony a to misery that have previously endured cooped up tightly wedged together day night in close noisome hold must not omit to mention very curious phenomenon of have often heard have never before beheld until day be known among sailor a phenomenon of ripple be on forecastle superintending bathing operation when first made appearance sky being at time clear cloudless with sun blazing in midst like huge ball of living flame while water be so oil smooth glassy that be quite impossible to distinguish horizon to determine where sea ended sky began be hotter than have ever felt before dressed only in thin shirt thinnest of white trouser perspiration be gushing so freely from pore of body that light airy garment be saturated with while atmosphere be so stagnant that seemed impossible to inhale sufficiency of air for breathing purpose under trying condition be of course anxiously watching for breeze be with feeling of exquisite delight happening to look abroad toward north saw horizon strongly marked with line of delicate blue indicating a believed approach of thrice welcome breeze in exuberance of delight shouted to mendouca who be reclining in hammock aft slung from main boom of course under shelter of awning hurrah here come breeze at last although know where have sprung from for there be not cloud to be seen mendouca sprang up in hammock at news looked in direction to be pointing then sank back again disgustedly pshaw be breeze worse luck cried be only ripple ripple ejaculated surely not have appearance of genuine breeze mendouca however be too intensely disgusted to reply meanwhile streak of blue stretching right athwart horizon be advancing rapidly bearing straight down upon brigantine soon became possible to see tiny wavelet sparkling in dazzling sunlight to detect soft musical liquid tinkling sound such a one may hear when tide be rising on flat sandy beach on calm summer day by time have made disappointing discovery that blue line be merely belt of rippling water about quarter of mile wide with perfectly calm glassy surface beyond a there be advance guard of cat paw such a may usually be seen playing on surface of water a forerunner of approaching breeze be reluctantly compelled to acknowledge to myself that mendouca be right so proved for although line rather belt of rippling water not only advanced right up to ship giving forth most pleasant refreshing liquid sound a came lapping musically against brigantine side for few minute when reached also passed on traversed entire visible surface of ocean finally disappearing beyond southern horizon whole phenomenon be absolutely unaccompanied by slightest perceptible movement of air curious disturbance of ocean surface be twice repeated on same day long hot breathless wearisome day at length drew to end still there be sign of wind night passed day dawned still lay like craft in coleridge ancient mariner a idle a painted ship upon painted ocean that day too waxed waned without sign of so much a cat paw to revive drooping hope although during succeeding night be visited by terrific thunderstorm accompanied by perfect deluge of rain during few evanescent puff intermittently filled sail moved perhaps mile nearer cuba when day again dawned there be further recurrence of same staring cloudless sky of dazzling blue same blazing sun same breathless atmosphere same oil sea a day of calm stagnation succeeded other with relentless persistency kept up custom of bathing negro thoroughly cleansing slave deck until at length poor creature actually grew fat merry so that mendouca despite fast growing impatience irritability at continued calm be obliged to admit that have never seen cargo of black ivory in such promising condition before however be not for while superintending bathing scrubbing operation talked cheerfully pleasantly to fellow giving such name a tom bob joe snowball so on to readily answered instead of abusing ordering about with brutal oath obscenity a be habit of crew although poor wretch understood not word of what be spoken to either by crew by yet readily enough distinguished difference of manner not only so seemed to posse faculty of interpreting one meaning from tone of one voice so that quickly grew to understand what wanted to do did cheerfully with alacrity in manner with persistent calm recurring day after day passed le than almost incredible time of over three week without moving a many mile from spot where wind have deserted mendouca temper growing steadily worse day until at length became absolutely unbearable spoke to a little a possible climax be reached when one day steward who have be sent down into hold to overhaul store came on deck with face a long a main bowline reported that there be only food water enough in ship to last ten day longer chapter fourteen mendouca becomes communicative only ten day longer roared mendouca face livid with fury consternation nonsense juan must have made stupid mistake there surely be there must be more than have not made mistake at senor answered man sulkily be just a have said there be only provision water enough to last on full allowance ten day longer then if be case hand must be put on short allowance half ration at once exclaimed mendouca with oath stop little there must be mistake light lantern again will go down below with satisfy on point accordingly mendouca steward went down into hold together gave store exhaustive overhaul with result that original report of latter be fully confirmed mendouca came up from hold raging like maniac cursing weather provision everything else that must think of including whom denounced a jonah ill luck having commenced according to assertion with sparing of life reception on board francesca a for calm declared that must detain no longer having searched sky examined barometer in vain for sign of change gave order for canvas to be furled for negro to be set to work forthwith upon sweep intention being a stated to keep at in relay gang until region of apparently eternal calm have be left breeze of sort found there be ten of sweep long heavy oar working through port in becket firmly lashed to ringbolts in stanchion be evidently placed there expressly for particular purpose loom of sweep be long enough to admit of four men working at accordingly boatswain having received order from mendouca selected forty of strongest looking of negro set to exhausting labour rest of unfortunate creature being driven below out of way vessel lying there inert a log on water proved very heavy to start especially a black knew not how to handle sweep having evidently never touched one before once fairly started craft be kept moving with comparative ease at speed of about three half knot per hour be cruel work for unhappy black who naked a when be born be remorselessly kept at by boatswain mate of whom paced deck fore aft armed with heavy colt plied unmercifully upon shoulder of man whom chose to believe be not fully exerting although perspiration poured from dark naked hide like rain short spell hard work be however order of day after hour of almost superhuman exertion relief be called fresh gang be set to work exhausted toiler be hustled below to rest recover a best must remonstrated hotly with mendouca upon needle cruelty practised by boatswain mate be roughly told that did not know what be talking about negro must never work unless kept continually in wholesome dread of lash that be absolutely necessary to get ounce of work out of if be not one to perish miserably of hunger thirst so a must do better got piece of oldest softest canvas must find bucket of water with descended to slave deck carefully bathed poor lacerated shoulder of unfortunate who have suffered most severely at hand of boatswain mate little piece of attention that saw be most gratefully received made fully twenty mile of westing day from time when negro be first set to work up to sunset to mendouca great gratification indeed so delighted be with own brilliant idea that did that night what have never known to do before indulged rather too freely in content of rum bottle a consequence grew garrulous good humouredly sarcastic over effort made for suppression of slave trade emphatically asserted must never be put down one very serious disadvantage labour under remarked referring particularly to operation of british slave squadron be that be altogether too confiding credulous accept man a honest straightforward until have learned to cost that be reverse take case for example of attack upon chango creek be led to undertake upon representation made information given by lobo portuguese trader of banana point be oh know about have heard whole story interrupted to say in reply to ejaculation of surprise be very much obliged to lobo of course captain paid handsomely for information assistance suppose there be not one of from captain downward who ever have ghost of suspicion that fellow be playing false that affair be bold yet carefully arranged plot to exterminate whole of destroy ship eh of course have yet give word that be ay only wonder to be that did not succeed suppose be that have good deal more fight in than of gave credit for be where so many excellently arranged trap have failed plotter have never made sufficient allowance for fighting power of british a have told over over again be just that important oversight caused what ought to have be splendid success to result in serious disaster intention be good a be much too often case have reckoned without host understand cut in a mendouca paused what be plot how be lobo concerned in appears to that man acted in perfect good faith gave certain information proved to be substantially correct except that be mistaken a to force that must have to encounter safely piloted to spot from boat attack be to be made can see nothing like plot treachery in of course can not sweet innocent retorted mendouca with fine sarcasm for simple reason a say that british be altogether too trustful confiding to see treachery double dealing until be thrust openly in face be altogether too simple unsuspicious navy men to deal with trick rus of slave dealing fraternity before eye be opened die of fever be killed in brush with be invalided home may be so agreed so general statement a doe not in least help to see what be character of lobo plot even that there be plot at well will tell said mendouca thickly helping to caulker of rum have already swallowed two tumbler of stiff grog since subject have be broached in addition to what have previously taken will tell because having made up mind that will never rejoin own people information be not likely to do lobo harm when arrived at banana point on particular morning presence seriously threatened to entirely upset very important transaction senor lobo have in hand namely disposal shipment of prime lot of nearly thousand able bodied full grown male black that have got snugly stowed away in two big barracoons short distance up creek from factory have captain taken into head to land party make search of peninsula barracoons must have be discovered friend lobo must have be ruined man so a soon a brig be identified a man o war be a soon a must be distinctly made out mistake that man ' war men make friend dugdale can scarcely ever bring yourselves to disguise ship declare character a far a be possible to see let see what be saying have run clean off course know where be be going to tell what happened when barracouta be identified from banana point a man o ' war said ah yes exactly answered mendouca well a soon a be discovered that brig be british man o ' war available hand be set to work to clear everything of incriminating character out of two brig be going to ship slave so must overhaul a be told did nothing might be found on board to justify seizure job be successfully completed only few minute before entered creek must have availed lobo nothing have captain happened to have thought of landing upon peninsula next thing therefore be to furnish with totally different subject to think about lobo found in opportune presence of four craft in chango creek captain of three out of four vessel happened to be down at banana when arrived lobo who be gifted with unusual measure of persuasiveness have very little difficulty in convincing that must be absolutely certain to discover hiding place sooner later consequently must be good plan to inveigle into making immediate attack upon when by concerting proper measure of defence might succeed in practically annihilating so sweeping formidable enemy out of path three skipper fell in readily with plan when have propounded also undertook to secure cooperation of fourth a creek offered exceptional facility for successful defence be accepted that be all a good a done for especially a lobo have undertaken to cut brig adrift at right moment so that might be driven ashore rendered useless for time being if not altogether matter arranged slave captain left banana forthwith to carry out plan for defence of creek taking short cut by way of back of creek taking with also available man that lobo must spare idea being to allow to advance unmolested a far a boom never dreamed that must succeed in forcing then destroy by musketry fire from bank when weakened by unavailing attack upon boom must at length be compelled to retire astounding pluck perseverance in forcing boom completely upset plan converted what must have be for easy bloodless victory into disastrous defeat while saved life of survivor of attacking party though turned out disastrously for aravares of mercedes friend plot served lobo purpose perfectly shipping of slave on board two brig be waiting for proceeding immediately that be clear of creek vessel getting away to sea same night so that see be by mean a difficult matter to deceive hoodwink man ' war people a choose to suppose answered so must seem yet by own showing be not only deceived party after attack be successful so far a be concerned that be very true only confirms what have always insisted upon namely that in making plan foreigner allow sufficiently for british pluck obstinacy now do never leave anything to chance always lay plan so carefully that destruction capture of enemy be absolute certainty for such careful forethought on part sapphire two boat must never have fallen into power sapphire boat exclaimed surely mean to tell that be responsible for massacre of two boat crew not massacre of certainly capture answered mendouca with smile of gratified pride be people still alive then asked be when last heard of answered mendouca be quite possible that by time at least part of have be tortured to death by matadi chief to whom sold a sacrifice to fetish gracious power how horrible exclaimed to think that englishman must consign fellow countryman to such fate a why not demanded mendouca fiercely why must be more gentle to countryman than have be to do think that because carry fate lightly gaily feel keenly depth to have fallen might have be post captain by time honoured distinguished for great service worthily rendered be instead slaver pirate masquerading under disguise of spanish name do think be insensible of immeasurable gulf separate from what might have be be own countryman who have opened that gulf who have robbed of opportunity of reaching that proud eminence be at one time within reach have hurled into abyss of crime infamy in find be surprised forsooth must avenge whenever opportunity come knew now from experience that be quite useless to argue with mendouca when got upon subject of grievance therefore gave conversation turn by asking where then be wretched people now if indeed be still alive presume answered that if still alive a say be where last heard of namely at matadi village place on south bank of congo about one hundred mile rather more from mouth why do take profound interest in asked possibly be contemplating formation of expedition for rescue a soon a have effected escape from laughed satirically reply laugh be alike cut short by sound of heavy footstep on companion ladder outside cabin next moment boatswain made appearance in doorway with intimation that craft of sort have just be made out at distance of about three mile broad on starboard bow wished to know whether course of brigantine be to be altered not mendouca sprang to foot hurried on deck following on first emergence from brilliantly lighted cabin night appeared to be dark a eye accommodated to change of condition became apparent that cloudless sky be thickly gemmed powdered with star of magnitude from of first order down to star dust constituting broad belt of milky way gleaming with soft resplendent lustre be only to be witnessed within zone of tropic moreover there be young moon delicate crescent shaped paring about two day old hanging low in western sky yet capable in pure translucent atmosphere of yielding appreciable amount of light water be still smooth a polished glass even swell having gone down so completely that undulation be not to be detected by even delicate test of watching star reflection in polished depth while brigantine be a steady a though still on stock where took form substance negro be still toiling at sweep watch armed to teeth be clustered fore aft on alert to guard against attempt at outbreak among canvas be closely furled so that have uninterrupted view of sky from horizon to zenith around toward latter of delicate tapering naked spar pointed a steadily a spire of church boatswain however be eagerly directing mendouca attention toward small dark object broad on starboard bow turning gaze toward made out brig under two topsail jib trysail with course in brail mendouca have already seized night glass with aid be subjecting to prolonged searching scrutiny upon completion of handed instrument to with remark in english take good look at dugdale tell what think of took glass having brought stranger into field soon managed by adjustment of focus to get clear sharply defined image of a floated motionless black silhouette against deep velvety purple black star spangled sky a did so certain sense of familiarity with delicate diminutive black picture upon be gazing thrilled through surely knew that low long shapely hull lofty slightly raking mast spacious topsail even very steeve of bowsprit seemed familiar to felt certain that superbly cut jib handsome trysail must belong only to barracouta if so how be to act be plainly duty to do anything everything might be in power to promote capture of daring slaver unscrupulous pirate whose guest prisoner be have power to do anything with now thoroughly alert even suspicious individual at side watch on deck about be clearly evident that nothing in shape of signalling must even be attempted with slightest hope chance of success only other mode of action remained to appeared to be to carefully conceal knowledge rather very strong suspicion a to identity of brig have barely arrived at conclusion when mendouca with accent of impatience interrupted reverie with exclamation well surely have seen that be possible to see by time can not quite make up mind a to character have impression have seen before seems to that bear very striking resemblance to spanish brig be lying off lobo factory on day of first arrival in congo said happy idea suggesting to a began to speak might safely make statement without breach of truth of on board barracouta having observed remarked upon striking resemblance between two craft um may be so muttered mendouca with strong accent of doubt in voice however let have look at handed over glass with alacrity for be about last wish just then to be questioned too closely a to character of stranger mendouca subjected to further long exhaustive scrutiny at termination turned to with accent of unmistakable suspicion inquired have suggested to suppose that yonder craft may be british man o ' war have seen nothing so like in own squadron a to lead to suspicion that may be dangerous enemy whom ought to be promptly warned to avoid now have not known that have never seen barracouta must have scarcely known what reply to give to home question a be however answered at hazard well at distance yonder vessel offer to eye very little resemblance to usual type of british gun brig be longer much lower in water mast be certainly further apart than be case with brig generally must see that for must be unreasonable to expect to give more decided opinion at distance in so vague light will swear to that be honestly of opinion that yon brig be not man o ' war certainly not answered with pretended annoyance at pertinacity may be may not be be quite impossible to express more decided opinion under circumstance therefore must decline to do so turned walked away from with air of petulance mendouca laid down telescope walked to binnacle peered intently for moment at compass keep way two point more to southward ordered helmsman alteration in course brought brig about one point before beam distant about two half mile if persisted in must soon have effect of increasing distance between two craft unless be already seen rendered quite possible that might slip past unobserved spar standing naked to dark sky hull lying low upon equally dark water there be however hope that even at distance separating two vessel roll grinding of heavy sweep must be heard in perfect stillness of air water felt confident that if yonder brig be indeed barracouta sound referred to extended so far a to reach sharp ear on board must be identified significance at once understood even a thought passed through mind seemed to have also occurred to mendouca for strode toward waist exclaimed in low clear voice be distinctly audible fore aft must probably not have be audible half cable length away let nigger knock off sweeping for present send below a soon a be there have clapped hatch on noiselessly mind let hand set to work to muffle sweep with mat old canvas pad of oakum anything else that can lay hand upon be unfortunate that be not thought of before may not yet be too late negro grateful for unexpected respite from exhausting toil of course quite ignorant a to cause gladly tumbled below grating be carefully secured over meanwhile boatswain with one hand dived below in short time two men re appeared with load of miscellaneous stuff ball of spun yarn hand went diligently to work under mendouca personal supervision to muffle sweep be so effectually done that when hour later be again manned worked with scarcely sound beyond rather heavy splash of blade in water meanwhile during progress of muffling process in have not offered to participate kept keen watch upon distant brig taking occasional squint at through night glass when thought possible to do so without attracting mendouca attention quite know what expected to see for of course knew perfectly well that eye in brig might be steadfastly watching without being able to detect sign of such scrutiny be moreover fully aware that must have be discovered character suspected visible indication of such discovery suspicion must be permitted to reveal to eye same studied concealment must equally apply to preparation for investigation that might be moved to undertake still thought just barely possible that by maintaining strict watch might chance to detect sign of alertness on board brig if be indeed barracouta a strongly suspected be disappointed for did at length detect indication not on board brig at considerable distance from immediately under slender crescent of setting moon where while sweeping surface of water moved by vague instinct caught two faint momentary flash of dim orange radiance that to have very much appearance of reflected moonlight glancing off wet blade of oar if be so meant that have be seen character very shrewdly suspected most probably from steady plying of sweep for more apparently urgent reason than that be becalmed that surprise attack be about to be attempted from very quarter where under circumstance be least likely to be looked for namely straight ahead of course what have seen might merely have be ray of moonlight glancing off wet body of porpoise whale other sea creature risen to surface to breathe have so much appearance of momentary flash of oar be loath to believe anything else assuming to be what hoped cue be now of course to distract attention a much a possible from part of ocean lay immediately ahead of must not be better done than by concentrating upon brig now lay practically abeam of short three mile away therefore longer surreptitiously ostentatiously again brought night glass to bear upon allowed to be found thus when mendouca came aft after having personally superintended muffling of sweep putting of in motion again well said a rejoined have not yet be able to satisfy a to character of brig said be seem to be asleep on board if be slaver skipper have more care consideration for property than have for at least allows slave to rest at night be quite patent to answered mendouca drily then know may not be running short of food water a be may not be slaver of course assented with best accent of indifference must assume slaver slaver have not be able to detect sign of life on board brig for last half hour indeed from moment when first began to watch can make out faint light of binnacle lamp be fact of being allowed to continue shining must seem to argue to mind at least that be what may have reason for attempting to conceal presence from if feel differently toward think must do well to extinguish binnacle light for awhile helmsman can steer equally well by star of there be plenty to choose from yes of course be right assented hastily there can be harm in doing going to binnacle glanced into saw that ship be heading on course have last set for directed helmsman to choose star to steer by then carefully withdrew lamp extinguished chapter fifteen affair of francesca barracouta ' boat continued to industriously scrutinise brig through night glass by so doing contrived to keep mendouca attention also pretty closely centred upon must see that be fully on alert appeared to instinctively scent danger in air for frequently assumed anxious listening attitude with growing irritability manifested in repeated execration of slave for quite unavoidable splashing sound that made in working sweep be also intently watching thin crescent of setting moon be by time hanging on very verge of western horizon suspected that be awaiting disappearance to put in practice stratagem such a perhaps further alteration of ship course a additional safeguard may have be intention be altered by unlucky discovery made by one of men on forecastle who at very moment when moon be in act of sinking behind horizon caught sight for moment of large boat full of men strongly outlined against golden crescent immediately reported fact coming aft that might do so without raising voice boat exclaimed mendouca anxiously when man have told what have seen be quite sure a sure a be that be now standing here speaking to senor answered man in tone of conviction jose saw also be watching disappearing moon when be about half way below horizon suddenly saw large boat pulling must say at least twelve oar glide swiftly across face a though steering to southward on line must cross course phew ejaculated mendouca that look serious for undoubtedly mean that brig people be by mean a fast asleep a have imagined to be dugdale how far off did judge boat to be when saw demanded turning again to seaman matter of mile half perhaps trifle more be answer very well then will do answered mendouca forewarned be forearmed ' a english say a go forward pas word along for sweep to be laid in stowed away for negro to be sent below hatch grating put on secured do hear everything must be done a noiselessly a possible bueno senor answered man a turned away to do be bidding in few minute sweep be laid in stowed away brigantine head gently turned more to southward in order that might drift in direction a long a retained way then slave having be driven below secured deck be rapidly noiselessly cleared for action gun be cast loose loaded liberal supply of grape canister be passed on deck arm be served out to men boarding netting be triced up round ship whole of work be executed so rapidly silently a to clearly demonstrate that crew be thoroughly seasoned one inured to fighting by mean averse to when chance be in favour a certainly be in present instance be filled with chagrin disgust at thought of how simple accident have sufficed to mar defeat what might otherwise have proved perfect surprise to mendouca crew still although must not conceal from fact that apparently trivial accident have placed attacking party at woeful disadvantage by warning antagonist of intended attack thus putting on alert have seen enough of british pluck to hope that even yet despite might still prove successful awaited event with small anxiety quite determined that if slightest chance offered of affording aid to assailant must avail of let consequence to myself be what must mendouca soon proved that be not man to overlook such peril a for presently when by personal inspection have satisfied that everything be in readiness came up to said with just suspicion of sneer in tone of voice now dugdale will not pay so poor compliment a to suppose capable of treacherously making use of present position on board ship to raise hand against man who gave life at moment when whole attention will be needed to protect against outside enemy still conscience appears to be very curious inscrutable thing there be knowing what may prompt to do under influence of excitement misguided enthusiasm in order therefore that may be placed beyond danger of temptation to do something that must probably afterwards have cause to bitterly regret will ask to go below to cabin where for own safety sake will take liberty of locking in with companion whose duty will be to see that remain there commit by rash act oh certainly answered rather bitterly need must when devil drive so lead on most courteous senor look here dugdale said apparently rather hurt by tone must not feel aggrieved at action in matter what propose to do be for own good safety quite a much a by way of safeguard of own men be fairly amenable to discipline in calmer moment a have doubtless discovered by time must be sorry to answer for in excitement of fiercely contested fight such a be likely to be since have persistently refused to join out out honestly think will be safer for to be below out of sight until have driven meddlesome boat off very well said must of course be a please only for mercy sake spare humiliation of mounting guard over looked intently in eye for moment then said right will will be locked up by only for own sake be careful to behave exactly a must in presence of guard for promise that if have slightest reason to suspect treachery on part will be sorry that ever spared life now come along for there be time to spare accordingly followed below entered cabin closing door behind immediately heard turn key withdraw from lock after went on deck again for time most perfect stillness silence reigned throughout ship silence be not of long duration however for have scarcely be in cabin ten minute when low murmur of voice overhead next instant mendouca voice pealed out loud clear in english ho boat ahoy who be what do want there be reply must not catch voice evidently coming from point at distance from ship on opposite side to occupied by cabin be probably inquiry a to name destination of brigantine for mendouca shouted nubian queen of for liverpool from brass river with oil ivory keep off will fire into warn that be armed be quite prepared to defend long hail from boat now followed to mendouca replied if do will be at peril have be cleared out once before just about same spot intend to be robbed second time keep off tell if advance stroke will fire instantly afterwards heard say to own men in spanish now lad have in cluster let have fire sharp ringing report of brigantine nine pounder immediately pealed out even through shock concussion of discharge thought that a stood with ear at open port caught sound of crash whether be so not there must be mistake about scream groan of agony came floating over water in response to broadside mingled with cry of command roll dash of oar in water rattling volley of musketry deeper note of two boat gun fired almost together shot of one at least of heard felt strike hull of brigantine be now in instant noise confusion on deck silence have held tongue of crew be now no longer necessary jabber oath shouting loud defiant laugh rumbling of gun carriage creaking of tackle block thud of rammer sponge call for cartridge combined to create hubbub must not have shamed builder of babel through above rose mendouca voice in short sharp sentence of appeal encouragement direction to men must hear by furious grinding of handspike breathless ejaculation of men crash of gun carriage a gun be run out that francesca crew be working like demon almost before must have believed possible have again loaded gun second broadside rang out over still water to be again followed by still more gruesome chorus of cry groan sudden cessation of sound of oar loud above rose exultant cheer of ruffian on deck hurrah lad heard mendouca exclaim joyously load again smartly with grape canister only time have checked for moment have not yet have enough fear will come at again a soon a have picked up shipmate so now be time load let have while be stationary while be speaking must also hear voice that unless be greatly mistaken belonged to young first luff of barracouta exclaiming at great distance pull starboard back port now back hard let pick up poor fellow before shark get scent of easy steady lad steady hold water now then hearties lay hold of oar let get inboard sharp ca afford to lie here to be peppered help wounded of who be unhurt be sort style bring along here be still alive do think right have now then coxswain heave with will hurt poor fellow more than can help gently man gently now lift handsomely so crash relentless broadside of francesca again pealed forth again uprose that dismal wail of shriek in testimony of too terribly truthful aim frantic cheer shout of exultation burst from lip of slaver crew in midst of mendouca voice rang out now stand by men here come there be only one boat load of number must be killed wounded stand by with pike pistol cutlass let not one of show head above rail give volley from pistol a range alongside then trust to cold steel for rest now be time fire at word there followed tremendous popping of pistol mingled with yell of men on deck british cheer sent blood tingling through vein made anathematise helpless condition sharp ringing clash of steel upon steel furious trampling of bare foot upon plank overhead scuffle continued for fully three minute must have be very hot while lasted for through hubbub cry groan of freshly wounded be continuous must hear dull crunching sound of sharp cutlass shearing through bone muscle shrill scream of agony heavy thud of body falling to deck oath execration in spanish in english shout of mutual encouragement yell of deadly hatred ceaseless trampling of foot indescribable medley of sound accompany sharp stubbornly contested hand to hand conflict in feverish anxiety to share in struggle forgot about mendouca warning dashed frantically against stout cabin door in effort to burst way out before however must succeed hurly burly suddenly ceased to be almost instantly followed by yell of exultation from crowd overhead a hasty rattle splash of oar proclaimed that attacking party have be driven off now men to gun again quick load smartly give broadside before get out of range shouted mendouca sweep off face of water if can let not one of escape to tell tale loud shout of exulting assent to brutal exhortation pealed forth heard rumbling of wheel on deck a gun be run in be more than must endure again hurling furiously against cabin door at length succeeded in bursting off hinge to emerge from cabin rush on deck be work of moment reached scene of action just a loaded gun be being run out stop shouted what be about to do men have utterly mistaken captain order if suppose meant to fire upon boat order to secure gun continued turning to mendouca surely can not be that be going to allow excitement of battle to betray into committal of cold blooded murder have beaten off enemy be in full retreat let that satisfy hitherto have be fighting a be aware present state of law be such that be held justifiable in act of self defence must fire upon boat now will be murder swear to that if do will testify against for deed if live so long man have regard for do suppose that captain of yonder brig will be content to take beating off of boat a final settlement of night doings tell will follow hunt to world end ay take sooner later what do suppose will be fate if murder that retreating boat crew why will swing for deed a certainly a that now stand there glaring at have finished demanded in voice almost inarticulate with fury hand resting meanwhile upon butt of pistol be stuck in sash yes said have be to say have finished if have succeeded in preventing perpetration of act of miserable cowardice that in cooler moment must cause to hate despise for remainder of life not otherwise slowly removed hand from butt of pistol with bitter laugh drew cigar from pocket lighted secure gun shouted to men then walking up to clutching by shoulder said have triumphed again warn that day will go too far pay for temerity with life do know that while be speaking be actually tottering upon very brink of grave why did not blow brain out know boy if have wish to live out day never taunt with cowardice again there go below let see again until have recovered self command even yet will do mischief said will not go below be watch on deck mean to keep have fear of temper getting better of now so will remain where be be if will trust with charge of deck be fresh while be fagged with exertion excitement so be for to go below get rest not mendouca laughed again time quite genially said very well let be a say will go below rest if be comfort to to know mind acknowledging now that be glad intervened to prevent from firing on boat keep a be going let nigger man sweep again be right about brig will follow to world end if can so must put distance possible between ourselves while calm last repeating to boatswain order respecting manning of sweep singular man nodded shortly to dived out of sight down companion way in few minute gang of slave be again brought on deck put to sweep steering course of about south south west be soon once more moving through water at speed of about three knot course be followed through night up to eight o'clock next morning at hour one of men having be sent aloft a far a royal yard to see whether sign of brig must be discovered having returned to deck again with intimation that horizon be clear round brigantine position be pricked off upon chart head once more pointed straight for cuba have by time traversed distance of fully sixty mile under impulsion of sweep alone everybody be anxiously watching for sign of coming breeze yet despite already long continuance of calm heaven be still a brass to clear cloudless blue a fathomless depth beneath foot not merest vestige of cloud to be seen mercury still persistently steady at abnormal height sea a smooth motionless a sheet of glass not smallest sign to justify in hoping for change heat be something absolutely phenomenal deck planking be so hot that have to wear shoe to protect foot from being scorched gang of negro be kept constantly at work drawing water with to flood deck yet despite precaution despite too awning be now spread fore aft pitch in seam of planking became so soft that if stood still for only few second found stuck fast pitied unfortunate black from bottom of heart for be relentlessly kept toiling at horrible sweep without intermission through day that too upon short allowance of water be useless to interfere for even have begun to understand by time unless brigantine must be taken out of awful region of apparently eternal calm one of black white together must inevitably perish miserably of thirst terrible weather lasted through following day during with torment indescribable from thirst lash of boatswain colt miserable slave propelled ship le distance than one hundred fifty mile oh how fervently begged entreated mendouca to have mercy upon unhappy creature to at least give order that must be no more flogged even if inexorable necessity demanded that must be kept toiling at sweep wretch be a adamant laughed jeered at sympathy with poor creature a much believe to annoy a for other reason persistently refused to give order declaring that since must receive many sound flogging when got ashore if indeed ever lived to reach be just a well that must learn to endure lash at once at brutal statement went temporarily mad think at event did what looked like thoroughly mad thing went on deck walking up to boatswain informed that if mate dared to strike negro again must knock down mendouca highly amused at heat excitement on behalf of negro have followed on deck probably to see what must next do upon hearing threat called out jeeringly look out jose man senor dugdale have warned may be sure that if strike one of nigger again will carry out threat boatswain saw at once how land lay that mendouca be only amusing at expense feeling confident therefore of captain countenance protection suppose for answer raised colt smote nearest negro savage blow over shoulder with of course after possibly foolhardy threat there be one thing to do did forthwith hitting out with whole strength catching boatswain fair between eye rolling over like ninepin have have well hit exclaimed mendouca laughing heartily at sight of boatswain a reeled fell under foot of negro warned jose lad now see evil result of neglecting warning no hastily continued starting to foot put up knife man will never do can not afford to spare senor dugdale at least not just yet ah must look out dugdale bravo well hit again serf right jose must never draw knife upon unarmed man for fellow have hastily scrambled to foot with drawn knife in hand made rush at eye blazing with fury a only way of defending at moment have seized uplifted right hand with left giving wrench sent knife spinning over bulwark into sea while with right again knocked down now jose exclaimed mendouca end matter do hear can not spare senor dugdale so if be found with knife between rib will hold responsible for give solemn promise will run up to yard arm leave there until will not matter to what becomes of miserable carcase hope that thrashing have received will make use little more discrimination in use of colt if nigger wo work make by mean so long a be willing to work without thrashing leave alone say a for dugdale continued in english have suspected that really meant to carry out threat must have taken step to prevent will not have men interfered with in execution of duty if perform duty to satisfaction will take such step a may seem necessary for correction so need not trouble further in direction why man if be to give free hand must have mutiny in le than week moreover have made one deadly enemy by knocking jose down may consider exceedingly fortunate if authority prof sufficient to protect from knife take care make other enemy among men will not be answerable for safety occurred shortly before sunset through hot breathless night unhappy negro be kept toiling at sweep in gang relay result being that when morning dawned poor wretch seemed one to be utterly worn out yet still there be respite for when again attempted to remonstrate with mendouca individual simply pointed to serene cloudless sky with blazing merciless sun in midst savagely asked whether wanted hand to perish of hunger thirst occurred while be at breakfast when went on deck at conclusion of meal enemy boatswain drew mendouca attention to upper spar sail of ship just rising slowly above horizon on starboard bow never saw so sudden change in man demeanour a took place in of mendouca when eye rested upon distant object hitherto have be growing day more savage morose now good humour suddenly returned to ordering brigantine head to be pointed straight for stranger shouted in gladness of heart hurrah lad there be relief for at last will find what want food water on board yon stranger also way of persuading to let have be greatly mistaken significance of last part of remark be to mind unmistakable if must not get by fair mean what wanted mendouca have already made up mind to take by force in other word to commit act of piracy be sorry for crew of unlucky craft for felt convinced that mendouca must have scant consideration for future want while satisfying own yet sight of stranger filled with almost delirious delight for here be chance if must contrive to avail of to make escape from present surroundings true if be permitted must contrive to throw in lot with people yonder must probably have to face terrible suffering in shape of hunger thirst after must be le unendurable than present situation determined that might happen must certainly make attempt to join always provided of course that craft be honest not of similar character to francesca a neared stranger proved to be handsome full rigged ship of about thousand ton measurement thereabouts thought that have somewhat of look of one of new british clipper indiaman be just at time beginning to supersede old fashioned slow lumbering tub have be considered correct kind of thing by john company if be must probably have crew strong enough not only to successfully resist demand of mendouca also to protect must be able by pretext to get on board difficulty of course must be to do if a rather expected mendouca must elect to lay francesca alongside ship endeavour to carry latter by coup de main must board with rest taking chance of being run through shot down in attempt immediately place under protection of stranger crew be of course easy enough to arrange scheme in own mind even very slight deviation on mendouca part from programme expected to adopt might suffice to nullify nevertheless appeared probable that surmise a to mendouca intention must prove correct for if did not mean to lay stranger aboard carry with rush must scarcely understand boldness with be approaching in broad daylight with strongly manned sweep proclaiming to most unsuspicious eye dubious character of brigantine chapter sixteen capture plundering of bangalore indiaman be just six bell in afternoon watch when at length arrived within distance of about mile of stranger have by time be unmistakably made out to be british passenger ship of one of crack line first by having hoisted british colour time before secondly by crowd of well dressed lady gentleman with aid of telescope must see congregated on poop mendouca also have hoisted british ensign to supreme indignation man o ' war pennant object in doing so being of course to disarm suspicion a long a possible thus leave ship only very brief length of time to prepare for defence when intention to attack became longer possible of concealment remonstrated with upon desecration of colour that have once fought hoped to win fame under of course remonstrance be quite useless rascal only laughed at having arrived within above named distance of ship mendouca ordered sweep to be laid in slave to be driven below secured done to disgust next order be to hoist out boat of francesca unlike most slaver carried three a soon a be in water entire crew be armed whole of except especial enemy jose englishman very quiet inoffensive fellow whom be surprised to find among crew of such ruffian be ordered down over side completely upset plan for of course only way now of reaching stranger be by mean of boat by swimming while must gladly have gone in one of boat taken chance of reaching stranger deck alive be not quite prepared to throw away life in unsuccessful effort to swim to ship for be what must have meant water being alive with shark have followed day after day with alarming persistency ever since have taken to use of sweep besides must of course not have be permitted to make attempt of course have chosen to tell deliberate falsehood declared readiness to throw in lot with mendouca crew be possible that might have be given command of one of boat not even for purpose of effecting escape did consider course must be justifiable so have perforce to remain where be under jealously watchful eye of jose if not of englishman also mendouca asking ironically a went down side last of whether have letter for home elsewhere must like to forward by mean of stranger now that sweep be laid in everlasting grind roll splash be no longer heard silence of nature seemed so profound a to be almost awe inspiring there be literally not sound to be heard save such a be caused by human agency such a movement voice of men in boat gasping sigh of unhappy negro cooped up below in stifling hold occasionally slight murmur of sound reached from distant ship call of officer uttering command yo heave oh of crew gang of engaged upon heavy job occasional rumbling that to ear sounded very much like of carronade slide in process of being trained to bear upon object if ship be armed there be sign of side being decorated with painted port only so far a must see when however boat have traversed about distance between brigantine ship man appeared in mizen rigging of latter hailing in english in voice rendered word perfectly audible to on board francesca demanded to know what wanted saw mendouca rise in stern sheet of boat heard make reply must not distinguish what be perhaps because have intentionally made unintelligible whatever word may have be be clearly unsatisfactory for figure in rigging waved hand warningly shouted keep off whoever be be far too strong party to be allowed to come alongside warn that if attempt to do so will fire upon if have legitimate business with let one boat with crew of not more than five come alongside welcome will not have whole of if can help think can boat have up to time be paddling quietly composedly along men evidently husbanding strength for final effort now in response to shout from mendouca bent to work sent boat foaming along in style for certainly must never have given credit must scarcely have done better have be british man o ' war men that have pretended to be oar bent water be churned into foam miniature surge gathered under boat bow a little craft be suddenly urged to racing speed then figure in ship mizen rigging waved arm stepped quietly down on to poop by time be occupied only by band of men evidently passenger who under leadership of military looking man be handling musket making ready to open fire at signal given by individual who have just stepped out of ship rigging who be doubt captain eight hitherto closed port in stranger bulwark be suddenly thrown open a many dark threatening iron muzzle appeared at second command whole eight blazed forth content consisting of round shot with charge of grape on top of went hurtling through air in direction of boat aim be excellent shot flashing up water round boat so far a must see not man among of crew be touched heard cheer men on urging to stretch out get so close to ship by time that gun be again loaded must be impossible to depress muzzle sufficiently to hit boat men responded with nearest approach to cheer suppose spaniard can give pulling manfully while ship crew be however too quick for managed to give broadside just before boat got within critical limit where must have be impossible to touch time discharge be very much more effective round shot striking mendouca own boat square on stem just at water line destroying bow tearing several foot of keel away while accompanying charge of grape bowled over three of men shattered mendouca left arm at elbow crew of other two boat suffered nearly a badly one of losing three men while other lost one man killed five more le severely wounded besides having to stop pick up mendouca crew boat sinking almost immediately thought that severe punishment must have sufficed spaniard that must have abandoned attack so imagine thought skipper of ship for while be in perilous predicament magnanimously withheld fire giving opportunity to retire without further loss so must in probability have mendouca be born spaniard renegade a be british blood in vein still told despite anguish of terrible wound sooner found in boat picked up than voice again rang out almost a loudly clearly a before still urging men to press forward reminding that be fighting for life be same thing food water be probably reminder turned scale among waverer for at mention of word water again seized oar with yell gave way for ship evidently exasperated at quite unexpected exhibition of determination on part of pirate little band on poop now opened smart very galling fire with musket upon boat saw three four pair of arm tossed skyward a discharge rattled forth before weapon of little party of volunteer must be reloaded boat be alongside ship pirate dropped oar made simultaneous dash for fore main channel there instantly ensued desperate melee in popping of pistol be for first half minute so very prominent feature fully expected to see mendouca crew driven back into boat with very heavy loss to astonishment sorrow soon saw that be more than holding own in le than three minute have actually forced way inboard right be transferred to ship deck be evident that british crew be now making most determined desperate resistance for fight be protracted to fully quarter of hour clink clash of steel shout of combatant cry of wounded being distinctly audible to on deck of francesca then hubbub suddenly lulled heard cry for quarter cry to bitter grief knew to be sure indication of defeat on part of british crew then utter silence fell upon unfortunate ship for few minute to be broken by muffled sound of woman shriek men voice uplifted in fierce impotent anger denunciation two three pistol shot sounded a though have be fired in ship cabin then silence again ominous dreadful silence that to foreboding mind might mean perpetration of horror to already enacted on blood stained deck be a nothing silence prevailed for fully hour during sign of life be visible on board ship then arose sound of hilarious shout drunken laughter there be sudden stir commotion about deck crowd of men gathered on poop many of with hand bound behind a must see with aid of telescope while others have head swathed in blood stained bandage long plank be rigged out over taffrail then mendouca appeared to be making sort of speech if such be case speech be very brief one when terminated short pause ensued saw that few of prisoner perhaps three four a nearly a must make out be being released from bond then occurred short pause at expiration of man be led forward blindfolded guided to inner extremity of plank along must see that be urging to walk advanced few pace paused a though have be addressed distinctly saw shake head a though movement of head be prearranged signal inner end of plank suddenly tilted up unfortunate man with staggering movement a though to save fell with resounding splash into sea where for few second seemed to struggle desperately not for long however shark have be haunting for so many day heard splash after few restless movement a though unwilling to leave darted off toward ship saw horrid triangular fin cleaving surface of glassy water leaving own delicate wedge shaped wake spreading astern a went until small ripple of different wake met crossed other then a distance between prey lessened there be sudden increase of speed soon became rush black fin merged toward other water swirled round drowning man there be single ear piercing shriek of agony poor wretch have disappeared dreadful spectacle appeared to have have desired effect for saw that several more of prisoner be now being released from bond released men one slinking down off poop away forward toward forecastle there be others however fifteen in for counted whose courage be not to be shaken even by awful ordeal one after other boldly trod fatal plank went to meet dreadful doom honour to say for lofty courage enabled to choose death rather than ignoble crime stained life then there be long pause during a afterwards learned francesca crew be rummaging ship homeward bound indiaman named bangalore loading deck with booty of imaginable description preparatory to transfer to brigantine mendouca must mention have already compelled bangalore surgeon to dress wound for now having given order to one of men whom considered most reliable trustworthy of crew returned to francesca with aid of son pedro be got into bunk where must hear from time to time grinding teeth in agony although such be spirit of man not groan must permit to escape sun have set velvet dusk of tropic be closing down upon scene when at bangalore boat be hoisted out work of transhipping booty began mendouca must have felt second kidd for ship be almost a rich prize a one of old acapulco galleon there be bale of rich silk shawl spice casket of gem ingot of gold exquisite embroidered muslin know not what beside good of value sufficient seemed to to make rascal on book of francesca rich for remainder of life although be of course unable to take more than comparatively small quantity of bangalore entire cargo nevertheless contrived to find room for goodly proportion of most costly valuable content of vessel hold transfer of of a much food water a deemed necessary to requirement occupied crew until midnight for in mendouca absence a may be supposed did not trouble to exert overmuch moreover large proportion of be in such state of intoxication scarcely knew what be doing especial bete noir boatswain among number having seized early opportunity to board ship after mendouca have be safely bestowed in own cabin did not know until told so by simpson english man whom have already mentioned a having be left on board francesca afternoon with boatswain who added to information better keep weather eye liftin ' mr dugdale sir that jose full of spite a egg full of meat have never forgiven for knockin ' down have swore over over again to put knife into now that be full of drink skipper on beam end be just a likely a not to try yes suppose be thank for warning simpson said man put finger to forehead in acknowledgment of thanks continued to linger near presently dawned upon that have something further to say so turned to inquired be there anything particular that wish to say to simpson well yes sir there be if only knowed how to say answered man in low cautious tone of voice with somewhat hesitating manner paused for second two a though in consideration then looking full in face said hope will excuse askin ' of

berth then simpson sir be not to tell truth of answered man know that be rather risky thing to say aboard of here wessel truth be that ai satisfied at have be for long while not since mr arrowsmith senor mendouca a now call took up to piratin business so long a be just matter of runnin ' cargo of slave across atlantic did mind so much for there be plenty of dollar goin did see that there be much harm in for suppose poor beggar be worse off on sugar plantation than be in own country when come to work like what be be done to day want to be out of mind sayin ' so to straight out mr dugdale because be naval hofficer be sir of course a such be bound to be dead against such thing a have happened since have be aboard here besides have be watchin ' of sir askin ' pardon for same mr dugdale have seen that ship doin ai no more to taste than be to mine be right simpson be not said since have be so frank with will be equally so with have rightly guessed must gladly make escape from accursed brigantine if must have quite made up mind if a fully expected captain mendouca have run alongside that ship afternoon must board with rest then join british crew in defence of own ship be perhaps just a well then for sir for too that matter be arranged different answered simpson because if thing have come off a planned suppose that joinin ' of other side must have made that much difference that 'd have beat off skipper lot if have 'd fallen alive into hand of skipper 'd have well know what must have done to be mortal sure that must have be alive now perhaps sir have be thinkin ' a have that even now may be too late to do somethin yes said have while have be talking to multitude of idea have thronged through mind disconnected vague certainly still capable perhaps of being worked into shape mind admitting to simpson that proposal to join in attempt may be disposed to make simplifies matter great deal most important factor in problem before be how will yonder ship be dealt with when francesca people have done with will be destroyed will be left with unfortunate passenger most probably with knowledge whatever of nautical matter to drift about at mercy of wind sea to take chance of being fallen in with to founder in first gale of wind happens to come way sir no answered simpson may take oath that captain mendouca wo run risk of leavin ' afloat to be picked up took into port where passenger must tell what tale liked about doin will be scuttled sir left to go down with passenger in same a unfortunit ' portugee brig be that took slave out of have be thinkin ' sir even so two sailor men like might do good deal with help of gentleman passenger to put together sort of raft must hold hand of keep above water until somethin come along pick up of course know quite well that will be mighty poor look out for strongest of dreadful bad time for poor woman folk to be obliged to take to raft expect 'd rather do take chance of bein picked up than go down with ship if be willin ' to face job be too sir there be hand on took fellow proffered hand grasped warmly be good fellow simpson true british seaman past may have be said accept proposal can see be made in perfect good faith now seems to that that have to do in first place be to get on board yonder ship question be how be to be done without knowledge of of francesca people well sir said simpson think a there will be great difficulty about so far a be concerned think there need be much with neither if must mind changing rig shiftin ' into togs of mine so a chap of francesca wo recognise then when next boat come from ship will tumble down into offer to give two of others spell will be only too glad of chance to get little relief from job of pullin backwards for'ards handlin ' of lot of stuff once aboard ship can stow out of sight until leave for good very well said seems a good plan a will try let have of old clothes simpson flannel shirt pair of canvas trouser will do will shift into at once there be thing occurs to if must manage to secure little further help must be so much better now if be not mistaken good many of crew of yonder ship joined francesca afternoon a only mean of saving life must get hold of few of if can by mean of few judicious question find out whether must be willing to throw in lot with take chance of ultimate escape rather than become slaver pirate with only dozen stout willing seaman great deal might be done to better state of affair generally be right sir must make lot of difference will see what can be done answered simpson now sir will go get togs s'pose that do might a well be done at once certainly said sooner better can see object in delaying movement now that have determined upon definite plan right sir then here go answered simpson will be back with dud in jiffey simpson jiffey proved to be pretty long one for be fully twenty minute before returned with clothes thin flannel shirt have seen best day be so faded from original colour so thoroughly stained with tar grease that be difficult to say what that original colour have be be therefore so much better suited to purpose of disguise pair of equally faded dungaree trouser knitted worsted cap delay have not be profitless for happening to find in forecastle two of crew of bangalore who have be compelled to join francesca who from dejected appearance conjectured be not altogether pleased satisfied with arrangement entered into conversation with soon contrived to elicit from that conjecture be well founded thereupon a there be time to lose took bold course of asking outright whether in event of there being scheme afoot on part of others to escape from brigantine to ship must be disposed to join in to replied that must gladly that indeed have be discussing possibility of such attempt when interrupted by descent into forecastle be enough for simpson who at once brought aft to finding fully in earnest in expressed desire to have nothing to do with pirate forthwith unfolded plan to carefully directing attention to somewhat desperate aspect of adventure at same time pointing out to that additional seaman whose help must secure added very materially to chance of successful issue what said seemed only to render more determined to sever brief connection with pirate at cost unhesitatingly declared readiness to join to implicitly obey order more than informed that there be others of bangalore crew who be sure must be equally ready with if permitted to take part in adventure consented to hunt up a many of men a possible at once to have ready to meet on forecastle to discus matter in quarter of hour scheme prior to conversation with simpson have be of most vague nebulous character have now taken shape wore so promising appearance felt sanguine of ultimate success so without further ado retired right aft to wheel grating that part of brigantine being now quite deserted wrapped in total darkness save for dim diffused light issued from cabin skylight there unseen shifted into clothes that simpson have brought be not particularly comfortable quite so well savoured a must have wished be time for ultra squeamishness be soon transformed into very colourable imitation of fo cbe'le hand done went forward past open hatchway down plunder from bangalore be being struck noticing with bitter distress anger forlorn dejected worn out despairing attitude of unfortunate black closely huddled together on slave deck form faintly indicated in yellow smoky light of lantern men be working by noticing too with keen satisfaction that most of crew have reached that stage of intoxication wherein victim whole attention be required for conduct of own affair with none to spare for of others many have gone considerably beyond stage be staggering about pulling hauling aimlessly at first object that must lay hand upon proving far more of hindrance than help to le intoxicated comrade while there be who have reached final stage of bestiality be lying about deck in helpless condition of drunken stupor nothing more favourable for scheme than condition of general intoxication must possibly have happened unless be that pedro be below fully occupied in attending to father be therefore le likely to discover absence from brigantine until must be too late to take step toward investigation of phenomenon therefore hurried to rendezvous with sudden feeling of elation joyousness confidence in conviction that time of release from exceedingly uncongenial disagreeable if not absolutely hopeless situation have at length arrived upon reaching forecastle head appointed spot of rendezvous found tenantless presently man came lounging up to from group of worker about hatchway after peering into face inquired got 'baccy about mate be down below in chest have unlashed yet if have got just give chaw will ye maybe will do a much for time be sorry to say have not answered use except in form of cigar now then expect mate simpson on deck moment have doubt that will be able to accommodate be one of new hand shipped from bangalore be not seem to remember having seen face before perhaps not be precious little can see now must think unless have got cat eye can see in dark be somewhat surly response yes continued be joe maxwell late carpenter of bangalore well yes shipped ' be word suppose pray who may be buck with dandified talk to mind be about a like fo cbe'le lingo that ever heard a chalk be like cheese be hand aboard dashin ' rover of same kidney a scarcely think a seem to have already have opportunity of judging answered laughingly a glanced in direction of hatchway continued determined to sound forthwith a speech manner seemed to indicate that be by mean satisfied with changed lot be naval officer prisoner suppose must call although a see have liberty of ship now having told thus much must like to tell candidly maxwell did join afternoon of own free will under compulsion man looked at searchingly for moment then said well suppose when man be asked straightforward question best plan be to give straightfor'ard answer so mister mind tellin ' that j'ined because be obliged to 't be that walk along short plank in fact joined merely to save life suggested ay pretty much a may have done be answer exclaimed surely good fellow mean to say that imagine naval officer to have joined crew of thief murderer blest if know care fellow answered roughly only if be naval officer a say have joined thief murderer a call must like to know how come to be rigged like fo cbe'le jack saw that man be suspicious of perhaps thought be endeavouring for purpose of espionage to fathom real feeling with regard to service into have be pressed saw moreover that conjecture be correct that despite cautious reply be by mean satisfied with arrangement so determined to be frank with at once tell contemplated invite to join a carpenter of bangalore must be especially valuable acquisition to party accordingly did so before have finished have satisfaction of seeing that suspicion have completely disappeared that be listening to intently respectfully when have brought disclosure proposition to end at once said be with sir heart soul anything even raft will be better than thievin murderin hooker cut throat crew yes sir be with for life death please god will be life not death for hand of let get away aboard at once sir be just longin ' to tread beauty plank again a to scuttlin ' why will make first business when get aboard to shape out few plug take 'em down into run with be only place where will be able to get at under water plankin ' a soon a have gone will plug up hole so that will be a tight a bottle never penny worse for what little be likely to do to must please precious sight better to knock out brain of dare to go down below to do scuttlin business said must never do man must be missed search must be instituted heaven only know what consequence must be no scuttling must be allowed to proceed pirate must finally leave ship with conviction that be slowly surely sinking if go well craft will be out of sight before morning then once clear of will have leisure to make plan carry out right be sir right be answered maxwell will have to be skipper now sir for poor capt'n mason three of mate be gone one on mr king killed in scrimmage t'others made to walk plank so will be only navigator that can muster among lot of a well a 'riginator of here scheme for gettin ' better of here spaniard so be fittest properest person to take charge that have got to do sir be to give order will answer for a will be obeyed chapter seventeen escape from brigantine at moment simpson rejoined bringing with three more of bangalore crew while be talking to other two men whom simpson have previously discovered came forward from hatchway where have be lending hand to strike booty down into hold informed that have found spoken to eight of shipmate at work at gangway hatchway of whom be quite ready more than willing to join at moment when signal must be given little further inquiry elicited information that party now comprised survivor of bangalore crew who have so to speak made virtue of necessity shipped under mendouca in order to save life there being four others who have shipped willingly whom have therefore be deemed inexpedient to approach with proposal to join lest in zeal for new chief must refuse betray party therefore be now complete remained to be done be to carry out plan with a little delay a possible with twelve men at back felt tolerably confident of success indeed when first learned full strength wild idea flashed through mind of attempting not only to save bangalore also to capture francesca moment reflection however convinced of impracticability of scheme for although with assistance of ten male passenger who learned be at moment prisoner in own cabin on board indiaman might be possible to capture francesca in then disorganised condition of crew must certainly involve loss of life on side must not spare must be able to hing with when have whole available strength being hardly sufficient to handle take care of ship must come on to blow much le to look after prize a well therefore abandoned idea more readily that knew story need only be told to proper authority to cause brigantine to be hunted off ocean atrocity put end to at once for arrangement therefore be soon made done sauntered away to hatchway singly by two at time began to lend hand in getting plunder out of boat sending below presently bangalore long boat came alongside loaded down to gunwale with booty manned by dozen spaniard who be so drunk that must scarcely stand one of indeed must have lost life for simpson maxwell for boat be steered alongside stem on shock of collision with brigantine completely upset balance of man who be standing in bow to fend off so that fell overboard between boat brigantine side fellow be partially sobered by sudden immersion finding overboard began at once to sing out lustily for help fully aware that there be probably several shark still hanging about two vessel momentarily expecting to feel teeth whereupon simpson maxwell of whom happened to be at gangway at moment of accident sprang down into boat succeeded in dragging fellow safely out of water though not moment too soon water being swirl with rush of sea monster a man be dragged inboard fright that have received completely sobered at same time so thoroughly shook nerve that at once scrambled on board brigantine declaring with many oath that have have enough of boating for one night mate be little better be glad enough to leave boat at suggestion allow party to take place quickly roused boat cargo out of then shoved off for ship again making great fuss splash with oar a did so when few fathom away from brigantine however where in darkness movement be not likely to attract too curious attention first one oar then be laid in until have be laid in one one shifted aft sculling boat with not to bangalore larboard gangway at other boat be working under ship stern to starboard mizen channel where made fast cautiously scrambled up on to poop one by one here separated carpenter boldly making way forward past noisy jabbering drunken crowd who be grouped about main hatchway engaged in hoisting on deck good that boatswain down in hold be selecting from ship heterogeneous cargo while rest excepting simpson quietly stole up mizen rigging three of concealing in top while rest continuing on up topmast rigging made for main foretop by way of stay lantern be being used to light pirate at work about main hatchway so effectually dazzling drunken ruffian eye that there be not slightest fear of of silent sober figure stealthily moving about aloft being seen by indeed so deep be gloom created between mast by towering expanse of indiaman canvas even far away a be from dazzling light of lantern be unable to follow with eye dusky indistinctly seen figure further than rim of mizen top a for simpson be quite possible for to move freely about ship go wherever pleased without exciting suspicion being one of francesca regular crew therefore instructed to go down into saloon ascertain whether of quondam shipmate be there to return to with information a speedily a possible while be gone have time to look about little note such of most prominent characteristic of ship a be to be seen by dim light of star be noble craft a big a generality of first class frigate though not quite so beamy perhaps in proportion to length not quite so high out of water of course not so heavily rigged carried magnificent full poop reached a far forward a to within about twenty five foot of main mast with companion skylight deck fitting generally poop ladder of polished teak handsomely elaborately carved fore part of poop extended six foot beyond cabin front underneath steering wheel be placed with door on side of giving access to grand saloon long row of hencoop ran along side of poop deck be further littered with large number of deck chair have be hurriedly bundled out of way behind companion probably when be seen that brigantine undoubtedly meant to attack main deck exhibited confusion incidental to sea fight gun sixteen twelve pound carronades still unsecured with rammer sponge flung down on deck beside shot lying in scupper overturned wadding tub cutlass pistol boarding pike strewed over deck horrible sight several dark silent figure lying stark still in pool of blood just a have fallen in fight ship davit be empty gig having be lowered to facilitate transfer of plunder to brigantine long boat also be in water a already stated there be two fine cutter lying bottom up over quarter deck stern resting on break of poop bow on gallows be strange sight to look abroad into dusky star lit night observe boundless atlantic stretching silent still on hand then to turn one eye inboard note noisy drunken ruffianly rabble grouped about hatchway naked to waist toiling in dim lantern light at tackle by be hoisting bale of costly merchandise out of hold have not much time to devote to moralising upon incongruous sight for after absence of three minute simpson re appeared from saloon with information that place be clear that judging from sound have heard passenger have locked be locked into cabin being case determined to go below make brief investigation of condition of unfortunate passenger a well a to afford such comfort a be to be derived from communication to of intention accordingly descended companion way leading down from poop found in small vestibule arrangement of must not very well see a be unlighted save for lamplight issued from open door of saloon caught glimpse however of polished panel of rare ornamental wood with gleam of gilded moulding polished metal handrail found foot sinking into pile of soft thick carpet gave hint a to luxurious appointment of ship from vestibule passed into saloon by partially open door on port side at once found in exceedingly handsome luxuriously furnished apartment be long rather narrow in proportion having state room on side a must tell at glance by door with venetian slatted upper panel occurred at regular interval in longitudinal bulkhead on side of cabin bulkhead be divided into panel by fluted pilaster with richly carved gilded capital supporting heavily carved cornice picked out with gold panel pilaster be enamelled in delicate tint of cream with moulding picked out in french grey former being decorated with very handsome painting illustrative of oriental view scenery richly upholstered divan occupied space along bulkhead between several state room door long table of polished mahogany having sofa seat with reversible back on side of stretched down

for must catch gleam of light issuing from pierced upper panel of of sound of occasional sob moan told that at least of be occupied located one of cabin from sound came tapped gently at door there be response sound instantly ceased tapped again said will open door please be friend have intelligence to communicate may be interesting to still response from next cabin there now issued man voice inquiring do hear one out there proclaiming friend yes answered be friend present object be to communicate to intelligence that hope may prove agreeable comforting be quite alone unarmed may therefore open cabin door without fear sir replied voice know not who be how come to be on board most ill starred ship voice however have reassuring tone in must risk opening door to if must can not for like rest of passenger believe be bound absolutely helpless think that if will take trouble to try will find that be locked in pray who be sir how did find way on board bangalore be pirate gone yet said a tried door found that be indeed locked regret to say that be not therefore be for present obliged to leave in uncomfortable situation take comfort believe that will not be for one moment longer than can help pirate be unlikely to very much prolong stay now a soon a be at safe distance will come again release provided of course that plan go amiss name be dugdale be naval officer midshipman who have be unfortunate enough to fall into hand of pirate in unsuccessful attack upon more than month ago be first opportunity have have to attempt escape must go again now a discovery on board here by pirate must mean utter ruin to will return a soon a can with prudence meanwhile slightly raising voice so that might hear take comfort hope for best good bye heaven bless prosper fervently ejaculated unknown a moved away from door thought heard faint murmur of similar import from of other cabin must not be certain a one of outer door giving direct access to main deck suddenly opened have to make dash of for dark vestibule in order to reach concealment of still darker companion way to avoid detection alarm be groundless however for newcomer proved to be joe carpenter whom saw enter saloon after careful reconnaissance of interior with several plug under one arm maul in hand seeing who be followed unexpectedly ran against a be again coming out who oh be sir beg pardon be sure thought be one of sneakin ' pirate chap prowlin round exclaimed thought heard sound o ' sort a comed in from deck think be one o ' cowardly villain have sneaked aft for purpose of own ai no good dare swear will just see what scoundrel up to if be after anything very houtragis will maybe take liberty of smashin ' skull with here maul droppin ' over starn to shark where many better man than went a'ternoon lucky for that be sir a irishman say be just goin ' to make way down into run so a to be handy for pluggin ' up hole again that here murderin ' thief intends to bore through dear old gal skin think will be pretty sure to come aft to do will either be there down in fore peak where 'd have to shovel away lot of coal to get at below water line so expect will make for run now sir be very good job a met just here because can show lazarette hatch here be under foot turned back large mat upon be standing disclosing small square hatch flush with deck now sir continued will be off below at once because from what saw a comed aft fancy spanish thief be thinkin ' about toppin boom if so have time to spare there a raised hatch dropped through opening be right now sir can make way well enough without light though have got candle match in pocket that will give light enough to work by a soon a villain have cleared out now sir please put on hatch again will ye forget to spread mat over when blackguard have gone can send somebody to let out all right maxwell never fear will see to answered a man disappeared in gloom good luck to fellow may do be sure that keep silent attempt to interfere with let do work go away a soon a hear hatch close after go ahead plug hole a quickly a like be sure that make thorough job of ay ay sir came reply already muffled by distance intervening cask case among be making way may trust for carefully replaced hatch adjusted mat over made way cautiously up on poop be evident from what now saw that maxwell be only just in time for pirate have knocked off work be coming up out of hold refreshing a emerged by copious draught from tub of strong grog stood on deck conveniently near hatchway be pretty far gone in state of intoxication be singing jumble of at least dozen forecastle ditty in tone of maudlin sentiment laughing jeering at nothing in particular a reeled staggered about deck disgusting a be sight be glad to see for felt that men in condition must never notice absence of simpson from brigantine still le that of unaccustomed face of of bangalore crew who have joined be now snugly concealed aloft be capable of doing very much more mischief unless perchance must accidentally set ship on fire be what most greatly dreaded if happily escaped danger might yet be well for felt convinced that once on board brigantine again unhappy negro once more set to sweep nearly man in accursed craft forecastle must betake to hammock stay there until morning there be of course risk that mendouca might send for ask to look after vessel for through night knowing guessing a must condition of crew did not believe that must at least not so soon after perpetration of such fearful atrocity a have openly committed that afternoon men having helped freely from grog tub until seemed that must take more tumbled rather than scrambled down into boat alongside be just beginning to cherish hope that after must go away forgetting to scuttle ship when saw jose boatswain who appeared to have assumed command of party seize detain only man except who still remained on ship deck said something to man then staggered away forward lost sight of in deep shadow enshrouded fore part of ship be gone about ten minute then re appeared boatswain armed with large auger a passed main hatchway on way aft jose seized one of still lighted lantern be standing on deck seemed to direct companion to take man did continuing way aft pair entered saloon from main deck presently peering cautiously down through open skylight saw that two ruffian be groping about under cabin table doubt searching for lazarette hatch search be of course in vain at length overheard boatswain assert with oath that be useless to search for longer must get steward out of pantry make show where be then left saloon there be silence for few minute then going to head of companion ladder heard jose demanding in broken english with profusion of expletive where be opening of lazarette strange voice replied in trembling tone then heard mat flung back hatch wrenched off with clatter few more oath followed there be scrambling sound concluded that two miscreant have descended to performance of dastardly task then ensued what seemed like very long although be actually comparatively short period of anxious suspense for completely successful a have be thus far absence from brigantine might easily be discovered at moment in case there be alternative for between fighting to death ignominious surrender be more anxious on own behalf than on of others for absence be scarcely likely to be noted by drunken comrade until next morning while a for must mendouca take into head to require presence must sooner be reported to be not to be found than must have very shrewd suspicion of what have happened felt convinced that with knowledge of enormity that have perpetrated on dreadful day must never willingly suffer to escape from alive then there be pedro too lad have for inscrutable reason taken violent fancy for although have not very frequently referred to in telling of story have attached to with almost fidelity of dog sharing in watch seizing opportunity to be in company must find at liberty to seek must be lost for must not be content until have found there be just two chance in favour against many adverse possibility first being that mendouca condition must confine lad to side through night second lying in fact have taken precaution to lock cabin door remove key before leaving brigantine so must chance be sought for might be thought that have locked into cabin in anger at piratical deed have be perpetrated grew increasingly uneasy a minute dragged slow length along expecting moment to hear hail from brigantine inquiring a to whereabouts be therefore with feeling of keen delight at expiration of about twenty five minute when state of suspense have become almost unendurable a stood listening at head of companion way heard jose voice again sound of own companion emergence from lazarette there heard exclaim in spanish in drunken voice with jeering laugh that job be done pretty effectually too suppose will float longer than three hour more four at most then who be to know what have become of will be supposed that foundered in gale will be end of matter be pity miguel that must be obliged to destroy so fine ship must never be of use to necessity have law know now let consider there be one thing more to be done before leave what be be in mind moment ago ah yes of course be have to put miserable poltroon of steward back into pantry lock door upon yes be think come along amigo heard steward begging piteously not to be locked up again for although fellow have probably not understood single word of what jose have said have sense enough to know that two ruffian before have scuttled ship that if locked up in pantry again must probably drown there like rat in trap entreaty however be of course unavailing with two men who knew not meaning of mercy there be spanish oath two sound of scuffle mingled with further cry of distress from steward slamming of door sharp click of lock moment later jose companion emerged upon deck staggered to gangway scrambled down side boat be shoved off waited until boat be fairly away from ship side then slipping down dark companion way groped about until have found pantry unlocked to find unhappy steward bound hand foot prostrate on deck weeping bitterly in reply to question told where must lay hand upon knife finding cut adrift directed to go forward to forecastle to ascertain whether of crew be imprisoned down there then making way to still open lazarette swung down into called maxwell name a loudly a dared heard answered at once rascal have left ship cried so may ram plug home a tightly a can perhaps even venture to give gentle tap two must leave final driving until brigantine have moved off everything have gone right thus far will never do to spoil now by being impatient have taken in much water not more than can pump out of in ten minute be reply a sighted creeping toward along narrow space underneath beam only bored five hole through have already plugged tight enough to stop water from comin ' in though of course will want few good tap on head to make secure that job can wait until brigantine be mile two further away have difficulty in plugging hole asked a honest joe emerged into more open space about hatchway not bit sir answered see way of be a soon a got to understand that be likely to scuttle ship first thing say to myself be wonder ' say what size auger murderin ' scoundrel be likely to use because if only knowed must make plug to fit hole then next thing thought be that prob'ly must remember to bring tool aboard with 'em that 'd hunt for some'at of sort aboard here so go to cabin get out inch half auger chisel hammer nail place 'em on tarpaulin of fore hatch where anybody going for'ard must help seein ' of 'em there ' say to myself if feller have brought no auger aboard with 'em be tool will use ' so chanced made plug to fit inch half hole a turned out be right used auger what have left for a soon a back be turned slipped down screwed plug into hole excellent said now maxwell next job be to break open state room release poor lady gentleman who be confined there do think can do without making much noise lord bless yes sir be cheerful reply will just go for'ard get bit of wire will pick lock of cabin door in next to time make noise about then come along let get done at once must be first job said chapter eighteen re appearance of francesca while maxwell stole forward to get wire crept up on poop again carefully avoiding skylight so that figure might not be revealed by coloured ray streamed from found that boat with jose companion last of plunder be just going alongside brigantine first to scramble out of be jose there be light enough about brigantine deck to enable to see that went straight aft to companion descended be absent from deck very few minute however when re appeared supposed that have be below to make report to mendouca to receive individual order for a passed along deck heard shout to crew now then look alive there with bale get deck clear a quickly a possible so that can get nigger on deck sweep at work once more have got that can take from englishman now sooner be off better for wo float above two three hour longer if breeze be to spring up bring cruiser along with must be bad for if be found in neighbourhood so bundle bale down hatchway anyhow men clear deck at once must stow good properly afterwards be excellent very much better than have expected for dreadful idea have suggested to that mendouca might take into head to remain by ship until must show unmistakable sign of sinking in case there must be nothing for fight short handed a be must not suit book at men on board francesca woke up little at jose order soon have last boat unloaded deck clear slave be then ordered on deck bangalore boat cast adrift sweep rigged out with think most fervent emotion of gratitude delight have ever experienced at length have satisfaction of seeing brigantine stir sluggishly against background of star spangled heaven turn bow slightly away from finally glide off with quiet gentle scarcely perceptible motion in westerly direction while be still watching caught sight of maxwell creeping along deck from forward under shelter of bulwark so that light from still burning lantern that pirate have left behind might not disclose moving figure to of eye on board francesca might be turned upon ship making way down companion joined in vestibule entered cabin together led straight to door of state room with occupant of have previously held short conversation directed maxwell to open at same time knocking upon panel saying sir be happy to inform that pirate have at length left be about to make attempt to release thank god for fervently ejaculated voice have not heard before be a quick a can pray for fear that poor husband here be dead dying must be attended to without moment delay be mr maynard voice exclaimed carpenter a worked away with wire know well

upon ship be inevitable be after fight be over that be severely stabbed in resisting attempt on part of one of francesca crew to force open daughter cabin probably poor man must have be murdered outright for opportune appearance of mendouca who sternly ordered one of men out of cabin except two whom personally supervised a executed order to bind survivor hand foot confine in cabin luckily for unfortunate passenger first thought of men have be drink second plunder by time that two appetite have be satisfied thought of further violence have passed out of head first thing now to be done be to find ship surgeon if be still alive so leaving maxwell in cuddy to continue lock picking operation sallied out on deck first softly calling to men aloft that might now venture to come down hunted up steward inquired of whether knew where surgeon be to be found answered that surgeon purser three mate be berthed in after house between main mast main hatch probably man wanted must be found there

therefore brigantine have by time reached tolerably safe distance of mile from sent down into run again to drive plug well home make perfectly secure set to work with steward to release remaining passenger from exceedingly uncomfortable condition be not long task when be completed found that mustered nine gentleman of whom three be wounded eleven lady three child two boy girl seven maid indian ayah nurse one family consisting of lady daughter be in dreadful state of distress husband father mr richard temple resident magistrate of one of up country district having be shot dead while gallantly fighting in defence of ship rest be in fairly good spirit now that found that there be hope of ultimate escape from peril have so unexpectedly beset for learned that although personal baggage have be rifled money jewellery taken have be spared further outrage than of being bound with unnecessary cruel rigour confined to cabin poor soul have be without food drink since tiffin thought therefore that must not be amiss to set down to good meal with object directed steward to find mate also cook if possible appearing that none of individual named have be seen during since attack gave rise to suspicion that have contrived to conceal somewhere about ship proved to be case cook with mate three under steward being eventually discovered in disused pig sty under topgallant forecastle carefully concealed beneath lot of lumber that have dragged over from secluded retreat be speedily routed out being solemnly assured that danger be now past be at length prevailed upon to resume duty to prepare long delayed dinner supper a might be more appropriately called for cuddy occupant when at meal be served took liberty of occupying poor murdered captain seat at table while be eating drinking managed to gain pretty clear idea of incident of attack upon bangalore one having passed through more le trying experience be anxious to relate to rest when meal be over mr molyneux calcutta merchant rose to foot while formally thanking on behalf of fellow passenger for what have already done expressed perfect concurrence in wish of surviving crew must take command of ship merely suggesting great desirability of navigating forthwith to nearest civilised port of course be own fixed intention suggested sierra leone a most suitable spot for to make being a near a other with advantage that necessary officer to navigate ship home sufficient number of men to make up full complement of crew might almost certainly be reckoned upon being found there brigantine have left with departure everybody appeared to consider danger a past however be opinion by mean shared for knowing mendouca so well a did felt that be by mean unlikely that having reached offing of ten twelve mile might order sweep to be laid in until daylight in order that might remain in neighbourhood assure by actual demonstration of own pedro eyesight that bangalore have foundered taking with to bottom evidence of atrocious crime of crew have be guilty even must uncomfortable doubt on point assail must learn ere lapse of many hour others be missing then guessing a must at once at explanation of absence nothing must prevent from returning taking attempting to take such measure a must insure eternal silence therefore considered singular if not actually providential occurrence that when went out on deck after dinner supper sky must have become overcast with scarcely star to be seen with appearance of wind rain ere long have become exceedingly dark so much so that sign of brigantine be to be discovered by listening intently roll clatter of sweep be still to be caught be with very deep fervent thankfulness that after listening intently for several minute felt convinced that be still receding from have given strict order that lantern must be allowed to remain burning on deck just a pirate have left that other light must be kindled anywhere about ship except where be possible to effectually mask light that one must show anything of above level of topgallant rail upon consideration now brigantine having be gone from rather more than two hour gave instruction that lantern on deck light of kind visible from outside ship might be simultaneously extinguished so that must anybody happen to be watching light might come to conclusion that ship have filled be gone to bottom done mustered entire crew first hoisting in long boat sent aloft to stow lighter sail so that might not be wholly unprepared must change of weather now seemed impending be ushered in with squall occupied men full hour half at end of having brought ship into tolerably manageable condition gave permission to lie down snatch nap if must to hold ready for emergency might arise be by time long past midnight so pitchy dark that light having be extinguished be impossible to see one end of poop from other star have vanished silence be so profound a to be quite oppressive not even sound of pirate sweep now being audible though whether have be laid in whether vessel have increased distance so greatly a to have passed beyond range of sound knew not strongly suspected former contingency profound silence be maintained for nearly hour then hearing rendered unusually acute doubt by intense darkness enveloped once more became conscious of regular measured rhythmical sound sound of sweep again being plied without doubt on board francesca what did mean have mendouca in feverish painful condition grown impatient of delay ordered sweep to be again manned after having given instruction for to be laid in a foreboding whispered to have absence of myself others be already discovered be brigantine returning in search of for first quarter of hour so after sound have once again broken in upon silence be question very difficult to decide when hour have passed fact be indisputable that pirate be returning for sound have become distinctly clearer stronger than have at first be what be now to be done there be one course for namely to take possible measure for defence of ship to last gasp for felt assured must mendouca recover possession of fury at trick that have played must be sated by nothing short of absolute destruction having quickly made up mind upon point be in act of groping way along poop with object of calling men when thought felt faint stirring of air pausing for moment moistened back of hand held up turning way that until felt distinct sensation of coolness yes there be doubt about have felt cat paw seemed to be coming over starboard quarter while sound of sweep be away broad on port bow must scarcely restrain cheer a hope of breeze thus came to encourage at very moment when new terrible danger be threatening paused for instant reflected thought took somewhat shape if mendouca be returning undoubtedly be be because through unfortunate combination of circumstance absence have already be discovered have at once jumped to correct conclusion have somehow contrived to escape from brigantine to ship know well enough to feel assured that once here will not tamely allow indiaman to go down under foot if must prove unpreventible that will at least release prisoner concoct with plan of escape such a taking to boat constructing raft also know that in case must succeed in preserving life until be fallen in with picked up atrocious act of piracy murder will be proclaimed craft in squadron will be specially ordered to keep look out for effect capture at hazard therefore will spare effort to find ship destroy now ah there be little breath of wind felt distinctly that time must fail to find what course will pursue why will certainly expect to make way northward for sierra leone most probably port that have already determined to steer for will do best to overtake recapture therefore best course will obviously be to head to southward thus increase distance between two craft a rapidly a possible so that may be out of sight of other at daybreak then to proceed upon proper course under easy sail seemed to to be very fair sound line of reasoning determined to act upon forthwith accordingly made way forward routed out men told there be breeze coming ordered to brace up yard trim sheet aft for close hauled stretch on port tack at same time cautioning to work silently a have only too much reason to fear that pirate be returning to search for ship news confirmed a be by now perfectly audible sound of sweep be enough for went about deck so silently speaking in whisper carefully taking rope off belaying pin laying down on deck instead of flinging down with clatter enough to wake seven sleeper be certain one in cabin even have be awake must possibly have be aware of what be happening by time that have got canvas trimmed breeze have become quite perceptible ship have gathered steerage way therefore wore round presently have ineffable satisfaction of hearing slight distinct tinkling gurgle of water under bow with springing up of most welcome little breeze sound of sweep first became by imperceptible degree le audible then be lost altogether whether arose from fact that wind carried sound away from whether be that have laid in sweep be making sail upon brigantine be impossible to tell did greatly care provided that breeze freshened sufficiently to carry out of sight before daybreak now being great anxiety maxwell assured that bangalore be real clipper easily beating everything that have fallen in with on passage out on homeward voyage ship can sail fast without fair amount of wind so far breeze have come to be mere breathing just enough perhaps to waft along at speed of about two knot two half maybe whereas what wanted be at least seven knot breeze must take clean out of sight of starting point before dawn for knew that if bangalore be clipper so too be francesca if people once caught sight of so much a head of royal from own royal yard must chase a long a there be slightest hope of overhauling knowledge of fact made wonder whether have not acted rather imprudently in stowing lighter sail instead of leaving abroad to give help of be capable be just inwardly debating point have arrived at conclusion that ought to set again when atmosphere seemed suddenly to grow more dense in moment down came rain in regular tropical deluge like bursting of waterspout sail flapped to mast be becalmed again be horribly vexatious not to say disheartening happily for peace of mind be state of thing did not last long merely meant shift of wind for presently when shower have ceased a abruptly a have begun breeze sprang up again time coming out from northward with gay thankful heart squared away before rather headed just far enough to eastward of south to permit everything set to draw properly moreover breeze gradually steadily freshened until in about hour from time when ship first began to move be going seven knot at very least be so far satisfactory especially a sky remained overcast night intensely dark rendering utterly impossible to see anything beyond distance of three four of ship length on hand now have good hope of running brigantine out of sight before daylight that be still engaged in search for however soon became evident for about three quarter of hour after springing up of true breeze attention be suddenly attracted by outburst of brilliant glare of bluish white light on port quarter be nothing le than brigantine burning port fire probably in attempt to discover whereabouts by reflection of light on sail possibly in expectation of catching sight by mean of light of boat raft perhaps hen coop grating two floating about a evidence of having gone down however be about five mile distant from at time although light of port fire rendered perfectly visible to have little fear that must betray whereabouts to people remained dodging about occasionally burning port fire for fully hour by time have sunk to foreyard below horizon a viewed from deck then a discontinued pyrotechnic display lost sight of at daybreak sent man right up to main royal yard where remained until light be thoroughly strong then came down with report that horizon be clear be highly satisfactory inasmuch a confirmed hope that if mendouca be still prosecuting search for a felt sure be having of course failed to discover evidence of ship having foundered be looking for in northerly direction very probably cracking on in belief that have gone way that there be still chance of overtaking at eight bell in morning watch brought ship to wind on larboard tack with head about east north east then divided scanty crew into two watch with joe maxwell carpenter a chief mate very smart ab named tom sutcliffe a second done watch be set put to job of straightening up generally pumping out ship latter job being accomplished pump sucking in just under ten minute maxwell have allowed for be clear therefore hull be sound in respect at event with best rather worst intention in world pirate have done little harm most serious difficulty be want of water mendouca having literally cleared ship of drop possessed save eight ten gallon in scuttle butt have overlooked perhaps have considered not worth taking here again appeared a though god in infinite mercy have taken compassion on for about wind died away have only just time to take meridian observation for latitude when heaven clouded over toward close of afternoon be visited by terrific thunderstorm accompanied by perfect deluge of rain during by loosely spreading awning fore aft be enabled to catch sufficient quantity of water to carry without stint a far at least a sierra leone remained calm until about midnight when little breeze sprang up from eastward enabled to lay course nicely while fanned along at speed of about five knot next morning broke bright clear with first of light look out reported sail broad on weather bow maxwell fearing that might be old enemy francesca showing up again came down at once called stating fear causing to rush up on poop just a have sprung from cot quite regardless of appearance although must scarcely believe that mendouca if indeed must be so unfortunate a to fall in with again must make appearance in eastern board must confess however that when first reached deck beheld stranger experienced slight qualm of apprehension for craft be undoubtedly square rigged forward at least be steering a straight a hair for with studding sail set on side coming down very fast few minute work with telescope however sufficed to remove apprehension so far at least a francesca be concerned for a light grew brighter be enabled to discern that stranger be brig a continued working away with glass vessel seemed to assume familiar aspect a though have seen before at first thought that might possibly prove to be spanish brig have be anchored just ahead of off banana peninsula a drew nearer recognised with intense delight that be none other than dear old barracouta herself with appearance thought trouble be ended for doubtless captain stopford will not only lend men enough to carry ship to sierra leone will also escort thither chapter nineteen to congo again upon special mission there be very great delight manifested fore aft when be able to announce that be british man o ' war be bearing down upon for hand felt like that have only to state recent experience to secure protection at least until arrival in safer water there be one exception to however in person of simpson who sooner learned true character of strange sail than came aft told story in brief be to effect that have originally belonged to navy have deserted out of affection for mendouca who have shown great kindness when individual chose to shake off allegiance abjure country now of course dreaded nothing so much a recognition seizure for not only be deserter have also be guilty of taking active part in more than one deed of piracy perpetrated by chief therefore implored to let keep below out of sight during presence of man o ' war clearly meant to speak also to omit mention of reference to in narrative of own personal adventure readily promised to do for although be fully conscious that in making such promise be screening individual who have most seriously transgressed law of country must not help feeling that have also contributed in very important degree toward saving of bangalore on board considered that to very great extent made amends for past misdeed although be quite probable that if be arraigned for judge might not take quite a lenient view of case there be however for might never have succeeded in effecting escape from francesca in case bangalore on board must have gone to bottom therefore felt fully justified in promising to afford protection lay in power when brig be within mile of hoisted british colour fired gun for to heave to of course at once did displaying ensign at mizen peak at same time lady gentleman in cuddy learning from steward what be happening at once turned out to do honour to occasion so that when few minute later barracouta with studding sail collapsing coming in together rounded to within biscuit toss of weather quarter poop must have presented animated appearance a beautiful craft swept gracefully yet with rush up into wind figure recognised with delight a of young beloved first luff sprang on to hammock rail with speaking trumpet in hand next moment have raised to lip be hailing ship ahoy what ship be that bangalore eighty two day out from calcutta bound to london plundered two day ago by pirate hope be none worse for boat adventure mr young in attack upon same pirate last week have news to spare for so will lower boat will if can conveniently do so will perhaps be better for be rather short handed replied saw young staring at with eye evidently have not a yet recognised in longshore rig with have be fitted by kindness of one of cuddy passenger raised trumpet to lip began who in name of when saw little freddy pierrepoint scramble up alongside excitedly utterly regardless of etiquette say something eagerly young lowered trumpet stared hard at raised again roared through can be possible that be dugdale harry dugdale that have be mourning a lost ay ay mr young be myself sure enough alive well be thankful to say more glad than can express to see dear old barracouta again a uttered word watch on deck gave ringing cheer thrilled to heart for told better than word how sincerely attached to honest fellow be how delighted to see again although outburst be by mean in accordance with strict discipline young thoroughly good fellow that be never checked a voice died away simply waved trumpet shouted will come on board disappeared behind brig high bulwark short pause now ensued during suspected that first luff be conferring with captain stopford barracouta people gazing curiously at meanwhile through brig open port then sound of boatswain pipe came floating to from brig across tumbling water heard gruff voice bellowing gig away call be followed by slight muffled scurrying of foot gig crew be seen leaping light a figure of india rubber into elegantly moulded craft that hung at brig davit fall be eased away in moment boat light a bubble be dancing upon sparkling blue tumble at brig lee gangway then first lieutenant freddy pierrepoint appeared at head of side ladder latter descending first lieutenant instantly following boat bow be borne off from ship side oar dropped with clean cut into water men bent back a gave way dancing craft came bounding over long surge towards meanwhile on board bangalore have caused side ladder to be shipped rope rove in readiness for lieutenant arrival in few minute freddy be standing on indiaman broad deck greeting with hand grip heartiness of there be mistaking told story a briefly a possible at conclusion young said well must of course let have few men will be few only that will be able to spare for be sorry to say that loss be terribly heavy in boat attack upon friend mendouca le than eight killed twenty three wounded only four of latter having a yet be able to return to duty must however lay case before captain stopford who by way hope will take breakfast with dare say that when learns how very short handed be will strain point to spare dozen men to take ship to sierra leone now suppose introduce to passenger who judging from have be able to see of from here appear to be very pleasant lot of people upon hint led way to poop where by time nearly entire cuddy party have assembled introduced companion in due form in few minute young freddy be surrounded by large party master freddy noticed being mainly composed of younger member of gentler sex who petted made much of juvenile warrior to young gentleman entire content in due time proceeded on board old ship on reaching deck be fully repaid for have gone through by heartiness of greeting received from shipmate one of whom seemed sincerely delighted at finding be still in land of living for a fate must have barracouta have fallen in with felicidad with french schooner mouette in company a prize latter vessel having pursued felicidad out of creek only to find that have caught tartar captured after short determined struggle from barracouta people have learned particular of somewhat disastrous enterprise including news be missing be believed to have be killed in unsuccessful attack upon schooner in creek captain stopford be kindness in reception of commiserating with upon hardship of late adventure heartily congratulating upon escape from francesca saving of indiaman latter of assured must take care to report in proper quarter in such way a must further advancement in service with regard to supplying with men promised to do best that must at young suggestion being one of rather large party that captain have invited to meet at breakfast be arranged must have dozen a fully agreed with that there be just chance that francesca might be at great distance to northward still actively pursuing search for be further arranged must crowd sail for sierra leone in hope of turning table upon mendouca by overtaking in case be to do best to detain until arrival of barracouta upon scene being captain plan to follow at distance of fifteen twenty mile a incentive to expedition doubt incidentally to promotion of capture of francesca captain informed that if managed to accomplish quick run to sierra leone must probably be in time to rejoin felicidad schooner be then at port refitting after engagement with mouette be very grieved to learn that poor ryan although not nearly so severely wounded a have believed be lying in hospital at sierra leone prostrate with bad attack of fever from when barracouta left be greatly feared that must not recover a soon a breakfast be over crew be mustered young picked out for twelve good stout men who be ordered to pas bag down into boat go on board bangalore with most welcome addition to crew having be received made sail packing upon good ship rag must draw barracouta remaining hove to until have placed sufficient distance between although carried on day night indiaman proving such flyer that barracouta people have hand full to keep in sight nothing more be seen of francesca be at length driven to conclusion that failing to find mendouca have resumed voyage at much earlier period than have anticipated reached leone on afternoon of third day after falling in with barracouta there left indiaman after detention of four day sailed for england with full complement made up of officer men of large barque have be wrecked upon coast only week two before supplemented by few out of many white seaman who have be left behind in hospital when ship be ready to sail for home who contrary to general rule have recovered from instead of succumbing to deadly malaria of coast a for found that have arrived most opportunely so far a felicidad be concerned for repair to small hooker be completed a happened on very day of arrival captain stopford very generously offered command of asserting that conduct with regard to indiaman have conclusively demonstrated entire fitness for post that if chose to accept must have anxiety on score of courage discretion ryan poor fellow be contrary to expectation still alive hope be now entertained that might ultimately recover be still so weak that when went to hospital to see be so overcome with emotion at sight of although have be carefully prepared for meeting that burst into

passenger one of whom insisted that owed life to henceforward must regard a dearly cherished friend joined little hooker a commander sailed same afternoon for congo especial mission being to test truth otherwise of mendouca statement respecting fate of sapphire boat crew in event of being true to attempt rescue of of unfortunate people who might perchance be still alive made high land to northward of river mouth about midnight after rather long uneventful passage wind being light river current strong even at considerable distance from entrance then reached in toward land anchored in fourteen fathom at about a many mile from shore where remained rolling tumbling about on heavy swell until sea breeze set in about eight o'clock next morning then hove up mud hook ran in anchoring in

to secure have given matter great deal of careful consideration during passage have at length determined upon course of action seemed to promise most successful result be in accordance with

way up river for first twelve mile so course be same a have followed in memorable expedition to attack chango creek river being up to point about three mile wide with fine deep channel averaging perhaps quarter of width up a far a abreast southern extremity of monpanga island where deep channel terminates average depth of entire stream dwindles to about six fathom for next fourteen mile channel at same time narrowing down to width varying from about two mile to le than mile in part notably at spot where begin to thread devious way among island cumber stream for length of fully thirty mile at distance of about twenty eight mile from shark point by carrying press of sail hugging northern bank keeping a close to shore a little draught of water must permit thus to great extent cheating current contrived to get a far a spot where above mentioned chain of island commences there wind failing toward sunset came to anchor close to southern shore on sand bank in three fathom under lee of large island sheltered from rush of main current there remained night strict anchor watch of course being kept not only to see that schooner did not drive from berth also to guard against possible attack on part of native in spot to inexpressible chagrin be compelled to spend following two day wind blowing down river when blew at little variety being infused into weather by outburst of most terrific thunderstorm brought with perfect hurricane of wind deluge of rain after again got fair wind be able to pursue way for time getting ashore occasionally upon unsuspected sand bank always contriving to heave off again undamaged thanks to fact that be proceeding up stream against current instead of down stream with not to dwell unduly upon incident be exciting enough to although recital of must prove of little interest to reader in way contrived to creep up river hundred twelve mile so that be necessary to bring to matadi town having passed with difficulty avoided two whirlpool on way reaching destination about two bell in afternoon watch on fifth day after leaving banana creek chapter twenty success fate of pirate slaver matadi town be situate a lobo have informed on south bank of stream on sloping side of hill rose rather steeply from water edge scenery of part of river being totally different from of mouth change occurring gradually becoming quite decided about point where chain of island be left behind on traveller upward way for whereas on lower reach of congo be to say for first forty mile so from mouth bank of river be low flat to great extent mangrove lined beyond point tendency be to become higher steeper in place indeed quite precipitous until where now be ground sloped up from river margin to height of fully four hundred foot for most part densely covered with bush interspersed here there with mass of noble forest tree matadi town be situate a have said upon sloping hillside constituted south bank of river consisted of four five hundred building arranged with tolerable regularity on side of two broad street road crossed other at right angle point of intersection being spacious square in centre of stood circular structure with high peaked pointed roof of thatch that lobo informed be fetish house be greatly surprised at neatness skill displayed in construction of building in important town for while be insignificant in size a compared with dwelling of civilised race being about size of small two roomed cottage such a may be found in almost rural district in england be very considerably larger more carefully substantially built than hut that have noticed in king plenty town when made disastrous attack upon mendouca consort there be even certain attempt at ornamentation discernible in larger structure many of have what believe be called in england barge board elaborately carved under projecting eaves of roof formed verandah wooden post supported same projecting eaves being also boldly sculptured particular noted through telescope on rounding bend of river just beyond town must not help feeling that community of savage intellectual enough to find pleasure in adornment of house must be likely to prove very difficult to deal with unless must contrive to make inclination coincide with own wish appearance felicidad being probably first ship have ever penetrated so far up river created profound sensation in town inhabitant rushing in out of dwelling about street for world like alarmed colony of ant finally congregating along margin of river to extent of fully one thousand most of being men one of whom so far a must make out be armed weapon being spear bow arrow club with heavy knob on end seemed to be fine powerful race evidently accustomed to warfare if one might judge by readiness with at command of immensely stout powerful man whom lobo declared to be none other than matadi formed up into compact orderly squadron thought ruefully that if became necessary to resort to forcible measure for release of countryman be likely to have pretty bad time to attempt to open communication with thousand armed savage whose evident purpose in mustering on river bank immediately in front of town be to resolutely oppose attempt at landing on part be rather delicate operation still have to be done be worse than useless to exhibit sign of trepidation hesitation therefore ordered gig to be lowered with four men fully armed at oar lobo in stern sheet pushed off for shore bold action on part created profound sensation upon savage massed upon shore boat being sooner under way than raised spear above head shook furiously until blade clashed upon other with sound of falling torrent of water emitted blood curdling yell that almost drove poor lobo out of sens have however at lobo suggestion provided with palm branch cut on night before at previous anchorage now seizing one of portuguese scrambled forward into eye of boat stood there waving branch violently pointing toward savage demonstration have effect of quelling tumult black subsiding into quietude almost instantly at command of matadi be evident that have intention of permitting to land for at second command from chief advanced a steadily a band of civilised troop across short intervening space of greensward between water edge at halted forming up three deep in long compact line along river margin continued to pull shoreward until be within easy speaking distance when boat bow be turned up stream while men continued to paddle gently ahead using just sufficient strength to enable boat to stem current maintain position abreast centre of line of savage lobo opened palaver by informing matadi that be there by command of great white queen to procure release of white men held by a prisoner that be fully prepared to pay handsome ransom for be only for matadi to name price must be cheerfully paid to chief replied by inquiring what white men referred to knew nothing about white men indeed have never seen except ourselves strongly advised to lose time in making way back down river again a soldier be very angry at presumption in invading territory must not answer for that must be able to restrain must take into head to actively resent intrusion by attacking ship knew from reply lobo duly translated to that friend matadi be adept in art so peculiarly characteristic of african savage of lying must be dealt with accordingly so said to lobo tell that be mistaken say that circumstance be doubtless of so trivial character a to escape recollection of great chief like matadi that nevertheless know to be fact that about six moon ago thirty forty white men be sold to by one mendouca slave buyer that be men be seeking instruction being that be not to return without even must be obliged to destroy matadi town with thunder lightning in process of securing scarcely veiled threat to destroy town be received by matadi with scornful laughter savage declaring in set term that did not believe in power of white men to produce lightning thunder a to accomplishing threatened destruction without mean why there be few of warrior present who must have word to say upon matter touching question of white men said to have be sold to matadi admitted that now thought remembered transaction of kind have not remotest idea of what have become of must make inquiry however if must go away return again about same time next moon must perhaps be able to give news of before troubling to make such inquiry must be propitiated with present must also like to know what price be prepared to pay for white man must be found tell said that be case of white man present that if white men be found will not only buy of at so much per head also make handsome present into bargain say that good to be paid a ransom be aboard schooner that consist of gun bead brass wire beautiful printed calico suitable for adornment of african king wife handsome red coat with resplendent brass button gorgeous worsted epaulette admirably calculated to set off matadi own kingly figure superb blanket red blue green in fact colour of rainbow if two three of chief must like to come aboard see magnificent article will be very pleased to exhibit speech being translated by lobo there ensued long palaver result of be that matadi declined to go on board schooner have objection to come off alongside inspect from distance provided that must first return hoist up own boat fact evidently be that fellow treacherous suspected everybody else of being same be clearly indisposed to put in power while be at same time devoured with curiosity to see article of have given glowing description of course a wished above thing to excite cupidity to point of determining to posse good even at cost of having to give up white men readily agreed to proposal at once returned to schooner ordered boat to be hoisted to davit be evident that endeavour to excite matadi curiosity have be completely successful for sooner be gig out of water than large canoe be launched into matadi three four other negro presumably subordinate chief scrambled when be at once shoved off paddled by twenty native brought to within about twenty yard of schooner that being considered suppose about shortest distance within must be safe to approach tried to persuade to come little nearer if not actually on board matadi resolutely refused a seemed half inclined to go back again without even waiting to see what have to show ordered steward to open box at once forthwith proceeded to exhibit coil of wire string of bead bandana handkerchief roll of gaudily coloured print old military uniform musket other odds end exhibition proving so attractive that before conclusion canoe have be gradually sheered nearer nearer to schooner until be brought fairly alongside have even consented to accept rope end to hang on by matadi badly wanted to pas of article down over side that might examine still more minutely must not permit thinking best to still leave of curiosity unsatisfied at length after have be alongside nearly hour half have asked for second even third sight of most of good reluctantly retired eye glistening with cupidity matadi promising to institute immediate inquiry a to whereabouts of white men to let know result a soon a possible be very well satisfied with interview for felt convinced that have so powerfully excited covetousness of savage that must determine to posse good have shown at cost so a turned out have although consequent upon omission to take into consideration natural treachery of savage character be wholly mistaken a to form in determination must manifest be clear that matadi still entertained wholesome whole souled distrust of for when landed troop of warrior be still left drawn up along river bank with evident intention of preventing attempt on part to go ashore satisfy curiosity by inspection of town therefore accepted palpable hint thus conveyed stuck to ship need scarcely say have be cleared for action held ready for emergency from moment of arrival abreast town be by time growing late in afternoon a be anxious to obtain possession of unfortunate countryman leave matadi rather dangerous neighbourhood before watched proceeding in town narrowly with great deal of interest although be enabled with aid of telescope to follow matadi little coterie of chief to large building abutting on square at intersection of cross street took to be palace be unable to detect anything of unusual character in appearance movement of people until close upon sunset when observed small canoe coming off to schooner craft propelled by four paddler with single individual sitting in stern person presently recognised a one of chief who have accompanied matadi alongside earlier in day brought message to effect that king have ascertained that white men about whom have inquired be safe in village day march distant that matadi must send for on morrow unless be prepared to make present of musket five string of bead bandana handkerchief roll of printed calico in case must so far discommode a to send off messenger at once be of course very annoying did not at like idea of giving savage anything without tangible return for still after considering matter little arrived at conclusion that to expedite affair by twelve hour be quite worth price asked article be accordingly handed over not without grave misgiving a to wisdom of proceeding soon after fell dark star sparkled out one after lighting up scene with soft effulgence noise in town became hushed save for occasional barking of dog here there deep solemn hush fell upon in deep hoarse tumbling roar of whirl pool at great distance gurgle rush of turbid river past schooner hull became almost startlingly audible a long a be able to see line of native warrior still stood silent motionless guarding whole river front of town a matter of precaution now ordered boarding netting to be triced up round ship gun to be loaded with grape canister small arm to be prepared for immediate service double anchor watch to be kept men to hold ready for emergency after bustle of preparation schooner subsided again into silence darkness men for most part pricking for soft plank on deck coiling away thereon in preference to seeking repose in stifling forecastle a for gowland paced deck contemplatively together until about ten o'clock discussing chance of getting away on morrow then everything seeming perfectly quiet peaceful have mattress brought on deck stretched out thereon in small clear space between companion wheel have be asleep about two hour when be awakened by light touch starting up found that be one of anchor watch who be saying better go below sir think because look a though be goin ' to

robert moment may be precious if be a suspect ay ay sir answered man a trundled away forward to find gunner meanwhile a be evident that heavy downpour be imminent roused up gowland carried mattress

few second elapsed then with startling distinctness came down to cry ready sir with port fire then light at once answered will see what there be to be seen livid blue white glare of port fire almost instantly burst forth shedding unearthly radiance far across glassy swirling surface of rushing stream by light saw startling sight indeed schooner being surrounded by flotilla of at least twenty large canoe manned by from thirty to forty dusky warrior fully armed with spear bow war club be about cable length from have evidently taken up position with utmost care so that might close in upon reach simultaneously a be now doing a brilliant light of port fire blazed forth shout of astonishment not very far removed from dismay burst from occupant of canoe momentary tendency to sheer off precipitately became apparent be instantly checked by loud authoritative call from largest canoe voice sounding very much like of matadi with answering yell savage at once turned bow of canoe toward schooner began to paddle for dear life call hand shouted pipe to quarter pas word that men be not to wait to dress minute savage will be upon men needed second order have be sleeping on deck have awakened at gunner call from aloft glare of port fire striking through closed eyelid before word be well out of lip be standing to gun awaiting next order depress muzzle of gun a much a can give treacherous rascal content a bring to bear cried will only have time for one round if doe not stop will be obliged to fight hand to hand whole of schooner gun be fired one after other port fire unfortunately burnt out just about time so that be unable to ascertain what effect have be produced before must be found lighted heard felt light shock of collision a canoe dashed alongside in moment found ourselves engaged in attempting to check onset of perfect wall of savage hemmed in on side surged struggled writhed panted a endeavoured to force way through stubborn boarding netting be just tricing up of netting saved for schooner deck must have be overrun must have be massacred in moment a be unexpected obstacle of course none of have observed in afternoon netting not being then triced up daunted for must neither displace force way through while clung there like lot of bee vainly striving to find make passage through men be blazing away with musket pistol at black wall of writhing yelling humanity bowling over by dozen at time when at length port fire be found lighted disclosed to appalling picture of dusky panting body blazing eyeball waving skin plume gleaming spear point upraised war club hemming in on side from stem to stern separate individual glaring at with demoniac hate fury a strove ineffectually to get at savage fell in score at time beneath close withering fire at length finding netting impassable being shot down to purpose suddenly abandoned attack flung back into canoe in made off with speed for shore subjected meanwhile to galling fire of grape canister from gun very regretfully allowed to be maintained believing that only chance of safety lay in inflicting upon severe enough lesson to utterly discourage from renewal of attack continued firing until last canoe have reached shore by time eleven of have be utterly destroyed several others badly damaged resulting in loss to matadi of according to estimate not far short of three hundred men have just ceased firing men be busy securing gun again when threatened storm burst forth fight terminated with one of most terrific tempest of thunder lightning rain have ever be exposed to lasted until about three o'clock next morning then passed off leaving heaven calm clear serene once more star even more brilliant than have be before gathering of storm of course after attempted surprise of schooner by savage there be more sleep for that night before dawn have resolved to send boat ashore demanding surrender of matadi chief a hostage for good behaviour of people until delivery of english prisoner alternative in case of refusal being destruction of town accordingly a rising sun be gilding hill top ordered boat to be lowered sent away in gowland charge with lobo to act a interpreter with message to effect guard of warrior still held landing place to chief in command of message be given receipt a gowland subsequently informed producing very considerable amount of consternation reply be that matadi have be very severely wounded in accidental engagement of previous night be believed to be dying that chief to whom message have be given must communicate with brother chief that must receive reply on following morning to gowland have replied that if white prisoner be not surrendered safe sound whole of chief matadi included on board schooner when sun stood over certain hill top must be in about hour from moment schooner gun must open fire upon town continue bombardment until house in be razed to ground therewith gig returned to ship be again hoisted to davit peremptory message coupled doubt with experience of preceding night have desired effect for while sun be still quarter of hour distant from part of heaven gowland have indicated saw procession issue from fetish house in centre of town telescope enabled to make out a consisting of group of white men closely guarded by body of two hundred armed warrior detailed must appear for purpose of guarding white from fury of witch doctor priest who be thus most unwillingly deprived of prey who accompanied party right down to shore doing best to instigate people to attack escort recapture released prisoner there be terrific hubbub over affair repeated rush being made at party guard appeared to use club with great freedom eventually cortege reached river white be safely embarked in three large canoe manned by native apparently in charge of authoritative person at once shoved off for schooner upon arrival of little flotilla alongside be found that white prisoner brought off for surrender numbered twenty eight of whom be in most wretched plight from sickness barbarous neglect with have be treated during long wearisome captivity consisted of sapphire late second third lieutenant one midshipman nine marine sixteen seaman one midshipman three marine two seaman having died of fever during time that have be in matadi hand so frightfully be reduced by suffering despair when poor little surviving mid mere lad of sixteen be helped up side to schooner low deck nerve entirely gave way fell upon plank in paroxysm of hysterical tear wild incoherent ejaculation of gratitude to god for having delivered from living death while a for others be too deeply moved shaken to utter more than husky word two for moment convulsive grip of emaciated hand quivering lip look of almost incredulous delight with gazed about into face spoke far more eloquently than word needle to say gave most hearty fraternal welcome at once before thing else providing a far a must for physical comfort while armstrong warm hearted scotch surgeon immediately took in hand with good will promised wonder in way of speedy restoration to health strength during while three canoe have remained alongside by by when have once more time to think of other matter than more immediately concerning guest lobo came to informed that chief who have brought off released white men be waiting for payment of promised ransom thought tolerably cool after treacherous manner in have attacked during preceding night be too greatly rejoiced at success of mission to be very severe retributive in behaviour just then therefore paid full amount agreed upon directed lobo to say that although paid did not consider that matadi be entitled to claim single article in view of unprovoked attack upon schooner miserable condition in have delivered up captive paid in order that might practically learn that englishman never break promise that have once made having duly impressed upon gave further to understand must ever happen that other white men fell into hand must be expected to treat with utmost kindness consideration upon pain of condign punishment must fail to do so that upon delivering such white safe sound to first warship might happen to enter river must be handsomely rewarded matter settled business with matadi be at end although there happened to be not breath of wind stirring determined to make start down river at once get to sea a soon a possible in order that rescued men might not be deprived for one moment longer than be absolutely necessary of restorative effect of pure salt breeze accordingly manned capstan forthwith hove short then proceeded down stream by process of navigation known a dredging be to say kept schooner in proper channel by mean of anchor rudder combined allowing anchor to just touch drag along ground when became necessary to sheer ship away from danger at other time heaving off ground few foot allowing craft to drift with current so strong be rush of river just then that by mean alone accomplished descent of le than thirty mile day before sunset anchoring for night in very snug cove on northern bank of river under shadow of high hill then during night light southerly air sprang up freshening towards morning into spanking breeze soon became gale of wind under welcome impulse although found rather shy with in of narrowest most intricate part of navigation contrived to complete descent of remaining portion of river on second day out from matadi town arriving off mouth of banana creek about hour before sunset here in fulfilment of promise released lobo who to do justice have served well when found that be to interest to do so may now dismiss finally from story by saying that when one of ship of squadron put into river about three week later be found that senor lobo have profited by advice to extent that have disposed of factory other property just a stood to former manager purchase money being paid three fourth down remainder to be paid by instalment at three six month date very excellent bargain contrived to make too so understood unfortunate buyer suffering heavy loss when captain of cruiser made first business to destroy barracoon formed portion of property although aforesaid buyer of course made point of vowing most emphatically that have intention whatever of using structure for slave dealing purpose to also a matter of course declared that have most righteous aversion having landed lobo proceeded to sea same night carrying southerly breeze with through night then falling in with regular twister from eastward carried right across line to about latitude degree minute north from thence have light variable breeze to sierra leone despite made excellent passage arriving in anchorage in just three day short of month from date of leaving upon rescuing expedition be happy to say that when landed rescued party have so far rallied a to render perfect recovery merely matter of time provided of course that deadly fever of coast did not carry off in meanwhile on arrival in sierra leone be greatly surprised to find barracouta still in harbour of course lost time in going on board to report incidentally to find out reason of prolonged stay in port on presenting on board discovered that have be mistaken in supposing to have lain there idle during whole period of cruise on contrary have only arrived three day before felicidad after have told story received compliment of captain rest of officer upon what be pleased to term boldness judgment with have executed mission have to listen in return to story a gruesome a can well be imagined although be told in very few word appeared then that day two after departure barracouta again put to sea with fixed unexpressed determination to prosecute further search for francesca wind weather having meanwhile be such a to encourage captain stopford in hope that by adopting certain measure might yet contrive to fall in with have done so though by mean in manner that have expected cruise being without result in direction in have hoped to meet with success day later however after search have be reluctantly abandoned while brig be edging in towards coast again hoping to pick up prize to recompense in measure for disappointment have unexpectedly fallen in with francesca again be not long in coming to conclusion that something be seriously wrong on board topmast being carried away close to cap hanging suspended by rigging with apparent effort being made to clear away wreck although weather be then quite fine sail be of course at once made to close with dismantled craft then surprise met for although intention of brig must have be from first moment unmistakable attempt be made to avoid encounter however be accounted for little later by fact that francesca appeared to be in unmanageable condition then a brig neared still more closely be seen that sweep be rigged out not manned although deck be crowded with people unmistakably black then be that for first time dreadful surmise dawned upon captain stopford mind surmise soon proved to be true that negro doubtless goaded to frenzy by continued ill treatment have risen upon massacred entire crew taken possession of brigantine of course have not remotest idea how to handle barracouta soon arrived upon francesca weather quarter evidence of fearful deed then became unmistakable scupper still bearing stain of ensanguined stream have poured from while among whole of crowd of yelling fiercely gesticulating black not single white face be to be seen boat be at once lowered strong crew sent away to take possession of disabled vessel emancipated slave maddened at thought of again falling into hand of hated white of course unaware of fact that brig crew be anxious only to render service offered so desperate resistance to boarder that young who led latter recognising impossibility of taking brigantine without serious loss of life withdrew to consult with captain stopford a to best course to pursue meanwhile wind fell away to calm of circumstance slave took advantage by manning sweep gradually withdrawing from vicinity of barracouta be about sunset three hour later bright blaze upon horizon proclaimed that notorious francesca have caught be set on fire in inexplicable way brig boat be at once manned dispatched to rescue of unhappy black a many of a might be possible to save brigantine be by time nine mile away flame burnt with ever increasing fury while boat be still three mile distant doomed ship blew up occupant of boat saw body of miserable black hurled high in air in midst of dazzling sheet of flame cloud of smoke when boat arrived upon scene of disaster remained of once gallant guilty francesca consisted of few charred timber fragment of half burnt planking in midst of floated forty fifty dead body of negro rest have vanished whither such reader be story such be end of pirate slaver terrible doom of when became known caused such thrill of horror in breast of who have emulated crew in career of crime that from time forward there be noticeable falling off in number of vessel frequenting west african river in search of slave finally year two later appearance of fast steamer in slave squadron rendered chance of success so remote that few of most enterprising have heart to continue pursuit of so risky unprofitable business when be one by one captured vessel condemned infamous trade dwindled more more until finally died out altogether never let hope to be revived again end
