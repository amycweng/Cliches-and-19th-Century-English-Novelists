writes hero year old midshipman of salami be suddenly given job of going aboard taking command of mercury emigrant ship that find drifting in mid ocean officer having died in various accident illiterate bosun ship carpenter knowing full well that have idea how to navigate take charge appears to be going well when will not spoil good story for full of event seaman humour book make good audiobook will enjoy overdue story of missing ship by harry collingwood chapter one mercury appears be yarn of day when clipper sailing ship be at zenith of glory renown when be recognised medium for transport of passenger ay very frequently of mail between great britain colony when steamer be comparatively speaking rare object on high sea true few of great steamship line such a cunard peninsular oriental be already in existence fleet be only just beginning to compete with very limited measure of success against superb specimen of marine architecture owned by black ball other famous line of sailing clipper for suez canal have not yet be dug apart from overland journey to india traveller bound to east be compelled to go south about round cape of good hope whether journeyed by steamer by sailing ship be very uncommon thing for latter to beat former on passage to india china australia moreover marine steam engine be at period very expensive piece of machinery to operate developing only very moderate amount of power upon exceedingly heavy consumption of coal hence be only nabob who must afford to indulge in then costly luxury of ocean travel by steam occurrence regard a starting point of extraordinary yarn happened on th day of october in year of grace salami be ship in originated being at noon of day in latitude degree south longitude degree west thereabout thirty day out from london on voyage to melbourne salami may explain be full rigged clipper ship of ton register classed being one of crack vessel of celebrated gold star line outward bound to melbourne a have said with full complement of saloon steerage passenger general cargo that while filled to hatch be so largely composed of light merchandise that only sank in water to very finest sailing trim of circumstance captain martin commander be taking fullest possible advantage by carrying on day night in hope of making record passage philip troubridge be one of midshipman apprentice of whom carried six be seventeen year of age on day when occurrence happened have alluded to above will now relate salami carried three mate chief second third accident happened in first watch when mr moore second mate have charge of deck wind be out from about ' west have be blowing very fresh day notwithstanding ship be under three royal fore main topgallant studdingsails course being south east there be heavy steep sea following ship on port quarter not only made motion exceedingly uneasy also caused to yaw wildly from time to time despite utmost effort of two men at wheel to keep true to course be during one of wild sheers that main topgallant studdingsail boom snapped short off by boom iron there be immediately tremendous hullabaloo aloft of madly slatting canvas threshing boom a studdingsail flapped furiously in freshening breeze momentarily threatening to spring topgallant yard if indeed did not whip topgallant mast out of ship then something fouled aloft rendering impossible to take in sail skipper being on deck manifesting impatience at what conceived to be clumsiness of men who have gone up on topsail yard mr moore second mate sprang into main rigging went aloft to lend hand just precisely what happened nobody ever knew one of men aloft said that broken boom in wild threshing struck mate knocked off yard be that a may one thing certain be that poor fellow suddenly went whirling down without cry fell into boiling smother raised by bow wave be never seen again happened to be on poop at moment despite darkness saw falling body of mate just a flashed down into water guessed what have happened even before thrilling cry of man overboard came pealing down from aloft therefore made dash for one of lifebuoys be stopped to poop rail cut adrift hove a nearly a must guess at spot where mate have disappeared while one of men on forecastle anticipating skipper order called hand to shorten whole ship be of course instantly in tremendous commotion fore aft rest of studdingsails be taken in a quickly a possible royal topgallantsails be clewed up reef be taken in topsail ship be brought to wind worked back a nearly a must be to spot where accident have happened boat be lowered although skipper have displayed such nice judgment in determining precise spot where search must begin that crew of boat dispatched to search for mate actually found recovered lifebuoy have thrown sign of lost man be ever discovered assumption be that have be stunned by blow have knocked overboard have sunk at once occurrence cast gloom over ship for several day for poor moore be probably most popular man in ship highly esteemed by passenger a nearly beloved by crew a one of afterguard can ever reasonably hope to be skipper in particular took loss of very promising officer deeply to heart not only because of esteem in held also fancy because be worried by conviction that accident be very largely due to own propensity to carry on rather too recklessly on ninth day after unfortunate occurrence on thirty ninth day out from london found in longitude of cape of good hope in latitude degree minute south with whole gale of wind chasing blew into latitude degree south longitude degree east before left ten day later stark becalmed calm however lasted few hour be succeeded by light northerly breeze under impulse of with plain sail set salami must barely log six knot to hour lasted night next day before day have sped second incident occurred that resulted in plumping into adventure be subject of yarn heavy sea have be kicked up by gale subsided with extraordinary rapidity when went on duty at eight bell eight o'clock on particular morning weather be everything that most fastidious person must possibly desire saving that sun struck along weather side of deck when squinted at past weather leach of mainsail a ship rolled gently to heave of swell with fierceness threatened roasting hot day what time must have worked way point two farther round to nor'ard swell lingered to remind of recent breeze be subsiding fast ocean presented one vast surface of long solemn sweeping undulation of deepest purest sapphire gently ruffled by breathing of languid breeze ablaze in wake of sun with dazzle brought tear to eye attempted to gaze upon ship morning toilet have be completed deck darkened by sluicing to have be lavishly subjected by acting second mate watch be drying fast recovering sand white colour in process brasswork freshly scoured polished glass of skylight shot out thousand flash of white fire where sun ray searched out glittering surface a ship rolled awning have already be spread upon poop in readiness for advent of energetic occupant of cuddy who made point of promenading for hour in order to generate appetite for breakfast running gear have be bowsed taut neatly coiled down canvas from dew have already evaporated soared aloft toward deep rich azure of zenith in great gleaming milk white cloth of so soft so tender so ethereal aspect that one must scarcely have be surprised to see skysail dissolve in vapour go drifting away to leeward upon languid breeze main deck be lively with coming going of steerage passenger a went to galley to fetch breakfast there must have be between twenty thirty child chasing other fore aft dodging round elder in play filling rich sweet morning air with music of voice there be soft seething sound over side a ship slid gently along accompanied by constant iridescent gleam flash of tiny bubble slipped along bend vanished at last in smooth oil like wake with tiny whirlpool at frequent interval shoal of flying fish must spark out from under bow go skimming glittering away to port starboard like shower of brand new silver dollar hove broadcast by hand of old father neptune cuddy breakfast be fairly under way great clattering of cup saucer knife fork hum of lively conversation accompanied by sundry savoury odour came floating up through open skylight when chief mate eye happened to be attracted toward gasket streaming loose like irish pennant from fore topgallant yard sang out to one of ordinary seaman to jump aloft put right fellow made way up ratline with extreme deliberation for indeed journey aloft in such scorching heat be joke made up loose gasket be in very act of swinging off yard when happening to be watching saw suddenly pause stiffen into attitude of attention a holding on to jackstay with one hand flung other up to forehead peered ahead under sharp of for full minute stood thus then twisting body until faced aft hailed on deck there hillo answered mate there be biggish ship away out yonder sir reported man under three taups'ls fore topmast staysail by way that come to fall off again 'd say that be hove to how far off be demanded mate 'bout dozen mile reckon sir answered man um remarked mate a much to a to seemed be probably whaler on lookout for fish believe sometimes meet with rare streak of luck just about here right added hailing man aloft can come down shortly afterward made out stranger upper spar from deck from rapidity with raised soon became apparent that if have really be hove to when first seen have soon filled away be now standing in direction by five bell be hull up while skipper mate be standing together eyeing from break of poop latter with ship telescope at eye saw ensign of stranger float out over rail go creeping up to gaff end there go ensign sir shouted to mate who responded by remarking dryly yes see then turning to skipper said there be something wrong aboard craft sir have just hoisted ensign jack downward may be explained to uninitiated be signal of distress dickens have exclaimed skipper just let have look at mr bryce mate handed over telescope skipper raised to eye adjusting focus to sight ay be quite right agreed with eye still peering through tube jack downward right enough wonder what be wrong aboard of hull spar seem to be right see water pouring from scupper a there must be if have sprung leak hand be working at pump well will soon know suppose let own ensign be hoisted in acknowledgment mr bryce ay ay sir answered mate troubridge to jump aft run ensign up to peak will ye went aft to flag locker drew out big ensign bent on to halyard ran up to gaff end where there be just wind enough to blow out make distinguishable for what be news that stranger in sight be flying signal of distress soon spread among passenger in few minute telescope in cuddy be upon poop being eagerly focused upon approaching vessel have by time revealed a full rigged ship of ton measurement of wholesome motherly build certainly not whaler a must be seen by model of boat carried by absence of certain characteristic proclaim whaler be apparent almost from moment when heave into full view there be naturally vast amount of speculation not only on part of skipper mate also among passenger a to precise character of distress probably not one of came anywhere near guessing at extraordinary nature approaching other a two vessel be did not take very long to close with stranger a drew near to became apparent that people be preparing to lower boat at proper moment therefore mainyard be laid aback stranger followed suit minute two later two craft came to stand abreast of other stranger about hundred fathom to windward of near enough indeed for to read with unaided eye name mercury upon head board then one of two port quarter boat be lowered hauled to gangway with three men pulling one in stern sheet grasping yoke line shoved off pulled away towards mate hailing to come to lee gangway where side ladder have be dropped over for use main deck be crowded with people men woman hanging over rail staring at with idle curiosity be so characteristic of uneducated class mr bryce at once unhesitatingly pronounced to be emigrant opinion skipper a unhesitatingly endorsed men in approaching boat be forecastle hand one steering having appearance of being boatswain carpenter of ship be that gave doubt skipper mate also first specific hint of what be actually wrong aboard stranger nothing however be said presently when boat came rounding under stern captain martin mr bryce descended to main deck awaited visitor at gangway own steerage passenger who have crowded lee rail to see strange boat come alongside respectfully making way for one only of boat crew man in stern sheet ventured to come on deck other three staring up at head peering down at from rail without saying word in reply to multitude of question be fired into beyond remarking that bobeun will tell skipper about boatswain of mercury for such newcomer proved to be passed through gangway pulled off knitted woollen cap decorated head at once addressed to skipper mornin ' sir remarked name polson james polson be bobeun of mercury ship see hove to yonder with flourish of hand in direction of vessel named yes said skipper enquiringly a man paused apparently waiting to be questioned after introduction of see have signal of distress flying what be wrong with well fact be sir a have lost cap'n mate answered man when skipper struck in amazedly lost captain mate how in name of fortune did that happen well sir see be way be reply when 'd be out about week be from liverpool bound to sydney new south wale with general cargo two hundred emigrant ninety seven day out when 'd be out about week thereabouts ai certain to day two be wrote down in log cap'n somers be found dead in bunk by steward what took in cup o ' coffee mornin at six bell mr townsend be chief mate took command o ' ship then nothin ' partic'lar happened until be well side o ' line when one day when hand of be shortenin ' sail to heavy squall a have bust upon jim tarbutt hordinary seaman comin down off main top l yard by way o ' backstay let go hold drop slap on top o mr townsend what happened to be standin underneath instead of hurtin ' of hisself broke t'other man neck killed dead on spot then continued polson regardless of ejaculation of astonishment commiseration evoked by recital of extraordinary accident then mr masterman what be originwilly second mate up took charge navigated to somewhere about where be now four night ago come last night yes be right be four night ago 'bout three bell in middle watch while be blowin ' hard from west'ard be runnin ' under single reefed topsail with very heavy sea chasin ' of night bein dark thick with rain somebody come rushin ' out of poop cabin yellin ' like mad afore anybody must stop sprang on to lee rail just fore side of main riggin take header overboard more exclamation of astonishment from listener amid polson triumphantly concluded gruesome narrative by adding of course must hin so poor feller be lost when chip comed to investigate found that unfortunit man be mr masterman bein ' only one be missin ' well ejaculated skipper addressing to mr moore chief mate have heard good many queer yarn in time of maritime accident disaster one top lot captain mate lost in same voyage so far a two last be concerned by such queer accident too did turning to polson find anything in mr what be name masterman cabin to account for extraordinary behaviour in rushing out on deck jumping overboard in middle of night sir answered polson with much simplicity 'd be drinkin ' goodish bit there be half empty bottle of rum under piller ah ejaculated skipper with whole world of emphasis may account for good deal well what happened next oh nothin ' else have happened thank god exclaimed boatswain piously ai that what have already told ye quite enough sir what be made so terrible awk'ard for hand of be that be now without navigator have lost reckonin ' so after chip have confabulated bit comed to conclusion that knowin ' a be well in track of ship bound to east'ard best thing must do be to heave to wait until somethin comed along must spare somebody to navigate ship for to sydney chip be men enough to take care of to know when to make when to shorten sail know nothin ' about navigation ye see sir ay see answered skipper well think acted very wisely boatswain in heaving to know that must have done anything better under circumstance a to sparing officer to navigate have have misfortune to lose one of own mate voyage here eye happened to fall on considered attentively for several second a though felt have seen before somewhere be trying to remember who be then countenance lit up a idea seemed to strike addressed briskly what d say troubridge have heard man yarn understand fix that be in aboard ship yonder be perfectly reliable navigator very fair seaman moreover boatswain say that carpenter be seaman enough to take care of ship for moment doubt do feel inclined to undertake job of navigating mercury from here to sydney ought to be very good thing for know have doubt that owner did not wait for to finish knew enough to understand perfectly well what splendid thing must be for from professional point of view if must succeed in safely navigating such ship a mercury to sydney have shadow of doubt of ability to do so therefore cut in by eagerly expressing readiness to undertake task then be right remarked skipper turning to polson said young gentleman be mr philip troubridge one of midshipman apprentice have be with for matter of three year be a just now heard say excellent navigator very good seaman have not least doubt that will serve purpose quite a well a anyone else that be at likely to pick up if care to have will be pleased to spare to be best can do for a told little while ago have lost one of mate say more sir say more interrupted polson recommendation quite sufficient to satisfy that mr er troubridge will do very well ' since be willin ' to come with will have most gratefully sir with many thanks to for sparin ' of to very well then be settled exclaimed skipper briskly then turning to said cut away at once troubridge get chest over side a quickly a possible if be smart may get aboard new ship in time to take observation at noon check own reckoning by ours then a rushed off to after house where apprentice be berthed turned to polson proceeded to question further relative to extraordinary series of fatality have occurred on board mercury chapter two shadow of coming event took le than ten minute to bundle trap into waiting boat alongside then having already said goodbye to shipmate in apprentice berth stepped up to skipper chief mate to say same to thank former for giving splendid chance be very kind in bidding farewell told have given satisfaction while have be with gave few word of caution advice wound up by saying boatswain here tell that chronometer aboard mercury have unfortunately be allowed to run down when therefore get aboard have taken meridian altitude have better wind chronometer then set to greenwich time will give after must experience difficulty in finding way to sydney to port wish prosperous pleasant voyage of course quite reckon upon arriving two three week ahead of unless have exceptionally protracted passage ought to arrive in good time to return home with unless therefore mercury agent in sydney wish to return to england in ship have better make way to melbourne a soon a have settled up go back with thanked for kindly send off that be giving then after final shake of hand followed polson down side seated in stern sheet boatswain pulling stroke while other three oarsman shifted one thwart forward shoved off crew passenger of salami giving little cheer to speed on way cheer be at once vociferously responded to by people crowding mercury rail doubt be greatly relieved at thought that there be to be no more aimless drifting about ocean for at last be to find again heading intelligently toward port of destination by time have arrived alongside mercury mounted to deck be getting so close toward noon have only barely time enough to get trap out of boat before moment arrived when must get to work with sextant to secure sun meridian altitude from to deduce ship latitude then there be even more important job to be done namely to start set chronometer therefore a soon a have secured meridian altitude made noon aboard mercury wore ship coming up alongside salami lay patiently waiting for with main topsail aback obtained correct greenwich time set chronometer to done captain martin swung mainyard made sail followed suit a quickly a must then worked out observation pricked off ship position on chart wrote up log took possession of late captain stateroom by time dinner be on cabin table sat down to first meal on board mercury food of course be not quite so luxurious a served up on cuddy table aboard salami be long way better than what have be accustomed to get in apprentice berth appreciated change accordingly at conclusion of meal at polson joined uninvited while carpenter stumped poop a officer of watch went on deck to have good look at first command on whole be very pleased with be big ship for tonnage having evidently be constructed with eye to ample cargo stowage rather than speed consequently be inclined to be bluff in bow full in run yet when looked ahead saw that salami have only drawn ahead of by about mile during half hour so that have be below be by mean dissatisfied be evidently elderly ship for everything about in way of fitting equipment be old fashioned be a strong a oak iron must make scantling being nearly twice a heavy a of salami bulwark be almost a high solid a of frigate be pierced to mount seven gun of side longer carried artillery on deck excepting two brass six pounder for purpose of signalling be very loftily solidly rigged did not take long to ascertain that have be most liberally maintained much of rigging standing running being new while ground tackle be ponderous enough to hold ship of double size not much chance thought of old barkie dragging anchor home driving ashore in anything short of hurricane carried full poop break of came so far forward that there be scarcely room to pas comfortably between foot of poop ladder combing of after hatch poop cabin be very spacious affair extending for greater part of length to full width of ship be most comfortably fitted up although a might be expected lacked luxurious finish of salami cuddy looked a though might at one time have be fitted with stateroom on side for accommodation of saloon passenger if so have be removed save two at fore two at after end of cabin even be now unoccupied boatswain carpenter occupying stateroom at fore end of structure in chief second mate have originally be berthed captain cabin be abaft saloon in extreme after end of ship be unusually commodious airy apartment extending entire width of ship splendidly lighted ventilated by whole range of large stern window there be fine roomy standing bed place on starboard side with splendid chest of drawer under washstand dressing table at foot of large well stocked bookcase on port side chart rack occupied whole of fore bulkhead floor deck of cabin be covered with handsome turkey carpet mahogany table big enough to accommodate large chart stood in middle of apartment be where be to sleep to spend in privacy a much of waking time a chose truly thought be agreeable change from cramped quarter aboard salami having completed establishment of myself in luxurious cabin by turning out chest hanging up such of clothes a be likely to want immediately so on went on deck again where carpenter who told that name be tudsbery josiah tudsbery honour sir be on duty requested to conduct below to emigrant quarter found occupied whole of 'tween deck here again liberality of ship owner became manifest for whole fitting up of place be vastly superior to what be at time considered good enough accommodation for emigrant married quarter consisting of number of quite comfortable roomy cabin while space allotted to accommodation of single men woman ensured to occupant such complete privacy a be deemed quite unnecessary in day found that be duty of emigrant to keep own quarter clean seemed to have be somewhat neglected of late therefore gave order that hand must at once turn to give 'tween deck thorough cleansing in readiness for inspection by at eight bell in afternoon watch emigrant aboard mercury numbered two hundred told namely thirty three married couple twenty eight unmarried woman forty two unmarried men sixty four child of whom one sweet good tempered baby girl have be born during voyage emigrant seemed to be very mixed lot ranging from clod hopping agricultural labourer whose intelligence seemed insufficient to enable to appreciate wonder of flying fish beauty of golden crimson purple sunset to individual of so refined intellectual appearance so polished behaviour that fact of being 'tween deck passenger seemed nothing short of grotesque incongruity when went below again at eight bell to inspect emigrant quarter found sweet clean altogether very much more wholesome than have be upon occasion of first visit expressed gratification at change hinting pretty strongly must expect place to be maintained in condition for remainder of voyage at remark one of occupant pale delicate looking girl exclaimed oh sir only hope that will insist upon of people here especially men be shockingly lazy must never do hand turn of work if be not made to be much obliged to for hint said will find out identity of especially lazy one see if can not imbue with good wholesome hatred of idleness before arrive in land where who wo work must starve by sunset night salami have slid so far ahead of that only head of course be visible above horizon with saw last of that be destined to see during voyage suppose be only natural that lad of barely seventeen year of age must be full of business importance anxiety for few hour at least upon finding thus unexpectedly placed in position of such tremendous responsibility a be involved in navigation therefore to large extent safety of fine wholesome old ship with two hundred passenger crew of thirty valuable cargo at event be condition of mind in found a paced spacious poop hour after hour sometimes accompanied by polson sometimes conversing with tudsbery occasionally alone a walked glance travelled with regularity of clockwork first to windward then ahead then aloft finally a reached binnacle into compass bowl then away out to windward again so on ad infinitum until be fairly bone weary have completely walked off anxiety to say nothing of importance have convinced that really might venture to leave ship for few hour to care of boatswain carpenter have mentioned that when bidding farewell prior to change over from salami to mercury captain martin be kind enough to give word two of caution advice one of bit of advice most forcibly impressed upon be must make point of sighting saint paul amsterdam island on way to eastward thus verify reckoning recognised a being counsel of wisdom determined to shape course must enable to sight being only about fifty mile apart standing high therefore very carefully laid off compass course upon chart found to be south east by east three quarter east distance being eight hundred forty mile course gave to helmsman a soon a have pricked off very carefully verified while passed on to relief so on when turned out at six bell next morning found to disgust that wind have drawn round from eastward broken four point off course while to add to vexation boatswain carpenter of illiterate men have entered up log slate in such extraordinary manner so far a dead reckoning be concerned information be not of slightest use to fortunately for peace of mind atmosphere be clear be able to get sight during forenoon gave ship longitude while little later on meridian altitude of sun fixed latitude for then for nearly thirty hour found enveloped in one of densest fog ever experienced with light baffling variable wind that made of wake continual zigzag winding up with three day of thoroughly foul weather whole gale of wind from north east during greater part of lay hove to under close reefed fore main topsail with head to south east then weather cleared moderated wind gradually worked round first to east then to south east at length found ship laying up close hauled under plain sail for spot where according to reckoning saint paul ought to be be now especially anxious to make island for weather of past three four day have be of such character a to baffle most experienced of navigator confess be beginning to feel rather more than trifle nervous island however hove into view at precise moment in precise quarter that ought to do if reckoning happened to be correct test verification of accuracy of working served to completely re establish confidence in so that from time onward never experienced least anxiety felt that so long a must get tolerably regular sight of sun moon star be not at likely to go wrong before island of saint paul have climbed up over horizon stretched athwart bow have become aware of certain matter while struck a being somewhat peculiar seemed to bear further significance for one of first person among emigrant passenger aboard mercury to attract attention be tall thin long haired sickly looking man of about thirty year of age clad in suit of rusty black whose appearance manner generally suggested to idea that must be by profession schoolmaster there be certain air of exaggerated earnestness of demeanour about wildness of expression in flashing coal black eye caused to set down a being somewhat crack brained name soon ascertained be algernon marcus wilde be among first of emigrant to speak to came to on morning after joined ship with complaint a to quality quantity of food served out to occupant of 'tween deck be a much struck by correctness of speech a by excessive indignation infused into manner when stating nature of alleged grievance pointed out to fact that whatever quality of food might be be certainly not responsible for in event of proving to be unsuitable must remedy matter away out there in mid ocean promised to investigate affair to do what might be possible to remove grievance must find such to exist of have doubt after brief highly satisfactory experience of viand served up in cabin accordingly requested steward to produce dietary list formed basis of agreement between owner emigrant upon going through be certainly unable to find just cause for complaint so far a quantity be concerned question of quality be of course different matter here again when day two later unexpectedly examined food a be being served out at galley be quite unable to discover legitimate cause for complaint on contrary food although plain be a good a be possible to obtain in time aboard ship have be at sea hundred day be excellently prepared when sent for wilde asked to state specifically what found wrong with food have just examined must say be that be not so good so varied in character a have seen from time to time carried aft for use in cabin that in opinion distinction ought to be made in treatment of person occupying different part of ship also that considered ought to give instruction for emigrant to be fed henceforth from store provided for cabin use must be satisfied although pointed out that be getting food that owner have undertaken to provide with in exchange for passage money of course to attempt to argue with so unreasonable individual be obviously absurd therefore dismissed thought nothing more about complaint however be not matter of have spoken a gradually obtruding upon attention although have only be able to guess two be not unconnected what noticed almost from first moment of boarding mercury without attaching particular importance to be that man wilde few of other male emigrant be in habit of spending practically whole of second dogwatch in fine weather at event be usually period of idleness recreation for ship crew on forecastle head smoking chatting animatedly with forecastle hand while at other time ex schoolmaster a wilde actually proved to be seemed eternally engaged in earnest discussion with fellow emigrant often wondered idly what man must possibly find to talk about so incessantly usually found sufficiently satisfactory explanation in reflection that being man of education must naturally take pleasure in extracting idea of others also probably in correcting according to own notion be evidently very fond of talking frequently amused by watching impassioned earnestness eloquent gesture with must hold forth upon subject whatever might be happened to be under discussion soon found that polson tudsbery boatswain carpenter of ship apparently found more pleasure in spending second dogwatch on forecastle with shipmate emigrant than did in promenading poop with be not surprising for not only be very illiterate men quickly became apparent that have scarcely single interest idea in common be consequently often hard put to to find topic of congenial conversation indeed in course of few day without slightest ill feeling on side communication became almost exclusively restricted to matter connected with business of ship looking back from summit of matured experience a now can upon that first fortnight aboard mercury often feel astonished that never for single instant caught faintest premonition of what be looming ahead for can recall plenty of hint suggestion have only be keen sighted enough to observe smart enough to read significance believe fact to be at time have room in mind for other thought than of navigation of ship be true that for more than year have be part of daily duty a midshipman apprentice qualifying for position of officer to take observation of various heavenly body simultaneously with of captain martin mate to work out independently to submit calculation to skipper who examined returned with such written comment a deemed called for with result have long since become proficient in science of navigation be very different thing if on board salami have chanced to make mistake worst must have happened must have be sharp rebuke from skipper for carelessness equally sharp injunction to be more careful in future whereas now aboard mercury if happened to make miscalculation there be nobody to correct although subsequent observation might reveal error actual harm arise from committal so long a ship be in mid ocean comparatively trivial mistake committed when ship happened to be in vicinity of rock shoal approaching land might easily make difference between perfect safety total loss together with of hand hence during early day when sense of grave responsibility lay heavy upon young shoulder must think of nothing more le abstruse astronomical problem chapter three unpleasant surprise revelation came upon with stunning effect of thunder clap on day upon made island of saint paul weather during whole of preceding day have be brilliantly fine with light air of wind that breathing out from south east at daybreak have gradually hauled round until by noon have settled at south so that when took meridian altitude of sun for determination of latitude mercury be heading straight for spot where calculation declared island to be with plain sail set to royal with weather bracer slightly checked upon working out meridian altitude found ship latitude to be degree minute south be steering true east consequently if calculation be accurate be at moment on exact parallel of saint paul also according to calculation then lay in line with jibboom eighty mile distant result be confirmed by further observation of sun taken in course of afternoon watch very simple calculation then informed that if have made mistake there occurred change in direction strength of wind island ought to be sighted directly ahead fourteen mile distant at dawn of next day anticipation communicated in anxiety to polson tudsbery former of whom remarked well mr troubridge sha have very long to wait afore be able to prove haccuracy of calculation let tell ye sir if be able to hit off that there bit of hiland anywhere near a close a hope to a'ter box haulin ' about breakin off heavin ' to driftin ' to leeward that have have here last few day well can say be that be good enough navigator to take ship anywhere ay if 't be round world back y e e said flattered bit off balance by fulsome character of compliment there will not be much fault to find fancy after traverse that have be working by way polson have ever sighted saint paul never have although be fifth trip in sea well sir ca say a have answered boatswain continued peering through skylight at cabin clock be eight bell will call chip fancy heard say that 'ad sighted once twice will ask when come on deck so saying polson walked to bell where hung mounted on rail guarded fore end of poop struck eight bell upon then descended to call carpenter with whom presently returned to poop yes mr troubridge continued boatswain a preceded carpenter up weather poop ladder chip here say have sighted hiland twice in time only at distance ah said do think must recognise again tudsbery oh yes sir fear of answered carpenter confidently be peculiar lookin ' spot not to be very easily mistook remembers that when last sighted heard mate say to skipper that looked pretty much like dead whale floatin high out o ' water be right did oh yes will reckernize again fast enough if clap eye upon never fear well said expect to heave in sight to morrow at dawn under jibboom end fourteen fifteen mile distant if wind weather last a be now believe will be case since barometer remains steady be morning watch be yes sir eight hour out to night answered chip then said turning to boatswain when call carpenter to morrow morning at end of middle watch please give call also for never yet having sighted island must like to be on deck when heave into view get good look at right sir answered polson will rouse out never fear weather held fine through night with breeze light steady at south when having be duly called by boatswain at four o'clock next morning turned out went on deck ship with spar almost upright be sliding very gently along over sea so smooth that masthead seemed scarcely to sway at among brilliant star thickly jewelled deep indigo vault overhead silence of night lay heavy upon breast of placid deep seemed to be emphasised rather than broken by faint sigh of breeze through maze of spar rigging that towered aloft soft seething plash of water along bend light creak cheep of parral sheave up in velvet darkness occasional clank of tiller chain a watchful helmsman with eye upon star peering past weather leach of main royal found necessary to give ship spoke of wheel one way other watch have stowed away somewhere about fore deck doubtless taking quiet catnap somewhere out of reach of heavy dew be not to be seen figure of lookout on topgallant forecastle must be just made out momentarily eclipsing first one low lying star then a paced monotonously to fro athwartships to keep awake a stood there at head of weather poop ladder abstractedly watching man movement suddenly struck that there be one point upon horizon straight ahead where night gloom seemed to be merest trifle deeper more opaque than elsewhere wondered whether might perchance be loom of island highest point of being according to chart eight hundred twenty foot above sea level must now be visible above horizon if be only daylight reckoning happened to be correct fetched ship night glass took good look through at spot at first must make nothing certain of however while still looked bright star suddenly swam into view above spot heart gave great leap heavy sigh escaped for knew from sweep of horizon height of other star about in immediate neighbourhood that celestial body have so suddenly sprung into field of telescope must have just risen above topmost ridge of something solid blotting out small space of sky in quarter something solid must only be island of saint paul island be in sight tudsbery a straight ahead a be possible for man to aim for exclaimed exultantly for feeling of relief from doubt anxiety swift conviction might henceforward confidently rely upon be so great that felt impelled to give audible expression to satisfaction say so mr troubridge exclaimed carpenter coming to side whereabouts do lie sir come stand where be will show answered there now do see that bright star low down in sky just over spot where cathead pass out through bulwark certainly sir see quite plainly answered carpenter then look immediately beneath will see loom of land said can make out more clearly with naked eye than through telescope d see well exclaimed chip doubtfully now that come to mention admit that gloom away down there do look bit thicker than do anywheres else must never have ' noticed if have drawed attention to even now know a must care to swear a to bein ' land said must if did not know to be there wait until day break will see that be right doubt sir doubt at answered chip soothingly be wonder to how have be able to find way to for be only little bit of rock after hextinc volcano have heard people say how far d 'ye reckon be off from now mr troubridge probably about seventeen eighteen mile said ah observed chip then ought to be abreast of soon a'ter breakfast therewith fell into reverie be about hour later that preceded by slight chilling of air first faint pallor of dawn came filtering through velvet darkness ahead stealing

save one solitary gem that hung low in western sky like silver lamp zenith be rich pure ultramarine be fast spreading toward western horizon chasing last lingering shadow of night before great spoke of radiant light be darting aloft from behind island touching into gold few small scattered flake of fleecy cloud floated high over masthead then in moment small faintly gleaming bit of land ahead became transformed a might be with magician wand into block of deepest richest purple bristling with ray of burning gold throbbing rim of molten gold swept into view from behind in instant vanished amid blinding blaze of sunlight flashed across ocean toward transfiguring erstwhile surface of ebony into tremble of turquoise gold outlining spar sail rope in ship with thin golden wire causing bit

after breakfast be square abreast within mile of island having instructed boatswain to pas a close to a be prudent for have heard of shipwrecked people having found refuge there on neighbouring island of amsterdam be desirous to see whether perchance there might be anyone there at moment there be one to be seen at be not surprised for approach have be slow affording ample opportunity to anyone on island to observe make presence known yet signal sign of kind indicating human occupation have be descried true a drew nearer faint wreath of smoke here there be occasionally seen telescope showed that issued from soil not from fire kindled by human agency being doubt result of volcanic action also there be few goat dotted about browsing in group of two three perfect placidity of demeanour be

smaller island intending to subject also to similar inquisition five minute later be running off square before flagging breeze with elusive filmy shadow be a much a must see of island at distance under existing atmospheric condition hovering on horizon over figurehead have just completed making of sketch of jotting down of few note concerning saint paul thought might possibly be useful to time later on in life when somewhat to surprise man wilde of whom have already spoken came up on to poop informed that have somewhat to say to if must spare time to listen to imagining that might have fresh complaint to make regarding food supplied to emigrant closed notebook returned to pocket requested to say on thank said fact be mr troubridge come to morning a representative spokesman of on board ship crew a well a passenger will perhaps simplify matter great deal if tell at outset that be absolutely of one mind regarding matter have be deputed to lay before understand said pray proceed mr wilde for man have paused a though to afford opportunity to speak bowed slightly in acknowledgment of permission to continue resumed when polson boatswain of ship boarded salami informed captain that mercury be bound from liverpool to sydney new south wale in sense statement be true inasmuch a when ship sailed from liverpool captain have instruction to navigate to australia since then many thing have happened a be aware one very important happening however of a yet know nothing be after most carefully weighing point for against have arrived with absolute unanimity at determination that instead of continuing voyage to australia will proceed to pacific ocean where on suitable island for will search until find will establish a little community to be governed upon simple old fashioned patriarchal system of perfect equality object in explaining scheme of ours to be to request that will have goodness to change course of ship accordingly extraordinary statement with concluding request be made in so perfectly calm matter of fact manner in tone of such absolute finality that for space of several second be rendered literally speechless with amazement colossal impudence audacity of proposal took breath away soon collected scattered faculty forthwith proceeded vigorously to remonstrate with visionary enthusiast who instantly recognised must be originator of scheme sit down mr wilde said seating upon hencoop signing to to place beside have sprung upon matter be not to be dealt with dismissed in breath indeed involves so many momentous question scarcely know where to begin by way of starter let ask whether be aware that have right to make use of ship for purpose a have outlined to contract of owner be to convey to sydney land there can claim more from in next place pardon for interrupting broke in companion with indulgent smile uplifted protesting hand believe know must repeat to one of somewhat musty argument be crowding other upon tip of tongue will perhaps save time possibly certain amount of unpleasant friction if inform at once a indeed have hinted to already that have given most careful exhaustive consideration have quite settled among ourselves that none of be anything like weighty enough to divert from purpose know for example that appropriation of ship cargo in carrying out of plan will involve certain amount of hardship loss to owner revolutionary scheme of sort great small be ever yet carried into effect without inflicting loss hardship upon somebody must pas wit of man to devise one did not be therefore prepared to regard phase of question with perfect complacency wonder whether understand that what contemplate be called piracy be punishable with death said of course do dear young friend answered wilde with smile perhaps ought to have explained to that very root foundation of plan be to escape from man made law be compounded of tyranny injustice of grossest kind to revert to old simple patriarchal family idea idea of holding thing in common of abolishing individualism inequality of description of submitting only to such simple law a be manifestly for benefit advantage of besides who will there be to punish for so called act of piracy may rest assured said that there be spot on globe so remote so hidden away that british cruiser will not find sooner later when happens to visit island if ever reach captain will insist upon explanation of how come to be there in short of having whole story told to then mr wilde day of originator of mad scheme will be numbered dear boy said wilde laying hand soothingly upon arm originator of mad scheme a be pleased to put be more than willing to take chance of such happening a suggest so need not discus that point farther may pas on to next question now be will will not help to find sort of island that have in mind no no a saw that be about to refuse hotly decide in negative too hurriedly take time to consider matter because be rather important one to to be important to because if must decide in negative will put to trouble inconvenience of finding navigator be important to because if must refuse will mean that being opposed to must be got rid of for will have enemy secret open among think that best way to get rid of at same time to guard against possibility of doing bad turn in future will be to tie hand heel together attach good heavy weight to neck drop overboard sometime in small hour when woman child be asleep can not be shocked distressed at sight see have considered matter so thoroughly have so completely made up mind what intend to do that can not dream of allowing qualm of conscience of mere lad like to stand in way if have not be expert navigator must have be different affair altogether must have said nothing to must have put ashore on one of island have chanced to find have exchanged with ship for better navigator have proved ability now must either throw in lot with accept alternative think over dear boy let know decision when have fully made up mind will be able to do more easily since a originator of mad scheme accepted leader of on board be intention to take up quarter in cabin for remainder of voyage so saying wilde rose bestowing upon friendly smile made way down poop ladder to main deck few minute later saw steward helping to transfer belonging from steerage to cabin chapter four wilde explains boatswain whose watch now be who have be making pretence of superintending job on forecastle while wilde be talking to presently slouched along deck came up on to poop arrived at head of weather poop ladder paused facing forward appeared to be regarding set of canvas attentively then with very sheepish air joined took seat wilde have not long vacated saw that fellow be dying of curiosity to learn what have passed between ex schoolmaster be determined not to help by opening conversation result being long apparently on part of boatswain embarrassing pause however at length broke ground by remarking with conciliating smile so see have be havin ' yarn with mr wilde eh mr troubridge have told sir of plan that have made up among for startin ' new country have told to intense astonishment have become shipmate with round hundred so of consummate idiot leaving woman child out of question answered sharply ah returned boatswain with sorrowful shake of head felt somehow a must see thing a see same sir hope yes most fervently hope a have be able to persuade ye to jine in with tell that if refuse to do so be to be lashed up neck heel hove overboard with sinker attached to neck fine night when woman child be below do approve of arrangement polson demanded well ca say a altogether answered boatswain fidgeting uneasily where sat hope wo come to mr troubridge hold with forcin anybody to do what want to do see a 'd do very serious harm for to agree to navigate here ship to spot where want took to be a be to be asked to do if must choose to refuse suppose must stand by see drowned if indeed did not lend hand to lash up asked infusing sarcasm must into question mr troubridge exclaimed polson justly indignant must bring monstrous charge against must lift finger to hurt ye sir must have need to for there be lot o ' chap among emigrant ready enough to do mortal thing mr wilde tell to must just go below have nothin ' to do with job by simple mean must secure acquittal of thing call conscience against charge of murdering ejaculated scornfully do know polson that man who consent to murder be whit a guilty a who actually doe deed well dunno answered polson see how can be mr troubridge if man chooses to murder ye what be got to do wi besides what can do hand of have already signed paper agreein ' to obey mr wilde order tut exclaimed impatiently do seriously wish to believe polson that be such utter fool that be unable to discriminate between right wrong with one breath give to understand that must have conscientious objection to permitting man to murder with next intimate having a understand blindly pledged to obey wilde order whatever nature may be conscience will not permit to break pledge let tell man that pledge a be in nowise binding law will hold blameless if choose to break ay yes law retorted boatswain spitting over rail more strongly to mark contempt of system be once tersely denounced a being have take account of law mr troubridge mr wilde have showed that law ai justice have be made by rich men to grind down poor keep down there ai goin ' to be law in here new country what be goin ' to make everybody goin ' to be just a good a everybody else be goin ' to do just what jolly well like just so said have heard that yarn before if knew of country where state of thing existed must take precious good care to steer clear of ca picture to yourself joy of living in place where if stronger man than happened to take fancy to clothes house anything else that belonged to must compel to give up nobody must interfere to say nay be kind of thing be to be expected in country where there be law where everybody be at liberty to do just what jolly well like be astonished to hear talking such utter tomfoolery set down a having more common sense poor man stared at in silence agape with perplexity well will be jiggered exclaimed at last thumping hencoop with fist in bewilderment what be man to do here be that chap wilde man of eddication mind ye mr troubridge come along spin yarn of how poor sailormen be ill treated kep ' down overworked underpaid by rich owner of how law wo hin ' for show plan how can live in peace happiness enj'yment rest of life then turn up knock whole bag o ' trick into cocked hat of ye be right if be right stay a be life poor miserable shellback endin day by sellin ' match in street when be too old too stiff wi ' rheumatic to go to sea longer that bein ' case will give mr wilde plan trial for spell right wrong very well said go own way if will will most certainly regret day when be too late to retrace step let tell polson be attributing position accompanying hardship to wrong cause altogether true state of case be that be ignorant unintelligent man through lack of education did ever go to school never mr troubridge answered companion what little know larned father who be supposed to be wharfinger be too fond of drink ever to be able to hold job consekence bein that poor mother have to keep thing goin ' by takin ' in washin since there be seven of young 'uns took time to find in grub clo'es have money to spare for eddication consekence be did have none when be 'bout 'leven year old thing got to such pitch at home that cut run goin ' to sea a cabin boy in geordie to start with gradually workin ' way up to bein ' bosun a be now ah said well have done good deal better polson than many others in like circumstance be point if father instead of stupefying brain with drink have be sober steady hard working man have done duty by to extent of sending to school must have gained vast amount of valuable knowledge must have cultivated intellect must have learned to discriminate between right wrong must have be able to reason to perceive certain cause invariably produce certain effect must have discovered that knowledge be power that more knowledge man posse higher be able to rise in world instead of stopping at being boatswain must have risen to be first mate then master possibly owner day a other men have done now put that in pipe smoke jumped up went below to fetch sextant up on deck for by time be drawing well on toward noon a day wore on wind fell lighter until by sunset ship scarcely have steerage way consequently be not until next morning that found off island of amsterdam past drifted so slowly that have there be anyone on island must have have ample time to make presence known saw one anything in least resembling signal after skirting western side of island to northern extremity gave order to bring ship to wind gave officer of watch compass course of east south east for cape otway be not going to yield to wilde at first demand not at if must possibly help although talk with boatswain be of anything encouraging character there be still carpenter however thought must sound a to view on visionary scheme of wilde very first step toward realisation of involved act of piracy when came to talk to soon found that be even worse to deal with than boatswain for although perhaps not quite so ignorant a latter be still ignorant enough to be convinced by specious argument of socialist to readily accept doctrine of perfect equality between men like most of whose labour be of arduous character whose life be one of almost constant hardship privation to be dazzled by alluring prospect of being able to live out rest of day on island where according to wilde nature must do work man must only need to stretch forth hand to gather in bounty will do wilde justice to say that manifested impatience while awaiting announcement of decision relative to proposal have made to on contrary when met at cabin table at meal time be very chatty friendly with certain subtle suggestion of patronage in tone however that rather went against grain with asked question until have set course for cape otway island of amsterdam be melting into haze astern of then being on poop at moment when gave course to helmsman hearing direction came up to said be aiming for point in particular in directing helmsman to steer east south east mr troubridge yes said if wind will permit to steer that course long enough will eventually bring within sight of cape otway cape otway repeated um name seems not altogether unfamiliar to a man who have be for year schoolmaster suppose ought to be able to say offhand exactly where be memory upon such matter be trifle weak be afraid perhaps will kindly tell where cape otway be cape otway lie sixty mile more le south west of port philip head said excepting wilson promontory be most southerly headland of australia of course of course exclaimed with little air of vexation dear how marvellously easy seems to forget such detail be afraid system of education doe not attach nearly a much importance a ought to study of geography ah well what matter have done with such trifle hope for remainder of day doe cape otway happen to be on road to pacific mr troubridge yes said be to say if one elect to go south about pacific be big sheet of water there be two three way of getting to from here depends of course upon particular part of pacific to one be bound yes of course agreed wilde then turned suddenly looking keenly in face remarked really know troubridge impress very favourably very favourably indeed will be profoundly sorry if be obliged to part with for seem to to be lad of considerably more than average intelligence that remark of yours touching particular part of pacific to one be bound ' by way have tolerably intimate knowledge of pacific said know nothing of except part lie between australia cape horn take comprises very small portion of whole questioned very small portion indeed agreed ah commented can tell whether there happens to be map of pacific on board ship be quite possible said be pretty well stocked with chart now that come to mention believe there be chart of pacific in rack let go down ascertain will said placing hand within arm gently firmly led off poop may of course have be pure imagination on part manner seemed to say a distinctly a word mistake politeness geniality for weakness believe in putting thing pleasantly when make suggestion intend to be accepted a command descended together to captain cabin now occupied entered with laughingly explaining that be sure must excuse liberty be taking in doing so at once fell to examining label of chart in rack ah here be exclaimed laying hand upon roll labelled pacific ocean let take into main cabin study together laid out flat upon cabin table placed four weight at corner to hold down then bent over sheet studied with extraordinary interest so be what call chart be exclaimed see that varies very materially from ordinary map in give great deal of information about sea not much about land beyond outline began study of by asking meaning of certain mysterious line marking upon then asked number of question respecting various small island dotted about more le in patch upon to answer have to hunt for pacific directory fortunately found in bookcase finally after have thus be engaged for hour more said be perfectly clear to that must be idle for to determine at distance in what particular part of pacific will search for future home that search must be conducted methodically after studying chart very carefully have come to conclusion that best course will be to begin search here indicating with finger point about midway between north western extremity of new guinea pelew island work way in easterly direction have read note asked drawing attention to certain note on chart explaining that caroline marwill solomon group be almost entirely unknown be believed to have many danger in neighbourhood not marked upon chart navigator be therefore cautioned to exercise most extreme vigilance when approaching sailing among certainly have boy answered be to that choice of part of ocean be chiefly due island see be almost entirely unknown ' mean that if can find one among of suitable character for new settlement be not likely to be disturbed by intrusion of curious inquisitive visitor therefore kindly take measure to navigate ship to spot have indicated be on tip of tongue flatly to refuse to have anything to do with scheme to defy to do worst when germ of idea came floating into mind said instead do leave choice of route to because if so will certainly go south about past australia a being much safer route safer possibly not nearly so direct replied wilde therefore since be anxious to begin new life a early a possible let take shorter more direct route past north west of australia through banda sea molucca passage that route positively bristle with danger a might see if understood chart exclaimed in tone of exasperation doubt word for moment dear boy answered wilde soothingly will bear in mind warning of chart will exercise most extreme vigilance ' in midst of danger have not slightest doubt that everything will be right now to change subject have made choice between two alternative submitted to yesterday mean alternative of joining of being drowned asked with vindictive emphasis precisely answered with smile of utmost suavity understand youngster continued with sudden change to sternness in manner that disconcerted great deal more than must have cared for to know if decide to join must do so wholeheartedly with mental reservation who be not with must inevitably be against issue at stake with be of far too grave character to allow of running risk from secret enemy mercy will be shown to traitor assure so permit mind to dwell upon plan in submission be to be only apparent have place leave very much choice remarked if refuse to throw in lot with drown if accept alternative must be unlucky enough to incur suspicion be not acting honestly with what happens hang answered wilde tersely see said choice offer appears to lie between certainty of drowning risk of hanging be by mean certain that must not wiser on part to choose former get over done with at once will think over let know yes pray do so returned wilde in same exasperating tone of suavity before dismiss subject continued let give word of genuinely friendly advice get rid of idiotic idea of choosing alternative of being drowned getting over done with a soon a possible because so long a allow imagination to dwell upon will simply warp judgment prevent from arriving at sound sensible conclusion young man possessing sound mind in sound body a appear to do deliberately chooses death annihilation follows rather than long year of ease happiness comfort will be yours if join so why must eh will think over let know a soon a have arrived at decision repeated make mistake about annihilation come after death be atheist notion if be reckoning upon anything of kind to save from punishment for misdeed in present life be going to be badly undeceived make mistake about boy said laying hand upon shoulder if posse religious conviction retain by mean much good may do try to convert scruple of what term religious character will ever be permitted to deter from taking step may appear necessary to further ensure success of scheme such for instance a committing murder retorted right let tell that hint threat call like will not influence hairbreadth one way other very well dear boy returned be so at least thoroughly understand other be fool with parting shot left proceeding to main deck entered into conversation with of emigrant who be leaning over bulwark idly watching water a ship drove slowly through be fool be excellent advice although given by man whose folly regarded a stupendous determined to follow then proceeded to reason out matter with for be evident must very soon have to come to decision appeared to that there be nothing to be gained by delay in first place be compelled inwardly to admit intensely a disliked wilde stupendous a considered folly there be sound sense in suggestion must abandon idea of throwing away life when came to insisting that if decided to afford help must do so with mental reservation be altogether different affair be compelling to do something to very strongly objected leaving choice between death since have scruple about employing power possessed to thus constrain felt that too must throw scruple overboard in endeavour to defeat have power to compel to help that being case seemed to that must be sound policy on part to afford help with a good grace a must muster so far a mental reservation be concerned resolved that if must find mean to make known what have happened to mercury thus bring british man o war out to rescue ship cargo from scoundrel who be so determinedly bent upon stealing to carry out own mad visionary scheme must do so risk consequence chapter five conditional surrender have just definitely arrived at above conclusion when boatswain joined see mr wilde have be havin ' yarn with ye mr troubridge remarked a seated at side yes answered shortly be there chance of bein ' able to persuade ye to give help want enquired in conciliatory tone there might be perhaps if hand of be willing to agree to term answered stubbornly determined to drive best bargain possible ah exclaimed with air of satisfaction that sound better yes good deal better do say what term of yours be mr troubridge dare say must very soon give ye hidea whether 'd be willin ' to agree to 'em wo find noways unreasonable sir promise ye because want help badly there be use in pretendin ' that have proved to be hefficient navigator chip have quite made up mind that might go farther fare precious sight worse in way of findin ' somebody to take place besides want murder if can anyways help know that hand in fo cbe'le 'd be willin ' to agree to abeost anything in reason to dodge sort of thing do really mean that polson demanded because if so be very great pity that did not frankly say so when matter be first broached besides although sailor may be inclined to listen to reason must remember that can not answer for wilde rest of emigrant oh think can mr troubridge interrupted boatswain ye see sir be way continued sailormen be master of sittyation a sayin ' be wilde lot ca hin ' without help ca navigate ship ca handle there ai one of know enough to be able so much a clew up r'yal take in flyin jib so if want to carry out plan will have to agree to same a what doe d see be willin ' to agree to anything reasonable a may want to propose sudden complaisance on part of boatswain put very different complexion upon whole affair be infinitely better than have dared to hope with entire crew at back ought to have difficulty in keeping wilde lot in proper place well sea have many surprise for who follow who must know what might happen be part of policy to betray to man extreme satisfaction word have given thus perhaps subtly suggest to idea that have displayed more flexibility than be actually necessary to secure co operation therefore said well whichever way affair go be at least glad to hear say that ship crew be willing to agree to reasonable proposition may make still remains to be seen may differ in idea a to what be reasonable know ay of course may think be at likely a will sir answered boatswain state condition mr troubridge will soon tell ye whether seems reasonable not very well said will if understand in out of affair wilde have persuaded hand aboard ship seaman emigrant alike to seek out suitable island whereon can try experiment of living ideal life of socialist be one absolutely determined to give fantastic experiment trial desire to help to extent of finding island for be that be sir yes be have got hit off to happigraphy agreed boatswain then listen to condition upon be willing to do what require of said sort of island that people desire be only to be found if found at in ocean be at present comparatively unknown be full of danger in shape of rock shoal island position of be doubtful a shown by chart while there be doubtless many others have never yet be sighted ship bound upon such errand a ours be liable to blunder up against at hour of day night to navigate successfully ship among such danger a be imperative that there must be one person one only a supreme head to whom rest will render most implicit unquestioning obedience demand to be that one with carpenter a first second mate must command ship nobody must presume to interfere with dictate to in way secondly crew must undertake to observe maintain strict discipline among also among emigrant if need be thirdly decline nay absolutely refuse to acknowledge wilde authority may be king president whatever chooses to call a soon a island be found hand be ashore until then so far at least a be concerned be only passenger now be term upon be willing to undertake service require of may take leave just a please seems reasonable enough wo deny admitted polson dare say a everybody will be willin ' enough to agree to 'em except wilde mean know wo like hidea of not bein ' allowed to hinterfere until arrives at hiland ca ye make that there part trifle easier mr troubridge said resolutely on account on contrary be proviso upon will insist most strongly wilde may be excellent schoolmaster for aught know to contrary be seaman navigator will never consent to being allowed to interfere either directly indirectly with matter of posse knowledge can not have two captain to one ship know if be to be captain will have need of if be to be captain will not allow anyone least of landsman to interfere with ay ay mr troubridge yes can see now a be quite right agreed boatswain must never do to have hinterferin ' givin horders about thing understand if be allowed to do there be others a must soon want to do same then must soon be in pretty mess d mind writin ' condition of yours down upon sheet of paper so a can read out to hand sir if agree to 'em will get to sign paper then will hand back to very well said that arrangement will do excellently see here polson if seaman be willing to sign care brass button whether emigrant do not if men for'ard be agreed that condition of mine be just reasonable need not trouble a to what emigrant think of because know ca take ship from however dissatisfied may be in course ca mr troubridge agreed boatswain grinning appreciatively a though helplessness of emigrant be fact have not hitherto occurred to have now thrashed matter out have succeeded in bringing polson into far more pliant frame of mind than have ever dared to hope for therefore determined to clinch matter at once by putting demand into black white securing signature of crew to before boatswain who be evidently man of influence among must find time to alter view of affair consequently sprang to foot bidding companion await return descended to own cabin carefully wording document drew up form of agreement between on one part crew passenger of mercury on other then returning with to poop placed paper in polson hand after reading over to requested to obtain first signature of crew to beginning with carpenter then of emigrant afterwards returning document to cost nearly three hour strenuous work to secure signature of entire crew emigrant to agreement for in first place found occupant of forecastle one very unwilling a be case with most illiterate people to pledge by attaching signature mark to memorandum although be read over explained to at least dozen time so that thoroughly understood nature of verbally expressed a fully approving of of condition at length however by dint of much persuasion boatswain secured signature mark of occupant of forecastle after entered 'tween deck summoning whole of emigrant to meet fully explained situation to read over agreement then laying document upon table demanded signature to here again encountered quite unexpected amount of opposition wilde stepping forward not only refusing to attach own signature to paper also forbidding of other emigrant to do so polson argued pleaded cajoled in vain nothing that must say appeared to have slightest effect upon audience although several declared perfect readiness to sign if leader must accord permission be not until at length with patience completely exhausted suddenly determined upon adoption of what to seemed thoroughly desperate expedient that achieved even partial success dashing paper down with vehemence upon table exclaimed wrathfully now listen to lot of ye chip hand in fo cbe'le have signed here doccyment because havin ' thought over be agreed that mr troubridge be quite right in demandin ' what do mr wilde there object to because ai allowed to interfere with dictate to mr troubridge none of wo sign because mr wilde wo let ye now will give ye ten minute longer to make up mind if have signed by time sailormen wo have more truck with ye will go to mr troubridge tell 'im can take ship to sydney where be bound to announcement coming quite unexpectedly fell like bombshell among polson audience who have dwelt upon idea of life in island where perpetual summer reign where nature offer many of choicest gift almost unsolicited until have taken such complete possession of that have come to represent to one desirable thing in whole world to lose must be to lose everything in perfect passion of consternation turned upon wilde not only claimed right to sign also insisted that must conform to polson demand be first among to affix signature subjected to such pressure a there be of course one thing for to do did next moment dashed up on deck sprang up poop ladder approaching shook clenched fist in face a exclaimed almost foaming at mouth young scoundrel have signed that precious document of yours because fool polson left option wait until arrive at island power begin then will make hold tongue sir go down off poop exclaimed springing to foot in rage for fellow at helm be grinning broadly at scene if dare to come up here again without being sent for will kick down on to main deck then have put in iron ay will do so now if dare to answer be off with now quick never in life saw man so completely taken aback a be crazy schoolmaster when tackled amazement incredulity wounded vanity indignation bodily fear seemed to be struggling together to assert in countenance to find articulate expression upon tongue fear be strongest of fear that might be actually subjected to unspeakable indignity of personal violence when a uttered final word advanced step toward a though about to carry out threat suddenly turned tail slunk off like whipped cur time later when polson having at length accomplished mission brought signed agreement of course knew be a binding document not worth paper upon be written although still hoped that might be to extent effective related to little incident have occurred between wilde at expressed concern although fully agreed with that schoolmaster at event while aboard ship at sea must be held a amenable to discipline a anyone else that must never do to give least bit more liberty than be prepared to accord to one of other emigrant having secured admission from boatswain sent there then for steward ordered at once to bundle wilde belonging out of cabin back to 'tween deck during second dogwatch same evening wilde sought out boatswain carpenter complained to of what termed tyrannical conduct represented to two listener be of so grossly humiliating character that be calculated very seriously to detract from influence with follower so serious grievance did make of at length polson tudsbery approached with something in nature of remonstrance accompanied by mildly offered suggestion must concede something to enable wilde to preserve dignity probably must have be wiser to have accepted acted upon suggestion have got idea into head that matter have resolved into struggle for supremacy between wilde obstinately refused to yield hairbreadth thereby exciting permanent hostility not only of wilde also a afterward found of several of follower boatswain carpenter be at first disposed to regard a unnecessarily firm feeling soon yielded to one of quiet gratification that have a leader one who young a be must not submit to dictation from anybody feel convinced that may have lost in popularity more than regained in shape of power authority thereby averting a soon have reason to believe many serious dispute quarrel between widely conflicting element be confined so closely together in ship term upon be to command mercury having at length be arranged upon a satisfactory basis a must reasonably expect now found time to give consideration to plan for future a hope that wild scheme of conspirator might be frustrated ship cargo restored to lawful owner rested almost entirely upon possibility that might fall in with british man o ' war first question to devoted attention be that of route must choose by to reach pacific there be two alternative route open to one that perhaps rather safer of two from navigator point of view to south east of australia then northward between solomon admiralty group to water wherein search for sort of earthly paradise be to be prosecuted rather shorter more dangerous route up western coast of australia then through ombay passage into banda sea thence through boeroe strait into molucca gillolo passage successful negotiation of of must bring to spot where search be to commence if question of ease safety of navigation have alone be concerned must have unhesitatingly chosen former when came to weigh comparative chance of falling in with british man o ' war did not take long to make up mind that closer must hug philippine longer must remain in neighbourhood more likely must be to encounter something belonging to china station accordingly settled upon second alternative choice have further advantage being shorter of two route gratified hand none of whom be intelligent enough to understand appreciate question of comparative danger of two route to consider by adopting one met with approval risk of encountering man o war thus having plan knocked on head be very greatly increased naturally did not enlighten be season of north east monsoon in indian ocean careful study of chart directory made clear to that proper course to pursue be to run down easting until degree east longitude must be reached then still availing to utmost of such westerly wind a might be met with haul gradually up to northward in west australian current have northerly set accordingly kept ship bowsprit pointing steadily to eastward despite violent remonstrance wilde addressed to boatswain carpenter have never spoken to since have ordered off poop turned out of cabin for first few day be rather afraid that be going to have little trouble with two men for whenever wilde complained to be unnecessarily prolonging voyage by steering east instead of north east according to crude notion ought to have done came to reiterating man complaint evincing so much curiosity suspicion that be perfectly evident did not trust quickly arrived at conviction that let relation with wilde be what might be absolutely necessary must posse full confidence of boatswain carpenter through of whole crew therefore took considerable pain to make clearly understand reason for acting a did after have further trouble with very soon have reason to congratulate upon adoption of policy

went on deck to investigate upon stepping out on deck reason why nothing must be seen at once became apparent for night be a dark a wolf mouth so dark indeed that even after have be up on poop long

almost a something solid looking down upon main deck waist of seemed to be full of dead body clothing smeared splashed with blood while part of deck whereon lay be deeply dyed crusted with same deep rusty stain a gazed petrified with bell upon poop once more clanged loudly glancing upward saw that figure have already observed lolling in so odd attitude over poop rail be that of dead man grasping in right hand short length of rope attached to clapper of bell attitude be such that a ship swung upon swell body moved just sufficiently to cause clapper to strike single stroke for first few second after have found standing upon ensanguined deck plank of floating charnel house have eye for anything save spectacle of slaughtered crew lying there at foot in conceivable attitude indicative of unspeakable agony terror have distracted last conscious moment then a two seaman who have accompanied from mercury swung in over rail came to side muttering ejaculation of horror dismay at ghastly spectacle that met gaze pulled together with wrench mounting to poop began to take in general detail of scene standing a now be at head of starboard poop ladder commanded complete view of vessel deck

least fifty year old be still apparently quite sound a to hull spar rigging have be evidently well taken care of mounted eight twelve pounder upon main deck four in battery be secured must see nothing to suggest that have recently fought action with ship on contrary evidence be in favour of assumption that people have be taken completely by surprise most probably during night that have be boarded by pirate malay chinese hand ruthlessly massacred ship then plundered set on fire last assumption be based upon fact that longboat from deck of mercury have appeared to be stowed over main hatch have be shifted over to port side of deck hatch removed quantity of cargo broken out hoisted up on deck where now lay confused jumble of merchandise of torn bale shattered package piled high on starboard side of hatchway yawning fire blackened cavity in poop where mizenmast have stood showed that have be on fire in cabin that fire have somehow become extinguished before have have time to get firm hold upon hull condition of body of murdered crew seemed to indicate that tragedy must have occurred time within preceding forty eight hour apparently have be under plain sail when thing happened descending again to main deck calling upon two seaman from mercury to follow next entered poop cabin found to be arranged after manner be very usual at time access to main cabin be gained by narrow passage nine foot in length on port side of next ship side be stateroom be easily identifiable a belonging to chief mate while on starboard side of passage be steward pantry at inner end of passage be doorway door being open hooked back against bulkhead passing through doorway one found in main cabin apartment thirty foot long with three stateroom on side of abaft that again be sail room well stocked with bolt of canvas of varying degree of coarseness several sail many of seemed to be quite new neatly rolled up into long bundle stopped with spunyarn labelled legibly with description of

entrance to stateroom one from main cabin one directly from main deck in fore bulkhead there be window through while still lying in bunk skipper must see everything be happening out on deck observation occupied nearly hour moment entered main cabin nostril be assailed by smell of recently extinguished fire upon looking about finally came to conclusion that fire have not be intentional result of accident miscreant who have boarded vessel have apparently be over in search of anything might be worth carrying away among other place have explored lazarette lay beneath cabin small hatchway just abaft mizenmast giving access to hatchway found open general appearance of cabin seemed to indicate that depredators have roused up number of barrel case broken open for purpose of

on deck did not appear that have taken very much if of ship cargo must not find weapon ammunition of kind if therefore ship have carried anything of sort pirate have cleared whole of out of after giving craft pretty thorough overhaul fore aft making number of note of most important discovery eventually came to conclusion that vessel have be surprised laid aboard during night that crew have be mustered secured most likely with guard over that after pirate have taken that cared for out of ship have brutally murdered hand now became nice question with what if anything ought to do with blood stained derelict although have lost mizenmast there be nothing to prevent being navigated to port have circumstance be different must have called for volunteer made effort to induce crew to undertake navigation of to say batavia with idea of claiming salvage have come to know by time that eloquence of mine even though be backed up by prospect of handsome sum of salvage money must be powerful enough to wean crew of mercury from cherished idea of life of ease independence upon fair tropic island to say nothing of fear of what must follow upon discovery of unlawful appropriation of ship cargo to own use service therefore very quickly yet none le unwillingly abandoned that idea proceeded to consider merit of only alternative left namely of destroying of leaving just a have found excepting of course that in latter case sentiment demanded decent reverential burial of murdered crew considering latter alternative first if left drifting about ocean what be likely to happen on one hand might be fallen in with by ship taken into port on other hand be equally likely that might become death trap to other craft athwart whose hawse might drift on black stormy night whose bow must be stove in destroyed by violent collision with might be swamped founder in next gale that encountered taking thing into consideration at length came to conclusion that best thing to be done be to scuttle so render impossible for to become menace to other craft accordingly summoning two men who be below exploring forecastle fore peak jumped into gig pulled back aboard mercury where arrived just a steward be bringing cabin breakfast aft a sat at table partaking of meal related to polson tudsbery have seen done aboard dutchman informed of decision at have arrived with regard to directing carpenter to take boat crew auger immediately after breakfast go on board scuttle by boring several hole through bottom below water line men fully agreed with that be right proper thing to do at conclusion of meal chip set about making of preparation somewhat to surprise however when little later came aft with tool be followed by four men instead of modest two with have contented who preceded down side into boat when reached braave instead of being absent ten minute quarter of hour at utmost must have afforded ample time to do be necessary whole five of vanished from sight be not again seen until after lapse of full hour more once more showed on deck of derelict passing quantity of thing down side into boat finally about hour later still returned to mercury considerably worse for drink with boat loaded down to gunwale with bolt of canvas new sail other oddment that have appropriated of course there be actual harm in bringing thing away from dutchman because have left on board must have gone to bottom with thus have be wasted felt that chip might a well have paid compliment of first mentioning intention to be even more annoyed that carpenter occupying a did position of authority of however shadowy character have not only permitted men to partake pretty freely of drink have found have evidently not scrupled to partake of with came to conclusion however that remonstrance must be likely to be good deal more effective if addressed to later on instead of at moment when be under influence of liquor therefore said nothing to beyond briefly enquiring how many hole have bored in ship where suggesting to advisability of retiring to bunk to sleep for hour two advice seemed more than half inclined to resent ultimately followed in somewhat belligerent mood chapter seven embayed soon became perfectly evident that muddled with drink though undoubtedly be chip have very effectively executed work of destruction aboard braave for in hour have sunk to extent of very nearly three strake of planking within hour have brought chain plate bolt flush with water at rate three hour must suffice to see last of before moment arrived however little air of wind came

have vanished have left behind small legacy of annoyance for for while be still searching horizon for sign of continued existence became aware of certain raucous sound issuing from forecastle be quickly able to identify a maudlin singing seaman be so prone to indulge in when be worse for liquor presently polson who have gone forward to turn to watch after dinner came aft with expression of vexation upon weather beaten countenance explained that carpenter boat crew having smuggled aboard several bottle of schiedam from scuttled vessel hand forward have become just sufficiently fuddled to render indifferent to such authority a under peculiar circumstance of case be still able to exercise over have flatly refused to come on deck declaring with much abuse of boatswain that did not intend to do more work until have finished drink still remained how much have polson asked dunno sir answered tried to find out scowbanks must tell fancy however that have got so very much for see how four men even five if chooses to reckon chip in with 'em must have brought more 'n about dozen bottle aboard among without findin ' out somethin ' about dozen bottle wo go so very far among hand reckon that will finish lot in course of next hour so then will turn in have good sleep be ready to come on deck in time for first watch luckily there ai no more wind than what know what to do with not much sign of freshenin ' so far a can see so p'rhaps there wo be such very terrible lot o ' harm done a'ter possibly not agreed went on seizing opportunity to point moral be merely happy accident have be blowing hard weather threatening must probably not have made slightest difference in conduct of men chip by listening to falling in with fantastic proposal of madman have set men very bad example effect of be bound to recoil on own head sooner later by taking part in seizure of ship have broken law be mainstay of authority order discipline in doing so have encouraged ignorant creature for'ard to become lawless disobedient have pointed out to before polson now have example very mild example be true of what inevitably happens under such circumstance yes see what mean mr troubridge answered boatswain lor ' bless yer sir think nothin ' at of little spree like here discipline first rate thing admit man can have too much of doe good to chuck overboard now again chap for'ard wo be none worse for here little outbreak of theirs will see enj'ys bit o liberty occasionally know ay answered rather bitterly mischief of be polson that when men in position of noisy rascal in forecastle take upon to determine when for how long time will indulge in spell of liberty be a likely a not to insist upon having at moment when spell disaster for other people liberty be grand thing in theory within certain well defined limit when becomes licence a be very apt to do be bad thing for concerned well sir may be right may be wrong know never havin ' have eddication mr wilde be eddicated man be for

excessively nervous person when with rest of emigrant came on deck after dinner upon particular day heard maudlin drunken singing in forecastle furthermore recognised that ship be for time being at least without crew fell into tremendous rage rushing forward precipitated into forecastle where believing that crew drunk must accord to same reverential attention that be wont to do when sober proceeded to reproach revile in measured term for lapse from virtue actually going to length before anybody must stop of smashing dozen bottle of schiedam that caught sight of snugly stowed away in bunk so long a confined to merely verbal remonstrance abuse men listened to with vacuous good humoured smile of intoxication occasionally interrupting with invitation to join in bacchanalian orgy when took what deemed base advantage of good nature by smashing bottle wasting liquor that one of reveller have incautiously revealed to in support of jovial invitation good humour suddenly evaporated staggering to foot in indignation must probably have done man serious injury have be capable of following up on deck whither precipitately fled then having learned during brief visit to forecastle that carpenter be chief culprit rushed into latter cabin mercilessly aroused poor chip from profound sleep be gradually clearing muddled brain tongue lashed bewildered man until must have scarcely known whether be upon head heel fortunately for schoolmaster chip indiscretion have be mild one indeed compared with of forecastle hand therefore accepted wilde rebuke with tolerably good grace in

from blindly faithful disciple into sullen more than half doubting reluctant follower incident ended a polson have anticipated that must in hand coming on deck at end of first dogwatch clearing brain by plunging head into bucket of sea water after boatswain went forward gave mild more than half good humoured dressing down at same time telling one two home truth in tersely sarcastic strain be far more effective than wilde rabidly intolerant language lost point with to whom be addressed chiefly because of violent exaggeration through contrived in few minute to lose measure of influence that

restraint of lawful discipline only to subject to grinding tyranny of single individual of impulsive temper overbearing disposition sun went down evening in sky glowed like molten copper be streaked with long tatter of smoky looking cloud seemed to presage windy dark night to great anxiety for ship be now navigating comparatively restricted area of landlocked sea chart of be dotted much too

have given to chart directory have so very effectually impressed upon vital necessity for exercise of most extreme caution henceforward that being yet very young quite new to heavy load of responsibility imposed upon be perhaps more anxious than there be actual need for under pressure of anxiety went below again produced chart very carefully laid down upon course distance a indicated by compass log ship have travelled since noon did chiefly because have already ascertained that there lay in ship path two known danger position of be doubtful what have just done resulted in discovery must wind freshen sufficiently during night to increase speed of ship to more than six knot be likely enough to approach within perilous proximity of danger before daylight of next morning accordingly mentioned fact to polson tudsbery cautioning to shorten sail in good time to call must wind freshen a seemed likely to do during hour of darkness a matter of fact not only did wind freshen during first watch also hauled round over port quarter increasing speed so greatly that at length when watch be called at midnight having kept deck in anxiety took precaution of shortening sail to three topsail fore topmast staysail thus ensuring a confidently believed that must keep well clear of pestilent danger while darkness lasted then to add further to anxiety drizzling rain came driving down upon thickening atmosphere to extent that became impossible to see anything beyond ship length distant after driving along through at speed of about five knot for next four hour nervousness became so great that gave order to bring ship to wind heave to determining to await return of daylight before attempting further progress at length faint paling of intense darkness astern proclaimed that long night wet hot steamy altogether unpleasant be drawing to end simultaneously rain ceased enabling to discard oilskin sou ' wester in have be stewing night took mine down on to main deck hung up to drain dry on hook commonly used to hook back starboard door giving access to poop cabin then feeling exceedingly weary with night vigil for have never be off deck since sunset went to own cabin for few minute filling wash basin with cold fresh water indulged in luxury of good wash have effect of considerably refreshing done returned to poop meeting polson whose watch be at head of poop ladder oh here be sir exclaimed in accent of evident relief be just upon p'int of goin down to ask to come on deck again indeed said have there be fresh development then during two three minute have be below well dunno know much about development mr troubridge replied boatswain turn ear to wind'ard sir tell if hears anything at out of common why demanded do hear anything in particular a requested turned head in listening attitude even during brief absence from deck sky away to eastward have paled perceptibly there be already light enough abroad to enable one not only to distinguish principal detail of ship hull rigging also to render visible heaving surface of sea for distance of perhaps couple of cable length be a far a eye must penetrate still somewhat misty atmosphere a glanced outboard attention be instantly arrested by short choppy tumble of water colour be pale chalky blue why polson exclaimed what have happened to sea during night look at colour of hark surely that can not be sound of broken water so have catched troubridge have ye man replied well have scarcely got down off poop just now afore thought heard some'at o ' sort must be sure what told last night about there shoal be supposed to be somewhere ahead of have be stickin ' in mind night makin ' ah did ye hear that sir broke off suddenly again peculiar shaling sound a of water breaking over deeply submerged obstruction came floating down to from to windward yes polson certainly thought did answered in state of considerable alarm to tell honest truth half like more than do movement colour of water let get hand lead take cast of ay ay mr troubridge will be proper thing to do responded boatswain a bustled away down on to main deck wended way forward to bring up lead line ship be already hove to there must therefore be difficulty in obtaining absolutely accurate sounding in couple of minute man be stationed in weather fore chain with line coiled in hand lead weight foot duly armed with tallow sweeping in long swing close over surface of water preparatory to being cast presently weight shot forward plunged into sea fathom two ahead of ship coil of thin line leapt from leadsman hand a ship surged slowly ahead line slackened showing that lead have reached bottom leadsman bringing sounding line up down proclaimed depth eighteen fathom eighteen fathom ejaculated in horrified accent to polson who have rejoined that mean polson that be already on top of one of danger be speaking about last night jump for'ard man at once clear away starboard anchor ready for letting go bend cable to hurry about good fellow a value life may need to anchor at moment in order to save ship daylight be by time coming fast be possible to see with tolerable distinctness round ship to a great distance a haziness of atmosphere must permit still at interval there seemed to float down upon pinion of warm steamy wind curious suggestion for be scarcely more of sound of breaking water if be indeed actual sound not illusion of sens what did mean have already become embayed entangled among intricacy of reef shoal during night have in marvellous fashion blundered past through in darkness be already leaving behind a stood on poop asking question sending glance into mist enshrouded ocean on side of fancied that again caught mysterious sound resembled that of breaking water time seemed to come from ahead looking in direction presently became aware of line of spectral whiteness stretching right athwart hawse seemed to come go even a watched stand by to wear ship shouted a watch sprang to brace signed to man who be tending wheel to put hard up ship with fore topsail aback slowly fell off until be running dead before wind then just a be coming to on other tack mist lifted for moment caught glimpse of vast expanse of white water foaming spouting boiling dead ahead of a seemed to close aboard of lay aft here of haul out spanker shouted flow fore topmast staysail sheet to help to come to call hand to make sail round in upon after lee brace board fore main tack polson be on lee shore here must claw off if can furious battering of boatswain handspike upon fore scuttle brought up watch below with rush sight of white water close to leeward caught by moment that came on deck be hint to stronger than word of necessity for haste causing to spring about deck with display of activity very unusual on part of merchant seaman in few minute ship having come to on starboard tack brought breaker square off lee beam fore main tack be boarded sheet hauled aft dozen of hand be in weather rigging on way aloft to loose topgallantsails royal while two more be laying out upon jibboom to loose jib meanwhile have sprung into lee mizen rigging from situation be anxiously scanning sea ahead upon lee bow to great relief presently saw that ship be looking up high enough to justify hope that must claw off from danger menaced to leeward sea being merely short irregular popple with weight in to set down toward white water meanwhile hand in chain be continuing to take cast of lead a fast a must haul in line with result that seemed to be maintaining depth of about eighteen fathom over rocky bottom composed of coral a have doubt from peculiar whitish blue tint of water by time that topgallantsails royal jib staysail have be set have become broad daylight few minute later sun rose above heavy bank of thunderous looking cloud lay stretched along eastern horizon dispersing mist have hitherto obscured atmosphere affording extended prospect of surroundings scene thus disclosed be alarming enough for when in order to obtain a wide view a possible ascended to fore topmast crosstrees discovered to consternation that be in sort of lake of very irregular shape measuring about eight mile east west by perhaps twelve mile north south surrounded on side by extensive patch of broken water with narrow more le intricately winding channel of clear water between how on earth have contrived to blunder blindfold into trap of place in darkness thickness of past night without touching one of countless reef by be surrounded passed comprehension although believed must make out channel by have entered far away to windward if be right in conjecture must have hove to when be about three four mile to windward of everything then have driven while still hove to along channel finally into lake like expanse of comparatively deep water missing destruction dozen time more during passage by sheer miracle now being in trap problem to be solved be how to get out of again glancing round must see nothing broken water extending right out to horizon look way must with object of extending view ascended to royal yard even at elevation prospect be more encouraging yet stay surely that dark streak away there on northern horizon be blue water yes longer looked at that thin thread of dark colour barely visible broken here there by intervening white patch must be open water furthermore be to leeward therefore to be reached much more quickly easily than open water have left behind sometime during night to return to must be necessary for to beat to windward through more le intricate difficult channel be undoubtedly true that somewhere out there to windward there existed channel carrying sufficient depth of water to float ship for have already passed through difficulty must be to pick particular channel out from among many intersecting streak of unbroken water showed so elusively among breaker if be possible to hit off channel indeed channel leading without break into clear water be wind sufficiently free to enable to lay course along without breaking tack doubted very much if not if at critical moment wind must shift point two ship must inevitably go ashore become wreck for must nowhere see channel wide enough to allow ship to work in arguing thus soon came to conclusion must look to leeward for channel must conduct to open water safety accordingly directed gaze northward for time eye searched that vast expanse of seething whiteness for unbroken channel leading out into blue water from lagoon like sheet of water across mercury be then ratching in vain for while there be plenty of channel leading from lagoon through broken water to leeward not one of seemed to be continuous way across reef right out to blue water intersected merged into branched off from other in most bewildering fashion there be at least dozen seemed to lead into open water quite failed to trace connection between led out of lagoon at length however when ship have reached easternmost extremity of lagoon moment have arrived when became necessary for to go about retrace step suddenly opened out small patch of unbroken water away to north eastward with clear well defined channel leading from to open sea while be still regarding part of reef caught momentary glimpse of channel leading into small patch of unbroken water intently following course presently became convinced that be continuous with channel opened out close ahead of broad on lee bow channel be exceedingly narrow tortuous rapid survey of satisfied that wind be free enough to allow ship to traverse at once determined to make attempt there be time for hesitation be to be done must be done at once therefore hailed polson to keep ship away couple of point minute later mercury have slid into channel be sweeping rapidly along to north east for good for evil die be cast for direction of wind exceeding narrowness of channel precluded possibility of return couple of hour must now decide momentous question whether not be to bring whole adventure to premature conclusion by leaving bone of ship on deadly coral reef chapter eight pirate junk to con ship into along narrow winding channel with possibility of return with certain knowledge that slightest mistake smallest error of judgment meant destruction of vessel drowning of individual on board be nervous work for lad of year a stood there on royal yard with arm round masthead to steady upon somewhat precarious perch gaze concentrated upon thin line of unbroken water twisted hither through seething turmoil of yeasty froth swirling boiling on hand burst into drenching perspiration for must be remembered that have assumed enormous responsibility of plunging ship into inextricable situation have indicated upon impulse of moment generated by conviction that in other manner must hope to escape from labyrinth of shoal in have become involved furthermore have be spurred to act by hope rather than certainty that channel along be now sweeping with what to apprehensiveness seemed headlong speed offered unobstructed passage to open water yet now when retreat be impossible began to fear have be fatally mistaken for at certain spot in channel along proposed to take ship saw that water happened to have be unbroken at instant when arrived at momentous decision be now aboil with foam for space of three four ship length a though impassable obstruction existed there if be case one slender hope remained for hope that before obstruction must be reached might find part of channel wide enough to permit ship to round to anchor thus giving time to make more deliberate search for way of escape hope however be exceedingly slender one for channel be traversing be appallingly narrow averaging very little more than couple of length of ship be considerably le than minimum space required for contemplated manoeuvre while be anxiously searching channel ahead on lookout for such spot suddenly caught sight of channel branching out of one be then traversing unquestionably ran without break into small patch of open water of have already spoken from good channel led into open sea only question be whether there be room enough to allow ship to take sweep out of one channel into other without going ashore upon reef for new channel branched off at very acute angle there appeared to be even le width than usual at junction of two channel here be momentous question for to decide unaided in space of few second for there be not time enough to permit of summoning boatswain aloft consulting upon matter have to make up mind whether to continue along channel ship be then in trusting that appearance indicative of obstruction be illusory whether must take risk of wrecking ship on reef in endeavour to pas round very acute angle into newly discovered channel be by time able to see must certainly enable to reach open water be difficult to determine of two alternative be more desperate a ship went driving along toward point once past choice must no longer be possible fancied that prospect of being able to turn into new channel looked trifle le hopeless than did few minute earlier while appearance of obstruction in original channel be still a menacing a ever therefore determined to put to hazard of die make attempt to get into new channel decision arrived at hailed polson to send hand to station in readiness to brace round yard smartly at word of command for helmsman to respond instantly to signal for manipulation of wheel then a rushed down toward turning point caused ship to be edged gradually up to windward until weather side be scraping coral of reef in order to secure possible inch of turning space at same time narrowly watching channel ahead that might be able to determine accurately precise moment when to shift helm twice thrice in a many second did courage fail determine to take risk of keeping straight head when critical moment arrived be once more master of myself be able to give order hard up with helm brail in spanker shiver mizen topsail polson recognising necessity for prompt action at helm have sent second hand to wheel at first sound of voice two men sent wheel spinning hard over with united strength while at same moment men tending after brace have relieved ship of pressure of whole of canvas upon mizenmast craft accordingly swerved away from wind with almost alacrity of living thing next moment be swirling round a though upon pivot shaving obstructive angle of reef by hairbreadth coming to with wind over starboard quarter when rounding of port bow be actually dashing aside white water while clung to masthead in fear trembling waiting for shock must tell that have struck a matter of fact actually did very slightly graze coral for few foot of length just beneath port main chain for afterwards saw mark upon sheathing be merest touch shock of be scarcely perceptible next moment have luffed fair into centre of new channel be speeding away to northward eastward new channel be so exceedingly narrow tortuous that vessel still needed most careful watching compared with sharp turn remaining portion of navigation be simple trifle over two hour later have extreme satisfaction of seeing mercury sweep clear of edge of reef into blue water to feel once more rising falling upon swell of open ocean then made way down on deck having given officer of watch course retired to cabin to enjoy good breakfast before lying down to recover of arrears of rest at noon on fifth day after exceedingly awkward adventure latitude a computed from meridian altitude of sun showed that have fairly cleared molucca passage have reached water wherein search for ideal island pictured by wilde vivid imagination be to begin therefore gave order for ship to be brought to wind on starboard tack plunged into vast north pacific ocean shortly afterward sighting tulur island on lee beam in course of next day sighted passed two group of island within twenty mile of other standing in close enough to to enable to form pretty accurate idea of character be altogether too small insignificant to meet with wilde approval so left without even taking trouble to land give overhaul on following day ship still heading to northward sighted couple of junk about mile apart steering south be made out from forecastle head about three point on lee bow at four bell of forenoon watch emigrant who be on deck manifested much interest in quaint appearance of craft a approached close hauled there be only very moderate breeze blowing be carrying three of royal there be sea to speak of yet despite favourable condition must confess be not little astonished to see how nimbly two unwieldy looking craft moved over water how close to wind contrived to lie last of course being due to almost absolutely flat set of mat sail weathermost of two looked a though might cross stern at distance of not much more than quarter of mile got up glass have look at when be about two mile distant found nothing very interesting about after have noted strangeness of model rig quaint decorative painting of hull bow of especially being painted to represent human face with great staring goggle eye of most diabolically ferocious aspect grace hartley be standing near when having completed inspection of junk be about to return telescope to becket asked if might be permitted to use of course at once handed instrument to then walked away to attend to business of ship returning to poop when leading junk be within mile of with two mast in line what singular looking vessel be not mr troubridge exclaimed girl withdrawing instrument from eye for moment to speak to of course continued have seen picture of chinese junk one really need to see vessel sailing a be to get complete idea of quaintness of appearance what extraordinary number of men carry be because of peculiarity of rig large size of sail that require so many men n o said doubtfully think not be not aware that junk need exceptionally strong crew do consider that vessel be very heavily manned well be not asked of course have idea how many men junk requires to manage have be looking at two especially nearest one through glass struck that must have at least hundred men on board hundred men repeated incredulously oh surely not must be mistaken twenty perhaps twenty five at utmost must be much nearer mark oh be certain there be far more than on board of vessel be one of peculiarity particularly impressed in connection with answered girl be quite sure kindly let have glass moment said taking instrument from levelling at nearest junk junk however be by time settling away broad on lee beam a drew ahead be showing weather side to be therefore difficult for to get view of deck more so a bulwark seemed to be unusually high one thing however noticed namely that carried eight brass gun apparently about twelve pounder of side a got glimpse through wide port out of weapon grinned seemed to that there be men stationed at in flash thought reverted to braave dutch barque that have fallen in with week ago with cargo plundered murdered crew cumbering deck sang out for tudsbery to come aft that individual being at moment busy upon job on forecastle a be frequently case during watch if happened to be on poop tudsbery said a joined on poop think remember having heard say that have seen service in china trade want to take good look at two junk if have not yet done so give opinion of have have squint at 'em of course mr troubridge answered a handed glass have noticed anything extra partic'lar about so far applied instrument to eye imagine for instance that be cruising in company that be other than honest trading junk asked well dunno replied working away at with glass perhaps be bit strange seein two of out here so close together of steerin ' exactly same course yes by george now come to look at through glass see that be of 'em armed here nearest one mount eight barker of side will be hanged if believe people be trainin ' of 'em upon yes dash if ai 'd better look out sir mean to slap broadside into in minute be dutchman turned faced forward go below of shouted down with at once junk be going to fire upon of may be hurt miss hartley turning to girl who be standing close beside go down off poop get under cover at once if please bang crash eight jet of flame smoke leapt from port battery of nearest junk have by time drawn down broad on lee quarter three cable length distant next instant air round seemed thick with humming missile many of struck hull bulwark of ship making splinter fly while others passed through lower canvas perforating in two three dozen place providing nice little repairing job for hand in of future spare moment hurried glance along deck however assured that nobody have be hurt although there be good deal of screaming among woman while several of child in process of being hustled below by parent started cry vigorously meanwhile miss hartley after pausing moment to stare in astonishment at splintered bulwark riddled sail calmly descended poop ladder made way into cabin well exclaimed chip swamp if ai rummiest go a ever seen that junk pirate junk mr troubridge neither more le in opinion t'other one be better look at sir there go in stay tell ye what sir mean to get in between 'em if can upon word chip believe be right said a more distant of two junk swept up into wind preparatory to going round on other tack if must succeed will be pretty poor lookout for hand aboard ship have arm of description do know with to defend be sure know mr troubridge answered carpenter in tone of great concern have seen none there may be few musket some'at of sort stowed away somewhere down below for know if there be dare say bosun will know where to lay hand upon then best thing that can do will be to go down call boatswain put question to ah here be a polson head showed above poop ladder come up here polson exclaimed be just man want that junk astern of have just treated to broadside of langrage chip opinion of pair of be that be couple of piratical craft have firearm of kind aboard with to defend ship must run for believe that there be case of two dozen musket ammunition down in little bit of magazine abaft lazarette answered polson fancy that there be few round shot for two six pounder of ours will go down have look mr troubridge yes certainly said be quick about too polson to be perfectly frank with half like look of thing junk have just tacked be looking up good point higher than be unless happen to have heel of fancy that be in for warm time boatswain waited to hear more scuttled away off poop again with more alacrity than have seen exhibit since have joined mercury meanwhile watch below awakened by racket have come on deck be having situation explained to with much gesticulation lurid language by comrade watch on deck of whom have knocked off work upon happened to have be engaged be now talking excitedly casting occasional glance from on poop to junk away down on lee bow presently junk have fired into having drawn up fair into wake distant about mile tacked stood after after absence of ten minute boatswain reappeared with news that have found opened case of musket be of new fashioned percussion pattern also generous supply of ammunition for same together with fifty round shot cartridge for six pounder good exclaimed take hand below polson bring up case of musket together with ammunition also few round for six pounder if appearance go for anything will need before long few minute later musket of have be carefully wrapped in well oiled cloth be brought on deck taken out of wrapping well wiped nipple carefully tested with pin loaded powder being measured out from powder horn wad rammed down on top of with bullet on top of then wad on top of to keep bullet in place then brass six pounder be loaded primed two piece of slow match be cut off ready for lighting must confess that looked forward to prospect of fight with considerable amount of trepidation for in first place odds be exceedingly heavy against thirty of crew of whom only twenty four must be armed against probably two hundred moreover lad knew nothing about fighting a must see have not much stomach for while crew of junk be undoubtedly fighter by trade still be clear that be in fix out of there be escape without fight that fact be patent to hand might perhaps influence to do best probably there be among who have never handled musket in life must obviously be useless to put weapon into hand of such men first business must be to ascertain how many men be capable of using firearm therefore directed boatswain to call hand aft to quarter deck where addressed lad said leader plan own folly in abetting have brought into perilous water a may see for two junk be endeavouring to close with be undoubtedly pirate craft unfortunately none of suspected character until be too late now be in trap from can only escape by fighting must not only fight must also beat off for a suppose know if permit to fall into hand fate will be similar to of unfortunate crew of dutch barque with fell in other day now have here two dozen musket with plenty of ammunition also few round for six pounder so be not badly off for weapon if only have men enough who know how to use let a many of a know how to use musket step to front if of know anything about working gun step forward too exactly twenty men stepped to front sixteen of whom declared that must use musket while remaining four announced that be capable of loading firing cannon very well said must do utmost for fight must of who be unable to fight must act a sail trimmer polson tudsbery must take charge of gun steward go below tell emigrant want eight volunteer capable of handling musket must preferably be single men polson may serve out ammunition to musketry men hark ye lad when time to shoot arrives blaze away at random select mark do best to hit now range yourselves along lee rail fire until give word chapter nine beat off pirate few minute later steward returned from 'tween deck followed by seven very decent looking young fellow who appeared a if might have be farm hand announced that knew how to handle fowling piece supposed that musket be not very greatly different to men musket ammunition be accordingly distributed be put among seaman stationed along lee rail left one musket unemployed at be by mean sorry for rather fancied a shot be glad of good excuse to appropriate one of weapon arrangement being now complete have leisure to consider relative position of two junk a regarded ourselves needed single glance to assure that enemy vessel unwieldy awkward a model seemed to be have advantage of in matter of weatherliness for looked up good point half higher than mercury although made more leeway than point half fully compensated for consequence being that junk astern be gradually working out upon weather quarter while junk on lee bow be also hawsing up to windward be slightly faster than however be consequently drawing away from junk astern from hoped have not much more to fear junk on lee bow be certain to give trouble for be gaining upon while be edging up nearer to track minute with result by time that overhauled must be within biscuit toss of other must not hope to escape by tacking ship for must probably be quite a quick in stay a possibly trifle quicker evolution must place broad on weather quarter far enough to windward to permit of edging down on with slack bowline while must be jammed close on wind advantage believed must give heel of enable to lay aboard felt must be avoided at cost for if once crew must gain footing upon deck number be sufficient to overpower instantly therefore determined to slip past to windward run gauntlet of fire that risk terrible a be being to mind le than other having thus decided called to polson to ask how be off in matter of bullet to replied that there be dozen keg altogether being case thought might venture to be trifle extravagant so gave order for keg to be brought on deck for two six pounder to be loaded with bullet practically to muzzle on top of round shot be done four double handful amounting to about one hundred bullet being dropped into gun on top of round shot wad rammed home on top of done two gun be run forward pointed out through two foremost port on lee side of deck be now ready for fight nothing remained to await critical moment with such composure a must summon to aid in one respect be more fortunate than many other ship must have be in same situation for helmsman be sheltered in sort of little hurricane house built of stout planking over wheel be therefore in degree protected from jingal fire indeed hoped that planking of structure must turn out to be absolutely proof against missile usually fired from such weapon expected must be firearm used by pirate thus might hope must avoid being thrown into confusion at critical moment by helmsman being killed disabled at length drew up within point blank musketry range of junk be endeavouring to close upon lee bow gave word for armed with weapon while keeping carefully under cover to open fire upon of pirate who might expose almost immediately dozen shot rang out from deck few splinter flew aboard junk must neither see hear that further mischief have be done watch port lad fire through ordered if can shoot down men at weather battery during few minute that be passing will have nothing more to fear at moment perfect giant of man ascended short poop of junk stood calmly watching occasionally saying word two to on deck beneath have scarcely taken up position however before men began to blaze away at presently bullet knocked hat off while a be calmly stooping to pick up again bullet must have struck on right shoulder for saw suddenly clap hand to part hastily retreat from exposed situation without stopping to pick up hat hurrah lad shouted there be first blood to keep pot boiling shoot until can see somebody to shoot at at moment weather bulwark of junk became suddenly lined with men armed with jingals with proceeded to blaze away at dozen more missile went whizzing past most unpleasantly close to head nobody be hurt however men returned fire with commendable steadiness scoring few hit if one might judge by cry arose on board junk suddenness with five six of people sank out of sight behind bulwark then fresh hand appeared showing suddenly above rail taking rapid aim pulling trigger vanishing out of sight not always quickly enough however to dodge bullet people sent whizzing about ear thus far not one of mercury people have be touched critical moment be yet to come be now close at hand however for figurehead have drawn up level with stern of junk there be not more than fifty fathom of water between two craft might expect broadside at moment felt that be scarcely possible for to receive at such very short range without receiving very severe punishment therefore exhorted people to maintain hot fire upon port of junk feeling convinced that bullet passed through must be almost certain to find billet in body of chinaman thus tending to flurry gunner possibly cause to shoot wide be now so close that be able to see that junk needed trifle of lee helm to keep close to wind have sooner noted fact than saw man show head for instant above break of junk poop sign to helmsman to put helm hard down guessed in instant what meant be about to throw junk into wind in hope that must fall aboard of when must pour starboard broadside into board amidst smoke must not possibly have hit upon plan more likely to succeed to be fatal to recognising deadly nature of peril yelled to people at once to fling flat on deck did with almost laughable promptitude at same time seized musket thus far have not fired kneeling down with one of poop hencoop a rest aimed straight at body of junk helmsman just a be thrusting tiller hard down pulled trigger instant have man covered down dropped motionless ponderous tiller escaping from grasp swinging heavily back amidships with result that junk be already coming to at once fell off again at precise instant when whole starboard broadside burst into flame smoke missile luckily passing just ahead of very considerably damaging figurehead doing worse injury by most fortunate chance have made lucky shot at exact moment alone must save from disaster to give pirate due at least dozen men instantly sprang up on poop rushed aft to replace injured helmsman people have be watching through number of peep hole what be happening sooner did see chinese on poop than leaped to foot opened fire upon with such murderous effect that half of dropped while other half turned fled from poop seeking shelter under cover of craft bulwark left thus to herself junk gradually fell broad off presenting quarter to opportunity thus afforded to pour into partially raking fire be much too good to let slip shouted to boatswain chip to send content of piece into starboard bulwark hoping that at least of bullet must enter open port do certain amount of execution two men have evidently be expecting such order have got piece ready levelled couple of second later two six pounder barked out together two hundred bullet peppered junk bulwark most handsomely many of penetrating planking a must see hear for next instant dreadful ear splitting yell arose from deck of craft telling tale of very severe punishment be not two round shot likewise crashed through bulwark very effectively one of dismounting gun while other brought craft mainmast down thus effectually placing hors de combat two shot must have wrought terrible havoc among junk crew for not only did not attempt to return fire allowed vessel to run broad off before wind squaring away foresail better to do so presently junk in wake abandoned chase bore up to join consort thus emerged marvellously well from predicament at one moment threatened to be exceedingly serious too without slightest injury to so much a single one of company be remarked that wilde have most scrupulously refrained from obtruding presence on deck during little brush with junk exhibition of pusillanimity on part of man who aspired to position of head leader of little community provoked great deal of adverse criticism considerably reduced influence popularity on fourth day following above incident with appearance of dawn sighted land ahead a drew nearer resolved into three island lying close together largest of measured about eight mile long by three mile wide while remaining two be roughly circular in shape measuring about mile in diameter two smaller island presented appearance of low pyramid with rounded top highest point rising eight hundred foot above sea level while biggest of three rose somewhat abruptly from water to height of about fifteen hundred foot at extremity preserved that height pretty uniformly from end to end with elevation rising perhaps three hundred foot higher almost in middle of length three of island be well wooded largest have be cleared to extent of timber cleared ground bearing evidence of being under cultivation of course indicated that at least largest of island be already inhabited be therefore unsuited to requirement of wilde follower who wanted to find spot where must be reasonably free from risk of molestation by hostile native nevertheless be decided to approach island little nearer if only for chance of being able to procure fruit few fresh vegetable for hand be by time pining however since knew nothing of character of inhabitant be under sort of general impression that native of island of eastern sea be of more le treacherous character while at least of be very strongly suspected of cannibalistic tendency determined to adopt possible precaution musket be accordingly brought on deck loaded while man who have not musket served out to took care to provide with weapon of sort even though be more formidable than belaying pin also insisted that ship must be kept under way in order upon first suggestion of treacherous design upon part of native might be able to make sail stand out to sea again approaching lee side of biggest of three island one hand be sent aloft into fore topmast crosstrees to keep sharp lookout for submerged rock while be sent into fore chain with hand lead then clewed up course royal topgallantsails hauled down flying jib of lighter staysail furled nothing leaving in state to be set again from deck at moment notice water in immediate neighbourhood of island be deep bottom being reached with hand lead until be within mile of shore at distance brought ship to wind laid main topsail to mast a be seen that many native have gathered on beach be making preparation to launch canoe several of be hauled up on dazzlingly white sand kept ship telescope steadily bearing upon craft numerous native who swarmed about be greatly relieved to see that latter appeared to be busily engaged in loading former with basket of fruit fish quantity of fowl while nowhere must discover anything resembling weapon that people be quite accustomed to bartering of produce with passing ship have be taught to understand that must not be allowed on board be evident for although within next half hour be surrounded by quite hundred canoe of various size ranging from sixteen foot craft with two occupant up to vessel measuring fifty foot over manned by from twenty to thirty native not one attempted to come alongside until specially invited to do so simply lay off few fathom held up to view ware that have for disposal then waited to be beckoned to approach native be for most part fine lithe active looking men of deep rich bronze colour most of be almost naked adorned with necklace of shell shark teeth hair so arranged that stuck out round head like thrum of twirled mop few of wore necklace armlet of vari coloured bead of appeared to be inordinately proud adornment furnished many of people with hint a to kind of article most desired in exchange whole basket of assorted fruit a heavy a one man must conveniently lift being freely parted with for hank containing five string of ordinary glass bead at home must cost about penny next to bead copper wire appeared to be most prized commodity nail coming next such basket of fruit a have just described dozen fowl costing twenty two inch nail while dozen basket of fruit be eagerly offered for single six inch spike fish hook too commanded good price be to say two basket of fruit one dozen fowl sold for single hook fish of several basketful be brought off be to be have almost for asking basket containing about fifty pound weight of delicious fresh fish being gladly given in exchange for single ordinary pin at such price a crew emigrant must willingly have taken a much a native have for sale if must have allowed be afraid to let have too much fresh fruit at once lest must make ill took fowl that must get hold of killing enough to serve hand for dinner day putting rest into coop have by time become almost empty took nearly two hour to complete purchase for must not allow more than four canoe alongside at same moment when have acquired a much produce a thought prudent to lay in at one time mainyard be swung fore main tack boarded resumed voyage parting from native with mutual smile upon best of term be very much gratified at first experience of intercourse with pacific islander for seemed to that must be impossible to find more quiet amiable peace loving race of people on face of earth made mistake of judging whole by very few set down story have heard of treachery cruelty blood curdling tragedy a malicious fable be speedily disillusioned however for week later reached caroline island while found of islander a friendly disposed a above mentioned there be others who did utmost to entice to land place ourselves within power on one occasion when failed in produced hidden weapon resolutely attacked ship giving that must do to beat off more le seriously injuring three seaman two of male emigrant little experience taught much needed lesson in prudence for be more by luck than good management that avoided capture general massacre must most assuredly have followed for next five week cruised among island vainly seeking earthly paradise wilde have taught hand to expect with le than none of must be satisfied for such island a seemed to approach wilde standard in matter of size fertility be already inhabited that too for most part by native whose pressing invitation to land lavishly proffered hospitality have learned to regard with something more than suspicion while uninhabited island be invariably found to be wholly lacking in essential feature then leaving carolines behind passed on to marwill group where atoll have already encountered in somewhat modified form here there among carolines be to be found in typically perfect development here island such a be be entirely of coral formation of diminutive area generally not more than six eight foot above surface of ocean vegetation consisting of few coconut tree with maybe patch two of coarse grass here there possibly few stunted bush whole constituting more le irregularly shaped belt enclosing saltwater lagoon usually with entrance from open sea with water enough inside to float ship sometimes with entrance at fortnight among atoll sufficed to convince most optimistic among that what be looking for be not to be found in neighbourhood accordingly bade farewell to group to intense relief for between shoal current be worried very nearly into fever scarcely dared to leave deck day night once clear of marwill island stood away to northward gradually hauling round a wind favoured to about west west occasionally sighting small island more frequently broken water until at length when have be out from marwill group close upon three week land be made at daybreak bearing two point on lee bow be at considerable distance for showed soft delicate of tint a cloud in brilliant light of newly risen sun that be good solid earth be clear enough from fact that did not in slightest degree alter truncated conical shape a minute sped true there be land shown on chart at precise spot did not alter fact of being there since showed above horizon from deck at distance estimated at fully fifty mile be concluded that must be of fairly respectable size quite worth looking at more closely helm be therefore shifted kept dead away for ship be slipping along at about seven knot before nice little easterly breeze under plain sail being a much canvas a cared to show bearing in mind fact that not infrequently of late have be obliged to haul wind rather suddenly in consequence of white water revealing unexpectedly at great distance ahead although be travelling at quite respectable pace for mercury did not appear to be decreasing distance from land ahead nearly so rapidly a have anticipated circumstance led to conclusion have considerably underestimated that distance in first instance conclusion proved to be correct for at six bell in afternoon watch be still fully seven mile from island have arrived within four mile of what from fore topmast crosstrees have be able to identify a barrier reef appeared to extend from northern to southern extremity of island indeed might completely surround for aught must tell enclosing magnificently spacious harbour three mile wide between island estimated to measure about ten mile long from north to south with peak apparently crater of extinct at event quiescent volcano approximating to three thousand foot high rising almost in centre of be wooded from inner margin of somewhat narrow sandy beach lined to within about three hundred foot of summit of peak most promising of from point of view of wilde follower there be canoe on beach other sign of inhabitant chapter ten arrive at island surf be breaking heavily over whole length of barrier reef experience among caroline marwill island led to believe that somewhere in reef break might be found wide enough to allow passage of ship through examining long line of leaping surf very carefully through ship telescope at length thought detected passage two three mile to southward of point at ship bowsprit be pointing accordingly hailed deck directing helmsman how to steer for at same time requested polson to join there polson exclaimed what think of for island upon to settle ought to be big enough to accommodate hand of with room to spare soil be fertile if one may judge by luxuriantly wooded appearance thus far have be unable to detect sign of inhabitant upon do think good enough to justify in attempting to find way through reef in order to get closer view of do repeated boatswain feasting eye upon lovely prospect island presented in ray of afternoon sun happened at moment to fall at just proper angle to reveal clearly gently undulating character of island scored here there with ravine seemed to promise not only series of charming prospect also abundance of fresh water from stream have origin in central peak yes mr troubridge most certainly do if way can be found of gettin ' at place why be very kind of island a have be picturin ' in mind ever since chap began to talk about plan except yonder island be good bit bigger altogether more promisin ' than 'd ever hoped to stumble upon how be that there line of surf goin ' to be passed through mr troubridge take glass polson said very carefully examine spot immediately over jibboom end to mind there seems to be very narrow patch of unbroken water there may yet prove wide enough to take ship through with leading wind ay sir answered polson see what mean there certainly do look to be bit of passage there narrer a look may a say be wide enough for mercury to slip through what be two p'ints on mainland just over break with blue shadder showin ' beyond look to somethin ' like bit of cove harbour of sort looked at spot indicated thought must detect something of kind suggested by boatswain unaided vision be not strong enough to enable to be sure therefore borrowed glass from polson then saw that there be indeed indentation of sort have appearance of being spacious enough to give harbourage to ship that however be point did not call for immediate settlement although be certainly to be kept in mind meanwhile ship running off with wind now couple of point over port quarter have be sliding rapidly down toward reef have by time drawn so near felt morally certain not only of fact that there actually be passage through also that be wide enough for ship to go through yet did not altogether like idea of pushing ship through without further ado for rather unpleasant thought have flashed through mind at once proceeded to communicate to boatswain now look here polson said be undoubtedly passage through reef a draw nearer to grow more disposed to believe that may be possible to take old mercury through yet be strongly opposed to idea of doing anything hastily what mean be continued in answer to quick glance of half suspicious enquiry that flashed upon there be sign that can detect of native upon island yet there may be hundred ay thousand of there for if so what be to prevent having in sight day to day hiding canoe otherwise obliterating indication of presence in hope that by so doing may be tempted to pas through reef come to anchor under lee in pretty close proximity to island once through passage polson with wind a be now must be in trap from might be difficult if not absolutely impossible to escape in event of being attacked by strong body of hostile native now idea be if be to enter lagoon evening by time that have come to anchor rolled up canvas must be altogether too late to go ashore explore satisfactorily that island a said just now if there happen to be hostile native there might find in exceedingly awkward fix propose therefore instead of attempting to go inside to night must shorten sail to three topsail go round under lee of island heave to stand off on until daylight if do at once may hug lee side of a closely a please subject that side of island to pretty searching scrutiny while be still daylight if lee side be a bare of sign of inhabitant a weather side seems to be think may venture with tolerable safety to go through passage to morrow morning a soon a there be light enough when will have whole day in to explore island what say yes mr troubridge be quite right sir answered boatswain that there island look most terrible temptin ' shinin ' there in a'ternoon sunlight must dearly like to stretch leg by takin ' run ashore there afore turn in to night a make doubt be case with hand what say be right sir what propose be proper thing to do will go down on deck start shortenin ' sail at once sir yes if please polson answered meanwhile will remain up here see a much a can whereupon polson descended rigging taking charge proceeded to clew up haul down until canvas be reduced to three topsail fore topmast staysail afterward sending hand aloft to make harbour furl of everything by time that be done have run down to within mile of opening have detected in reef now perceived to be wide enough to allow of passage of not only single ship of dozen vessel abreast of tonnage of mercury at distance from reef at elevation above level of water be possible not only to see also to make out that fringing reef stretched along almost entire eastern face of island to northern southern extremity of barrier reef be united with one opening in namely one have already discovered fringing reef whereabout of be indicated by pale blue tint of water varied in width from two mile at north eastern extremity of island where barrier reef joined to average of about mile along rest of shore except for break of two mile in length at point where polson have detected indication of cove inner harbour much determined hailed deck instructing boatswain to haul up to southward when have brought passage through reef in line with summit of peak again hailed to take bearing of latter to serve a guide when running for passage on morrow bearing found to be north west by west quarter west of made note in pocket book sun be within hour of setting when at length having closely skirted southern shore of island opened out western side aglow a be in golden light of evening presented picture of absolutely fairy like beauty wooded slope revealing in nearer distance thousand varied tint of verdure from brilliant yellow to deepest olive relieved here there by great patch of white scarlet purple other lovely tint must only proceed from immense mass of blossom of kind a blaze of rich varied colour receded from eye into middle more remote distance gradually merged into pervading tint of delicate exquisite ethereal grey with gradual unfolding of charming picture presented by western side of island seemed to throw hand down on deck into ecstasy of delight judging from continuous exclamation of rapture reached from below a fresh beauty swung into view with progress of ship became apparent that barrier reef existed only on eastern side of island fringing reef seemed to run round with narrow margin of dazzlingly white coral sand above high water mark land seemed to rise everywhere from beach at very gentle slope vegetation came down right to inner margin of sand in fact there be thick fringe of what took to be coconut tree growing all along edge of beach encroaching upon so far in place that root of tree must be actually washed by salt water at top of spring tide search shore a carefully a might now that be to leeward of island did not hesitate to approach ship to within quarter of mile of edge of reef in order might obtain best possible view must discover sign trace of human being there be open patch of delicious greensward here there visible among clump of tree suggestion of cultivation there be canoe on beach indeed greatly doubted whether must have be possible for canoe to pas through line of surf boiled swirled along edge of reef even on lee side of island must detect feather of smoke rising among tree other sign of human occupancy although be now so close to land evening light smote upon so strongly that have there be native moving about on beach in nearer open space must scarcely have failed to see ship now under lee of island moreover under short canvas did little more than barely drift to northward along western edge of reef long before arrived off north western extremity of island sun have set have become too dark for to complete survey of lonely lovely spot yet have seen enough to assure that there be only one place along lee side at must be possible for ship to anchor even there although place in question took form of bay did not altogether like look of for nearly area consisted of fringing reef upon if ship be to drive ashore during sudden shift of wind must infallibly go to piece in few minute might possibly be made to do failing better place by riding with anchor down determined to have look at polson cove round on weather side of island under shelter of natural breakwater formed by barrier reef before risking ship by taking into such unsatisfactory anchorage second dogwatch have passed before drew out clear of island once more felt full strength of breeze whereupon gave instruction for ship to be kept full by on starboard tack until four bell in middle watch when officer of watch be to wear ship come to wind on port tack heading to southward for island again weather side of considered ought to fetch by daylight in good time to allow of passing through reef coming to anchor about breakfast time first ray of morning sun be flashing off placidly heaving water into cabin when chip awakened with news that peak of island be broad on lee bow that there be now light enough to enable to see way in through reef accordingly turned out went forward to get usual douche bath under head pump prior to dressing taking note on way of fact that be still ten mile to northward eastward of opening in reef moreover wind be blowing very gentle breeze pushing ship along at scarcely more than three knot therefore so far modified arrangement of previous night a to give order for breakfast to be prepared hour earlier in order that meal might be disposed of before real business of day began long before cook husky note summoned emigrant messmen to galley to receive morning allowance of cocoa tin of lobscouse hand be on deck emigrant gathered in waist of ship leaning over lee rail devouring with eye beauty of lovely island fresh green sparkling with dew of past night be rather amusing to note that many of people especially woman child have donned best clothes in to go ashore a though be festive occasion by time that breakfast be over ship have drawn well down toward southern extremity of island at length peak be brought to bear by compass north west by west quarter west by knew that passage through reef be now in line accordingly bore up wore round heading straight for peak slinging ship telescope over shoulder once more wended way aloft to fore topmast crosstrees in order that from commanding elevation might perform delicate task of conning ship through passage in reef at same time maintain sharp lookout for what now seemed to be only peril to be guarded against namely possible existence upon island of hostile native although be four mile from reef when bore up have not slightest difficulty in discovering whereabouts of passage through immediately upon arrival in crosstrees now at once brought telescope to bear upon in search of possible danger in form of sunken rock for although apparently narrow stretch of unbroken water be sure indication of break in continuity of reef be just possible that there might be detached rock two in fairway lying deep enough to allow swell to roll over unbroken yet not quite deep enough to permit ship of size of mercury to pas over prolonged inspection with aid of glass failed to reveal such danger in course of next half hour have drawn so close in must see a much in direction with unaided eye a with telescope therefore diverted attention for few minute to more distant beach still more distant open grassy space of island in search of possible indication of life movement here too quest be vain for nowhere must detect slightest sign of life except of bird few gull pelican being visible busily engaged in seeking breakfast on water of lagoon while be also possible to detect occasional flash of wing among tree so thickly clustered on slope of island at moment arrived when became necessary for to give undivided attention to passage through reef ship have now approached to within distance of couple of cable length while air be vibrant with deep hoarse thunderous roar of surf eternally flung in foam fury upon ten mile of submerged coral wall have spoken of a reef wall reef must now see be of tolerably uniform width of about one third of mile throughout length top be so nearly level with surface of ocean that constituted very perfect breakwater excluding from lagoon enclosed surface disturbance except trifling amount caused by incessant beat of surf upon revealed in form of eight ten line of miniature swell sweeping inward from reef losing in smooth sparkling surface of lagoon within distance of mile thus far have failed to discover submerged danger in passage through reef be now so close in must have seen through clear transparent water have such existed therefore directed helmsman how to steer so a to take ship through middle of channel now revealed a opening fully sixteen hundred foot wide minute later surged into on back of swell crashed down upon reef to right left of with roar made one very ear tingle while spray snow white sparkling in dazzling sunshine like countless million of diamond leapt into air a high a maintop to fall cable length to leeward in glittering shower upon seething turmoil of lace like foam swirled hither thither above reef five minute sufficed to accomplish passage through reef when found gliding gently forward upon placid surface of lagoon formed magnificent crescent shaped natural harbour ten mile long by about two half mile wide at widest part tapering away to nothing at northern southern extremity where barrier fringing reef united floor of lagoon a must distinctly see from elevated post of observation be composed of fine white coral sand with sign of rock other obstruction upon so far a sight must reach of course have leadsman in chain taking continual cast of lead a proceeded from appeared that depth of water in lagoon close up against inner face of reef amounted to seven half fathom shoaling very gradually regularly a neared island exceeding beauty of evoked continuous chorus of admiration from delighted emigrant a many attraction unfolded at approach upon clearing passage through reef have shouted instruction down to man at wheel to haul up couple of point to northward have brought jibboom end pointing fair between two headland opening into indentation have termed polson harbour now judged from what must see to be of quite respectable extent have intention however of attempting to take ship into without first subjecting to something in nature of preliminary examination therefore now called to on deck to stand by to let go anchor to polson responded that be ready for letting go stand by to let run topsail halyard be next order be obeyed with rush a of parcel of schoolboy eagerly anticipating holiday allowed ship to drive ahead little farther until have arrived within mile of two headland now saw be about quarter of mile apart then gave order hard down with helm let come head to wind closely followed by let run topsail halyard next moment with screaming of sheaf rattle of parrals three topsail yard slid down topmast brought up with thud upon cap to accompaniment of jubilant cheer from crowd on deck then minute later when ship have lost way followed order let go anchor succeeded by yell from carpenter of stand clear of cable few clinking stroke of hammer sudden plunging splash of anchor into placid water of lagoon rattling roar of cable through hawse pipe chip snubbed with twenty five fathom shackle just inside hawse pipe depth of water alongside being deep five fathom then men sprang into rigging laid out on bowsprit to furl topsail fore topmast staysail then turning about with face toward stern of ship seated comfortably in crosstrees once more bringing telescope into action proceeded again to subject island to searching scrutiny be now so close to have there be human being upon must scarcely have failed to detect indication of presence search a must sign of life save that of bird must discover therefore finally came to conclusion strange a might be lovely island be actually uninhabited therefore in respect perfectly suited to experiment wilde disciple be about to attempt upon did appear le suited in other respect size be ample fertility indisputable apparently exuberant glimpse of tiny rivulet of water must be caught here there flashing sparkling through glade there appeared to be noxious animal upon to endanger life so far a beauty be concerned place seemed to be perfect eden wood being gay with flowering shrub tree everywhere diversified innumerable shade of green with great splash of vivid gorgeous colour must much fault be found with climate for although island lay well within tropic constant sea breeze must certainly temper heat render perfectly endurable people on deck seeing how be engaged waited with exemplary patience until must make move moment rose to foot prepared to descend rigging there be rush to part of deck must first touch upon return from aloft individual in crowd evidently charged with question fully intended to fire off at without further delay while descending ratline therefore hastily prepared little speech hoped must not prove disappointing to chapter eleven end to responsibility a stepped out of rigging on to rail stood there grasping backstay there be sudden rushing together of crowd eye sought mine few of more eager one stretched out hand a though to grasp thus establish sort of claim to immediate attention have inclination to subject to sort of cross questioning might be expected from folk of class of emigrant be largely composed therefore raised hand for silence to command attention when saw that be ready to listen to began can see said that be very naturally anxious to learn what have be able to discover concerning yonder beautiful island during long stay aloft will therefore embrace opportunity have given by assembling yourselves together to tell collectively result of observation to begin with size of island of be probably a well able to judge a be roughly speaking be of circular shape a have already have opportunity to see for yourselves estimate diameter to be a nearly a may be ten mile must give area of somewhere about seventy eight half square mile upwards of fifty thousand acre of probably three quarter will be found useful for purpose to may wish to put therefore think will agree with that island be amply large enough to accommodate find plenty of employment for remainder of life have seen several stream of water evidently fresh flowing down slope be therefore not likely to perish of thirst on contrary there must be abundant supply judging from evidence of abounding fertility that see everywhere have observed sign of animal noxious otherwise do very well understand how must get here taking into consideration fact that there be other land near at hand from must have come be not likely therefore to experience trouble from source lastly have seen sign of inhabitant must therefore appear that title to island be a good a of anyone else loud cheer continued think must be altogether wise to assume that island be uninhabited simply because have be unable to discover from aloft trace of human presence for aught that know to contrary place may be swarming with native eager to obtain possession of ship cargo since first entered water have have more than one opportunity of judging what must be likely to happen must be so unfortunate a to fall into power of such people therefore propose that instead of hand swarming ashore leaving ship to take care of herself a see seem inclined to do musket with good supply of ammunition will be served out to most capable of making good use of half of number will go ashore a exploring party to examine island thoroughly while other half will remain aboard to take care of ship then when have satisfied yourselves that there be hostile native to molest will take ship into yonder cove hand can then land without fear last proposition of mine be evidently extremely unpopular with one more so than wilde who thrusting through crowd hotly demanded to know who thought be must presume to dictate to a to who must who must not land there be few level headed one among party who while freely acknowledging how tantalising must be to left on board to gaze upon island without being permitted to land upon be quite able to recognise prudence of suggestion among being polson carpenter at length after much animated discussion not altogether free from flavour of acrimony proposal be adopted difficult task of choosing who be to form exploring party be proceeded with wilde demanded that must be included among party upon ground that be originator of scheme have brought to island a saw particular reason for resisting demand allowed to pas unchallenged merely insisting that polson must be leader of expedition while four others must necessarily have to be seaman in order to handle boat bring quickly back to ship in event of anything in nature of hasty retreat becoming advisable thus five of twelve explorer be seaman whole of personally nominated being careful to choose most steady reliable for so important service while remaining six be chosen by lot from among unmarried male emigrant point being at length settled packet of refreshment consisting of cold meat ship bread be served out to member of expedition largest of quarter boat be lowered brought to gangway whole party bundled down side into pushed off amid half envious cheer of rest just before started drew polson aside gave view upon manner in considered that exploration ought to be conducted impressed upon fact that be leader of expedition must exact strictest obedience from member of promised to do allowed exploring party to get fairly away from ship then causing second quarter boat to be lowered sent four hand down into with lead line followed then headed after first boat toward harbour suspected to exist inside two headland first discovered by polson object being to make rough survey of harbour before attempting to take ship into fact must allow only four seaman to accompany occasioned further discontent among number who be obliged to remain aboard ship cared nothing for be quite determined that unnecessary risk of kind must be run since people appeared unable to think for wilde seemed to have a little idea a rest of of what precaution ought to be observed just resolved to think for at least until be safely ashore must feel be longer responsible for safety after might take a many risk a pleased a in second boat neared two headland formed approach to inner harbour assumed much more imposing appearance than have presented from deck of ship rising sheer out of water to height of nearly quite two hundred foot in form of precipitous cliff of dark rock sloped away on hand until at distance of about mile to right left dwindled away to nothing be lost in verdant slope that rose gently from outside beach started sounding a soon a boat pushed off from ship side instead of heading directly for inner harbour pursued zigzag course athwart toward mouth of arm of zigzag measuring about mile did in hope of discovering hidden danger might perchance lurk in track of ship on way into inner harbour found none floor of lagoon seemed to be a smooth almost a level a of ballroom sloping very gradually up from deep five fathom where ship lay to four half fathom between two headland when at length got fairly in between two headland what surprise be sprung upon have expected indeed utmost extent of hope have be that inside two head might find snug little cove just large enough to allow ship room to swing in to astonishment of when got inside found in splendid landlocked basin measuring about two half mile long by about one three quarter mile wide by far largest part of area lying to south westward of entrance on inner side two head presented very much same appearance a did outside be to say sprang sheer out of water a practically vertical cliff gradually decreasing in height until at about distance of mile from harbour entrance disappeared altogether merging into general gentle upward slope of land from water edge where cliff ended beautiful sandy beach began having sweep of fully three mile round back of basin be on beach that exploring party have landed when entered basin there be other boat stem hauled up on beach painter made fast to oar loom of have be driven deep into sand instead of lying off afloat with two hand in a boatkeepers ready for emergency a have directed be little annoying to find one instruction disregarded so flagrantly reminded that with berthing of ship in basin must have accomplished have be demanded of henceforth must expect to be treated a nonentity that of course must leave quite free to think out plan whereby to effect escape return to civilisation for wilde socialistic doctrine did not in least appeal to not even prospect of passing remainder of life upon beautiful fertile island must reconcile to however there be plenty of time before in to work out plan of escape present business be to ascertain whether basin a already named in own mind afforded safe anchorage for ship therefore resumed task of sounding working pretty regularly over area of with result that floor be found to slope upward very gradually until within about mile of low water mark when slope became comparatively steep so far a somewhat cursory survey went there seemed to be submerged rock shoal other danger in beautiful landlocked harbour to imperil safety of ship in order to make assurance doubly sure landed on inner beach ascended south west head from best view of basin be to be obtained when sun having by time climbed nearly to zenith ray striking down almost perpendicularly into water be able to see considerable portion of sandy floor of harbour through crystalline depth of water in way must discover sign of danger obstruction therefore concluded that ship might be brought inside head anchored pretty closely to beach without much apprehension of harm happening to especially a there did not appear to be more than eighteen inch rise of tide in particular part of ocean from situation now occupied be of course afforded best view of island have yet obtained truth compels to say that more saw of better liked there must be lack of fresh water on island for even from point of observation there be at least dozen small stream in sight doubtless there be others beyond range of vision then tree upon seemed to number hundred of thousand very fair proportion of

gorgeous colour flitted here there bee hovered over multitudinous blossom busily engaged in collecting store of honey many bird be seen of then of marvellously beautiful plumage while a to fruit wild strawberry raspberry flourished in profusion even upon headland on be standing boasted other vegetation than grass low bush shore of basin offered absolutely ideal site for town although ground there might perhaps be considered rather low for own part practically made up mind that while must stick to ship a long a might be permitted to do so if be compelled to remain on island for length of time must endeavour to secure plot of land on weather side of island about halfway up side of mountain one of most remarkable fact connected with island served to confirm in conviction that be uninhabited be extraordinary absolute fearlessness of man bird other living thing exhibited flitted about settled within reach of hand number of might have be captured have permitted pointed out to men who accompanied absolute uselessness a well a cruelty of such proceeding contrived to convince that great deal more pleasure be to be derived from sight of beautiful creature alive flying about in perfect freedom fearlessness than from possession of few of dead stuffed skin having at length learned a much a be possible in such brief visit to island paradise having also fully made up mind a to precise spot in basin where mercury must be moored summoned boat crew to follow descending to beach got into boat pulled back to ship just in time for dinner polson being ashore with explorer cabin party at dinner consisted only of miss hartley tudsbery be only natural that two companion must be eager to learn what impression nearer view of island have produced upon although must not help thinking that there be something suggestive of apprehension distaste in question girl put to took little notice of at moment however for be thinking more about task of moving ship than of satisfying curiosity of companion who considered must doubtless have opportunity on morrow to learn for that desired to know have so completely made up mind that there be reason why ship must not at once be taken into basin that a soon a dinner be over gave carpenter instruction to muster hand heave short news that ship be about to enter basin producing sufficient number of voluntary helper from among emigrant to render task of walking ship up to anchor easy one despite fact that exploring party left five seaman short then seaman who remained on board having loosed set three topsail jib spanker broke out anchor cast ship with head to southward for short stretch in lagoon in order to get fair run in between head then roused anchor up to bow catted by time that be done be far enough to southward to enable to point jibboom straight for fairway between head northernmost of slightly overlapped other when tacked ship bore away for entrance with emigrant crowding waist on side of ship eager to see new home at somewhat closer quarter quarter of hour later swept in between two towering headland with sufficient way on ship to carry through belt of calm under lee of northernmost head interior of basin in beauty lay spread out like picture before loud ejaculation of delight proclaimed pleasure sight gave to emigrant several of whom turned face toward poop in unmistakable language hinted hope that must now be allowed to go ashore without further delay once fairly inside head helm be starboarded ship be headed for sort of bay in southern extremity of basin topsail halyard be let go jib hauled down spanker brailed in with way that still have on mercury slowly drifted to spot have chosen a final berth anchor be let go in three half fathom of water be afraid earned certain amount of unpopularity by steadfastly refusing to allow anyone to leave ship until explorer must have returned refusal be part of policy of extreme caution of leaving nothing to chance of taking risk of kind adhered to explaining reason think convincing majority be right with mooring of mercury in berth have chosen for inside basin considered task responsibility at end seating in basket chair on poop beneath awning disposed to begin thinking out plan for ordering of own future conduct have scarcely settled comfortably when be joined by grace hartley who strove to conceal somewhat embarrassed manner obvious fact that have something on mind behind attempt at light frivolous conversation endured a long a must at length girl preoccupation became so marked that interrupted somewhat unceremoniously by saying pray excuse for breaking in upon entertaining remark miss hartley do not think have better come to point have done with want to say something to quite know how to begin be not that fact yes mr troubridge be acknowledged although how managed to guess be sure know well said let suffice have guessed now go ahead just tell what be girl hesitated for time at length said with laugh of embarrassment know quite well what be that want to say difficulty be that know how will take for have only very hazy idea what be own idea upon subject have anything to do with gurney by chance asked well yes have in way answered fact be mr troubridge now when horrid man wilde scheme seems to be nearing fruition be beginning to realise be in very awkward difficult position be feeling very anxious have heard much talk lately have greatly alarmed have be compelled to ask what be to be outcome of attempt to found colony upon socialistic line admit have never very closely studied doctrine of socialism if wilde view be to be accepted a gospel common sense tell that experiment be about to make can result in nothing ghastly fiasco text of preaching be social equality equality there have never be never will be such thing so long a world endures mankind be what be attempt to make keep men equal be foredoomed to end in failure even a did in day of french revolution foresee that one of first result will follow attempt here will be discontent then will speedily follow dissension finally anarchy look forward to condition of thing with utmost dread for anarchy mean lawlessness violence adoption of doctrine might be right in midst of such state of thing what will happen to unfortunate woman ah said be question must think will affect very closely although judging merely from what have seen of others doubt whether will greatly trouble imagine that even if anarchy must come will know pretty well how to take care of even a french revolutionary woman did what have got to do with gurney well concern in way girl answered think upon subject precisely a do foresees a do grave trouble for loom in not far distant future of course know very little about george gurney mr troubridge to be merely one of crew of ship with little embarrassment very readily understood have seen great deal of of late assure that be very remarkable man intelligent well educated refined indeed a matter of fact believe although have never told so that be born to very different station in life from now occupies may a well acknowledge that be to conversation have have with have come to see thing in light have endeavoured to make clear to be partly at suggestion that finally decided to mention subject to endeavour to obtain view upon view miss hartley said be in essential identical with own gurney if think fit may tell so oh thank mr troubridge exclaimed companion will certainly do so for be sure that will be glad to hear of course understand that conversation of ours be intended to be private will not mention to others what will not promised make mind quite easy upon point a matter of fact be very much obliged to for opening mind to will give what have said most serious consideration may be that little later on will be very glad to have little further conversation with upon most interesting subject chapter twelve landing be effected explorer weary jubilant bubbling over with enthusiastic encomium upon beauty fertility resource of island loaded down with sample of numerous fruit vegetable product have discovered arrived on board ship just a sun be sinking beyond southern shoulder of peak polson reported that upon landing have gone to westward thence north east south spreading out in such manner a to cover widest possible extent of country while still retaining touch with other have carefully examined entire coast line of island in search of indication of presence of native finding none so have come to conclusion that might safely assume island to be uninhabited therefore in respect a in others eminently suited to requirement have found two harbour in addition to basin one have observed on preceding evening toward north western extremity of island other of nearly same area a basin on northern shore considered harbour to be inferior to basin from fact that one on north west coast be practically open roadstead exposed to westerly wind while other although pretty well sheltered from except north westerly wind seldom blew in latitude be willow fringing reef entirely filling described island a abundantly watered having encountered crossed no le than twenty seven stream brook during day there did not appear to be sterile spot anywhere upon except just bald head of peak wilde be of opinion that island be rich in mineral trace of iron coal having be met with while outcrop of granite very beautiful marble probably exceedingly rich in lime have also be encountered be first rough report of explorer given immediately upon return to ship wilde undertook to supplement in address proposed to deliver from poop after supper accordingly at conclusion of meal hand emigrant seaman alike mustered in waist on quarter deck finding seat where must of on rail with foot resting on plank sheer on after hatch rest on deck plank while polson tudsbery grace hartley disposed ourselves upon poop near enough to hear be said wilde placing in centre of fore end of poop where must be seen heard by everybody be bound to admit that a speaker ex schoolmaster acquitted fairly well grammar be unexceptionable a might be reasonably expected choice of word admirable mode of expressing easy yet precise while seemed to have gift of arranging point of subject symmetrically in such manner a instantly to catch hold attention of hearer began by recounting in detail history of day doings describing route taken nature of country passed over various product met with of descriptive passage dealing with beauty of scenery loveliness of wooded glen with tiny streamlet flowing over rocky bed

wonderful orchid flowering shrub creeper countless fruit bearing tree shrub loaded with luscious fruit berry mile of coconut palm bordering shore gaily plumaged bird with quaint sometimes discordant cry brilliant winged butterfly be picturesque poetical there be savage ferocious animal indeed animal of kind reptile on island so far a explorer have be able to discover said a for extent of island be sufficient to provide individual of party including child with ample subsistence for rest of life then proceeded to sketch out for about thousandth time principle upon community be to be governed be to be subject to law be to be enacted from time to time by council of seven including of be to be president for life in virtue of fact that whole scheme idea be of originating remaining six member of council to be elected once three year there be to be distinction of rank class be to be absolutely equal there be to be such thing a private property everything being held in common everybody be to labour diligently for benefit of entire community natural increase due to person labour be to be delivered into sort of general store warehouse apportioned out in accordance with rule to be framed by council there be great deal more said that night to same effect of statement being received with rapturous applause chiefly by lazy ne'er do well member of party must see that although hand have in first instance jumped readily enough at prospect of easy luxurious life free a thought from restraint in land of eternal summer there be among to whom socialistic doctrine of perfect equality thing in common be already distinctly distasteful believed that if must school sufficiently in exercise of patience be said to be virtue must hear more of distaste also of other thing might be advantageous to in determination to effect escape from community with aim of be entirely out of sympathy wilde closed discourse with announcement on morrow hand must be permitted to go on shore immediately after breakfast to view island sample product for returning to ship at sunset in time for supper after meeting must be held for purpose of electing six member of council who must upon election immediately proceed to frame law for good government of community also make arrangement for settlement upon island accordingly soon after sunrise on following morning emigrant once more made appearance on deck in holiday attire impatient for moment to arrive when boat must be brought to gangway to convey to green bosky glade have spread so alluringly before gaze for preceding forty eight hour so eager be that be only with utmost difficulty be able to persuade to go below again until crew have have time to wash deck perform ship toilet for day determination not to forgo daily duty drew from wilde acrimonious remonstrance objection be promptly overruled by polson tudsbery who now discovered to great satisfaction be with most of crew disposed still to leave matter strictly pertaining to ship rule governance entirely in hand wilde know nothin ' about ship mr troubridge how must explained polson to if be let to have way might start pullin ' of to piece for sake of timber metal a likely a not must said men must never permit that polson at least not for time to come there be dozen way in may yet be found eminently useful for instance beautiful altogether suitable a island appears for purpose who be to say that doe not posse subtle peculiarity of climate rendering unfit for abode of european what sort of condition must be in if such must prove to be case have ship to to retreat in to seek island very true sir cut in carpenter have thought of there be chance of same now that come to mention a matter of fact however be not above reason influenced in least in desire to ensure preservation of ship for although have mentioned did not for moment believe that contingency must ever arise like grace hartley gurney have long since subjected wilde theory to careful examination decided that there be nothing in to satisfy man possessed of healthy ambition to make mark in world therefore wanted to keep open for way of escape better way must possibly be afforded than by ship by one bell in forenoon watch half past eight breakfast be over everybody be once more on deck clustering about gangway waiting for boat to be brought alongside be soon done boat belonging to ship having be got into water veered astern first thing that morning now delay occurred most vexatious to impatient emigrant for one of boat excepting quarter boat have be kept tight by filling about quarter full of water morning proved so leaky seam having opened through long exposure to air that have quietly swamped in interval between six o'clock breakfast time swamping process however have not occupied more than quarter of hour since time submerged boat have be rapidly taking up therefore when soon afterward be baled out be found that have already become tight enough to make short passage to shore by ten o'clock ship be empty save for polson two seaman who have be included in exploring party of previous day who be now willing to remain aboard look after went ashore in last boat to leave ship

refreshing musical sound of running water came up from depth of glen although stream be not visible from where stood while subdued roar of distant waterfall strongly tempted to swerve from path follow upward course of glen surrendered to temptation rather erroneously arguing that foot of rise must necessarily take so much nearer summit of peak whereas eventually found that have diverged almost at

weary with long day ramble be full of enthusiasm at prospect of making home on so lovely fertile spot in such perfect climate at eight o'clock night wilde ascended poop assuming direction of affair

thirteen important talk with gurney immediately upon completion of election wilde in plenitude of zeal eagerness to taste sweet of power authority insisted on calling meeting of council to meet there then in poop cabin for purpose of arranging proceeding of morrow when sitting be over polson told that very first proposal submitted by president be that ship sail must be unbent taken ashore to form tent for people to live in that next ship must be stripped to gantline spar rigging together with a much of bulwark a might be required worked up into raft for conveyance of cargo to shore of course polson with memory of conversation have passed between on very morning still fresh in mind stoutly opposed proposal adducing argument have used against proceeding adding to own with such success that not only be proposal negatived actually succeeded in carrying to effect that dozen hand under be to be told off for express purpose of giving hull spar standing running rigging sail thorough overhaul executing such repair etcetera a might be found necessary to bring ship to maintain in condition of perfect fitness for service at moment notice result achieved boatswain be quite content to let wilde have own way in other respect with result that be quickly arranged that hatch must be lifted first thing after breakfast on following morning cargo overhauled a far a possible room made by transferring to shore such portion of a be not likely to be injured by exposure to weather also that live stock consisting of three dozen fowl together with boar two sow be to be landed allowed to run wild for week two until proper quarter must be prepared for reception in order that might improve condition mention of live stock produced weighty argument in favour of proposal just carried by polson for elicited expression of opinion that horse horned cattle a well a sheep be urgently required by colonist ought to be procured at earliest possible moment what d think of arrangement mr troubridge asked boatswain when have brought account of proceeding to close see nothing to find fault with in replied except think be acting unwisely in meddling with cargo before providing receptacle for ashore believe highly probable that when begin to break out cargo will find many thing must necessarily be kept under cover if be not to be ruined by exposure to weather what will do with strike back into hold if so will be giving yourselves double trouble delaying instead of expediting matter well what else can do what must have advised if 'd be in place demanded polson must have proposed building storehouse big enough to receive whole of cargo before removing hatch replied job must easily be done few pole cut up there among hill brought down to shore sufficient quantity of wattle to form roof side covering of coconut palm leaf there be saw plenty of such structure among island that visited before arriving here remember that everybody remarked how easily might be built now why mischief did think of exclaimed boatswain smiting knee with vexation of course be proper thing to do oh mr troubridge why did let be elected member of council sir have old head although be on young shoulder 'd have be worth more to than fell burgess monroe hilary lumped together refused polson said because a must have be aware from first absolutely utterly disapproved of whole affair from beginning to end started wrong in first place by stealing ship cargo from to whom lawfully belonged be act for of may yet be made to smart apart from be strongly of opinion that be starting community upon totally wrong line have already heard say more than once have belief in sympathy with principle upon wilde proposes to rule settlement believe will be found to work satisfactorily therefore will have nothing to do with scheme yes yes know mr troubridge have heard say afore answered polson with impatience same ca for life of see what be wrong with plan a for what call act of piracy well there be gettin away from that if ever be found out of must get toko ' for job expect must be one dunno a feel partic'lar oneasy about for see how be goin ' to be found out risk such a be be worth runnin ' for ai goin ' to settle down here live in peace plenty happiness life think so polson doubt said wait while until schoolmaster theory be put to test of actual everyday practice then come tell what think of right mr troubridge be fair enough will answered boatswain therewith rose with somewhat troubled countenance left effect of conversation became apparent when on following morning before breakfast polson came aft announced to that upon further consideration of matter council have decided to build storehouse ashore before touching cargo followed up communication by asking for idea a to what dimension of structure must be oh said in tone of indifference if make twice a long a ship hold twice a wide about twelve foot high to eaves ought to have ample room for storage of everything in such fashion that can get at particular portion of cargo without difficulty at moment notice let give hint polson if be wise will have careful inventory taken of item of cargo a go ashore with record of particular part of building in be stored thank ' e mr troubridge thank ' e sir that good advice will see a be follered answered boatswain walking away now be quite determined to hold absolutely aloof from everything in most remote degree savouring of participation in mad scheme for many reason have objection to dropping of hint to polson now then for considered that by so doing must strengthen influence with wanted to acquire habit of depending upon to help when found in difficulty of kind there be also possibility that in way might occasionally be able to induce to put forward support proposal might be of utmost advantage to plan of ultimate escape revised arrangement of council be put into effect immediately after breakfast boat being brought alongside hand except member of council gang few of idler sent ashore carpenter with gang of assistant going up to higher land to select cut down transport to near neighbourhood of beach sufficient number of suitable tree sapling to form framework of store while gang sought wattle wherewith to form wall woman child meanwhile being dispatched along shore to collect fallen leaf of coconut palm bind in bundle prior to transportation to site of store for use a thatch for roof side of building fourth working party at same time be engaged in digging hole in soil for reception of pole be to form corner intermediate post of structure while hand ashore be thus engaged council be sitting in poop cabin drafting law by community be to be governed making mighty poor business of if frequent outburst of voice raised in angry altercation might be taken a criterion a for dozen seaman be placed at disposal thoroughly to overhaul hull spar rigging sail of ship began task by unbending sail needed repair sending down on deck storing away in sail room prior to starting upon repair did not take very long pretty early in afternoon have party at work on poop under awning cutting out worn cloth inserting new from stock of canvas carried for purpose ripping off old roping replacing with new generally putting sail into perfectly good reliable condition there be not so much of kind of work to be done a have feared so building of warehouse came to end together then followed discharging of cargo be conveyed to shore in boat carried up from beach on men shoulder in case of heavier package on hand barrow few there be so heavy that have to be removed from beach on roller be not many when ship hold be empty whole of content transferred to warehouse there ensued general overhaul of everything detailed inventory be taken showing precisely what article material in what quantity be at disposal of community ship being empty seized opportunity to careen examine sheathing go over with mallet where have become wrinkled with straining of hull stripping off worst of replacing with new so far a resource must allow removed weed barnacle re caulked seam where necessary next job be to smoke for rat with be overrun remove carcass then repainted inside out having plenty of paint for purpose after ballasted with sand putting sufficient quantity into to make tolerably weatherly finally gave spar rigging thorough overhaul fitting to new main topmast old one proving to be slightly sprung rove considerable quantity of new running gear lower mast bowsprit masthead yard be next repainted bright spar thoroughly scraped revarnished standing rigging tarred down last of sail be rebent old mercury be once more ready to go to sea at practically moment notice work with small gang of men at disposal occupied best part of six month in doing meanwhile remainder of community have not be altogether idle although have already become apparent that there be fairly liberal sprinkling of drone among there be steadily growing discontent among more industriously disposed because of because also wilde doctrine provided mean whereby lazy one must be compelled to do fair share of work despite aspect of island have greatly changed not altogether for better thought during month of sojourn upon in first place warehouse have be so easily quickly erected that roomy barrack like structure have at once be built alongside for accommodation of hand pending erection of separate dwelling of better appearance more permanent character for several family then many marriage have taken place wilde in capacity of chief magistrate undertaking to tie nuptial knot erection of two building by mean comprised sum total of what have thus far be accomplished by settler small party of prospector have be sent out to ascertain resource of island among many other valuable product coal iron clay of exceptionally fine quality for manufacture of brick tile marble granite basalt limestone pine satinwood teak sandalwood in exceedingly large quantity have be found brick tile yard have be established over on north west side of island large quantity of splendid brick tile have already be made limekiln have be built be in full operation large consignment of circular other saw having be found among cargo sawmill have be erected alongside one of numerous stream flow of have be utilised to drive saw much timber have already be cut down converted into plank scantling considerable quantity of sandalwood have likewise be collected with intention of loading into ship dispatching with to china there to be converted into money with cargo of tea ship be to be purchased dispatched to find profitable market proceeds of cargo being expended to provide live stock such other necessary a settler might require so much sandalwood indeed have already be collected that to make room for have be found necessary to discharge eighty ton of sand ballast have be originally shipped mercury be now quite deep enough in water to enable to go to sea with safety at moment only thing be worrying wilde council so far a part of plan be concerned be fact be only navigator among well knowing how strongly have disapproved of everything connected with original scheme for appropriation of ship cargo feared that if be sent away to navigate ship must betray at first civilised port arrived at while without ship must not be sent to sea at gathered partly from strenuous effort be now being made to induce to throw in lot with rest of settler partly from grace hartley between whom firm friendship have steadily grown up who in turn have gained pretty fair knowledge of situation from gurney did not often see for have be installed a schoolmistress to instruct young folk of settlement while in conjunction with young fellow named meadow who have served pupilage with architect surveyor in england have be set task of making detailed survey plan of entire island affair of settlement have reached stage when on certain evening after hand have knocked off for day miss hartley came to side a be leaving large shed in meal be served after few casual remark gave time to get out of earshot of rest said suppose mr troubridge after tramping about day in hot sun a have be feel too tired to come for walk with george indeed answered have grown quite accustomed to be on foot day now think nothing of indeed have in mind to take stroll in case evening be far too fine beautiful to be spent under cover may ask have special reason for giving invitation yes said grace have fact be mr troubridge that george be very anxious to have chat with right said will be very pleased be time now since gurney have spoken to other do know what wish to speak to about hope there be nothing wrong said there be nothing actually wrong george will tell about do mind if go up on to head will be delightful up there to night can talk without much fear of being overheard told george must go there will follow so did overtaking about halfway up rise must apologise mr troubridge said for troubling to come way after long day work fact be that for last month have have in mind to speak to inducement to do so have be growing ever since to come to point at once grace have have enough of wilde fantastic notion must like to cut connection with whole concern if be possible be speaking quite freely to mr troubridge for know that have be dragged into business quite against will apart from what grace have told from time to time have drawn own conclusion from steadfast refusal to sign charter also from what have seen of feel tolerably certain that may say to in confidence will not be betrayed to others of course said may rest assured of what be that wish to do gurney in what way do imagine that can help well said gurney idea have taken hold of not only may tell good many others wilde being one of that if chance to quit island return to civilisation be to present to must gladly seize be just idea have caused wilde to hesitate about completing loading of ship dispatching under command something however must be done soon for settlement be in urgent need of live stock many other thing must be obtained by hook by crook without much further delay now can not speak with certainty because know by putting two two together have come to conclusion that wilde certain other unscrupulous person among follower have in mind to fill up ship with sandalwood man with dozen so of forecastle hand in whom can place absolute trust dispatch to canton under command here come in villainy of scheme a soon a landfall be made be to be quietly knocked on head hove over side to prevent further trouble ship be to be taken into port cargo be to be disposed of vessel cargo of tea be to be bought with proceeds skipper secured new ship be then to proceed to good market where tea will be disposed of proceeds applied to purchase of what be most urgently needed by settler very pretty scheme indeed exclaimed gurney must be mistaken a to intention to do away with why idea be monstrous mean sheer deliberate cold blooded murder yes doe admitted gurney of course may be mistaken for enjoy wilde full confidence by mean be far too antagonistic in way for let urge not to trust too much to possibility may be mistaken mr troubridge for believe that be if must happen to be not who be mistaken must be bad for must not must agreed forewarned be forearmed gurney must take precious good care not to be caught napping be to tell that proposed walk to night yes answered gurney to tell also to say that if what have heard to night must determine to attempt escape from island may rely upon grace to help to utmost extent of power also want to include in plan think will be quite worth while to take with mr troubridge for know something of qualification a seaman be sure must be of service in carrying out plan while a for grace well if can hing else can at least cook grub for now what do say say will gladly include of in plan there be hand upon answered offering right hand in token of good faith discussed matter for time longer at length said now please leave to think matter out what have told have taken good deal by surprise a yet feel scarcely able to grasp full significance of have doubt that will get bearing of within next hour so meanwhile believe be right in suggesting that must be unwise to leave anything to chance will therefore endeavour to think out practical scheme when have done so will have chat now good night good night miss hartley chapter fourteen critical moment approach watched tall good looking well spoken sailor slim willowy figure of sweetheart gradually vanish amid deep shadow of bush bordered path leading downward from head then oblivious of peril of rheumatism seated upon least dew sodden boulder must find proceeded to think out momentous communication have just be made to be glorious night full moon thirty degree above eastern horizon flashed whole sea beneath outside reef into vast sheet of tumbling liquid silver while beam fell in long line of tremulous radiance upon placid water of lagoon right up to edge of cliff upon sat sky be cloudless toward zenith away down in west of larger star beamed with soft yet brilliant effulgence be only to be seen within tropic in own neighbourhood stronger light of moon have eclipsed save planet venus that hung near glowing like silver lamp so brilliant be moonbeam even ant beetle other small creeping thing ran about foot be distinctly visible a be tint of flower bloomed everywhere of have peculiarity of opening only at night soft gentle breeze be blowing in from sea just strongly enough to stir rustle grass foliage about to bring to ear deep ceaseless thunder of surf beat everlastingly upon distant reef greater part of basin be still in shadow including where mercury lay moon be high enough for ray to reach upper spar of ship almost down to topsail yard dew wetted spar rigging gleamed a though inlaid with wire of silver settlement temporarily built on inner shore of basin be almost a distinctly visible a though be daylight scattered light gleaming through gauze like mistiness of dew laden atmosphere from slope undulation of island delicately receded until at peak assumed almost ethereal softness of cloud be glorious scene that island presented slumbering langorously under brilliant ray of tropical moon more enchanting in respect than when viewed in garish light of sun so strong be enticement of beauty upon that for dull cramping influence of doctrine accepted by settler upon to frame guiding rule of life must without very much difficulty have reconciled to idea of sojourn there for remainder of day have already perceived unmistakable evidence of blighting effect be being steadily produced upon certain member of community by consciousness think of be only now beginning to fully realise industry individual effort be to count for nothing that lazy useless unit be to live life of inglorious ease at expense of hard worker foresaw that time be coming when deadly strife must rage between two section prospect be not enticing enough to induce to throw in lot with rest yet if did not life must be in danger for scarcely needed gurney communication of hour before to impress upon conviction that sooner later wilde follower must insist upon giving in adhesion to taking consequence of refusal did not need gift of seer to forecast precise character of consequence have scouted idea of deliberate cold blooded murder when gurney have suggested to yet have not forgotten that have already be threatened with death a alternative to undertaking navigation of ship during quest for suitable island upon to settle have very little doubt that must have carried out threat have persisted in refusal now be again threatened with there seemed to be two alternative submission flight be work of moment with to decide that flight be more acceptable of two how to accomplish thought of longboat to fit for long voyage in open ocean with hope of accomplishing must need amount of preparation must not possibly escape notice to be detected in making of such preparation must be to arouse such suspicion a must inevitably result in complete defeat of plan followed perhaps by other consequence of still more serious character while to neglect attempt flight in boat just a be must be madness expedient only to be resorted to under stress of direst extremity hour after hour sat there racking brain in quest of practicable plan offering reasonable prospect of success must think of nothing scheme upon finally settled being only one degree le mad than of venturing to sea in unprepared longboat such a be however determined to submit to gurney consideration hear what thought of accordingly watching opportunity contrived to get hold of grace hartley on following evening after supper whispered to intended to walk up to head again must be glad if gurney must follow to spot where have have previous talk together to replied that must certainly do so hour later pair joined well mr troubridge exclaimed gurney a met hope summons mean that have succeeded in hitting upon scheme will enable three to get away from here without delay for may a well tell that council have to day decided to complete loading of mercury dispatch to canton forthwith although wilde did not say so in so many word have reason to believe that pretty little programme sketched out to last night be to be carried through so much greater reason why gurney must make up mind at once what be to be done said yes be right answered gurney for have not yet told whole of story how affect grace a one of council be to go in ship ostensibly for purpose of transacting commercial part of business disposal of ship cargo purchase of vessel of cargo of tea so on actually a have only too much reason to fear in order that during absence wilde may have opportunity to force grace to marry see said well gurney only scheme have thus far be able to think of be of so mad desperate character gravely doubt whether will feel justified in having anything to do with let hear what be mr troubridge answered gurney will have to be something pretty desperate to choke grace off for can tell be growing more than trifle desperate ourselves well said to put scheme baldly simply propose that three will run off with ship sail to sydney hand over to authority telling whole truth take chance of what may follow doubt whether must deal hardly with of miss hartley be of course quite blameless must never dream of holding in least degree responsible for theft of ship cargo do believe must be very hard upon seeing that wilde rest compelled to fall in with plan a for fact that have assisted to restore ship to proper owner must probably be accepted a set off against share of crime of stealing ship especially in view of fact that have brought in cargo of sandalwood in place of much le valuable cargo settler have appropriated now what do think of well answered gurney slowly a turned plan over in mind proposal that two men girl will attempt to navigate ship of eight hundred ton from here to sydney matter of four thousand mile more suppose have certainly a say more than suggestion of madness about yet believe that must do mr troubridge be in plymouth sound trifle over two year ago when ship nearly a big a mercury came in be from rio second mate apprentice one ordinary seaman comprised whole of crew sailed from rio with full complement when be only three day at sea outbreak of yellow fever occurred aboard first one then of crew be struck down skipper must not put back have fair wind insisted that men best chance of shaking off fever lay in keeping ship at sea did so although men continued to die until by time that reached latitude of azores only three have named remained alive meanwhile a crew dwindled ship became short handed snugged down until at last have nothing set close reefed fore main topsail fore topmast staysail under canvas entered sound hove to signalled for assistance oh yes be sure must do provided of course that kept health must have to take chance of that must be hard work certainly there be two of fairly strong a second mate of ship told of answered when be asked how managed one can do lot of work with tackle two a to how authority might be disposed to regard share of stealing of ship must take chance of gracie here can bear witness be never in favour of scheme only joined in with good grace because there seemed nothing else to be done now a to best time for making attempt what be idea about well said in view of fact that have actually be decided to send ship to sea think will be well to wait until cargo be in hatch on will give opportunity to get trap aboard without exciting suspicion then on night of day prior to sailing of ship three must go off to slip cable make sail a much a can manage trust that may be able to reach open water before flight be discovered if completion of loading can by mean be delayed until moon rise about hour after midnight so much better oh a to answered gurney deliberate way of working that people have got into will make quite week before loading be finished will bring moonrise to somewhere about time mention moon will have taken off to about third quarter by then even so will give light enough to find way out through reef be that need trouble about precisely agreed then be to understand that miss hartley definitely agree to throw in lot with in desperate attempt yes mr troubridge certainly may answered gurney at least corrected can answer for a to gracie here what say little woman say of course must infinitely prefer to go with mr troubridge answered girl only thing be continued that be afraid will be frightful trouble to yet know can cook meal for can steer ship in fine weather ca george ay that can a well a man in ship answered gurney taught mr troubridge long before appeared upon scene foresee miss hartley said that so far from being trouble to will be absolutely indispensable to success now gurney think have better part for under circumstance believe will scarcely be wise for to be seen very much together watch progress of event in council let know if anything must transpire of character likely to interfere with plan on evening of following day upon return to settlement from scene of surveying operation found awaiting formal intimation from council of determination forthwith to complete loading of mercury dispatch to sea at earliest possible moment be instructed to deliver over document paper of kind relating to survey of island to coadjutor meadow who must henceforth have sole charge of survey also be to proceed on board ship on following morning accompanied by men former member of crew named in margin for purpose of submitting hull spar sail rigging to thorough overhaul in order to ensure that ship be fit ready in respect to undertake voyage to china to prepare inventory of such provision store a might be required for voyage lastly when order have be carried out be to report in person to council receive final instruction relative to voyage found that crew be to consist of twenty men told namely eighteen seaman one cook cabin steward of eighteen seaman gurney be to act in capacity of chief mate tudsbery carpenter a second gurney being member of council be excused from participation in overhauling operation polson who be also member of council being sent in stead must not at time quite understand reason for somewhat singular arrangement for did not for instant accept official explanation polson from former association with ship a boatswain be considered to posse more intimate knowledge than gurney of minutia of ship equipment however be made clear to afterwards with twenty men then proceeded on board mercury on certain morning proceeded to give gear thorough overhaul although knew to be simply waste of time energy overhaul having already be made defective doubtful gear replaced sail loosed aired once week since still did not in least object for be to personal advantage that if perchance trifling defect have be thus far overlooked must now be made good while rest of hand under polson tudsbery be going systematically to work upon overhauling process set cook steward to work to take careful stock of content of lazarette with object of ensuring that there must be sufficiency of provision to last through voyage also have water tank emptied filled up with pure spring water while be being done strong gang be put to task of bringing down sandalwood loading into ship boat bringing alongside when be carefully stowed in hold object being to so stow a to make ship receive utmost possible quantity for have capacity on fourth day overhaul of ship be completed on morning of fifth day presented before council to hand in report receive full instruction report be very simple document merely informing council that final overhaul have be most carefully executed that defect of description have be discovered that supply of provision in lazarette have be found to be sufficient for proposed voyage be ready to proceed to sea at moment notice report be received with formal expression of council satisfaction be then informed that a be anticipated that loading of ship must be completed on morrow be to make preparation for sailing of ship on day afterward when crew must be sent on board immediately after breakfast when be to present before council for final instruction left apartment have be dignified with name of council chamber exceedingly well satisfied with what have transpired especially so at information that crew be not to join ship until day of sailing for be precisely point upon have be experiencing good deal of anxiety of late for reason be most anxious that ship must go to sea with hatch on longboat at least properly stowed on other hand greatly feared that when matter have reached point crew must be ordered aboard say on evening of day preceding sailing of ship if must happen plan of making off with ship must almost inevitably fail for must be practically impossible for gurney to overpower remaining nineteen of crew who apart from other consideration must certainly have suspicion aroused a soon a grace hartley presence on board must be discovered a soon must be shrewdly suspected that arrangement relative to embarkation of crew at last moment prior to sailing of ship must be due to gurney who must of course perceive quite a clearly a how vital to success arrangement must be tried to get word with to ascertain whether be actually case found impossible to do so accordingly devoted remainder of day to getting chest aboard taking possession of cabin carefully studying chart with view of deciding upon most desirable route to be followed on voyage to sydney late in afternoon gurney tudsbery also brought chest aboard even then be unable to get private word with former because of constant presence of latter moreover appeared to that gurney be rather markedly avoiding circumstance caused good deal of uneasiness at last moment just a hand be going ashore at close of day work co adventurer came stood beside at gangway for instant without saying word even looking at felt for hand thrust into seemed to be small tightly folded piece of paper immediately afterwards passing through gangway down ship side waited until everybody else have left deck then carefully thrusting paper into breech pocket followed arrived at length at quarter occupied while ashore drew forth from pocket what proved to be a have suspected from feel of sheet of paper folded into very small compass opening read a follows have just learned through merest chance that have be arranged that crew will go aboard to morrow instead of next day mean that must act to night please meet therefore among big rock on basin beach under south head a soon after supper a conveniently can if must not be there when arrive kindly wait for have chosen that spot for rendezvous on account of secluded character because nobody care to go there after dark be awkward news indeed for a gurney have remarked in communication meant that must act be to say must make escape same night although hatch be off boat be ashore of course fact that hatch be off be merest trifle for gurney must soon clap on batten down did not at like idea of going to sea without even so much a single boat on board while of boat belonging to ship must most have preferred longboat because be fine wholesome boat in event of anything untoward happening must stand far better chance in than in of others however there be help for must be better for to escape without boat than not at yet when came to think of there be reason why must go to sea entirely without boat must require one in to make passage from shore to ship surely ought not to be beyond power of two men girl to hoist one of quarter boat to davit for a gurney have said good deal of work can be done with aid of tackle two if must hoist one quarter boat why not ay might even be possible to get in longboat a well if time opportunity permitted perhaps be almost too much good luck to expect still have germ of plan in mind determined to talk to gurney about supper last meal of day be served at seven o'clock be over done with before eight by time be quite dark save for such light a star afforded while light be quite sufficient to enable one to see one way about island be not powerful enough to reveal object at great distance condition be therefore quite favourable for purpose when left building in supper have be served sauntered off in aimless sort of way a though going for stroll toward peak before turning in for night when have gone about quarter of mile have satisfied that one be about for settler be a rule early bird usually turned in almost immediately after supper made detour took by way of slight hollow down to inner beach along passed towards rendezvous mentioned by gurney spot be situated beneath cliff on basin side of south head where outcrop of big basalt rock occurred be always of so dark gloomy weird character that be generally shunned even during hour of daylight while at night time nobody ever went near place if must possibly avoid a drew near once twice fancied that someone be following thinking that might possibly be gurney waited to let overtake a nobody appeared supposed must have be mistaken went on again presently arriving among rock next moment two figure emerged from among shadow gurney sweetheart stood before chapter fifteen great adventure ah here be gurney miss hartley too exclaimed that be good better indeed than dared hope for did not expect to see miss hartley at least for two three hour answered grace did expect to be here so soon lucky chance enabled to get box out of hut unobserved george happening to come to window soon afterward to make final arrangement seized opportunity came straight away at once mr pierson with whom have be staying belief to be in bed with bad headache made escape through window excellent said then suppose may set to work almost at once may not gurney yes a soon a please mr troubridge answered gurney think must be wise to give everybody chance to get home into bed first must be rather awkward if anybody must happen to be out late taking walk on head must see be true must said reminds that a came along beach on way here just now once twice have impression of being followed thought possibly might be waited for to overtake nothing came of be case of guilty conscience ' expect mr troubridge laughed gurney why must anyone follow nobody can possibly suspect for grace either suppose have ever breathed word of to single soul not even to other when there have be slightest chance of being overheard of course not be fancy perhaps answered must plead guilty to having felt trifle anxious nervous during last few day be gone past now first thing want to talk to about gurney be boat much like idea of going to sea without boat especially longboat now so far a quarter boat be concerned believe might manage to get hoisted up to davit by hooking watch tackle on to fall what about longboat do think there be possibility of being able to hoist in might certainly if only have time answered gurney must have to be done before passed out through reef in smooth water if a say have time dare say must be done not outside with ship rolling tumbling about boat must be stove long before must get inboard undoubtedly agreed have plan think will afford time to hoist in longboat a well a two quarter boat before go outside when once be safely out of basin what have to fear nothing except being overtaken ship recaptured by strong body of men sent after in boat if have boat can not follow now plan be propose that a soon a seems safe to do so proceed to spot where boat be moored man jollyboat tow rest off to ship veering astern by painter when get aboard then will loose set fore main topsail fore topmast staysail slip cable work ship out between head into lagoon once there be safe can heave to hoist two quarter boat to davit then put on hatch hoist in longboat with fear that anyone can possibly interfere with then when have completed work to satisfaction can cast remaining boat adrift will be certain to drive ashore undamaged be recovered can go out through reef in broad daylight by jove mr troubridge have hit exclaimed gurney with enthusiasm if can manage to secure whole of boat get ship out of basin undetected may defy hand of yes see possibility of hitch in plan will not be safe until be outside basin now what do think mr troubridge will be safe to make beginning at once will give little longer to get indoors to sleep minute be of utmost value to said still must be pity to spoil by being too precipitate let wait hour at expiration of think may safely make move accordingly three sat down in deepest shadow of rock chatting in low tone discussing prospect of voyage chance of success in somewhat desperate attempt that be about to make kindred matter until watch showed that be within hour of midnight when thought must be unwise to delay longer accordingly gave word to make move whereupon gurney hoisted sweetheart box on shoulder three moved cautiously in dead silence along beach toward where boat be moored keeping close in among shadow cast by cliff overhanging foliage boat with exception of jollyboat be moored in string at distance of about hundred yard from beach longboat riding to small boat anchor while others be secured to by painter jollyboat being hauled up on sand be boat that intended to use to go off to ship in towing other boat astern when got alongside gurney swung grace hartley box off shoulder intending to deposit in stern sheet of boat prior to launching a leaned over gunwale to do so however started back with smothered ejaculation for at same instant human figure rose up out of bottom of boat where have be crouching to drop box on sand be with gurney work of second next instant have man by throat be bearing back into bottom of boat again while grace hartley seized arm gripped like vice to prevent from screaming not sound for life grace hissed in ear a shook free from grip then springing to gurney side exclaimed in low tense whisper steady gurney steady man kill fellow make noise who be let get up tell who be what be doing here do hear what mr troubridge say growled gurney in prisoner ear get up give account of if attempt to raise voice will choke life out of without more ado now then let have look at why will be shot if be saunders saunders may be explained be one of original crew of mercury very quiet steady well conducted fellow be probably for reason that have not be chosen to go in ship on projected voyage to china man stared in face sure enough be indeed saunders very scared a well a somewhat angry appearance presented why saunders exclaimed in low pitched accent of surprise what be doing here in boat at time of night come explain will mr troubridge in jiffy a soon a have got feel of gurney grip out of throat answered man be like sir have be on here island long enough to see wilde idea wo work can see that accordin ' to plan may stay here life be better off than be to day 'cause why harder others like work better be for lot of lazy shirkin ' swab who have made up mind that will never do hand turn if can help see fun in workin ' for skowbanks like have have about enough of want to get away from here place to somewhere where man can get full value of labour so have kep eye on day to day mr troubridge on lookout for chance to ast to let stow away aboard mercury until get well out to sea intendin ' understand sir to cut run at first port that touch at must get chance to speak to without bein ' seen by a did want to see so follered to night when started out for walk a thought intendin ' to range up alongside of when be well clear of settlement afore must arrange thought shipshape so to make clear what wanted 'd jined george here young lady must help hearin pretty near be said now sir understands that gurney feel pretty much a do about wilde notion intends to give lot of 'em slip by makin off alone by yourselves in ship to night ai that sir well supposing that have such plan what have to say about returned only sir answered saunders that begs most earnestly to let come in with be stiff job mr troubridge for two people for young lady wo count nothin ' to speak of to work ship size of mercury 'd find most uncommon useful assure ye sir be ab know business a well a e'er man yes agreed be perfectly true saunders for have noticed more often than perhaps think have considered tremendous amount of hard work must fall to share in such adventure a speak of hard work be not only thing have to be considered voyage of kind that be talking about be certain to involve considerable element of danger be care that for danger hardship interrupted saunders snapping finger emphatically only say may jine in picnic sha have cause to regret sir what say gurney asked have right to voice in matter probably know saunders good deal better than do say let come by mean mr troubridge answered gurney be good man will be worth weight in gold to so think agreed turning to saunders be prepared to start with now instant for can not consent to incur risk delay must be involved in return to settlement there be call for to go back sir answered man eagerly have nobody to say goodbye to a to dunnage ' why dare say can make out pretty well durin ' v'yage by helpin ' from chest will find in fo cbe'le very well then said may come saunders welcome now miss hartley step in please sit down while gurney shove off in with box though gurney must not leave behind go aft saunders help with oar remember everything must be done in absolute silence boat be already afloat for three part of length be easily launched in minute be seated in stern sheet beside grace hartley while gurney saunders be gently silently paddling toward spot where rest of boat be moored ranged quietly up alongside longboat got hold of painter hauled up anchor placed in bottom of jollyboat whereupon two men at oar once more gave way gently be soon slowly heading for ship with whole string of boat in tow took full half hour to accomplish distance between ship spot where boat have be moored during whole of time gurney saunders kept eye intently fixed upon settlement while steered place remained wrapped in darkness nothing occurred to occasion least alarm during stealthy passage across basin discussed in low tone important question of boat be ultimately settled that must take two of four gig at least make effort to hoist in longboat other two gig jollyboat to be cast adrift allowed to drive ashore a soon a be ready to pas out through reef accordingly a soon a have arrived alongside ship grace hartley box have be safely passed up side boat be veered astern longboat best two of gig by own painter while other two gig jollyboat be secured together in string one astern of other so that by casting off one painter three of boat must be released at same instant while being lashed together must go ashore at same spot by time arrangement be carried out hour of midnight have arrived moon what there be left of be not due to rise until hour twenty minute later by time that have got two gig hooked on tackle hauled hand taut be a much a intended to do with before getting clear of basin have come to conclusion that star afforded light enough to see by therefore determined to proceed at once with task of setting canvas be more anxious over part of job than other for be light task for four people one of whom be slender slip of girl to sheet home hoist fore main topsail of eight hundred ton ship must be rather lengthy business somewhat noisy at for on quiet night rasping of chain sheet through sheeve hole might be heard at considerable distance far enough indeed to attract attention of sleepless individual in settlement moreover inside of basin be particularly quiet spot being under lee of head thus sheltered to considerable extent from sweep of wind true reef lay to windward ceaseless roar of surf upon filled air with volume of sound during night that other sound might well be drowned in if perchance suspicious sound from direction of ship be to reach settlement alarm be given might still be very awkward for although have boat for settler have plenty of firearm ammunition obtained from cargo if be to muster on head in time to fire upon a passed out of basin one more of might be hit disabled if not killed must greatly jeopardise success of attempted flight still risk have to be taken that must do be to minimise a much a possible by taking precaution accordingly buntlines clewlines leech line be cast off very carefully overhauled watch tackle hitched to halyard before of went up on yard then gasket be cast off main topsail sheeted home to with sense wrought to highest pitch by anxiety noise be absolutely appalling seemed a though might easily be heard at most distant extremity of island die be cast have taken fate in hand there be nothing for now to go on get part of business over a quickly a possible therefore a soon a sheet seemed to be home belayed sprang to watch tackle with assistance of handy little piece of gear got heavy yard mastheaded without much difficulty although process be somewhat lengthy one in consequence of necessity to frequently fleet tackle racking halyard meanwhile to keep what have gained however completed job at length then same process have to be gone through with fore topsail be while be dragging away at halyard of sail grace hartley upon whom have not a yet found necessary to call for help came running forward to tell that light be beginning to flash out here there in settlement be true for when paused from labour for moment to verify statement counted four separate point of light while still stood looking leapt out of darkness alarm be given men be being roused exclaimed well can not be helped anyhow be too late for before can even discover that have boat will be under way tail on again hearties let get yard mastheaded then heavy work will be done for present grace will find lantern in steward pantry light please bring for'ard take care that gleam be not seen from shore well there with halyard belay think have that can get of saunders slip out cast loose fore topmast staysail gurney lend hand to brace round foreyard little attempt be now made at concealment hoisted fore topmast staysail light a be breeze inside basin rustling of important piece of canvas drummed in ear with sound like thunder have sense enough to know that be exceedingly doubtful whether not must be heard at settlement most noisy part of work be yet to come however to now bent energy be slipping of cable soon have shackle out released portion of cable at once rushed through hawse pipe with roar must certainly be heard at settlement then dashed aft to wheel flung hard over to help ship to cant did with a seemed to most exasperating sluggishness paid off at last when hauled aft staysail sheet braced up yard mercury began very deliberately to forge ahead great adventure be at length fairly begun then while ship ratched across basin prior to tacking to pas out between two head gurney saunders of whom be exceptionally powerful men went to work to hoist two gig up to davit by time that have got first boat up second one out of water be far enough to windward to render necessary to tack in order to avoid putting old barkie ashore on northern beach be just little doubtful whether ship must work under such short canvas have now drawn out from under lee of south head be feeling something of true breeze water be smooth ship have very nearly four knot way on therefore determined to try giving word ready about to others put helm very gently down aim being to sail round if possible with a little drag a might be from rudder luffed into wind quite a freely a must reasonably be expected moment heard head sail begin to flap helm hard down lashed there leaving ship to herself while sprang to help others to swing mainyard by time that have got main topsail yard round ship be fairly paying off on other tack when sang out to grace to cast off lashing steady helm then letting go fore brace dragged round head yard got also braced up whereupon ran aft to wheel again leaving gurney saunders to trim over fore topmast staysail sheet upon reaching wheel found grace hartley already perched alongside ship well to windward of passage between head have fallen off good bit owing to sluggishness with head yard have be swung be already coming to few second later jibboom be pointing straight for middle of passage with head looming up on hand black a ebony against faint shimmer of starlight on water of lagoon beyond gurney saunders now came aft proceeded to complete hoisting of second quarter boat seeing that grace seemed to know pretty well what be about with wheel left at directing to steer ship a nearly a might be midway between two head went to lend others hand with boat have davit tackle two block by time that ship be fairly clear of head in lagoon after put hatch on battened down then came formidable job of endeavouring to hoist in longboat formidable job be when actually came to seriously consider nevertheless determined to make attempt time be only thing needed to assure success be just in regard to that have doubt for must be remembered that although have got ship out of basin be not yet in open water on contrary be now moving athwart placid water of lagoon heading about sou ' sou ' east lagoon think have somewhere said be roughly crescent shaped in plan measuring about ten mile long by about two half mile wide at broadest part northern end being trifle more weatherly of two now plan be ship when hove to drift along on course a nearly a possible at right angle to direction of wind in case be blowing due east therefore proposed to work mercury up toward northern end of lagoon until when brought round hove to must have room to drive slowly to southward without going ashore on fringing reef projected into lagoon average distance of mile from island then while be thus drawing to southward available distance being about seven mile maybe trifle more be to make attempt to hoist in longboat by mean of yard tackle stow on main hatch hatch be already on battened down to get chock into place to receive boat be work of few minute then came business of rousing out yard tackle getting aloft knew where to lay hand upon soon have ready for sending aloft by time that have got thus far ship have drawn well over toward southern end of barrier reef be time to heave about therefore tacked ship again old hooker working in much more lively fashion time because be now within influence of true breeze then with grace hartley still at wheel gurney saunders went aloft got tackle up on fore main yard also stay purchase be then ready to begin actual work boat be next hauled alongside starboard gangway in readiness to be hooked on when ship being by time a far to northward a be prudent to go tacked hove to on port tack chapter sixteen cataclysm sooner be ship round hove to with fore topsail aback than gurney saunders slid down into longboat hooked on tackle stood by on deck to haul taut then by mean of snatch block watch tackle winch proceeded to lift first bow then stern out of water foot so at time be slow tedious work be greatly assisted by light of moon be by time well above horizon by working a though for life at length managed to get boat well above level of bulwark to transfer weight from yard to stay tackle to swing inboard few minute before became imperatively necessary for to wear round in order to avoid going ashore upon barrier reef by time too be able to see great crowd of people gathered upon south head watching once twice even thought caught sound of hailing attempt to communicate with ended with that fear have entertained that number of might attempt to swim out scramble aboard while be busy with longboat proving groundless contrived to get ship round with head to northward again just in time to avoid nicely hitting reef then upon principle that be useless to make two bite at cherry determined to complete task fully before going outside therefore got yard stay tackle down stowed away longboat properly secured in gripe before attempting to pas out through reef kept busy for nearly hour at end of tacked for last time in lagoon bore away for passage through reef successfully negotiated just a sun upper rim flashed above horizon jollyboat two gig that intended to leave behind having be cast adrift quarter of hour earlier be by time beginning to feel need of food rest therefore decided to treat to good substantial breakfast to start with after weather being fine glass high three out of four of might safely venture to snatch few hour sleep accordingly went aft to relieve grace hartley at wheel while retired to cabin have be allotted to made hasty toilet prior to incursion into steward pantry with view of arranging for breakfast saunders be beforehand with for while be refreshing entered pantry gave overhaul finding smoked ham barrel of cabin bread coffee cocoa sugar number of other article already stowed there by steward who be to have accompanied ship on projected voyage to china ham promptly cut carrying several slice together with coffee forward to galley where gurney be already busy starting fire after returned to cabin produced tablecloth knife fork cup saucer plate dish set table thus by time that grace be ready found intention anticipated when breakfast be ready saunders came relieved at wheel while in company with gurney sweetheart sat down to breakfast at meal be arranged must take first watch steering ship keeping lookout until seven bell in forenoon when gurney be to be called to relieve while took sun saunders duty being to prepare makeshift dinner next watch until eight bell in afternoon be to be gurney when saunders must come on duty for first dogwatch while grace hartley be to be allowed to prepare tea supper a be then fashion to call last meal of day in fact made out regular watch bill setting forth sequence of watch name of who be to keep additional duty person be to perform grace hartley being of course let off very lightly share of work being principally confined to easy domestic duty a soon a have finished breakfast went on deck relieved saunders who went forward to galley to secure food be there being kept hot for taking aft consuming in cabin have already determined upon route must take be glad to find that while have be below wind have veered just sufficiently to allow ship to lay course close hauled hour further experience revealed fact that ship be so nearly steering that very slight adjustment of helm must enable to do so entirely adjustment be able to make with sufficient accuracy within next twenty minute to permit of lashing wheel giving attention to other matter therefore got out chart spread open on cabin table went on deck again to take bearing distance of island latitude longitude of have long ago ascertained marked upon chart then laid down ship position then finding that ship still continued to behave satisfactorily under lashed helm got telescope went up into main topmast crosstrees to take last look at island by time about ten mile distant still lay broad on horizon astern so clear be atmosphere be able to distinguish boat have cast adrift still about mile from shore next swept entire horizon with telescope in search of other land sail not hint of presence of must detect in direction be especially anxious to fall in with ship a soon a possible being intention to borrow few more men if must for experience of past night have already demonstrated to that while be certainly possible for four to handle ship in fine weather meant heavy work while in bad weather might easily prove impossible one thing of paramount importance to while be so short handed be plenty of sea room be determined to keep ay although to do so must add thousand mile to length of voyage having taken thoroughly exhaustive look round descended to deck busied about number of odd job needed attention such a hauling taut coiling up a much of running gear a have be cast off pin during night in way contrived to pas fairly busy morning until seven bell when called saunders to turn out start work in galley afterward taking sextant on deck to catch meridian altitude of sun then immediately after dinner retired to cabin throwing off clothing have now worn for more than thirty hour stretched upon bunk slept like log until grace hartley who have left cabin hour so before knocked at door to tell that be four bell supper be ready by time have have at least six hour sleep felt able to face coming night with equanimity more so for reason that weather promised to continue fine ship be still under two topsail fore topmast staysail under be doing very well average rate of sailing throughout day having be a nearly a possible four half knot there be nice topgallant breeze blowing felt that must like to have availed ourselves of to fullest possible extent making sail taking in be two very different thing must make sail at leisure must probably be in hurry when shortening process became necessary moreover to swing topsail lower yard with strength at command be quite a much a must well manage after talking matter over together therefore ultimately decided to let everything stand just a be until must see little more clearly what be before in manner then first two day passed ship jogging along to southward at rate of about one hundred to hundred twenty mile in twenty four hour weather continuing fine on whole settled enabling to get ample sufficiency of rest while attending to duty day brought with on third night dating from beginning of adventure fell to to take middle watch when went on deck at midnight still found weather everything must be desired except that wind be perceptibly lighter than have be when turned in four hour earlier change saunders informed have be in progress during almost whole of watch did not think did that portended very important alteration in weather for sky be perfectly clear star shone brilliantly utmost that anticipated be possible shift of wind however must be no great matter since be just a likely to be in favour a against stood for few minute discussing probability then saunders bade good night went below for nearly two hour stood at wheel holding ship to course with ever increasing difficulty for wind still continued to drop until scarcely have steerage way then with final sigh breeze died away altogether topsail hung limp dew saturated from yard fore topmast staysail sheet drooped amidships mercury swung broadside on to scarcely perceptible swell abandoning now useless wheel walked forward to skylight in cabin lamp turned low burned dimly have look at barometer be about tenth lower than when have last looked at two hour earlier might possibly mean impending change of weather if so heaven showed sign of thus far for sky be still clear a crystal star beamed down with undiminished radiance out of immeasurable depth of blue black vault overhead swell be perceptibly flattening then looked at clock a be usual at sea be set day by sun wanted five minute to two therefore have still two hour of watch to stand to stave off certain feeling of drowsiness be insidiously taking possession of went down on to main deck proceeded to pace to fro in waist satisfied that might walk there a long a pleased without disturbing rest of companion of whom occupied cabin under poop a thoughtfully walked fore aft between main fore rigging instinctively treading lightly in sympathy with profound silence of night imagination carried back to island be endeavouring to picture to myself wilde rage disgust upon making discovery that ship have prematurely gone to sea taking with girl that have fully determined to marry when low sound like muttering of far distant thunder awoke out of reverie sprang up on poop flung hasty glance around horizon to see if must anywhere catch glimmer of distant lightning thinking possibly squall might be brewing far away to northward did indeed distinctly see what appeared to be reflection in sky of certain ruddy flash hardly looked to like lightning at event like kind of lightning have be accustomed to see meanwhile low muttering sound have not died away a thunder doe on contrary be not only continuous be steadily growing in volume with amazing rapidity proceeding apparently from direction of curious ruddy flash be also growing stronger even a stood staring wondering what phenomenon might mean a sound steadily increased so did resemblance to thunder rapid firing of heavy gun become more pronounced distinct booming like of frequent heavy explosion making heard in midst of continuous rumble seemed to to be drawing nearer with frightful rapidity then a still gazed in perplexity toward spot from mysterious terrifying sound seemed to emanate caught gleam of white water on northern horizon longer doubting that heavy squall of character quite unknown to perhaps peculiar to water be about to burst upon dashed down poop ladder into cabin uttered one yell of hand on deck then dashed out again on to main deck springing first to main topsail halyard letting run then doing same by fore by time have cast off fore topsail halyard gurney saunders alarmed by cry be out on deck while in doorway of cabin stood grace hartley with wrap of sort thrown over shoulder what be mr troubridge what in name of be terrible be happening demanded gurney gazing about in amazement man reef tackle for life shouted hear squall thundering down upon if be not lively will whip mast out of indeed be not sure will in case here be lay hold drag grace go back to cabin be place for gurney sprang to one of reef tackle while saunders dragged at other yelling yo ho a did so meanwhile awful booming crashing sound seemed to be sweeping down toward on wing of squall so heavy have by time become that must actually feel ship trembling with reverberation of next second frightful combination of rumbling crashing sound be about mingled now with hoarse roar of heavily breaking water ship suddenly began to pitch roll with violence deprived of power to do anything more than just cling for life to nearest object that must lay hold of sea about suddenly broke into mad turmoil of raging water white with glare of phosphorescence leaping foaming swirling hither thither with appalling violence huge mass of water flung high in air crashed in over bulwark forward aft amidships at same moment deluging deck threatening to sweep overboard in midst of felt succession of violent shock a though ship be being swept over reef by violent tide race there be wind not breath save such slight baffling draught a be probably created by violent motion of sea around grating hammering shock lasted perhaps minute then suddenly ceased deep rumbling crashing sound swept past away down to southward gradually died away roar of broken water changed note became seething hiss of innumerable multitude of stream rushing over rocky bed cascading from one level to other ship once more floated motionless nearly so throughout whole of soul shaking experience star beamed calmly down upon with undimmed splendour for few second three men stood staring at other in awestruck silence then gurney spoke with curious little quaver in voice be squall mr troubridge said be submarine earthquake of extraordinary violence too must not be in least surprised if find that effect have be powerful widespread enough to make chart of sea absolutely useless to for instance be supposed to be long way off sounding here be not yet what be to make of shock that felt just now be merely result of earth tremor communicated to water through to hull of ship be actually swept violently over surface of shoal must like just for curiosity sake to take cast of paused suddenly while speaking eye have be fixed intently upon something that seemed to see over shoulder away out on port side of ship now without attempting to finish sentence abruptly walked to rail stood staring out over be matter gurney what do think see demanded going to side somehow thrilled by queerness of manner come up on poop said will see better from there led way followed a drew to side slowly stretched forth arm in pointing attitude sweeping hand slowly right round horizon said in low impressive voice be almost whisper single word look then for first time saw explanation of strangeness of manner while have be voicing anticipation a to possible effect of earthquake have be looking at meanwhile merely catching suggestion out of corner of eye a be of fact that disturbance of ocean surface around be very rapidly subsiding without grasping significance of for be listening to what be saying turning over in mind now a stood together on poop gazed out in direction round about saw to unspeakable awe consternation that what quarter of hour earlier have be to best of knowledge belief unfathomable ocean be now to very large extent dry land be to say ship appeared to be floating be aground in kind of pond small lake of perhaps eight ten acre in extent surrounded on side by land of sort off rugged surface of salt water be still pouring in multitude of little stream cataract how far land extended be at moment quite impossible to say so far a must be seen in dim uncertain light of star appeared to extend nearly quite to horizon whole of have be hove up from ocean depth in space of few second true part of great pacific ocean be thickly dotted with reef shoal position of many of have never be accurately determined while be known that there be many others with sufficient depth of water upon to allow ship to pas safely over in weather might possibly be one of even so fact remained that low island of quite respectable extent have suddenly be created well gurney exclaimed looking round in ever growing amazement be something quite new in way of shipwreck something indeed that if recorded in newspaper must be denounced by clever one who know everything a outrageous falsehood audacious attempt to impose upon people credulity very possibly agreed gurney have run up against good many people in time who seem to make point of disbelieving everything have not come within scope of own actual experience yet there be nothing so very wonderful in business after new land be frequently being discovered where deep water be known to have previously existed be case in point be a to calling present plight shipwreck well think be rather anticipating matter to do that if have chanced to be caught floating immediately over of portion have be hove out of water ship left high dry might be justified in calling shipwrecked here be still afloat who be to say that way may not be found out of dock into open ocean yes agreed there be certainly something in what say be really afloat ship seems too absolutely motionless for let get lead line take cast ay ay mr troubridge be proper thing to do exclaimed saunders who meanwhile have joined will get lead take few cast round hurried off to put resolve into execution a descended to main deck by way of starboard poop ladder grace hartley fully clad ascended to poop by way of other approaching exclaimed oh george oh mr troubridge dreadful thing have happened what doe unnatural stillness of ship mean mean gracie dear answered gurney that there have be violent submarine earthquake have replaced most of water be round about hour ago with dry land a may see by looking about unnatural stillness ' of ship a call be due to fact that be now afloat at least hope so in small lake instead of upon open ocean be sum substance of what have happened to statement may add that earthquake have passed there be now further danger there be therefore reason why must not be in bed miss hartley there very strongly advise to go forthwith thank mr george gurney for information advice answered grace with little quavering laugh testified to extent of alarm from poor girl have be suffering a to latter however continued will not follow for simple reason that must be quite impossible for to sleep notwithstanding reassuring statement that danger have now passed therefore a imagine that men will not attempt to turn in again to night will go to galley light fire make cup of good strong coffee for believe will all be better so saying tripped away on to main deck forward to galley from dark recess of presently saw cheerful light gleaming within hour ministering angel have placed within hand of of cup of steaming hot coffee buttered biscuit meanwhile saunders having procured lead line lantern proceeded to sound systematically round ship with result that in due time rejoined on poop reporting a follows there be bed of soft mud under bow mr troubridge on have grounded to about a far aft a fore riggin ' beyond reckon ship afloat for at p'int there be eighteen foot of water gradually deepenin ' to twenty two foot under starn post reckon that be so very hard fast on mud hows'ever for there be good seventeen foot o ' water under bow noticed when 'd finished loadin ' t'other day that only drawed seventeen foot six for'ard chapter seventeen reef be good news remarked when saunders have completed report for short handed though be think may be possible for to get ship afloat again then if a gurney have suggested there happens to be channel carrying depth enough to float may yet hope to find way into open water once more let pray however that channel if such exists doe not trend to windward unless of course happens to be wide enough to work ship in now think first job must be to clew up furl canvas otherwise when breeze come a come may at moment will drive ashore in grim earnest perhaps never get afloat again two companion fully agreed with accordingly halyard having already be let go yard lowered to cap let go sheet manned clewlines buntlines first of main then of fore topsail then let go fore topmast staysail halyard hauled down sail finally laying out securing before going aloft to furl topsail tackled one at time next thing to be thought about be how to provide for safety of ship when breeze must come again a come soon must a ship then lay be heading almost exactly due east if wind must happen to come away out from quarter seemed to be prevailing direction thereabout thought not improbable that might blow off mudbank go ashore again on lee side of lake quite possibly in very much worse position than then occupied gurney saunders be quite of opinion after talking matter over for while decided to get stream anchor over bow in place of one left behind at island bend hawser to have ready to let go at moment did without difficulty anchor in question being of weight not too great for three of to handle by time that job be ended first sign of coming dawn began to show away to eastward with one consent gurney saunders sprang into main rigging made way aloft to crosstrees with purpose of taking good look round at surroundings in low latitude day come quickly have not occupied lofty perch many minute when up leapt sun flashing golden beam over dark expanse spread out around saw to dismay that occupied small basin one of many such situated almost in exact centre of vast reef stretching over distance roughly estimated at thirty mile from north to south perhaps twenty mile from east to west salt water have be hove up with reef have by time run off leaving dark weed covered rock fully exposed to view here there of course owing to exceeding roughness irregularity of surface be scattered numerous pool small others of considerable extent must obviously soon evaporate disappear under influence of sun beam disagreeable possibility suggested to that pool in mercury floated might share same fate hoped not for there be at least three channel wide enough to permit passage of ship leading out of basin stretching away across reef joining other channel until labyrinth became too intricate for eye to follow trusted that one more of might lead to open ocean while still remained aloft discussing situation best mean of extricating from light air from eastward arose redolent of mingled odour of mud seaweed a wind from direction if must come strong enough might greatly assist effort to get ship off mudbank upon be partially grounded decided that must at once try effect of setting main topsail throwing aback so while gurney saunders proceeded with work looked about for suitable berth in to moor ship in event of effort to refloat being crowned with success at height of main topmast crosstrees be easy for to discern pretty clearly character of bottom of basin in lay a light increased discovered that mudbank held ship be only of very small extent remaining portion of bottom being sandy apparently of almost uniform depth below surface of water affording excellent holding ground there be one place however two hundred fathom to southward of spot where ship then lay seemed to be trifle deeper than elsewhere at once determined that if must by mean clear ourselves of mud must anchor there by time have thus decided other two have cast off gasket from main topsail therefore slid down on deck by way of topgallant backstay cast off clewlines buntlines that saunders might overhaul prior to coming down from aloft then manned sheet of course came home easily enough except for last few inch upon required help of gurney saunders then having squared main topsail yard got halyard to winch with aid of snatch block hoisted sail flat aback gurney then went forward loosed fore topmast staysail ready for setting in case of need while saunders got hand lead dropped over side in order that might be able at once to detect movement on part of ship wind meanwhile have freshened perceptibly be now blowing ten knot breeze effect of soon became perceptible for lead line have not be overboard five minute when saunders cried out that ship be moving at same moment distinctly felt slight tremor in hull followed by barely perceptible jerk then be once more afloat driving astern at once sprang to wheel put hard starboard at same time shouting to gurney saunders to hoist fore topmost staysail then leaving wheel to take care of sprang to main brace throwing port main topsail brace off pin rounding in on starboard a well a must unaided ship have now paid off on port tack a soon a starboard fore topmast staysail sheet be hauled aft began to forge ahead whereupon rushed back to wheel steadied called to gurney to stand by to let go stream anchor to saunders to take cast of lead first cast gave bare four fathom next trifle over four fathom next four half fathom next five fathom gave word to let go anchor haul down staysail at same time abandoning wheel springing to main topsail halyard let run by time that have once more furled canvas breakfast be ready sat down to with excellent appetite having breakfasted gurney again betook aloft to main topmast crosstrees carrying ship telescope with object being to subject reef to thorough scrutiny in hope that with sun now high in heaven light a good a be likely to be might be fortunate enough to discover way of escape from extraordinary prison a matter of fact did now get much clearer on whole more satisfactory view of reef than upon previous occasion although perceived perfect network of channel so narrow a scarcely to permit passage of boat while others be wide enough in place actually to allow ship to work to windward in inequality in surface of reef be so great a to render impossible for to trace of for more than three four mile at utmost there be four channel wide enough to allow passage of ship branching out from basin in lay one trending toward north east running off toward north west then apparently by zigzag course ultimately leading to open water on west side of reef third running west out of basin for distance of about three mile beyond farther course became untraceable fourth broad on starboard bow looked most promising of counted seven pool lakelets in addition similar to own three to northward one to eastward two to southward one to south westward of own one in mercury floated seemed to be largest of reef appeared to be composed wholly of rock covered for most part with weed with broad expanse of sand here there interspersed with mud bank height above ocean level seemed to vary from about foot to ten fifteen foot with occasional isolated hummock rising perhaps a high in case a forty foot with aid of telescope be able to perceive considerable quantity of fish have be stranded left to perish by sudden upheaval appearance of caused slight spasm of alarm on score of health be only partially dissipated by fact to gurney directed attention that already great flock of sea bird have appeared be busily devouring remained aloft for more than hour studying reef so far a be concerned making copious note rough sketch map of in notebook then descended to deck having come to conclusion that only thing to be done be to make systematic exploration of reef especially of channel by mean of one of boat for purpose selected larger of two quarter boat very handsomely modelled craft of twenty six foot long by six foot beam with keel nearly eight inch deep in midships rigged a fore aft schooner have be late captain fancy boat used by for sailing ashore from open roadstead be fitted with air chamber forward aft under of thwart thus being converted into sort of unsinkable lifeboat be therefore in respect eminently suitable for duty upon proposed to employ be rather afraid that upon learning purpose grace hartley might express desire to accompany must be somewhat awkward in view of rough work might possibly lie before to relief expressed a perfectly content to remain aboard alone upon being assured that harm must possibly happen to ship therefore bent ensign on to main signal halyard showed how to hoist directed to run up to main truck in event of anything occurring to render immediate return to ship necessary then having hastily stowed away few biscuit piece of cold salt beef in boat stern locker placed small breaker of fresh water in for ballast lowered to water brought to gangway rigged got away about six bell in forenoon watch grace waving farewell to from poop decided to begin exploration by examining channel opened on south side of basin a be widest most promising of four accordingly upon leaving ship brought boat close to wind on port tack just enabled to point fair for mouth of channel at once proceeded to take sounding have not be under way five minute before found that under whole canvas boat travelled much too fast to enable to sound with frequency accuracy considered necessary be consequently obliged to take in foresail altogether sail boat under single reefed mainsail jib at least during outward journey within ten minute of leaving ship glided into channel be intention to explore found slipping along waterway ranging from two hundred to thousand foot in width with average depth of about five fathom side of channel be very rough irregular direction be also exceedingly erratic varying from east south east to south by west irregularity of direction be worst feature of channel for with prevailing direction of wind at about due east there be stretch of channel looking so close into wind eye that ship must never be sailed through true of stretch be so short that gurney believed mercury must be carried through by making half board must be somewhat hazardous experiment unless wind chanced to veer point two in favour while even then there be other stretch must only be traversed by kedging apart from disadvantage there be nothing to find fault with channel being everywhere wide enough to permit passage of ship depth in never le than twenty foot with fine sandy bottom traversed channel for distance of about nine mile during general trend of might be said to be south east then arrived at point where not only widened out also abruptly took south south west direction to great delight for if ship must by mean be coaxed a far a must then proceed with free wind ala for hope have not traversed more than mile half before found in cul de sac channel coming to abrupt end be very severe disappointment to for after travelling so far meeting with so few difficulty be already beginning to congratulate upon having found way of escape at first attempt however there be use in worrying about only thing to be done be to retrace step try one of other channel must not be supposed that channel have thus traversed to extremity be unbroken on contrary there be several other channel branching out of to right left at various point in length two of at least one about three mile back five mile back have struck a not altogether unpromising idea be now to return examine before starting upon return journey gurney made suggestion be destined to exercise extraordinary influence upon future a lay hove to in cul de sac discussing question of what must next be done attention have be more than once attracted toward large hummock of rock rising thirty forty foot above general level of reef at great distance from margin of channel gurney proposal be that before attempting anything else must land make way to hummock climb ascertain whether observation of value be to be made from summit proposal have so much to commend that be agreed to forthwith laying boat alongside rock at convenient spot three landed set out to walk across reef hummock in question be only two hundred yard from margin of channel therefore soon reached despite difficulty of going surface of reef proving to be exceedingly rough covered for most part with weed so terribly slippery that be positively dangerous to attempt to walk upon when at length reached summit of rock be not much better off for although must see from thence great deal more of reef than be to be observed from boat made discovery be likely to facilitate escape while stood upon summit of rock staring about attention be arrested by sight of great brown patch three four acre in extent showing up strongly against dull black of otherwise weed covered rock although obviously have nothing to do with channel extricating ship from extraordinary situation curiosity be aroused determined to pay visit ascertain character before returning to boat lay three hundred yard to south of hummock saw that upon returning from to boat must only need to pas close to eastward of hummock to hit off correct trail accordingly descended to surface of reef headed for mysterious brown patch soon reached suspicion of true character having dawned upon even before arrived at spot from circumstance that a approached nostril became cognisant of most ancient fish like smell suspicion that have formed be confirmed upon arrival by discovery that object of curiosity be great bed of oyster hove up exposed to air by convulsion of previous night fond a be of oyster did not care to tackle of for apart from fact that many of be already dead did not altogether like appearance of be very much larger than ordinary edible oyster to mind did not look quite wholesome saunders however be far le fastidious than gurney found one two that being immersed in willow pool of salt water be still alive announced intention of trying accordingly producing strong clasp knife contrived with difficulty to open one sooner have forced shell apart than guessed that have stumbled upon fortune in extent probably beyond dream of avarice for a shell parted exposing fish three four small bead like object became revealed that instantly recognised a pearl oyster be undoubtedly pearl oyster million of shell lay at foot doubtless contained gem enough to make rich for remainder of day not to be behindhand with saunders seized one of bivalve already dead with shell gaping apart tore open although shell be lined with beautiful lustrous mother o ' pearl be barren of gem flinging away tried third fourth with like result fifth yielded nine small pearl about size of duck shot number six seven proved barren eighth surrendered to eager grasp magnificent pearl perfectly globular quite inch in diameter when cleaned of exquisite lustre colour gurney saunders meanwhile have be a busily engaged a between have secured three more gem not quite so large a mine about a much seed pearl a must half fill ordinary wineglass one of three smaller pearl however secured by gurney amply made up in beauty what lacked in size for be of most exquisitely delicate yet rich rose colour friend said a soon a be able to collect scattered sens speak intelligibly be said that darkest cloud have silver lining extraordinary accident by have become imprisoned in mesh of reef let hope only temporarily have at same time presented with treasure of incalculable value think must be almost criminally negligent if failed to make utmost of marvellous good fortune therefore propose that before proceed further with exploration of reef take step to secure wealth lie spread so lavishly at foot let take oyster spread at least portion of in row so that sun may get at speedily bring about state of decomposition understand be necessary to enable gem contain to be secured uninjured further propose be value of wealth may ultimately secure be equally divided between four of for must be manifestly unfair that miss hartley must not equally participate in good a in ill fortune what say companion cheerfully agreed with proposal point settled forthwith proceeded to collect oyster indiscriminately from enormous heap lay out singly upon seaweed in long row taking care to place bivalve quite flat in order that a process of decomposition proceeded precious content must not roll out be lost so absorbed be in occupation that did not desist until sun hung upon very verge of western horizon by time have placed in position very nearly three thousand oyster not until then did find time to remember that have eaten nothing since leaving ship then returning to boat cleansed hand in water alongside shook out reef set canvas headed boat back to ship snatching hasty meal a went chapter eighteen pearl breeze freshened with disappearance of sun beneath horizon boat under whole canvas in perfectly smooth water of canal like channel fairly flew along careening almost gunwale to with merry buzzing of water at sharp stem a sheared through with sound like rending of silk in about hour half favoured with free wind sufficiency of starlight to enable to see way found once more alongside ship tired with fatigue of day excited happy at amazing good fortune have befallen for moment must neither think talk of anything pearl precarious situation of ship consideration of what might happen to must gale spring up be entirely lost sight of already saunders if not gurney be anxiously considering what must do with wealth when have conveyed safely home grace hartley woman like fairly gloated over sight of lovely gem that have brought back with earnestly besought that might be allowed to accompany on next visit to oyster bed in order that might have delight of securing few with own hand after demur promised that might do so on following day by end of must probably have have quite enough of for decomposition of animal matter be speedy under tropical sun experience even of single day led to conclude that twenty four hour must reduce stranded oyster to condition sufficiently revolting to tax even male endurance pretty severely following morning found early astir moment that breakfast be over boat be brought alongside provision for day passed down into then gurney descended assisted sweetheart down side saunders following bringing up rear boat sail be set under whole canvas pushed off on way to oyster bed for craving for wealth be upon felt that moment spent otherwise than in gathering be so much wasted time breeze be still blowing fresh although for greater part of distance boat be jammed close upon wind made excellent time between ship point of destination arriving there after pleasant sail of le than two hour long before arrived began to wish have thought of putting gun into boat for while be still good two mile from oyster bed saw bird hovering over in thousand strongly suspected that upon arrival must find that same bird have played havoc with previous day work so did for when reached spot found neatly arranged row of oyster turned topsy turvy by bird in endeavour to get at fish while odour emanated from million of dead bivalve be already powerful enough to upset strong stomach although bird have completely disarranged labour of preceding day did not appear to have otherwise done very serious damage be true that single oyster that have laid out so carefully have be attacked dragged out of place fish extracted nearly hundred pearl of value be found between otherwise empty shell while careful examination of ground revealed fully a many more together with a much seed pearl a must rather more than fill half pint measure grace hartley accompanied from boat to oyster bed remained long enough to actually find for two very fine pearl sufficed confessed that effluvium be altogether too powerful for beat hasty retreat to boat where spent remainder of day in comparative comfort only occasional faint whiff of odour reaching there a for male have taken precaution to bring along with ship bucket filled with salt water upon leaving boat pearl found whether large small be dropped into a soon a found first task be to go very carefully over ground upon have laid out oyster on previous day retrieving pearl have be thrown out of shell by bird in endeavour to extract fish when have satisfied ourselves that more be to be found there turned attention to bed where also bird have be still remained exceedingly busy did not then attempt to look for spilled pearl for bulk of oyster be by time dead have be so long enough to render opening of shell quite easy matter therefore wandered about bed examining such of shell a happened to be gaping open extracting pearl might happen to be therein then flinging fish shell a far away to leeward a must have done with now tossed aside in order that might not inadvertently find handling second time toiled assiduously throughout whole of day two companion smoking steadily time in order to counteract a far a might be sickening odour of fast decaying fish when knocked off work shortly before sunset found that altogether have gathered during day five hundred nineteen pearl varying in size from large pea to marble nearly quart measure full of seed pearl prize be generally speaking of usual soft sheeny white colour there be exception to two more pink pearl being found a well a one of deep rich exquisite rose colour one of very delicate shade of sea green seven of so very dark smoke colour that be almost black did not think very much of last believing that extremely dark colour be against ultimately discovered that be very far from being case precise shade of colour being exceedingly rare none of have much appetite for food night when got back to ship when turned out next morning be even le desirous of food than have be on previous evening be suffering from violent headache accompanied by great nausea be fain to confess that have have quite enough of oyster bed for present therefore soon agreed to let that part of reef very severely alone for at least week to devote interval to prosecution of survey of channel accordingly after making ineffectual attempt to do justice to excellent meal grace hartley have provided for three male hauled boat alongside descended into got under way course for first seven half mile lay along canal leading to oyster bed purpose being to examine two promising looking channel branched out of that have already noticed commented upon on reaching more distant a thought more promising of two bore up with wind over starboard quarter ran away on west south west course for about five mile next hauling up to about south by time that have run four mile in new direction saw clearly that channel must be of possible service to for began to shoal ultimately became too willow to float ship therefore a simultaneously with discovery caught strong whiff of tainted wind from oyster bed four mile to windward put down helm tacked retraced step going back couple of mile along oyster bed channel to other channel desired to examine be by time about noon purer air of reef generally although even be not wholly innocent of suggestion of decaying fish have so far restored appetite that decided to pipe to dinner accordingly upon entering new channel opened out package grace have prepared for fell to channel in now found trended generally about north east by east for distance of four half mile there be therefore short stretch in here there where wind came too shy to allow boat to lay course consequently have to beat to windward long leg short one in stretch at length reached point where channel took due northerly trend when away went with flowing sheet under short canvas sounding industriously way then after have traversed ten mile in of new channel quite suddenly unexpectedly found in basin very similar to in mercury lay peacefully at anchor not quite so large coasted along weather side of basin for distance of about two mile then found channel at once entered channel trended north east have not sailed above four mile before narrowed so much that saw must be useless to therefore bore up returned to newly discovered basin continuing progress round found channel branching out of north western extremity a have rather promising appearance plunged into trended away to northward westward for first seven mile then turned abruptly toward southward for distance of five mile when found in channel trending about north north west south south east channel be even more promising than one have just emerged from being almost double width be puzzled for moment a to direction to take whether to head to northward southward northerly trending channel might lead anywhere southerly portion on other hand looked a though might possibly take back to ship spar of be visible nine mile away decided to try latter a day be by time well advanced must ultimately find obliged to retrace step must make very late in getting back to ship fortunately however be not driven to latter alternative for after following winding course of southerly channel for distance of twelve mile arrived at north eastern extremity of basin in mercury lay at anchor safely arrived alongside hour later having spent day in circumnavigating portion of reef thus discovered to be entirely surrounded by channel of width depth of water sufficient to allow of passage of ship discovery however be of practical service to for still left in original state of uncertainty regarding existence of channel through ship might be taken into open water narrative of effort to find such channel have be given thus far with considerable detail in order to bring home to reader idea of extreme awkwardness of situation difficulty perplexity with found confronted there be need to continue story further in quite so detailed form since progress of research be unaccompanied by anything in nature of adventure let suffice therefore to say that traversed multitudinous canal like channel of labyrinthine reef continuously for ten day longer before found passage of sufficient width with sufficient depth of water in everywhere to enable mercury to go through to open sea passage when found proved to be continuation of channel originating in north eastern angle of what have now come to speak of a mercury basin from fact that ship lay anchored in although be undoubted fact that have actually found channel leading from basin to open water difficulty in way of successfully carrying ship through be so great that have very grave doubt of ability to accomplish in first place course of channel be of so winding character according to very careful estimate ship must have to traverse le than hundred ten mile of waterway before clearing reef consequently must be impossible to accomplish whole distance during hour of daylight of single day while to attempt navigation of portion of during hour of darkness be altogether too hazardous undertaking to be calmly thought of a though difficulty be not in sufficient there be stretch of twelve mile of channel running in north easterly direction ship must not possibly negotiate under sail unless change of wind must occur of there seemed to be absolutely prospect only alternative therefore must be to kedge twelve mile truly most formidable undertaking for four person one of being girl to attempt fortunately however for problem of how to overcome tremendous difficulty be solved for by accident quite unexpectedly for upon going over long intricate channel again in order thoroughly to familiarise with to become better acquainted with many danger point happened that on return journey be being made by moonlight missed way continuing along what appeared to be main channel instead of diverging into branch trending to eastward by time that discovered mistake be so favourably impressed with appearance of new strange channel seemed to be running almost straight toward mercury basin that determined to follow up see whither led not to dilate unnecessarily upon portion of adventure discovered to infinite satisfaction delight that did indeed ultimately conduct back to ship that too by route reduced distance to be travelled to about forty five mile very considerably le than of other channel moreover while original channel first ran north then north east for twelve mile be only to be covered by kedging before ultimately changed course to south in direction point of ultimate egress lay new channel left mercury basin at western leeward extremity running first west then south west ultimately south straight out to sea thus whole distance must be traversed under sail with free wind three following day night be devoted to most careful re examination of new channel with result that thoroughly satisfied a to absolute practicability with mind thus relieved of tremendous load of anxiety felt once more able to turn thought in direction of pearl harvest full fortnight have be devoted to exploration of reef since last visit to oyster bed be of opinion that ought by time to be in such condition a to afford very handsome return for labour accordingly after allowing day rest to enable to recover from fatigue of recent arduous boat duty once more repaired to oyster bed grace hartley preferring on occasion to remain at home a put rather than again face disgusting sight odour have met on occasion of visit upon arrival at scene of operation soon found that fortnight have made vast amount of difference in condition of oyster for whereas when have last visited oyster bed process of putrefaction have only just begun have now advanced so far that fish be not only completely decayed have also in many case so completely dried up under influence of sun ray a to have to very great extent lost odour furthermore bird have be so busy that more than shell have be completely emptied task therefore although still excessively disagreeable promised to be far le revoltingly offensive disgusting than have be before even such offensiveness a still remained contrived to mitigate to very considerable extent by adopting simple plan of starting work on windward edge of bed whereby accumulated odour be blown away from instead of directly in face a on previous occasion now went to work systematically roughly dividing bed into three nearly equal portion one of be to be gone over very carefully by of also have bucket into to drop spoil so that there might be time lost unnecessary fatigue incurred in passing to fro system of working be simplicity merely consisted in starting operation on extreme weather side of bed examining fish just a came to hand extracting such pearl a contained dropping gem into bucket of water with of be provided then throwing shell out on reef apart from still untouched toiled on thus day with pause of hour about midday when retired to boat cleaned a well a must snatched hasty meal concluding labour about hour before sunset when during run back to ship at end of day proceeded to compare note take stock of result of labour came to conclusion that bed be enormously rich one that have have exceedingly lucky day for combined booty consisted of over fourteen hundred pearl sixty three of be of quite exceptional value from size colour full quart measure of seed pearl be of opinion at time be so still that might have obtained considerably more than did of last for eagerness with prosecuted search for larger gem caused search for smaller seed pearl to degenerate into very perfunctory operation story of one day work at oyster bed be story of be therefore unnecessary to say more upon subject than spent full fortnight upon task of gathering pearl by end of time have acquired so much dexterity at work that did more in one day than did in two at beginning of labour then although at expiration of fortnight seemed to have made scarcely perceptible inroad upon enormous deposit grew tired of self imposed task mutually agreed that have accumulated a much wealth a required moreover a watched increase of wealth day by day anxiety grew lest perchance anything must happen to prevent escape from reef return to civilisation where alone wealth must be of real value to reader may reasonably ask what ground of justification have for fear that anything must possibly happen to prevent escape seeing that have be fortunate enough to discover channel through ship might be easily taken out to sea think still carried vivid recollection of terrific natural convulsion have placed in extraordinary situation then occupied believe others shared with feeling that thing having once happened might possibly happen again reef have held prisoner for so long might sink again to ocean depth perchance carrying ship with in terrific turmoil must ensue might be hove up still higher leaving ship stranded immovable then what must be plight therefore when on evening of certain day gurney ventured to voice suggestion that must now be well to think seriously of making good escape while yet opportunity to do so remained to of others raised so much a single word of protest on contrary agreed to proposal with eagerness clearly showed how welcome be to a for said gurney when walking poop with night discussing matter way be now clear gracie will get married a soon a arrive in sydney then think may venture to return home once more hope to find welcome beneath roof tree

chaplain offered to communicate with father endeavour to effect reconciliation refused have vowed that must never return home until must do so a thoroughly reformed character therefore made way down to dock took first berth offered under assumed name of george gurney became common sailor will think perhaps to go to sea in such capacity be not quite best possible method whereby to effect reformation may be be not be determined that nothing nothing must stand in way think may now say without undue confidence have succeeded gracie to whom have told story assures that need longer fear to face father believe for woman can see more deeply than man so now will return home to be comfort a devoutly hope to dear father declining year perhaps with aid of wealth may be able to do enough good to obliterate memory of grief shame have caused to suffer be story troubridge will add to be if ever feel tempted to stray though ever so slightly from path of rectitude think of man whom once knew a george gurney let history serve a warning to now will say good night for must be stirring early to morrow chapter nineteen once more in open water slept anything soundly that night fearing that if abandoned too completely to influence of drowsy god might not awake early enough in morning to ensure accomplishment of be to be done next day for have to hoist boat make sail traverse forty five mile of winding channel through reef in order to reach open water before darkness overtook although be astir with first sign of coming dawn found upon going out on deck that gurney saunders be before too appeared have be too anxious to do more than doze restlessly intermittently through hot night finally a though by mutual consent have turned out about hour before daylight after softly pacing main deck together chatting smoking for about hour have gone forward lighted galley fire proceeded to prepare early breakfast in order that might all be ready to turn to moment that have light enough to see what be about when went forward looked into galley light from have attracted attention instant emerged from cabin be greeted with mingled aroma of boiling cocoa frying bacon a well a with cheery good morning of two men who be bending over galley stove have scarcely have time to exchange greeting with when fourth member of party awakened by movement while dressing made appearance promptly assumed charge of culinary operation left three male of party free to tackle more arduous duty of day forthwith proceeded to unrig boat make ready for hoisting by time that task have be advanced to point of hooking on hauling taut davit tackle be summoned to breakfast in high spirit sat down to partake of what hoped must be last meal one before must find once more at sea meal over proceeded to get quarter boat hoisted to davit heavy boat though be for three men to handle soon accomplished with assistance of couple of watch tackle in employment of have by time through much usage become expert then came loosing setting of canvas decided that a before must rely upon three topsail fore topmast staysail to carry to destination being a much canvas a must conveniently handle hour half sufficed to get sail set to satisfaction braced ready for casting ship then sending grace hartley aft to wheel be now able to manipulate a deftly a of gurney stood by fore brace while saunders armed with axe proceeded to forecastle stood by to sever hawser by ship rode at proper moment word be given axe fell once twice be once more adrift ship gathering stern way paying off with helm hard

hauled over helm steadied old mercury began to forge ahead not to stop again a hoped until must arrive in sydney harbour now most ticklish part of task lay before for have to navigate forty five mile of narrow winding channel negotiate several very awkward place where slightest mistake meant disaster before must find once more rising falling in safety on swell of open pacific have talked matter over dozen time more before reaching stage of adventure knew exactly what be best to be done therefore proceeded forthwith to do for there be time for hesitation when ship be under way in narrow water have to be done must be done smartly on instant channel have to traverse toward entrance of ship be now heading started by heading due west for short distance then swerved to about south west then looked up to about south by east thence undulating slightly point so east west trended south for remainder of length now there be two three short reach of channel longest of not much more than mile in length where must find wind shy enough to necessitate ship being braced sharp up on port tack to enable to negotiate successfully be necessary for one of to be aloft to con ship a be obvious that other two must not brace round yard of ship of mercury size be sooner free of anchor than although ship be at moment running off square before wind sprang to brace braced yard sharp up on port tack in readiness for negotiation of reach of have spoken for while ship must run before wind with yard braced sharp up must not sail close hauled with yard square have therefore settled that proper thing to do be to provide for difficult point at once by time that be done be so close to western extremity of basin entrance of channel that became necessary for to jump aloft at once while gurney relieved grace hartley at wheel saunders stood in waist with eye on in fore topmast crosstrees ready to pas word from to helmsman from whom be hidden by main mizen topsail be bound to admit that when reached crosstrees noted speed with ship be sliding along in perfectly smooth water under impulsion of fine brisk easterly breeze observed narrowness tortuousness of channel that have to traverse winding hither through vast expanse of reef heart almost quailed within felt inclined to doubt whether three male possessed ability skill quickness of eye readiness strength of hand to take ship in safety through apparently endless twisting channel feeling be merely momentary old adage flashed into mind to effect that one need never trouble about crossing bridge until one come to also that be very unwise to meet trouble halfway told must not worry about difficulty danger ahead must stand up there in crosstrees deal with one at time a came to so did with gratifying result when sun lower rim have reached to within finger breadth of western horizon mercury slid out past southern edge of reef made first curtsy a once more dipped to swell of open ocean having triumphantly negotiated overcome one of difficulty of endless rock bound channel sprang into topgallant rigging shinned up to royal yard from elevation be able to watch over head of main topsail great black expanse of reef receding on quarter until sun plunged beneath horizon in blaze of purple crimson gold then descended to deck by way of backstay walked aft to exchange congratulation with little group of two men woman who stood clustered about wheel watching evanishment of strange rock prison in fast gathering gloom of tropical night before descending from aloft have taken precaution to fling one long lingering embracing glance round horizon ahead from one quarter to other have pretty well satisfied that there be danger lurking in road along be going white curl of surf to warn of existence of treacherous sunken reef next act therefore be to bring ship a close to wind a must lie on port tack lash wheel adjust after brace in such way that craft must steer then go below to partake of very excellent meal grace hartley have prepared specially to celebrate occasion of happy escape from reef ensuing fortnight be period absolutely barren of event weather remaining fine wind steady during whole time so that have nothing to do just to permit ship to drive steadily along to southward hour after hour day after day at average speed of about four knot be true that during course of fortnight sighted passed several

anchor nowhere if must help for be now anxiety to reach destination a quickly a possible care of so big ship be heavy responsibility to rest upon shoulder of three men girl desired to free ourselves of without moment unnecessary delay quite apart from that monotony of thing be beginning to get upon nerve for gurney grace hartley be doubtless well enough so long a must be together mattered little to to what length voyage might be spun out so far a be concerned think might also answer for saunders be beginning to crave for sight of fresh face sound of new voice stir bustle excitement of life

barometer high in short there be indication that be booked for long spell of calm weather before must find to southward of equator so indeed proved for believe may say with absolute truth never for five consecutive minute during ten succeeding day have sufficient wind to extinguish flame of candle true there be occasional evanescent breathing came stealing along from nowhere in particular gently ruffling few superficial yard of ocean glassy surface into faintest blue for brief two three minute at time then vanishing again during whole of period never have enough wind to keep canvas fully

gazing waiting canopy of cloud that arched above be rent asunder by steel bright flash of lightning so intensely vivid that be completely blinded for few second next instant there followed crash of thunder must have drowned combined broadside of thousand line of battle ship tremendous concussion of caused poor old mercury to quiver tremble from stem to stern now look out for rain shouted gurney exultantly a sprang to close skylight cover jump below gracie dear continued get under cover before rain come wash overboard rain did not come at least not just then a though that first flash have be signal gun whole of visible heaven seemed to break at same moment into lightning flash for full quarter of hour there be such terrific lancing of lightning such crashing roaring rumbling of thunder that one might almost have thought navy of world have foregathered up aloft there with one accord have set about task of annihilating other during whole of time not solitary drop of rain fell not enough stirring of air occurred to extinguish flame of candle have nothing to do simply to stand there dazzled deafened watch a far a might wonderful awe inspiring manifestation of conflicting force of nature happened that schooner lay right in wake of most violent part of storm therefore have full in view a stood watched people be at time busily engaged in restowing mainsail jib apparently convinced that ultimate outcome of elemental disturbance must be outfly of wind against must be well to be fully prepared have got mainsail down eight ten hand be stretched along length of boom tightly rolling up great fold of canvas while four more be laid out on jibboom furling jib when storm seemed to reach height great vivid flash of lightning like sword of blue green fire lighting up whole scene with ghastly glare fell a appeared to full upon little craft next instant a accompanying peal of thunder crashed boomed in ear distinctly saw flash a of fire leap up aboard accompanied by great puff of whitish smoke be only momentary have appearance of explosion be perfectly apparent that something more le serious have happened to little vessel after appreciable pause on part of crew a though be collecting faculty in face of sudden disaster broke at once into state of feverish activity rushing hither thither about deck like men who be attempting to do dozen separate distinct thing at same moment then came flash of flame on board in moment a seemed to whole after part of burst into fierce blaze why gurney exclaimed turning to where man stood with sweetheart that last flash of lightning seems to have set schooner on fire yes answered be blazing like tar barrel if rain doe come within next two three minute will have work cut out to extinguish flame ay cut in saunders be right there george look how flare up why must be a dry a tinder ah there go with bucket what be use of bucket against blaze like why get hose along start head pump will never put out that fire by balin ' up water from over side no assented gurney by mean of hose head pump nothing good downpour of rain will do good now rain seems to be holding off scissors ought to fetch down a terrific flash of lightning illuminated whole scene from horizon to horizon did not lightning fierce vivid baleful continued to flash thunder rolled crashed reverberated in one continuous deafening uproar rain held off for good five minute longer during fire aboard schooner gained apace spread with amazing rapidity when at heaven opened overladen cloud began to discharge content be not by mean kind of tropical deluge might have reasonably be expected simply sudden brisk shower lasting le than minute then ceasing abruptly be neither copious enough of sufficient duration to be of appreciable service to crew of schooner indeed did not perceptibly check progress of flame to onlooker aboard mercury seemed that other craft be irretrievably doomed such also seemed to be opinion of own crew for be presently seen to be frantically busy over clearing away of longboat be stowed on top of main hatch safety of be now threatened by rapidly advancing flame do think that will succeed in extinguishing fire george asked grace hartley a clung to lover arm gazed with wide open eye of anxiety at progress of conflagration answered gurney unhesitatingly to be quite candid with dear may be cargo that schooner carry be evidently of highly combustible character now seems to be fairly ignited fire gain ground even a stand gaze if crew must not conquer at outset be not likely to do so now what think mr troubridge quite agree with answered that schooner then interrupted grace passionately with impatient stamp of foot on deck if really think that what be standing here idly for why be not doing something to help poor fellow who be in danger of perishing in flame because dear there be need a yet at event answered gurney see continued be clearing away own boat if can only contrive to get into water before be irretrievably damaged will be right have to cross narrow space of water to reach safety a for can hing must need two of to take one of quarter boat alongside that schooner in time to be of service to people with weather a be at moment must be height of madness for to make attempt for suppose that thunderstorm be to end in heavy squall of wind a may at moment catching boat with saunders in halfway thereabout between two vessel what must be result why that must be equally unable to reach schooner return to mercury must part company chance be that none of must ever again meet in world suppose must be willing to risk great deal to help fellow creature in extremity must not lightly undertake adventure may be fatal to while of very problematical advantage to others ah see there be answer to appeal gracie have cleared away longboat now be hoisting out none too soon either for if eye deceive one gang have to sluice with water to prevent taking fire while others be getting over side be even a gurney have said flame have spread with such astounding rapidity that schooner crew only saved boat by very skin of teeth presently splashed safely into water alongside a did so schooner people seemed to pour over vessel low rail in body scarcely giving time to unhook tackle before flung out oar shoved off indeed there be very urgent need for haste for not only be entire after part of schooner ablaze by time flame shooting straight up in breathless air a high a little vessel main truck within last minute so there have occurred that abrupt cessation in case of tropical thunderstorm be so frequently precursor of sudden brief exceedingly violent squall of wind if threatened squall must burst bond come shrieking howling in fury across surface of sea scourging into mad turmoil of foaming leaping water blinding spindrift while burnt out crew of schooner be making passage across to mercury might be very bad for for even must be fortunate enough to avoid capsizal might be exceedingly difficult if not altogether impossible for ship smitten bowed down by might of tempest to pause pick up of course a fully expected boat headed straight for mercury only question now be whether must reach before brooding tempest broke loose involved in clutch glanced anxiously round horizon be not reassured by what saw for aspect of heaven have rapidly grown so threatening that looked a though outburst must inevitably come within next minute two while strive a might stranger must not get alongside in le than ten minute at least must do absolutely nothing to help for at moment there be not faintest perceptible movement of atmosphere craft lay a motionless a log in timber pond looked aloft at vane at masthead might have be made of cast iron for movement that betrayed wetted finger held up turning way that in hope of detecting draught however slight there be nothing glance at blazing hull of schooner showed that flame be shooting heavenward a straight a flame of candle burning in vault there be nothing to be done except to get number of rope end ready to fling into boat moment that came alongside must succeed in doing so did flinging coil of brace what not off pin to deck in readiness to cast at moment when perhaps second more le might make difference between life death to fourteen fifteen of fellow creature that occupant of boat be a fully alive a ourselves to critical nature of situation be clear from desperate energy with toiled at six oar have thrown out stout ash blade bending almost to breaking point at stroke sending long trail of tiny froth flecked swirl seething driving astern a men sprang bent back to work while water buzzed foamed under craft bluff bow be racing for life knew fathom by fathom heavy boat surged ahead over oil smooth surface of black water with scowling sky writhing overhead a though spirit of storm be struggling to burst bond leap upon be already so near at hand that must hear cry a shouted encouragement to other when sudden puff of air from north west swept over ship causing topsail staysail to momentarily fill with report like musket shot with quick jar creaking of truss parrals block sheaf before canvas again collapsed to mast with rustling sound that to overstrained sens seemed preternaturally loud be coming now look there over starboard quarter shouted gurney pointing putting hand to mouth yelled to in approaching boat pull men pull for life will miss yet looked in direction indicated sure enough be a gurney have said sky in quarter be black a night beneath be long line of white foam marked progress of approaching squall be racing down upon with incredible speed near a boat be be evident that squall must strike before must get alongside once in grip of raving fury of wind earthly power must save unfortunate who be now fighting like maniac to reach ark of safety floated so near yet not near enough something must be done risk must be taken to help that must without effort of sort suffer to be cruelly snatched away far beyond reach of desperately struggling men leaving to miserably perish be unthinkable back fore topsail yelled springing down poop ladder to main deck feverishly casting off fore brace be only thing that can do may lose topmast must risk that with fore topsail aback may perhaps be able to edge down upon pick up otherwise will never set eye upon again working like demon of seeming to be possessed for moment of strength of dozen men got head yard braced round brace made fast before squall reached then sprang aft to wheel while gurney saunders snatching up a many loose coil of rope a must grasp stood by to drop into boat a reached wheel wrenched hard starboard squall with indescribable fury of sound struck fortunately well over starboard quarter with report like cannon shot creaking groaning of overstrained spar timber mercury buried bow in boiling sea gathered way paying off square before wind a did so let go well off until longboat be broad on starboard bow then putting helm hard down brought ship close to wind thus throwing fore topsail aback by mercy of providence judging distance with such nicety that next moment longboat by time full to thwart utterly helpless be scraping along under shelter of lee side while ship suddenly arrested by backed topsail careened until lee rail be level with foam gurney saunders hove rope end fair into boat there be need for ship be bowed so steeply that occupant be able to seize rail scramble inboard unaided in a many second fourteen strange men have transferred from sinking longboat to deck while boat rasping astern along ship side capsized turned bottom up a drove clear gurney flourished hand to a sign that be well then a once more put helm up allowed ship to go off before wind seized three four of dazed stranger invoked aid to square foreyard be with mighty sigh of relief presently resigned wheel to saunders went forward to greet welcome rescued men for by skin of teeth have saved in very nick of time too without parting so much a ropeyarn furthermore by extraordinary stroke of fortune good for although bad for have in most unexpected manner secured service of enough hand to enable to work ship without being constantly worried a to quantity of sail that might safely venture to set therefore be now in position to avail to utmost extent of kind of weather must hope to bring remarkable voyage to speedy conclusion a joined group of stranger clustered about gurney down on main deck be easy to determine even before came within sound of tongue that be british australian be to say for one bore well marked characteristic of sturdy independent self reliant race gurney at once took upon to perform ceremony of introduction mate said indicating be skipper mr troubridge be youngster a may see for yourselves may take word for so long a command everything will go right with story be long one queer one too long too queer to be spun just now so must wait will all be glad to know that be bound for port that hail from so please god will not be long before see sweetheart wife once more mr troubridge be mr thomson chief mate of schooner seamew blazing out yonder rest be remainder of crew whose name have not yet have time to learn welcome aboard mercury mr thomson men of seamew said be heartily glad that since be lot to meet with misfortune happened to be near enough at hand to pick up what of captain where be be sorry to say mr troubridge answered thomson that captain peter mr girdlestone second mate be struck dead by flash of lightning set schooner afire be obliged to leave aboard to burn with since have time to do anything else seamew be cap'n peter own property be out after sandalwood of schooner be more 'n half full when misfortune happened to fought flame a long a must in hope of savin ' never have chance from very first for be old a dry a inside of tinder box burned like pine splinter hung on to so long that have to leave belonging aboard comin ' away with just what stood up in cut so fine that if 'd delayed minute 'd be in davy locker now ay said there be very little doubt of think however miss be a good a mile say be here except unfortunate captain second mate so must make yourselves a comfortable a can until arrive in sydney be afraid will have to ask to work passage for be very short handed a will have seen doubt when arrive oh be right sir cut in thomson of course will work passage glad of chance to do so be lucky thing for that be near enough to pick up so matter be arranged gurney thomson heading watch of six men while cook steward of seamew respectively took charge of mercury galley pantry saunders promptly escaped from cabin to more congenial atmosphere of forecastle where entertained men during remainder of voyage with story of adventure first on island afterwards on reef timely hint from gurney terse strong kept lip closed upon subject of pearl of existence of on board not man of schooner crew ever became aware there be little more that need be said in order to bring story of very remarkable adventurous voyage to close schooner continued to blaze fiercely flame fanned to ever increasing fury by strength of wind for about hour after have run past when suddenly lost sight of thomson opinion being that by time upper work have be completely consumed that sea have gained access to interior sending charred remains to bottom true tail of squall brought along smart shower of rain that lasted about ten minute be over again before disappeared so that alternative theory of brady boatswain that rain extinguished flame found little acceptance with in case be not worth while returning to seek for even have be found must have be mere burnt out shell of value to anyone squall blew out in about twenty minute wind continued to blow strongly through night be not until sunrise on following morning that weather moderated sufficiently to induce gurney to send hand aloft to turn out reef make sail when went on deck however at seven bell be glorious weather sky clear save for few light fleecy cloud drifting solemnly along out of north west moderate sea running ship bowling gaily along under plain sail starboard studding sail sight have not gazed upon for many long day crossed equator during forenoon of day meeting with favourable weather for remainder of voyage entered port jackson without further adventure three week later coming to anchor close to garden island arrival of mercury so long overdue that have be given up a lost created quite little local sensation be vastly increased when history of voyage be made public to extent indeed that government ship be dispatched to island with authority to arrest wilde polson tudsbery upon charge of piracy bring to sydney for trial business of ship fact that gurney saunders grace hartley must be required a witness at trial detained at sydney until return of corvette from island two month later news brought back sent thrill of horror throughout colony be to effect that upon arrival at spot latitude longitude of have given small islet have be discovered upon examination proved to be crater of volcano have evidently be very recently in state of violent activity trace of life be to be found upon have islet resemblance to extensive beautiful island have described weather however proving favourable captain of corvette have anchored ship for several day close to islet have caused extensive series of sounding to be taken round upon being plotted to large scale be of such character a to leave doubt that islet be indeed summit of peak of wilde island that latter have most probably be engulfed with inhabitant by same cataclysm have imprisoned mercury among mesh of pearl reef escape therefore from common destruction have overtaken rest have be exceedingly narrow one margin of safety amounting in fact to le than three day for there can be question have mercury be at mooring in basin even within few mile of island when catastrophe occurred must never have survived consignee of mercury original cargo name address of whom be mentioned in ship manifest found by with rest of ship paper in captain desk be of course only too glad to accept cargo of sandalwood brought from island in lieu of much le valuable merchandise originally consigned to at once chartered ship to carry wood to canton one of partner mr henderson going with in capacity of supercargo to dispose of upon arrival there be not much difficulty in engaging master officer crew for ship subsequently learned that arrived safely that cargo be speedily disposed of tea purchased with proceeds ship dispatched with to england where duly arrived net result of adventure being big profit for fortunate consignee gentleman be scotchman although person of nationality have reputation of keeping very tight hand upon bawbee be bound to say that treated gurney saunders with liberality not to say generosity left nothing to be desired although of course have claim on result being that not only be able to maintain most comfortably in sydney while awaiting return of corvette from island also to return afterwards to england a first class passenger be to say gurney grace hartley did so saunders remained in colony eventually became prosperous exceedingly wealthy sheep farmer a for gurney lost time in making grace hartley wife officiating a best man on occasion three went home together in cuddy of same ship upon arrival be happy privilege to be mean of opening negotiation with father sir george burnley baronet of chudleigh grange devon resulted in complete permanent reconciliation between two gurney burnley to give correct name have learned lesson while passing through fire of adversity have learned in school of experience that best of school that so called pleasure of sin endure for very brief season be inevitably followed by misery suffering shame self contempt beyond power of word to express have resolution strength to pull together become once more man in best highest sense of term before be too late mental moral physical ruin complete irretrievable have overtaken have joy of seeing father belief pride in fully restored of making that father declining year easy pleasant happy now reign in father stead honoured respected beloved by pride joy of wife child a for pearl when at length have succeeded in converting into money produced so unexpectedly magnificent fortune that not only be enabled by mean to obtain commanding interest in corporation owned gold star line of sailing clipper also very materially to assist in converting line from sail to steam be of course very gradual process by time that be complete be not only out of apprenticeship have worked way up to position of chief mate two voyage in capacity sufficed to qualify for position of master now in time of ripened experience hold proud position of commodore of fleet have pleasure of walking bridge a commander of
