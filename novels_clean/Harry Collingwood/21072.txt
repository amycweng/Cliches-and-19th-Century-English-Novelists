there be ay there be sure enough responded old bill from post at tiller having like rest caught momentary glimpse under foot of main sail of shapeless object have revealed for single instant in midst of whirl of boiling breaker only to be lost sight of again a leaping wave hurled once more furiously down upon helpless prey a smack rapidly approached scene of disaster wreck be made out to be that of large ship with only stump of main mast standing be already fast settling down in sand forepart of hull being completely submerged while sea swept incessantly over stern with full poop formed sole refuge of hapless crew now boy remarked old bill when have approached closely enough to perceive desperate situation of on wreck now boy whatever be going to do have got to be done tide rising fast in hour there wo be enough of yon ship left to light fire wi ' be yer ready wi ' anchor ay ay ready be prompt response helm be put down smack plunged round head to wind sail flapping furiously a wind be spilled out of there be need for order men knew exactly what to do did precisely at right moment jib main sail be hauled down secured in le time than take to describe then a little vessel lost way heavy anchor carried expressly for occasion like present be let go cable veered cautiously out so that full strain might not be brought to bear upon too suddenly old bill meanwhile stood aft by taffrail with lead line in hand anxiously noting shoaling water a smack drifted sternward toward wreck hold on for'ard shouted at last when little seamew have driven so far in upon sand that there be little more than foot of water beneath keel when sank into trough of sea now lay aft here hand let see if can get rope aboard of 'em smack be now fairly among breaker came thundering down upon shoal with indescribable fury boiling foaming tumbling round little vessel in perfect chaos of confusion falling on board in such vast volume have everything not be securely battened down beforehand must inevitably have be swamped in few minute a for crew man of worked with end of line firmly lashed round waist so in extremely likely event of being washed overboard comrade might have mean of hauling on board again wore only danger to adventurer be exposed there be possibility that cable stout a be might part at moment in such case fate must be sealed for nothing must then prevent smack from being dashed to piece on sand yet danger be cheerfully faced by men from pure desire to serve fellow creature without slightest hope of reward for knew at very outset that there must not be much hope of salvage with vessel on sand in such terrible gale wreck be now directly astern of smack only about one hundred foot distant so that must be distinctly seen a fortunately happened that sky have be steadily clearing for last quarter of hour allowing moon to peep out unobscured now then through occasional break in cloud by increasing light smack crew be not only enabled to note exact position of wreck must also see that considerable number of people be clustered upon poop of half submerged hull of being woman child poor soul be watching with most intense anxiety movement of on board smack if anything have be needed to stimulate exertion of crew must have be abundantly found in sight of poor helpless mother little one clinging there to shattered wreck in bitter winter midnight exposed to full fury of pitiless storm light heaving line be quickly cleared away one end bent to rope becket securely spliced to small keg be then thrown overboard allowed to drift down toward wreck line being veered freely away at same time crew of wreck anxiously watching motion of on board smack at once comprehended object of manoeuvre a keg drifted down toward made ready to secure set of tide wash of sea other unexplained circumstance caused to deviate so far from intended course that passed at considerable distance astern of wreck notwithstanding utmost endeavour of on board to secure in consequence of have to be hauled on board smack again thus valuable time be lost smack helm be at once shifted tide aided by wind gave so strong sheer in required direction that be hoped repetition of mischance must be impossible keg be again thrown overboard line once more veered away buoyantly drifted down toward wreck now buried in hissing foam crest of mighty breaker anon riding lightly in liquid valley behind eye be intently fixed upon impatiently watching slow somewhat erratic movement when smack seemed to leap suddenly skyward rearing up like startled courser heeling violently over on beam end at same moment there be terrific thud forward accompanied by violent crashing sound seamew crew have barely time to grasp cleat belaying pin nearest at hand when foaming deluge of water hissed swirled past over breaker of formed part sweeping from under smack down toward wreck in unbroken wall of green water capped with white ominously curling crest roller broke just a reached wreck expending full force upon already shattered hull black mass be seen to heel almost completely over in midst of wildly tossing foam there be dull report almost like of gun piercing shriek rose clearly above howling of gale babel of maddened water when wreck again became visible be seen that have broken in two amidships bow lying bottom upward sixty foot farther in upon sand while stern retained former position have be robbed of nearly half living freight to make matter worse floating keg have once more missed mark repeated failure be disheartening tide be rising rapidly minute be worth human life began to look a though in spite of effort poor soul clinging to wreck must be swept into eternity before seamew crew must effect communication with let have one more try boy exhorted old bill if miss time will have to shift ground trust to own anchor chain to hold until can get off risky work must be a man there told none thought of expressing such sentiment aloud preferring to take risk rather than abandon poor soul to fate line keg be rapidly hauled on board smack once more bill be standing aft by taffrail watching for favourable moment at to make cast when bob exclaimed excitedly 'vast heavin ' father 'taint use tryin ' dodge more be too far to leeward cast off line take turn with round waist be goin ' to try to swim know can do dad be only way a can do good old man stared aghast at lad for moment then glanced at mad swirl of broken water astern then back once more to bob who in meantime be rapidly divesting of clothing god bless ye boy for thought at length ejaculated god bless ye ai possible even if water be warm breaking sea 'd smother ye bitter cold a 't be must swim dozen yard bob lad put on dud again must try sum'at else bob have by time disencumbered of everything save woollen under shirt drawer now instead of doing adopted father bidding rapidly cast off line from keg making bowline in end passed over one shoulder underneath other arm next instant have poised lightly upon taffrail of wildly tossing smack mighty breaker sweeping by with comparatively smooth water behind without moment hesitation thence plunged head foremost into icy sea broken water leaped tossed wildly a if in exultation over spot where brave lad have disappeared while hand on board smack people on wreck waited breathlessly for reappearance on surface endless time seemed to for rapid passage of thin light line out over smack taffrail indicating that bob be swimming swiftly under water old bill maskell must have dreaded dreadful mishap to protege at last small round dark object appeared in bold relief in midst of sheet of foam gleamed dazzling white in clear cold light of moon be bob head there be be exultant exclamation of one of smack crew then sent forth upon wing of gale ringing cheer in upon wreck faintly joined now boy exclaimed old bill clear away here line behind of yer look out nice light handy one to bend on to in case want old man stood on taffrail paying out line attentively watching heave of plunging smack so bob might not be checked in smallest degree in perilous passage on other hand be hampered by having superabundance of line paid out behind for tide to act upon drag hint away to leeward distance from smack to wreck be short mere hundred foot so with heavy surf to contend against line sagging swaying in sea behind taxed bob energy to utmost limit to make progress at indeed appeared to that instead of progressing be like keg drifting helplessly to leeward with tide cold water too chilled to very marrow seemed to completely paralyse energy while relentless surf foamed over head almost without intermission so that have utmost difficulty in getting breath nevertheless fought gallantly on until after what seemed to be eternity of frightful exertion reached side of wreck grasped rope occupant flung to be too completely exhausted however to mount side at moment while clung to rope regaining breath strength mighty roller came sweeping down upon sand burying smack for moment a rushed passed then surging forward with upreared threatening crest toward wreck there be warning cry from on board wreck a saw terrible wall of water rushing down upon seized with desperate grip came nearest to hand clinging thereto with tenacity of despair bob heard cry saw danger have just time to struggle clear of wreck pas under stern when breaker burst upon blinded stunned breathless felt whirled helplessly hither while load like of mountain seemed to rest upon press down at last emerged again considerably to leeward of wreck with rope have thrown still in hand a gasped for breath shook salt water out of eye something swayed against beneath surface something knew instantly must be human body in second have in grasp dragging above water found to be body of child apparently about two year old at same moment powerful strain came upon line held in hand have only time to take by rapid movement two three turn of round arm when on wreck began to haul on board in le time than take to tell of be dragged inboard lay panting exhausted upon steeply inclined deck of wreck with curious crowd of haggard eyed anxious men

speedily recovering use of faculty rapidly explaining intention of on board smack strong hawser be soon stretched from seamew to wreck bobeun chair slung thereto transport of shipwrecked crew passenger at once commenced journey though short be fraught with utmost peril for being impossible to keep hawser strained taut poor unfortunate wretch have to be dragged through rather than over surf when be ready woman who be of course to go first found courage fail in vain be remonstrated with in vain be reminded that second a flew bore mayhap human life into eternity with sight of wild surf into hawser momentarily plunged completely unnerved one declared that rather than face terrible risk must die where be at last bob who knew a well a if not better than anyone on board importance of celerity whispered word two in captain ear latter nodded approvingly bob at once got into chair of ship crew rapidly securely lashing there in obedience to captain order when be ready skipper approaching terrified group of woman took one of child tenderly in arm before unhappy mother must realise what be about to take place handed to bob signal be instantly given to on board smack who hauled swiftly upon hauling line bob went swaying off gunwale with precious charge encircled safely in arm in moment be buried in mountain of broken water rushed foaming past only to reappear instantly afterwards however in very brief space of time charge have safely reached smack little one be handed over to rough tender hearted fisherman bob seeing that must be useful there at once returned to wreck there be now further difficulty with woman mother whose child have already made adventurous passage be frantic to rejoin baby eagerly placed in chair a soon a bob vacated too accomplished journey in safety then others taking courage once more from example quietly took turn carrying child with while others preferred to confide darling to bob to one of seaman for dreadful

with cheerful radiance bewildered glance with regarded scene say showed that even now be scarcely able to realise fact of deliverance be not left very long in doubt about a emerged with slow painful step from smack tiny companion strong arm seized enwrapped in blanket a be quickly tenderly passed over side into small boat have come off from shore for then a boat received complement shove off be word bending oar churned water into miniature whirlpool with dozen powerful stroke boat be sent half length high dry upon shore then strong arm once more raised sufferer quickly bore within wide open portal of hospitable anchor where mother salmon waited to receive eh goodness sake alive exclaimed a first man appeared within flood of light streamed from anchor window sam mean to say a there be woman amongst ah that there be mother panted sam child poor little helpless babbies on too quick warm tear of womanly sympathy instantly flashed into worthy woman eye be not one prone to much indulgence in sentiment particularly at time like present so instead of lifting up hand giving expression to pity in word faced sharply round upon maid who be crowding forward with curiosity of sex to catch first glimpse of stranger exclaimed now then idle huzzies what d 'ye mean by blocking up passage so that body can get in out d 'ye want poor soul to be quite froze to death before let in em'ly

rose in obedience to mother salmon summons following upstairs took over from sam patient shutting door lost not moment in applying such restorative adopting such measure a experience taught must be most likely to prove beneficial rest of survivor speedily followed woman child being promptly conveyed to room already prepared for men for most part proved to be very little worse for exposure seeming to need for restoration good hot supper more than anything else contingency also having by mother salmon experience foresight be provided for rescued rescuer be soon seated together at same table busily engaged in endeavour to restore exhausted energy one man only of entire party seemed unable to do justice to meal spread before be master of wrecked ship seated indeed at table made effort to eat drink thought be evidently elsewhere must not settle comfortably down to meal kept gliding softly out of room to glide a softly back again after absence of few minute when must abstractedly swallow mouthful two then glide out once more at length after somewhat longer absence than before returned to room in meal be being discussed look of care anxiety on face replaced by expression of almost overwhelming joy walking up to bob somewhat astonished that individual by exclaiming young man let without further delay tender brave comrade most hearty thanks for rescue of passenger crew from situation of deadly peril rescue be only effected at very great hazard to yourselves be successfully accomplished mainly be sure comrade will join in saying through indomitable courage perseverance debt owe be one that will be quite impossible for ever to repay can merely acknowledge testify to overwhelming nature of obligation for to gallant behaviour under god owe not only deliverance of twenty five human life from watery grave also safety of wife only child in fact have left to to make life worth living a have said will be quite impossible for ever to cancel so heavy debt what can do will conduct will be so represented in proper quarter a to secure for honour such noble service demand for rest hope will always remember that captain staunton be name will deem service that may require of too great to be promptly rendered what say to especially say also to gallant comrade who will hope accept grateful thanks now tender to poor bob blushed like girl at warm outspoken praise stammered deprecatory remark however be drowned by more vigorous disclaimer of rest of fisherman somewhat noisy applause of shipwrecked captain manly speech in midst of commotion mother salmon entered to enjoin strict silence to announce gratifying intelligence that woman child be doing well including skipper little daughter apparently lifeless body of whom bob have recovered when first boarded wreck low murmur of satisfaction greeted announcement then hand fell to once more upon supper be soon afterwards concluded when old bill mate shaking hand heartily round retired to seek rest have so well earned while shipwrecked men be disposed of a well a circumstance must allow in few remaining unappropriated bed room of hospitable anchor by noon next day shipwrecked party have so far recovered that be able to set out on journey to several home captain staunton sought out old bill arranged with respecting salvage of wrecked ship cargo after handed veteran fisherman a remuneration for service already rendered draft upon owner of diadem more than satisfied smack crew for peril exertion of previous night then left for london to perform unpleasant duty of reporting to owner loss of ship mentioning before left probability of speedy return to personally superintend salvage operation in bidding adieu to bob who happened to be present while final arrangement with old bill be being made captain staunton remarked to have be thinking great deal about lad be fine gallant young fellow seems to must be very great pity for to waste life in pursuit of arduous unprofitable occupation of fishing what say must like to take to sea a profession if so let know owe very heavy debt a have already said nothing must afford greater pleasure than to repay a far a possible by personally undertaking training afterwards using what little interest posse to advance in career think matter over consult with father upon be not then aware of poor bob peculiar position let know decision when return now once more good bye for present weather having moderated by next day seamew crew commenced salvage operation at wreck for more than week hand be so busy early late that bob have literally time to think about much le to consult with old bill respecting captain staunton proposal on third day chief mate of diadem appeared at brightlingsea having be sent down by owner to superintend work at wreck announced that have be sent instead of captain staunton in consequence of appointment of latter by owner to command of fine new ship then loading in london dock for australia appeared that captain staunton stood so high in estimation of employer possessed thoroughly established reputation for skill sobriety that notwithstanding recent misfortune there have be hesitation about employing again few day later letter came from captain to bob confirming intelligence stating that have then vacancy for young friend if chose to fill bob however a have already be remarked be at time too busy to give matter proper consideration so wrote back saying a much hinting that perhaps on return of ship to england might be glad to have repetition of offer to letter reply soon came announcing immediate departure of ship containing specific offer to receive bob on board in capacity of apprentice on next voyage idea of taking to sea a profession be so thoroughly novel to bob that have at first little difficulty in realising that meant hitherto have have other intention ambition than to potter about in fishing smack with old bill living hard life earning precarious subsistence possibly if exceptionally fortunate at period in far distant future attaining to ownership of smack month two later on when have be saved that be possible to save from wreck when nothing remained of once fine ship few shattered timber embedded in sand showing at low water like fragment of skeleton of leviathan when bob found time to fully discus matter with old bill maskell mate worthy painted advantage of regular seaman life over of mere fisherman in such glowing colour dwelt so enthusiastically upon prospect must surely open out before hero under patronage of man like captain staunton that bob soon made up mind to accept captain offer join on return to england having once come to decision lad be impatience for time to arrive when might embark upon career a be with most lad so be with prospect of complete change in mode of life be full of pleasurable excitement perhaps be only natural that now have decided to forsake monotonous humdrum fisher life became almost unbearably irksome to old bill maskell be not slow to observe with unselfishness be so eminently characteristic of though loved lad a own soul decided to shorten for a far a possible weary time of waiting send away at once accordingly on first opportunity presented remarked to bob say boy have be turnin matter over in mind bit seems to a v'yage two in coaster 'd do power o good afore ship aboard south spainer be a handy lad a man need wish to be shipmate with aboard fore aft rigged craft ought to know some'at about square rigged vessel too afore sail foreign now what d 'ye say to trip two in collier brig just to larn rope like eh note south spainer term frequently employed by seaman to designate foreign going ship especially one sailing to southern water hc life on board collier be not a rule condition of unalloyed felicity bob be happily unhappily ignorant of suggestion conveyed to mind only idea of change face lighted joyfully up at benefactor proposition to at once eagerly assented bob slender wardrobe be accordingly at once overhauled put into condition of thorough repair bill meantime employing laboriously in effort to ascertain through medium of voluminous correspondence whereabouts of old friend of last heard of by said bill a in command of collier brig with view to securing for bob berth a ordinary seaman under skipper of whom bill knew something who must be trusted to treat lad well old bill labour be at length rewarded with success captain a loved to be styled turnbull address in london being definitely ascertained together with gratifying intelligence that still retained command of betsy jane matter having progressed thus far satisfactorily old bill next business be to write to captain turnbull asking if must receive bob on board in about month time favourable answer be received naming day upon bob be to run up to london sign article bob departure from brightlingsea be regarded by numerous friend in village quite in light of event when morning came with market cart be to convey belonging together with old bill to colchester where be to take train to london nearly fisherman in place to say nothing of wife little one turned out to say farewell journey be accomplished in safety without adventure shortly after noon bill bob found threading way through narrow crowded street to captain address somewhere in neighbourhood of wapping on reaching house gallant skipper be found to be at home in act of partaking together with wife family of mid day meal on occasion happened to be composed of pickled pork taturs old bill bob be gruffly cordially invited to join family circle did bob making thoroughly hearty meal quite unmoved by coquettish endeavour of miss turnbull stout good tempered not particularly beautiful damsel of seventeen summer to attract attention excite admiration of pa handsome new sailor captain turnbull proved to be very stout not very tall man with somewhat vacant expression of feature singular habit of looking fixedly in apparent amazement for full minute at anyone who happened to address with slow ponderous movement of body fixed belief in own infallibility equally firm belief in unsurpassed perfection of betsy jane be chief characteristic a be destined to figure for very brief period only in page of present history need not analyse further after dinner have be duly discussed together with glass of grog so far at least a captain wife old bill be concerned two friend be invited by proud commander to pay visit of inspection to betsy jane venerable craft proved to be lying in stream outside vessel of number of similar craft moored in tier head stern to great slimy buoy laid down a permanent mooring in river wherry be engaged by skipper for old bill paid when time of settlement arrived captain being apparently unconscious of fact that payment be necessary three proceeded on board brig turned out to be about a bad specimen of class a must well be met with old rotten leaky dirty beyond power of description nevertheless skipper waxed so astonishingly eloquent when began to speak praise that idea never seemed to occur to bill bob that to venture to sea in must be simply tempting providence be consequently soon arranged that hero be to sign article nominally a ordinary seaman in consideration of ignorance of square rigged craft to receive only pay of boy point being settled party returned to shore old bill bob going for saunter through of principal street to enjoy cheap rare luxury to simple country people like of look into shop window with understanding that be to accept hospitality of turnbull mansion until time for sailing must arrive on morrow bob wished very much to visit one of theatre evening theatre being place of entertainment up to time have never have opportunity of entering old bill anxious to cultivate on bob behalf goodwill of betsy jane commander thought must be wiser to spend evening with worthy arrangement be accordingly carried out best

with tide toward evening fine fair wind sprang up betsy jane being only in ballast then began to travel at rate threw commander into indescribable state of ecstasy voyage be accomplished without occurrence of incident worth recording in something like week from date of sailing from london bob found at shield with brig under coal drop loading again for thames dozen similarly uneventful voyage to tyne back to london be made by bob in betsy jane life of seaman on board collier be usually of very monotonous character without single attractive feature in unless maybe that admits of frequent short sojourn at home bob period of service under captain turnbull might have be dismissed with mere mention of circumstance for incident terminated that service occurred on sixth voyage bob have made in betsy jane brig have sailed from tyne loaded with coal for london a usual with westerly wind however shortly afterwards backed to ssw with rapidly falling barometer appearance of weather grew very threatening coupled with fact that craft be old weak notoriously poor sailer with wind anywhere on quarter seemed to suggest a most prudent course under circumstance return to port have just left mate after many uneasy glance to windward turned to superior officer who be sitting by companion placidly smoking proposed skipper slowly withdrew pipe from mouth after regarding mate for moment a though individual be perfect stranger who have suddenly unaccountably made appearance on board ejaculated why well be afeard be goin ' to have very dirty night on be reply umph be captain only commentary after resumed pipe seemed inclined to doze meanwhile wind have hitherto be of strength of fair working breeze rapidly increased in force with occasional sharp squall preceded by heavy shower of rain while threatening aspect of weather grew moment more unmistakable brig be under topgallant sail tearing thrashing through short choppy sea in way sent spray flying continuously in dense cloud in over bluff bow until deck be mid leg deep in water stumpy topgallant mast where whipping about aloft to extent that threatened momentarily to snap off short at cap be not considered etiquette on board

rested on cap with terrific thrashing fluttering of canvas brig rose to more upright position saving spar by mere hair breadth captain turnbull rose slowly to foot advancing to where mate stood near main rigging tapped that individual softly on shoulder with pipe stem mate turned round captain turnbull looked fixedly at for moment a though thought recognised be not quite sure then observed say be cap'n of ship sir replied mate very well then retorted skipper do agen then to crew of whom be by time on deck bowse down yer reef tackle double reef taups'ls then stow main l think 'd better run back to tyne afore drop too far to leeward to fetch inquired mate captain looked at in characteristic fashion for full minute inquired be cap'n of ship then without waiting for reply replaced pipe between lip staggered back to seat contemplatively resumed smoking fact be that captain turnbull be actually pondering upon advisability of putting back when mate unluckily suggested adoption of such course dull inert a be skipper of betsy jane be by mean unskilled seaman fact that have safely navigated crazy old craft to fro between thames tyne in fair weather foul for so many year be sufficient evidence of have duly marked portentous aspect of weather be debating within question whether must put back whether must keep on take chance of weathering gale a have already weathered many others unfortunately mind be like rather heavy slow in action have not nearly completed process of making up when mate offered suggestion settled question at once captain be a obstinate unmanageable man a ever breathed be only necessary for one to suggest course must at once adopt line of action in direct opposition to hence resolve to remain at sea in present instance having finally committed to course however braced together for coming conflict with element when watch below be called at eight bell hand be put to task of placing ship under thoroughly snug canvas before relieved watch be permitted to go below brig be normally in so leaky condition that regularly required pumping out two hour when under canvas task in ordinary weather usually occupied ten minute if weather be stormy

drained in here there during last two hour task at length accomplished men in skipper watch of whom bob be one lost time in tumbling into berth standing where soon forgot wet miserable condition in profound sleep captain turnbull contrary to usual custom at conclusion of watch retired from deck only to change wet garment envelop in suit of very old very leaky oilskin when resumed once more favourite seat by companion stolidly resolved to watch gale out let last a long a might note standing in case mean without removing of clothing gale in good truth have by time become wind howling furiously through brig rigging threatening momentarily to blow old worn patched canvas out of bolt rope dull leaden coloured ragged cloud raced tumultuously athwart moonlit sky now veiling scene in deep gloomy shadow a swept across moon disc anon opening out for instant to flood brig sea in glory of silver ray cap of wave torn off by wind filled air with dense salt rain now then gleamed up

stationed at bowsprit end being just beyond reach of spray from bow be possibly a dry place a there be throughout ship excepting perhaps cabin sitting astride spar wedging back firmly in between two part of double fore stay found so comfortably situated that in le than five minute be sound asleep captain turnbull meanwhile occupied favourite seat near companion smoked contemplatively while mate staggered fore aft from main mast to taffrail on weather side of deck being watch suddenly mate stopped short in walk skipper ejaculated umph attention of have at same moment be arrested by something peculiar in motion of brig sound pump observed skipper apparently addressing moon at moment gleamed brightly forth from behind heavy cloud mate took sounding rod first of drying line carefully dropped down pump well hauling up again took aft to binnacle somewhat feeble light from showed that entire rod portion of line be wet more 'n three foot water in th ' hold exclaimed mate call hand remarked captain turnbull directing voice down companion a though be speaking to one in cabin crew soon mustered at pump manned relieving other ten minute after three quarter of hour of vigorous pumping there be a little sign of pump sucking a at commencement be then again sounded with result that crew appeared to have gained something like three inch upon leak men accordingly resumed pumping in half hearted sort of way however seemed to say that have very great hope of freeing ship hour passed pump be again sounded three foot ten leak gain on proclaimed mate in low voice a skipper bent together over rod at binnacle lamp shortly afterwards wheel be relieved man who have be steering taking at pump place of one who have relieved hurried consultation immediately took place amongst men presently one of walked aft to where skipper be seated remarked chap be sayin ' skipper a how think best thing can do be to up stick run for nearest port skipper looked inquiringly at man for so long time that fellow grew quite disconcerted after shook head hopelessly a though have be addressed in strange utterly unintelligible language withdrawing pipe from mouth pointed solemnly in direction of pump man took hint retired mate who have witnessed curious interview then passed over to lee side of deck steadying by companion bent down said in low voice to superior after cap'n tom about right old barkie will go down under foot unless can get in somewhere pretty soon captain turnbull with hand resting on knee extinguished pipe placed bowl downwards between teeth regarded mate with blank astonishment may imagine in one who belief at last actually see genuine ghost finally gasped in sepulchral tone be cap'n of ship mate knew that after there be nothing more to be said so walked forward to pump by voice example strove to animate men to more earnest effort hour passed pump be again sounded now became evident that leak be rapidly gaining general opinion of men be that labouring of brig in short sea have strained so seriously a to open more le seam that butt have started pumped away for hour then feeling pretty well fagged out finding on trial that leak gained upon with increased rapidity left pump began to clear away boat mate made strong effort to persuade to return to duty being by time convinced of impossibility of saving ship be unsuccessful seeing too retired below hastily bundling together own trap of skipper brought on deck placed in stern sheet of longboat men have by time brought bag chest on deck finding that brig have meanwhile settled so deep in water that deck

proceeded to knock brig bulwark away on lee side with intention of launching off deck task at last accomplished aided materially therein by sea by time be washing heavily across deck crew then passed into one by one bob among rest made final preparation for leaving devoted brig seeing that be ready mate then went up to skipper who still maintained position on favourite seat said come skipper be only waitin ' for by appearance must wait very long neither captain turnbull raised head like one awakened from deep sleep glanced vacantly round deserted deck pulled strongly two three time at long

looking at dark side of everything add to fact that entertained very exalted idea of own imaginary excellence believed to be almost if not quite infallible will be seen that be not likely to prove

show cabin that official hastened to do mr fortescue be among last to leave boat have brought passenger alongside be closely followed on board by mr brook on reaching deck paused to glance round aloft at towering symmetrical mast spar with mazy network of rigging jolly craft be brook remarked rex fortescue genially plenty of room clean a new pin although be only just out of dock think will be

bell have rung out welcome peal peace reigned undisturbed in handsome saloon of galatea meanwhile passenger having embarked ship at once proceeded down river in tow when occupant of saloon rose from dinner table went on deck to enjoy beauty of evening found off sheerness in midst of fleet of ship steamer of build nationality outward bound like others entering river under steam in tow under canvas a case might be here came magnificent steamship towering high out of water at close of voyage from india with sallow complexioned passenger scattered about deck fore aft muffled up in thick overcoat pacing briskly to fro to stimulate circulation of thin blood in vein looking picture of chilly misery though evening be almost oppressively warm there on other side moved sluggishly along under old

loaded down to gunwale with long gaily painted spreet tanned canvas gleamed rich ruddy brown in ray of setting sun here again came swift excursion steamer deck crowded with jovial pleasure seeker good

unwonted animation of scene rushed madly fore aft deck rearing up on hind leg incessantly to look over bulwark bark at sundry then came large full rigged ship in tow hull painted dead black down to gleaming copper upper edge of showed just above water line with high flaring bow short counter lofty tapering spar needed not star stripe fluttering far aloft to proclaim american behind again came great five masted ironclad gliding with slow stately motion up river on way to chatham oh what monster of ship exclaimed little blanche lascelles a ironclad approached near enough to galatea to enable on board to realise vast proportion yes said brook who be standing close by evidently anxious for opportunity to ingratiate with lady yes be black prince know well fine ship ai think be mistaken sir a to name of ironclad remarked captain staunton who be on poop within ear shot black prince have only three mast have raking stem not ram oh be not mistaken said individual addressed wait 'til see name will find be right minute so great ship swept close past white ensign drooping from peak pennant streaming out from main royal mast head like fiery gleam in sunset glow look out men on forecastle officer on bridge dwarfed to pigmy by comparison with huge structure bore a soon a be fairly past word agincourt flashed from stern in golden letter so large that must be easily read without aid of telescope captain staunton glanced with amused twinkle in eye at over confident passenger a much a to say what do think of brook looked just trifle confused for moment then brow cleared replied to captain look by remarking in usual easy confident tone oh ah yes be right be be altered have name changed remember reading about somewhere good heaven exclaimed skipper sotto voce to chief mate who be standing next why before voyage be over man will be telling that galatea be own longboat lengthened raised upon at hand be mustered when chief second officer proceeded to pick watch bob to great satisfaction found included in chief officer watch with ralph neville for companion be told off with two able two ordinary seaman for duty on mizzen mast two lad being also required to keep time

tug hauled inboard voyage be to prove of so eventful character to entering upon may be said to have fairly commenced ship be soon under stitch of sail must draw gliding down through down at rate of about seven knot passenger most of whom have remained on deck to witness operation of making sail then retired to several berth where night being fine water smooth be reasonable to suppose enjoyed good night rest chapter four outward voyage by eight o'clock next morning at hour passenger sat down to breakfast galatea be off dungeness rounded with somewhat freshening breeze noon saw fairly abreast of beachy head weather be magnificent breeze whilst fresh enough to waft good ship through water at rate of honest ten knot in hour be not sufficiently strong to raise much sea only result therefore be slight leisurely roll passenger found agreeable rather than reverse everybody be consequently in most exuberant spirit congratulating other on so auspicious commencement to voyage a for bob be in seventh heaven of delight noble proportion of beautiful craft bore so gallantly over summer sea spotless cleanliness perfect order method with various duty be performed consideration with be treated by superior constituted for novel experience in strong contrast to wet dirt often severe toil rough ready habit of collier seaman on board betsy jane from moment that bob have assumed duty on board galatea captain staunton have taken pain to make matter pleasant for have spoken freely of heavy obligation under considered that bob have laid have extolled in most laudatory term lad behaviour during terrible winter night upon gunfleet bob therefore found possessor of reputation commanded universal admiration respect in little community of be member with result that be quite unconsciously accorded distinction under other circumstance must have be vain for to hope thus when hero found a frequently did guest at saloon dinner table captain staunton following example of commander in navy by occasionally inviting officer to dine with passenger almost unanimously received into midst with friendly warmth accorded to none of other subordinate on board agreeing to regard in a pleasant eccentricity frequent lapse in grammar pronunciation must have resented in others a evidence of decided inferiority to be kept at distance by coldest most studied disdain captain staunton took early opportunity to speak to bob respecting unfortunate lack of education culture be alone together in chart room at moment whither skipper have called bob in order that conversation might be strictly private robert said always addressed bob a robert when what have to say be unconnected with duty robert boy wish to say word two to respecting education fear have be somewhat neglected a indeed might reasonably be expected seeing how few educational advantage usually fall in way of fisher lad now must be remedied a speedily a possible be anxious that must become not only first rate seaman thorough

point out to what be worthy of imitation what must be avoided in manner of around think be sharp intelligent enough to quickly profit by observation keep eye ear open mouth a much a possible shut just for present have doubt will soon make headway in addition to two hour tuition mr eastlake have promised intend to give two more mr eastlake tuition will be in various branch of useful knowledge mine will be in navigation study will be conducted here in chart room have very little doubt that if be only half a willing to learn a be to teach will have made considerable amount of progress by time that arrive at sydney indeed a far a navigation be concerned be by mean intricate science there be reason why must not be skilled navigator by time that reach australia bob have good sense to fully appreciate immense value of advantage thus proffered to be intelligent enough to at once recognise vast intellectual distance intervened between poor ignorant fisher lad highly educated men woman who be to be found among saloon passenger a well a wide difference between own awkward embarrassed manner quiet easy graceful demeanour distinguished of individual to be seen daily on poop of galatea

calculated to widen bob sphere of knowledge cultivate intellect be captain staunton le successful in portion of bob study have undertaken to direct fortunately for hero skipper be not one of men whose acquaintance with navigation consists solely in blind knowledge certain calculation if correctly performed will afford certain information captain staunton have studied nautical astronomy intelligently thoroughly knew raison d'etre of calculation in various astronomical problem connected with science of navigation be therefore in position to explain clearly intelligently to pupil step be necessary a well in simple a in more abstruse difficult calculation thus admirably circumstanced in matter of instructor aided by own anxiety to improve bob made such steady rapid progress by time ship rounded cape must work lunar solve quadratic equation problem in first two book of euclid write intelligently expressed correctly spelt grammatical letter in addition to possessing large store of knowledge on everyday subject be majority of passenger moved by captain staunton frequent reference to bob exploit on gunfleet have taken quite fancy to lad conversed so frequently so freely with that

serious than amusement to recipient gradually very gradually violet dudley have manifested partiality for quiet unobtrusive courtesy attention of rex fortescue partiality at length became so clearly marked that one after other rest of admirer retired discomfited sought solace for disappointment in exciting sport of rifle shooting at empty bottle dropped overboard allowed to drift astern in such other amusement a taste led to favour blanche however still kept division of admirer in state of feverish suspense manifesting partiality whatever for one of above indeed seemed to take greater

to be greatly envied whilst be state of thing aft matter be not that must be in forecastle crew be good enough set of men doubtless must have be right under proper management thanks to surly aggravating behaviour of mr carter starboard watch over ruled be in state of almost open mutiny yet so acute be aggressor for long time gave men excuse for legitimate complaint utmost must be said against being that be in opinion of men unduly particular a to set trim of sail superlative cleanliness of everything about deck be very well during daytime when in night watch men be hustled incessantly about deck taking pull here there everywhere at halliard sheet brace of already fully distended accurately trimmed sail only to be ordered few minute later to ease up lee brace inch take pull upon weather one alternately stowing setting flying kite light upper canvas must not help seeing that thing be done le from zeal anxiety to make quick passage than for purpose of indulging

anything out of common when captain staunton of passenger be on deck a of generally be until midnight began again within quarter of hour of coming on deck at be royal be set when took charge of deck have separately clewed up furled a well a one two of smaller stay sail allowed men just time enough to settle down comfortably then ordered recently stowed sail to be loosed set again be done short interval passed then have royal stowed once more finally ordered to be loosed set again not man took slightest notice of order do hear there jump aloft of loose royal shouted carter thinking for moment that have failed to make heard still there be response davis away aloft loose fore royal boyd jump up loose main nichols up go loose mizzen look lively now will rope end last man down from aloft exclaimed second mate passion rapidly rising a found thus tacitly opposed a last word left lip watch came aft in body pausing just forward of main mast look here mr carter said fine active

allowed temper to get mastery of oh be what say be fine fellow very good will soon see whether when give order be to be obeyed not hissed through clenched teeth saying stepped hastily to door of cabin

sent bullet through left arm of one of assailant men be still struggling with second mate when figure sprang up through companion closely followed by second captain staunton voice be heard exclaiming good heaven mr carter what be meaning of back men back for life how dare raise hand against one of officer men have by time wrenched pistol out of carter hand at once fell back left a captain staunton mr bowles advanced to rescue new comer placed promptly one on side of second mate then two party stood staring somewhat blankly at other for something like minute well mr carter at last exclaimed captain staunton have nothing to say by way of explanation of extraordinary scene what doe mean mutiny sir nothing le gasped carter whose passion almost deprived of speech thank sir too mr bowles for coming to rescue for must have be dead man by time oh must mr carter exclaimed one of men ai murderer must have ' touched if have touched first will do exclaimed captain staunton if of have anything to say will have opportunity of saying in due time at present wish to hear what mr carter have to say turning inquiringly once more toward individual thus pressed carter related version of story be to effect that men have refused to obey order have come aft in so menacing manner that in self defence have be compelled to arm further that hoping to check mutiny in bud have shot down ringleader so be explanation of shot awoke exclaimed captain staunton where be wounded man in bunk sir bleeding like stuck pig replied one of men resorting to simile to aid description a be wont of seafaring men generally phew whistled skipper be serious run bowles rouse out doctor at once if please mr bowles sped to doctor cabin found that individual already roused out with open case of surgical instrument on table drawer open from be hastily selecting lint bandage etcetera medico having be awakened by first pistol shot like sensible man bestirring at once in preparation for repair of damage without waiting to learn first whether there be damage to repair not well bowles exclaimed a worthy chief made appearance want eh what be nature of case man shot briefly replied mr bowles just so heard shot where be seat of injury know well never mind will soon find out let see tourniquet probe splint lint bandage um um yes just carry for bowles there be good fellow lead way so saying worthy man put quantity of splint etcetera into mr bowles hand gathering up rest of chattel followed mate to forecastle where at once busied in ascertaining extent of finally dressing poor boyd injury in meantime captain staunton assisted by mr bowles who have speedily rejoined have be holding sort of court of inquiry into case after much skilful interrogation giving of most patient hearing to statement of member of watch have succeeded in arriving at very near approach to actual truth of matter said be clearly case wherein party have be gravely in fault be compelled in justice to admit that turning to member of watch appear to have received great provocation inasmuch a there can be doubt that have be greatly harassed by mr carter habit of unnecessarily interfering with disposition of canvas set on ship have indeed noticed attention often having be arrested by sound of making shortening sail during night watch when doubtless thought fast asleep in berth have have on mind for time past to speak to mr carter on subject must have done so long ago for great repugnance to interfere with officer except upon most urgent ground confess have idea that provocation have be going on for so long time master of ship like other mortal requires sleep doubtless many thing be said done whilst be taking rest of can know nothing unless be brought to notice by others be therefore manifestly duty in justice to a well a in obedience to law to make complaint to of grievance of may have considered yourselves victim instead of doing so took upon yourselves to resent grievance by refusing obedience to order of officer constitutes offence offence in opinion have be sufficiently punished by wound inflicted upon two of number have satisfied that lapse of duty be in reality matter strictly between yourselves second officer in wise defiance of authority suppose need scarcely say must not take lenient view of conduct a for mr carter skipper resumed after pause have placed in very unpleasant position of being compelled to suspend from duty until arrival of ship at sydney have proved incompetent to command watch with tact moderation be so essential to safety of ship comfort of on board led away by heat of temper have hastily unnecessarily resorted to measure of extreme violence might have men be of similar temper have led to dreadful disaster may retire to cabin sir mr bowles do favour to call mr dashwood young dashwood be found sitting on chest dressed ready for emergency entire occupant of ship being by time on qui vive be therefore in presence of skipper within minute of mention of name to captain staunton at once delegated command of starboard watch saying at same time few word expressive of confidence in prudence seamanship one word more men said skipper again addressing watch have suspended mr carter not because regard a in right a in way justified in behaviour because be manifestly wrong must therefore very earnestly caution one against again refusing obedience to command issued by officer if command be such a to constitute substantial grievance if must by chance be such a to manifestly imperil safety of ship life of of on board be always to be found matter must at once be referred to will always be ready to protect from tyranny intemperate treatment remember from time forward there must be nothing even remotely resembling insubordination now go back to duty men walked quietly away forward captain staunton accompanied by mr bowles retired below to make immediate entry of occurrence in official log book occupant of saloon be naturally greatly exercised by event formed staple of conversation next day be interesting to observe way in subject be regarded by various member of little community obeilly editor of galatea free press be wild with excitement at contemplation of narrow escape have have from mutiny attendant fight exhibited curious study of mingled irritation satisfaction of irritation that fight have not come off of satisfaction that have not be compelled to take up arm against of forecastle hand one of whom regarded in free hearted way a personal friend with one of whom be prime favourite lady who really understood nothing of merit of case with unerring instinct invariably lead to right conclusion sided unanimously with seaman while few of more timid among male passenger regarded carter a sort of hero martyr mr dale being especially loud indiscreet in denunciation of recklessness manifested in encouraging mutinous rascal in defiance of authority will end dismally prophesied in being murdered in bed night oh dear wish have never come to sea brook one two more though said little went about ship for few day afterwards in evident perturbation of mind though to do justice have be obliged must have doubtless fought fought well rex fortescue perhaps took matter most coolly of not only went forward a usual to hear yarn spinning smoke cigar on forecastle during dog watch also took violet with having noticed long before that presence of lady be always sufficient to ensure strictest decorum on part of men thus showing crew a clearly a must that at least have doubt of loyalty carter suspension from duty removed only discordant element have ever revealed on board a far a crew of ship be concerned thenceforward matter went smoothly enough on board galatea for remainder of passage proved to be rapid one notwithstanding delay experienced in rounding cape be also uneventful one foregoing occurrence excepted nothing further need therefore be said respecting than that in good time ship safely arrived in sydney noble harbour landing passenger began forthwith humdrum operation of discharging cargo chapter five homeward bound at date of story discharging of cargo be much more leisurely operation than be at present day bob therefore have several opportunity of taking run ashore looking round town suburb of sydney passenger such of be a be resident in near sydney have one given bob most pressing invitation to visit whenever must obtain leave on day one following arrival of ship very prettily worded pressing little note have come to from blanche lascelles to say that friend with whom violet be staying at cookstown must be delighted to make acquaintance so that bob be never at loss for place whither to direct step whenever must get ashore consequently managed to see good deal of place thoroughly enjoyed seven week during galatea lay in sydney harbour outward cargo discharged homeward freight of wool began to come down stevedore be kept busy day long screwing into a small compass a possible in hold meanwhile captain staunton be in great tribulation gold fever be then at height in precious metal have be discovered year before about month previous to arrival of galatea in sydney news have come down country of discovery of new auriferous region richness extent of be said to be something past belief result of rumour be that idle loafer who arrived in australian port made first business to desert from ship start hot foot for gold field if matter have ended here shipmasters must have have cause to congratulate rather than reverse unfortunately for be not so gold fever have stricken everybody merchant even mechanic clerk in fact few cool hand who realised that by remaining in half deserted town be sure of making that fortune winning of at digging be problematical one consequence of be that when seaman deserted ship one must be found to take place captain staunton must stand on own poop count at least fifty vessel whose cargo be on board hatch battened down everything ready for sea there lay unable to sail for want of crew to man now galatea be not in quite so bad plight a for when last bale of wool have be screwed in hatch put on there still remained in forecastle eight good men true six belonging to port watch two to starboard who have resisted alluring dream of fortune to be made in day at digging other eight have deserted in body one sunday very cleverly eluding police whose chief duty then be to prevent such occurrence second mate cook be also missing hence captain staunton anxiety on one hand be averse to extreme step of taking ship to sea half manned on other be haunted by constant dread of losing still more of men if remained in port until have made up complement at length however to infinite relief chanced upon dozen men who in consideration of payment of fabulous wage undertook to ship for homeward passage be a lawless ruffianly looking set of fellow a one need ever care to encounter a mr bowles observed must at least pull haul once at sea away from demoralising influence of grog shop who knew might settle down into steady serviceable hand at event must not want for good example on part of shipmate remnant of original crew for be without exception thoroughly steady reliable men although one of be boyd man who have be shot by mr carter for refusal to obey order men secured captain staunton resolved to avoid further risk by sailing at once be true that ship must be still rather short handed be more to be regretted inasmuch a be in light trim trifle crank reflected that might lie in port for next six month without securing man therefore seemed to best under circumstance to make shift with what have get away to sea forthwith hasty summons be accordingly despatched to few passenger who have taken berth coming on board next day anchor be hove up evening saw galatea standing off land heading to eastward with sail set dragging at like cart horse passenger be time only six in number namely blanche violet messrs dale fortescue brook who have lost contract went out in hope of securing entirely through obstinacy of head of firm mr evelin formerly captain in royal engineer who have thrown up commission to go gold digging who thanks to technical training supplemented by arduous special study of geology have be successful to extraordinary degree be now returning home master of handsome fortune launcelot lance evelin be tall handsome man of about thirty five with physique of hercules result of six month toil exposure at digging deeply bronzed clear cut feature concealed by heavy moustache beard of golden chestnut hue clear grey eye wavy hair shade darker than beard proved immense acquisition to lady who must otherwise have be almost entirely dependent on rex fortescue for amusement mr dale being altogether too savage at recent failure to make agreeable associate indeed never be even at best of time while brook willing though be to do best be too pugnacious ill bred illiterate to be more than just barely tolerated rex fortescue violet be perfectly clear be daily sinking deeper into condition wherein people be conscious of existence of two individual only two self in whole world so poor little blanche must soon have found quite out in cold have not mr evelin taken compassion upon devoted to amusement knew london well on comparing note soon transpired that knew several people with whom blanche be also acquainted so got on capitally together especially a lance possessed in eminent degree art of making conversation interesting later on too when have thawed little must relate story after story of adventure at gold field of convulsed companion with laughter while others made shudder nestle unconsciously little closer to narrator notwithstanding blanche still found time to chat occasionally with lad be very fond of steering indeed have won reputation of being finest helmsman in ship be always ready to take trick at wheel during of dog watch so give rightful helmsman chance to stay for'ard amuse with shipmate when be case blanche generally used to seat in deck chair near chatter away upon topic came uppermost have be thus amusing one evening when a eight bell struck bob walked forward on being relieved from wheel lance evelin who have be smoking cigar on break of poop watching from distance carryings on of men upon forecastle sauntered to side opened conversation with remark how singularly exact repetition of same feature will observe in family doubtless have often noticed miss lascelles now there be that fine young fellow legerton anyone must recognise a connection of yours have often be on point of asking in what manner be related to other be unpardonably inquisitive by mean mr evelin be question easily answered be not aware that be related in most remote degree be not exclaimed in tone of greatest surprise be sure most earnestly beg pardon how very stupid of to make such mistake resemblance between two be so very striking that although one have ever said word to lead to such conclusion have never doubted from moment came on board that must be closely related be sure be quite at loss for word wherewith to express apology apology be necessary assure mr evelin returned blanche on contrary feel rather flattered by supposition for greatly admire robert many sterling quality what bold brave fellow be too notwithstanding quiet unassuming manner if feel curiosity a to history captain staunton will be only too happy to furnish with full particular can enlighten far better than can story be worth listening to manner of first acquaintance especially be romance in lance curiosity be aroused instead of referring to skipper preferred to hear story from blanche own pretty lip sinking down into deck chair beside listened with interest to that fair girl must tell respecting bob poor fellow remarked when blanche have finished story have never be able to find clue to parentage be very singular there surely must be relative of still in existence somewhere did fisherman who saved life never make inquiry no appears not answered blanche according to robert own account though always speaks with greatest respect affection of old man who adopted people among whom be thrown be very simple ignorant of everything outside pale of own calling must seem that really did not know how to set about instituting inquiry well what have told have interested so much lad have made favourable impression upon that believe will really feel more than half inclined to undertake somewhat quixotic task of seeking relative when reach england who know that might be good fortune to gladden heart of father mother whose life have be embittered for year by loss of perhaps only son half laughingly remarked lance ah jest upon such subject exclaimed blanche evidently have not least idea what complete blight loss may cast upon parent life have there be poor uncle sir richard who have never held up head since lost wife child at sea mother have told that before terrible bereavement there be not more genial light hearted happy man living than uncle dick have never be known to smile since dreadful news first reached though have always struggled bravely against great sorrow feel sure look forward eagerly to time when will be called away to rejoin wife baby boy how very sad remarked lance in sympathetic tone be slightly acquainted with sir richard lascelles be to say have met once twice have often wondered what great trouble must be seemed to be pressing so heavily upon if must not distress too much must like to hear how met with terrible loss have objection to tell answered blanche occurred very shortly after be born uncle be then younger son with very little expectation of ever succeeding to baronetcy for there be two brother older than have captain commission in army have married lady of whom because happened to have money father strongly disapproved serious quarrel between father son be consequence shortly after marriage uncle regiment be ordered off to north america uncle dick naturally took wife with regiment be moved about from place to place finally when uncle have be married about three year be broken up into detachment commanded being sent in consequence of trouble with indian to important military outpost at considerable distance up ottawa river of course be quite impossible for aunt to accompany husband into wild especially a be then mother of son eighteen month old question arose be what be to do be at first proposed that must establish in montreal until return of expedition letter reaching just at time stating that mother health be failing be hastily decided that aunt must return to england taking of course little son with everything have to be done in great hurry uncle have barely time to pack wife box see safely en route for montreal before set out with detachment for post to have be ordered aunt arrived safely at montreal failing to find there ship ready to sail for england went on to quebec reached just in time to embark for london have written to uncle from montreal wrote again from quebec letter reaching husband hand a be on point of marching out of fort on night expedition against band of hostile indian who have be discovered in neighbourhood engagement took place in uncle be desperately wounded narrowly escaped falling into hand of indian men succeeded however in saving making good own retreat into fort where poor uncle dick lay hovering for week between life death after long weary struggle splendid constitution triumphed with return of consciousness came anxious thought respecting wife child remembered letter have be handed to a marched out upon ill starred expedition letter have never have opportunity to read made eager inquiry respecting be found in inner breast pocket of uniform coat have be so thoroughly saturated with own blood poor fellow that be practically undecipherable by careful soaking washing at last succeeded in ascertaining that aunt baby have actually sailed from quebec on what date in what ship be quite impossible to learn be last news ever heard of how very dreadful murmured lance of course made possible inquiry respecting fate not immediately answered blanche waited patiently for news of aunt arrival in england a mail after mail came without bringing intelligence grew uneasy finally wrote to mother in law asking explanation of unaccountable silence letter remained unanswered just when uneasiness have increased to pitch that have determined to apply for leave of absence in order to proceed to england be returned to through dead letter office decided at once applied for leave be refused then threw up commission at once proceeded to england fearful conviction growing upon that something dreadful have happened stopped at quebec for fortnight on way home making inquiry at ship owner broker office in place endeavouring to learn name of ship in wife have be passenger strange to say must gain trace of whether be that people of whom inquired be careless indifferent whether be that passenger list be not at time regularly kept a now be be of course impossible to say be fact that be compelled to leave america without smallest scrap of information respecting dear one beyond contained in blood stained letter on arrival in england proceeded direct to mother in law former residence to find a feared in possession of stranger then with considerable difficulty hunted up lawyer who have managed mr percival mother in law money matter learned from that old lady have died seven month before in reply to further inquiry be informed that wife child have never reached mr percival home old lady have certainly expected lawyer said have never received more than one letter uncle have hurriedly written mentioning fact of departure for england poor uncle dick now found completely at loss so a best plan must think of put affair into lawyer hand handing also blood stained letter letter be soon afterwards intrusted to chemist who in attempting to cleanse destroyed altogether thus passed away only clue uncle possessed be now rather more than sixteen year since aunt sailed from quebec poor uncle dick have never succeeded in gaining trace of fate to day poor fellow ejaculated lance in absent sort of way be sure sincerely pity sympathise with what going below already then allow to conduct a far a companion blanche bade lance good night at head of saloon staircase raised smoking cap then returning sauntered up down poop for over hour with hand behind eye fixed on deck apparently in brown study few day after narration of blanche story lance evelin noticing bob at wheel strolled up to asked for history miss lascelles gave outline of night two ago struck a so peculiar interesting must like to hear full particular explained puffing lazily at cigar meanwhile where must like to begin mr evelin asked bob at beginning of course dear fellow laughingly answered lance want to know everything do remember being found on board wreck sometimes think do at other time think must be only recollection of dream have produced more than usually strong impression upon answered bob now then perhaps not more than dozen time altogether when have be lying half asleep half awake confused indistinct idea present of ship cabin seen through half opened state room door with lamp swinging violently to fro of woman face beautiful a oh can not describe something like miss dudley only still more beautiful if can imagine thing then dream whatever be get still more confused seem to be in cold wet darkness fancy hear sound like men shouting mingled with roar of wind rush of sea then then seem to have be kissed yes beautiful face seems to be bending over again be in light warmth once more then pass away if try to carry thought back to first circumstance can distinctly remember see again with other boy paddling about barefoot on shore at brightlingsea ah ejaculated lance contemplatively have doubt that if truth must be arrived at of course never can be in world dream like to call be faint recollection still remains impressed on memory of of incident connected with wreck of ship what be name by by lightning of london um be not very difficult name to remember at event beautiful face of spoke be impression of clear enough to enable to describe supposing possible for to see picture of original do think must recognise do mind asking question be right if be in least painful to will not put see legerton have very little doubt that face be face of mother confess feel trifle curious to know how far back man can carry remembrance of mother can not remember anything about mine previous to fourth birthday well answered bob can scarcely remember face clearly enough to describe can say about be that be very beautiful with tender loving eye dark hair be almost sure must have be worn in curl think that if ever saw really good picture of must recognise directly must eh said lance very well now go ahead if be not tired of talking tell about old fellow who found sort of life led a fisherman so on be very interesting assure quite a much so a of novel in saloon book case bob accordingly went ahead companion occasionally interrupting with question when story be finished lance rose stretched saying a turned to walk away thank very much story be so interesting that think will make few note of for benefit of literary friend of mine so if meet with in print day must not be very much surprised a bob saw shortly afterwards note book in hand a story actually be in print be to be presumed that mr lance evelin really carried out expressed intention on day following conversation wind have be blowing steadily from westward for time suddenly dropped by four bell in afternoon watch have fallen to dead calm ship rolling like log on heavy swell not faintest trace of cloud must be discerned in stupendous vault sprang in delicate carnation primrose tint from encircling horizon passing through multitude of subtle gradation of colour until became at zenith broad expanse of clearest purest deepest blue atmosphere be transparent to almost extraordinary degree slow moving mass of swell rising sharply outlined to very verge of horizon while mast head of far distant ship stood out clear well defined like two minute delicately drawn thin line on pale primrose background of sky suddenly however curious phenomenon occurred subtle distinct instantaneous change of colour took place made seem a though spectator be regarding scene through tinted glass brilliance purity beauty of various hue have died out dazzling ultramarine of zenith became indigo clear transparent hue of horizon thickened deepened to leaden grey sun gleamed aloft pallid rayless like ghost of former self ocean black turbid heaved restlessly writhing a if in torture intense unnatural silence too seemed suddenly to have fallen upon nature enwrapping scene a with mantle silence in flap of canvas pattering of reef point cheep of block occasional clank of rudder chain fell upon ear with sharpness be positively painful occupant of galatea deck glanced from one to dismayed violet dudley startled whisper to rex fortescue of what dreadful thing be about to happen being utterance of thought flashed through brain captain staunton turning to mr bowles who be standing beside in low tone requested that trusty officer to keep look out for minute two then hurried down to saloon to consult barometer returned to deck in le than minute face wearing look of anxiety concern be very rarely to be seen there glass have fallen full inch within last half hour muttered a rejoined mate then in louder tone of voice added call hand mr bowles if please shorten sail at once stow everything except lower fore main topsail fore topmast stay sail think be going to have change of weather seaman be a much startled a occupant of poop by preternatural change in aspect of sky sprang to post with alacrity of men who anticipate deadly struggle believe may have none too much time for preparation work of shortening sail proceeded rapidly methodically in orderly manner captain staunton have never before in experience witnessed anything quite like what be now passing around be oppressed by undefined foreboding of terrible catastrophe be too brave man too thorough seaman to allow aught of to appear in countenance voice manner must allow work to be hurried through with inconsiderate haste saw that men be startled rested with to steady restore confidence so prepare for coming struggle nature might be meanwhile atmospheric phenomenon be momentarily assuming more more portentous aspect sky deepened in tint from indigo to purple black sun lost pallid sickly gleam hung in sable heaven lurid blood red ball until became obscured by heavy mass of dusky vapour have gathered imperceptibly in firmament now seemed to be settling slowly down upon ship mast head rolling writhing like huge tortured serpent meanwhile silence broken though be by sound of preparation on board grew even more oppressively intense death like than before darkness now came to add new terror to scene not wholesome solemn darkness of nightfall weird unearthly gloom be night day gloom descended encompassed stealthily menacingly contracting horizon until nothing must be seen further than mile from ship still seemed to be saturated with pale spectral shimmering light in men looked in other eye like reanimated corps ocean presented aspect le appalling at one moment black a water of styx indistinguishable beyond distance of cable length anon gleaming into view to very verge of horizon palpitating sheet of greenish ghastly phosphorescent light canvas be stowed down to lower fore main topsail fore topmast stay sail men be about to hurry down from aloft when captain staunton stopped clew up stow lower topsail a well shouted adding in undertone to mr bowles know what to expect threatens to be something terrible le canvas show to better stay sail will be quite a much a will want expect topsail be stowed men came down on deck again evidently glad to find there once more huddling together on forecastle like frightened sheep passenger be clustered together on poop standing in group apart from skipper mate awaiting pale silent denouement bob who have be aloft helping to stow mizen canvas stepped up to a swung out of rigging addressing more particularly to violet blanche recommended to go below at once warning said be not for nothing precaution captain staunton have taken show clearly enough that expects something quite out of common change be likely enough to come upon suddenly bringing perhaps of top hamper about ear so if lady will be advised must recommend to go below where will certainly be in much le danger blanche violet looked at other inquiringly will remain here said violet unconsciously tightening hold upon rex fortescue arm a spoke happens must very much rather be here where can see full extent of danger than pent up in cabin picturing to myself know not what horror blanche expressed same determination mr dale hurried at once to companion loudly lamenting that have ever intrusted precious self to beastly treacherous sea ' remark attracted captain staunton attention to party at once stepped hurriedly toward exclaiming good heaven lady gentleman let beg to go below at once have idea be here saloon be safest place for at time like will be out of harm way there while here look out shouted mr bowles here come with vengeance take care of yourselves everybody gloom have visibly deepened until became difficult for grouped together on poop to distinguish other feature low deep humming sound be now audible increased in volume with startling rapidity go below of beg repeated captain staunton in anxious tone be a quick a can about please what be matter mr dale a individual stood few step down staircase grasping handrail on side neither descending allowing anyone else to do so book exclaimed dale left book on one of hen coop further remark be drowned in deafening din of tempest at moment swooped down upon ship with indescribable fury striking full upon starboard broadside hurling over in instant on beam end group gathered about companion way made instinctive effort to save rex fortescue flinging arm about violet dudley waist dragging with to mizen mast where hung on desperately to belaying pin brook nimbly scrambled upon upturned weather side of companion evelin exasperated by mr dale ill timed anxiety about book have stepped inside companion way down stair two to summarily remove obstructor two be flung together to bottom of staircase blanche left thus without protector clung convulsively for moment to one of open door of companion strength failing let go fell backwards with shriek into water foamed hungrily up over lee rail bob who have made spring for weather mizen rigging be just passing turn two of rope round body when happening to turn head saw blanche fall to cast adrift spring headlong after be work of instant succeeded in grasping dress just in nick of time for in instant ship must have driven over blanche fate must have be sealed a be have very narrow escape for bob in haste have omitted to take rope end with have consequently mean of returning inboard rather for lee side of deck be

bob head bob at once grasped rope with disengaged hand with rapid twist threw two three turn round arm whereupon brook exerting strength drew prize steadily up steeply inclined deck until be able to scramble into place have vacated upon companion chapter six dismasted a hurricane swooped down upon ship captain staunton mr bowles sprang with one accord aft to helm be well that did so for when vessel be thrown upon beam end wheel flew suddenly violently round taking unawares unfortunate man who be stationed at hurling far over lee quarter into sea where immediately sank being probably disabled by blow from rapidly revolving spoke two officer saw in moment that poor fellow be irretrievably lost so without wasting time in useless effort to save devoted forthwith to task of preserving ship wheel be put hard up with object of getting craft before wind then two men stood anxiously watching awaiting result two three minute passed there still lay ship prone on side with lee topsail lower yard arm dipping in water must not pay off bowles said captain staunton lashing wheel a spoke make way forward muster carpenter one two of most reliable men have bring aft with ax to cut away mizen mast must get before somehow must come stronger will turn turtle with station men cut until hold up hand mr bowles nodded head then set out upon difficult journey climbing up to windward by grating upon helmsman usually stood then working way along deck by grasping bulwark on poop be only about foot above deck on reaching wake of mizen mast be compelled to pause in order to help rex fortescue violet out of dangerous position position of course altogether untenable now that order have be given to cut away mast with brook assistance with difficulty accomplished landing safely alongside blanche bob upon companion slight delay thus incurred threatened to have most disastrous consequence for when chief mate be once more free to proceed upon errand became aware that ship inclination have sensibly increased to extent indeed that momentarily expected to feel rolling bottom up glancing aft once more caught eye of captain staunton who immediately raised hand mate took to mean order to cut away mast with possible expedition whipping out keen broad bladed knife thrust into brook hand tapping lanyard of mizen rigging roared in ear one word cut then without pausing instant proceeded a rapidly a must forward much impeded by continuous blinding shower of spindrift swept across vessel compelled to cling with strength to whatever laid hold of in progress in order to escape being literally blown away meanwhile brook who now showed that be made of far better stuff than anyone have hitherto suspected began without moment delay to vigorously attack rigid tightly strained lanyard of weather mizen rigging being speedily joined by bob who turned blanche over to rex fortescue care moment saw that must be of use steadily rapidly hacked notched away at hard rope working literally for life for be now no longer possible to doubt that galatea be slowly surely capsizing upturned side supported be becoming moment more nearly horizontal lee yard arm be steadily burying deeper deeper in water became apparent that unless relieved minute must see ship bottom up mr bowles meanwhile be out of sight forward hidden by gloom cloud of spindrift at last one of lanyard be severed by keen blade in brook hand others attached to same shroud immediately began to render through deadeye throwing extra strain upon lanyard of other shroud one of immediately parted under bob knife then twang twang one after other rapidly yielded until a last lanyard parted crash went mizen mast short off by deck away to leeward carrying away saloon skylight a went perceptible shock be felt a mast went over side one watched anxiously to see what effect must be disappointment be extreme when be seen that relief be not sufficient to enable ship to recover still lay down upon side though now no longer threatened momentarily to capsize neither righted paid off chief mate now reappeared upon poop having by time mustered gang of men whom have left clinging to main rigging thinking not unlikely main mast must also have to go by time reached captain staunton side mind of latter be made up be good bowles said will hing must part with main mast also cut away at once let get upon even keel again if can mr bowles hurried forward a soon a became visible to men clustered about main rigging made sign to to cut ax gleamed in darkened air few rapid stroke be struck upon lanyard of rigging main mast bowed crashed off at about ten foot from deck be carried by wind clear of lee rail into sea shock almost a if ship have struck something accompanied fall of main mast then laboriously at first finally with almost sudden jerk galatea swung upright paying off at same time began to draw through water speed increasing to seven knot when got fairly away before wind be relieved of wreckage towing alongside well be sounded to everybody intense relief six inch only of water be found in hold pump be rigged manned set to work water be so speedily got rid of a to show that have penetrated only through portion of upper work first mad fury of hurricane be by time over still blew far too heavily to admit of other course than running dead before sea have hitherto be level plane of fleecy white foam now showed symptom of rising aspect of sky be still such a to force upon voyager conclusion that be not yet by mean out of danger what must be done however be done entire crew be set to work to get up preventer back stay secure fore mast others to convert spare spar into jury mast passenger meanwhile have made way down into saloon directly ship recovered where found lance evelin pale dazed barely conscious bleeding from very ugly wound in temple caused by having fallen heavily against brass bound edge of one of saloon stair mr staunton be doing best single handed to staunch blood bind up wound with little may on knee beside patient sobbing a though tender child heart must break for lance have taken greatly to sweet little creature grave quiet though be in general be always ready to romp with tell most marvellous tale mr dale have retired to cabin shut in new arrival very promptly afforded assistance in short time lance be laid carefully in berth packed there with flag shawl other yielding material in such way a to prevent increasing motion of ship from causing avoidable discomfort dinner that day be very comfortless meal by time that be served sea have risen so much a to render fiddle necessary on cabin table even with aid be difficult to prevent viand from being scattered upon floor ship running before wind with only fore mast to steady rolled like hogshead act of dining be therefore quite acrobatic performance demanding so much activity of eye hand a to completely mar enjoyment of good thing in spite of weather graced board conversation at table turned naturally upon disaster have befallen ship passenger being curious to know how must affect suppose mean beastly detention grumbled dale ship ca sail way to england with only one mast can captain well scarcely replied captain staunton trip home might be made under jury mast must be longer more tedious voyage than of must care for fancy at event have intention of attempting nearest port be otago a be pretty certain to get westerly wind again a soon a breeze have piped out a current must also be against if attempted to return to westward will endeavour to reach valparaiso where may hope to restore poor old barkie clipped wing umph thought so snarled dale how long will be detained at wretched hole will depend on circumstance answered captain staunton think may reckon on being month there month ejaculated dale too much disgusted to say word month exclaimed rex fortescue jolly will explore andes do little shooting daresay evelin will join rather for suppose will go a well wo brook oh yes will go certainly 'tai often a have holiday so may a well take one when can get what be handle be to explore mr fortescue mr dale will come with too be sure be fond of sleeping in tent ai sir be such fool brook retorted that worthy if ever get to valparaiso think be very doubtful will go home overland be afraid that before can do mr dale someone else will have to bridge atlantic remarked captain staunton a leisurely sipped wine be extremely sorry for untoward event have interrupted voyage be one of occurrence skill foresight must have prevented so think best thing can do be to make a light of a possible worse thing than being dismasted have happened at sea before now for one be sincerely thankful that be still above water instead of beneath a seemed more than likely at one time so saying skipper rose with bow left saloon for deck sky still looked wild there be occasional momentary break in through lustrous star of southern heaven beamed gloriously down for instant ere be shut in again by scurrying cloud sea now ran high afforded magnificent spectacle a huge billow raced after ship with foaming crest cataract of liquid fire a ship rolled water washed impetuously across deck dark planking gleamed with million of tiny fairy like star waxed waned with oscillation of vessel fore mast have by time be made secure being too dark to work longer to advantage men be busy re lashing spar have be cast adrift in process of overhauling selecting most suitable for jury mast mr bowles who have hurried up from saloon after swallowing merest apology for dinner have charge of deck captain staunton joining pair began to discus future with plan probability two day later saw galatea making way to northward eastward under very respectable jury barque rig enabled to show fore topmast stay sail reefed fore sail double reefed fore topsail on fore mast main topsail with topgallant sail over on spar did duty for main mast reefed mizen set upon jib boom have be rigged in passed aft set on end properly stayed with heel stepped down through hole in poop from mizen mast have erstwhile sprung gale have blown out sea be rapidly going down wind have hauled round from westward once more ship be slipping along at rate of five knot hour minor damage have be made good excepting done to saloon skylight by fall of mizen mast upon job carpenter who be ambitious man in own way not altogether devoid of taste be taxing skill to utmost in effort to make new skylight stronger more handsome piece of work than predecessor barometer be slowly steadily rising everything seemed to point in direction of fine weather lucky be for voyager that such be case passenger have by time got over recent alarm be settling back into old way even impatient discontented dale seemed to have got over to great extent annoyance at delay loss of mast involved catching contagion of good spirit animated rest of party be actually betrayed into effort two to make agreeable that evening at dinner table so amiable be generally irritable individual that positively listened with equanimity to plan fortescue evelin latter with broad patch of plaster across brow be discussing relative to properly organised sporting excursion into cordilleras andes a indifferently termed much to perplexity of brook did allow to show sign of annoyance when last named individual sought to ruffle dale feather a elegantly termed by urging to join expedition on contrary to secret carefully concealed consternation of rex lance prime mover in matter mr dale seemed more than half disposed to yield to brook jesting entreaty that must make one of party almost seemed a though intensely selfish egotistical individual be at last becoming ashamed of own behaviour have resolved upon attempt to improve dinner over lady retired to poop to witness sunset rex lance accompanying while dale brook remained below lingering over wine oh how refreshing cool evening breeze be after closeness heat of saloon exclaimed violet a leaning on rex fortescue arm gazed astern where sun be just sinking out of sight beneath purple horizon leaving behind cloudless sky glowed in track with purest gold rose tint merging insensibly into clear ultramarine deepening in tone a eye travelled up to zenith thence downward toward eastern quarter where almost before upper rim of sun golden disc have sunk out of sight great star beamed out from velvety background glowing with soft mellow effulgence seems peculiar to southern sky yes responded rex be cool decidedly pleasant do not think be almost too cool however to be braved without shawl wrap of kind after being cooped up for hour in roasting saloon can not think why must have be so warm evening to mind be hotter even than when be crossing line on outward voyage blanche lance who be standing near enough to overhear remark be also of opinion that have be quite uncomfortably warm below two gentleman who by time have arrived at stage of intimacy with lady seemed to justify in own eye for assuming occasional dictatorial air toward fair companion forthwith insisted on returning below to seek for shawl wrap of kind phew be like walking into turkish bath to come in here exclaimed rex a passed through saloon door what peculiar smell yes assented lance smell like oil grease of kind expect steward have spilled lamp oil down in lazarette heat be causing odour to rise hope will pas off before turn in to night for be decidedly objectionable do know miss lascelles said lance a settled comfortably in chair by young lady side after carefully enveloping in soft fleecy wrap have idea in connection with touching story told other night respecting uncle loss of wife infant son have indeed said blanche pray what be mr evelin simply replied lance have impression almost conviction that cousin be living can put hand upon when required oh mr evelin what be say exclaimed blanche eagerly have indeed met with anyone in course of wandering whose history be such that believe to be dear little long lost cousin dick think must speak heedlessly without due consideration upon subject if supposition must be correct can furnish clue to discovery of missing relative will give new life to uncle lay under obligation a will never be able to repay place too much confidence in idea that must be quite impossible to repay even obligation a one of speak said lance in low meaning tone somehow caused blanche cheek to flush heart to flutter little be right in supposing continued must not make such assertion without due consideration have thought much upon story confided to comparing with have also heard be of opinion have discovered clue be worth following up if only for satisfaction of ascertaining whether be true false one if true poor aunt be without doubt long since dead cousin be still alive there stand pointing to bob who be in waist leaning musingly over lee rail where asked blanche looking quite bewildered there replied evelin again pointing to bob if supposition be correct that lad bob be cousin miss lascelles impossible exclaimed blanche oh mr evelin tell have led to think so will answered lance hope idea be not very distressing to be true that lad present position be well not perhaps exactly worthy of cousin of oh say that mr evelin beg interrupted blanche be not thinking of in least if bob indeed prove to be cousin will certainly not be ashamed of contrary took so completely by surprise have ever pictured lost cousin a chubby little flaxen haired baby boy from always having heard so spoken of suppose have forgotten for moment that if alive must necessarily have grown into young man let hear why have come to think that robert may be cousin be curiosity impatience woman like see in presence of mystery well said lance doubtless remember that on one occasion remarked upon striking resemblance bear to might have added still more striking resemblance between uncle sir richard somewhat bungling remark a at time considered led to relating to first history of friend bob then that of uncle loss a listened to idea dawned upon that bob lost cousin might possibly be one same individual got lad to tell story be naturally somewhat more full circumstantial than own sketch comparing date so on have be led to conclusion that may indeed prove to be sir richard son in first place age of course can only be approximately guessed at be about same a cousin must be if alive next there be very extraordinary likeness almost too striking think to be merely accidental lastly clothes wore when found be still in existence understand be marked with initial rl may stand for richard lascelles name a understood cousin bore at moment captain staunton made appearance at head of saloon staircase calling to chief mate said mr bowles pas word for carpenter to come aft to saloon at once if please let look smart skipper then disappeared below again not before passenger who be by time on poop have have time to observe that feature wore somewhat anxious expression word be passed chip who be on forecastle smoking pipe at once came shambling aft at head of companion way encountered steward who went up to mr bowles said word two to in low tone of voice then returned below again mr bowles nodded stepped quietly down to main dock put head inside door of deck house wherein mr dashwood be lodged in moment second mate came out followed chief up to poop took charge of deck mr bowles immediately proceeding below one lance appeared to take particular notice of movement so quietly be executed if suspected that anything be wrong took care not to show went on chatting with blanche upon same subject a before may be however that thought wandered little from matter in hand for once twice halted hesitated somewhat in speech seemed to forget what be talking about quarter of hour passed away then captain staunton followed by chief mate came on deck walked a far a break of poop together then mr bowles gave word to pipe hand aft there be something amiss thought lance in le than minute men be mustered in waist of ship waiting wonderingly to hear what skipper have to say for be perfectly evident that captain staunton be about to address when men be assembled captain turned to passenger on poop said lady gentleman have goodness to come little nearer if please what have to say concern hand alike in saloon a well a in forecastle passenger moved forward a requested lance taking blanche hand upon arm giving little reassuring squeeze a did so captain staunton then turned so that must be heard by began friend have called round in order to communicate to piece of very momentous intelligence be of somewhat trying nature therefore before go further must ask to listen to patiently to obey order implicitly above to preserve coolness presence of mind with have not doubt that can successfully battle with difficulty without will be impossible for to work effectively consequence must necessarily be proportionately grave paused moment then seeing that one appeared to be perfectly cool steady added greatly regret to say have cause for suspicion that fire have broken out somewhere below steady now steady lad wait hear have to say repeat have suspicion that fire may have broken out on board temperature of saloon be unaccountably hot there be strange smell below may may not be caused by fire be necessary that matter must be looked into at once ask one here to lend best assistance in case of surmise proving correct keep cool work hardest man of then there be reason why must not come easily out of scrape mr bowles mr dashwood will take charge of own watch mr dashwood get fire engine rigged under weigh mr bowles rig force pump get deck tub filled arrange watch in line along deck with bucket can muster gentleman turning to passenger be so good a to keep out of men way hold yourselves in readiness to assist in manner may be required now lad go quietly to post do duty like englishman chapter seven fiery ordeal chief second mate have when named by captain staunton gone down upon main deck upon conclusion of skipper address at once marwilled watch led to proper station third mate boatswain sailmaker cook steward apprentice be embodied with chief mate gang part of whom be told off to work force pump be to feed tank of fire engine while remainder be formed into line along deck to pas bucket to seat of fire fire engine have luckily be frequently in use at fire drill be in perfect order men knowing exactly what to do be rigged ready for action with tank filled hose screwed on laid along deck in remarkably short time captain staunton on seeing that men be cool thoroughly under control have immediately gone below again to rejoin carpenter whom have left busily engaged in seeking locality of fire of actual existence of have manner of doubt indeed one have need only to go to companion breathe heated pungent atmosphere ascended thence to have resolved doubt might have entertained upon subject oh how dreadful exclaimed blanche turning with white quivering lip to evelin a skipper disappeared below do think there really be fire mr evelin be quite impossible to say answered evelin calmly keeping to own conviction if there be can not have yet gained much hold daresay half hour so of vigorous work with fire engine will effectually drown out if doe not if looking at matter in worst possible light fire must after get upper hand drive out of ship night be fine water enough to enable easily comfortably to take to boat then boat be amply sufficient to take everybody without crowding be in perfect order best equipped boat have ever seen so that let what will happen think need not alarm ourselves in least think however added other passenger having gathered round that must do possible harm might be of advantage supposing that worst happens if lady be to go to berth make up package of warmest clothing together with valuable may have with so a to be in perfect readiness to leave ship if need be take matter quietly entreat for sincerely hope will prove that there be necessity for such decided step two girl turned away went together to cabin jointly occupied mr staunton have already followed husband below dale also hurried away loudly bewailing ill luck in ever having embarked on board unfortunate vessel for heaven sake follow fortescue stop clamour exclaimed lance be enough to demoralise entire regiment let alone small ship company like rex nodded followed partner seizing by arm leading aft instead of allowing to go below a evidently intended just then carpenter came on deck advancing to break of poop shouted pas along hose boy start engine there be spark two of something smouldering down below will soon have out men stationed at engine gave ringing cheer one of starting inspiriting shanty began at once to work away at handle well here be pretty go ai observed brook addressing to evelin a two stood together at break of poop watching men at work most unfortunate circumstance replied lance luckily there be sign of anything approaching to panic if keep a cool a be at present may hope to get out of difficulty one way other without mishap seem tolerably collected mr brook so perhaps there may be harm in telling that fear matter be much more serious than at present appear to be day to day saloon have appeared to to be extraordinarily hot presence of fire in ship now sufficiently account for if have be burning for time may prove to have obtained so strong hold a to defy mastery in such case behoves one of to set example of quiet self possession to rest behaved so nobly other day during gale think may depend on not to fail in respect oh be right returned brook believe in being put out about think be ready to help anywheres 'd begin at once if knowed where must do good if governor referring presumably to mr dale make fuss will roll 'im up in blanket like parcel take care of 'im thin vapour of smoke be by time rising from companion accompanied by strong quite unmistakable smell of fire in minute two more captain staunton in shirt sleeve appeared on deck called forward for more water there be rather more of than at first thought lad said stick steadily to work will conquer yet gang at fire engine be rapidly relieved fresh shanty be struck up chain of men with bucket got to work quickened clank clank of engine handle showed that crew be still confident determined now be time exclaimed lance to brook cut in here a rather wide gap in chain of bucket men revealed just at head of saloon staircase in moment be hard at work with coat off passing bucket twenty minute might have elapsed when captain staunton carpenter staggered together up saloon staircase to deck gasping for breath clothes skin grimy with smoke perspiration streaming down face send two fresh hand below if please mr bowles shouted skipper lad drop bucket lend hand here to cut hole in deck fire be spreading forward must keep to end of ship if possible two of most determined of crew at once stepped forward volunteered to go below captain staunton nodded permission led to scene of labour while chain of men who have be passing bucket along deck dropped under carpenter supervision at once commenced task of cutting through deck smoke be by time pouring in volume up companion through skylight lance have be too busy to take much notice of whilst engaged in passing bucket now that respite came have time to look about saw great dun cloud of smoke surging out of companion streaming away to leeward saw indistinctly through at interval small group gathered together aft by weather taffrail thought must join group for moment if only to ascertain whether girl have succeeded in securing such thing a be most anxious to save sauntered toward in usual easy deliberate manner a drew near violet rose said oh mr evelin be so glad be come be beginning to feel quite anxious about blanche where be see with be not with miss dudley answered lance what led to suppose must be not with oh mr evelin where be then if be not with must still be in cabin stayed there until smoke be too thick to see breathe longer then came on deck spoke to urging to come also receiving reply thought have left without noticing be not here anywhere latter part of speech never reached lance ear for upon fully realising that blanche own sweet darling a have called in inmost thought thousand time be missing darted to companion way plunged down stair three four at time into blinding pungent suffocating smoke rushed momentarily in more more dense volume up through opening on reaching foot of staircase found that several of plank have be pulled up to allow men tending hose to get below saloon floor approach a near a possible to seat of fire so dense be smoke just here that be only by merest chance escaped falling headlong into abyss catching sight however of aperture just in time to spring across did so glancing back for instant on reaching other side saw broad expanse of glowing white hot bale of wool dimly through acrid smoke steam form of men who be plying engine hose groping way into saloon be by time so full of smoke that must barely distinguish through feeble glimmer from cabin lamp made way in direction of state room appropriated to blanche violet smoke got into eye made water into throat made cough violently into lung producing overpowering sense of suffocation impressing unmistakably upon necessity for rapidity decision of movement blind giddy breathless staggered onward groping for handle of state room door at length found wrenched door open rapidly felt with hand foot about floor in berth one there where then must blanche be be not on deck be hardly probable must have fallen overboard then a hastily began search anew foot kicked against something on floor at once picked up be boot man boot unmistakably from size weight at once satisfied that in obscurity have groped way into wrong state room must prosecute search further be suffocating already brain began to reel there be loud humming in ear eye ached felt a though must burst out of socket found strength ebbing away like water must at once prosecute search further seemed physically impossible if blanche be in fatal atmosphere must soon die if not dead already if left cabin to obtain breath of fresh air be not likely to go astray again lose still more precious time search must be proceeded with at once reeling like drunken man lance felt for state room door staggered into saloon felt along bulkhead for handle of next door oh heaven what search be head felt a though must burst gasped for breath inhaled nothing hot pungent smoke saloon seemed to be mile instead of yard in length thank god at last handle be found turned door flung open lance with conviction that unless can escape in very few second will die grope wildly round into berth ah what be something coiled up at foot of bottom berth human body woman lance grasp tightly in arm stumble out through door with along saloon through passage roaring a of thousand thunder be in ear star innumerable dance before eye see a in dream yawning gulf in floor broad glare of fierce white light reel madly to fro before confused sound of hoarse voice strike upon ear feel that end be come that be dying with last supreme effort stagger up saloon staircase to deck turn instinctively to windward out of smoke with precious burden still tightly clasped in arm fall prostrate senseless to deck rex fortescue who have be present when violet spoke to lance of blanche absence who have witnessed hasty departure of friend upon perilous search be at head of companion on way below having grown anxious at lance prolonged absence when latter reappeared on deck assistance having be hastily summoned pair who have so nearly met death from suffocation be with little difficulty at length restored to consciousness meanwhile have become apparent to captain staunton that fire be of much more serious character than have anticipated that be minute assuming more formidable proportion therefore at length decided a precautionary measure to get boat into water without further delay be anxious more particularly about launch pinnace a boat be stowed over main hatch must have to be hoisted out by mean of yard tackle must be long difficult operation ship being under jury rig must fire attack heel of main mast before craft be in water two largest safest boat in ship might be seriously damaged if not destroyed in process of launching perhaps might defy unaided effort of crew to launch at there must be difficulty about other boat a must be lowered from davit mate be busy superintending directing effort of respective gang towards extinguishing of fire captain staunton therefore after moment two of anxious deliberation confided to bob important duty of provisioning launching boat giving a assistant cook steward two able seaman soliciting also aid of male passenger now happened that galatea boat be somewhat different in character from boat usually to be found on board ship captain staunton have when quite lad be compelled with rest of ship company of be then junior very unimportant member to abandon ship take to boat in mid ocean then learnt lesson never forgot formed idea with respect to fitting of boat nautical friend have be wont to rather sneer at stigmatise a queer when galatea be in process of fitting out have with difficulty succeeded in persuading owner to allow to carry out idea boat be fitted up almost under own eye chief peculiarity of boat lay in keel be made trifle stouter than usual of ordinary depth be so shaped finished that false keel eight nine inch deep must be securely fastened on below in very few minute be managed by having true keel bored in dozen place along length hole bushed with copper copper bush projected quarter of inch above upper edge of keel be so finished a to allow of copper cap screwing on over thus effectually preventing flow of water up through bolt hole into interior of boat false keel be made to accurately fit true keel be provided with stout copper bolt coinciding in number position with bolt hole in true keel to fix false keel be necessary be to unscrew cap from top of bush apply false to true keel pushing bolt up through respective hole set up tight by mean of thumb screw whole operation must be performed in couple of minute boat be then fit to beat to windward to extent a far a gig be concerned with exception of whaleboat gig be exquisitely modelled boat fitted with air chamber so a to render self righting unsinkable beyond greater attention than usual to model of craft be only difference captain staunton have thought necessary to make between boat of galatea of other ship in case of launch pinnace have gone step further by fitting with movable deck in section covered in boat forward aft for about foot wide right along side deck be bolted down secured with thumb screw to beam fitted into socket under gunwale when whole be once fixed section contributed to keep immovably in place decking being light be not difficult to fix in hour after order be given to launch boat launch pinnace be in water alongside gig hanging at davit ready to lower away at moment notice thanks also to captain staunton never ceasing care with regard to boat be in perfect condition not leaky a basket a be too many boat when required to be lowered upon unexpected emergency gig launch be regularly half filled with water morning before deck be washed down emptied at conclusion of ceremony while pinnace be stowed bottom up in launch be liberally soused with water at same time in addition to proper complement of oar rowlock stretcher boat hook mop baler anchor rudder yoke tiller together with compass mast sail be always stowed in boat to belonged be carefully overhauled once week under skipper own eye thus on present occasion there be none of bewildered running about searching high low for boat gear be at hand ready for use whenever might be wanted there be nothing therefore to do to make sure that boat be amply provisioned launch pinnace being safely in water be bob next task to devoted coolly with alacrity boat water breaker be slung ready filled between fore after gallows under two of gig breaker bearing painted upon name of boat to belonged be cast adrift passed into proper boat a be lowered then followed a large quantity of provision a must possibly be stowed away without too much encumbering movement of occupant meanwhile scupper have be carefully plugged up deck pierced hand set to work with bucket etcetera to flood still fire increased in volume be pm by time that boat be veered astern fully equipped ready to receive human freight at midnight main mast fell flame at same time bursting up through saloon companion skylight upon perceiving became evident to captain staunton that be quite hopeless to further prolong fight crew have be for four hour exerting to utmost capacity with fire gaining steadily upon whole time be now completely exhausted fire be blazing furiously almost throughout devoted ship therefore considered have done full duty be now quite justified in abandoning unfortunate galatea to fiery doom accordingly gave order for crew to desist from effort to collect effect to muster again upon quarter deck with possible expedition men needed second bidding saw that moment of good ship be numbered throwing down happened to have in hand made rush for forecastle there in midst of already blinding stifling smoke proceeded hurriedly to gather together few belonging in le than five minute hand be collected in waist waiting order to pas over side boat have meanwhile be hauled alongside lady with little may carefully handed into launch when attempt came to be made proved task of little difficulty for ship side be found to be so hot that be impossible to touch however by exercise of great caution be accomplished without mishap then male passenger be ordered down over side rex lance going into launch with lady while dale brook be told off to pinnace crew be then sent down man a passed over rail being told what boat be to go into mr bowles be appointed to command of pinnace mr dashwood be ordered to take charge of whaleboat gig with six hand a crew passenger crew of galatea be distributed thus launch under command of captain staunton carried mr staunton little daughter may violet dudley blanche lascelles bosom friend rex lance bob three fellow apprentice steward twelve in pinnace commanded by mr bowles have on board mr forester dale brook carpenter sailmaker two of seaman numbering seven told whaleboat gig smartest boat of fleet be manned a already stated by mr dashwood six picked hand be to act a tender to launch second gig of boatswain be given charge carried remainder of crew five in number six including boatswain captain staunton be of course last man to leave ship be not until moment have actually arrived for to do so that full force of calamity appeared to burst upon up to moment have be working harder than other man on board whilst body have be actively engaged mind be le busy devising expedient for preservation of noble ship with life cargo carried for safety of of be responsible now be done with ship cargo be hopelessly lost time have come when must be abandoned to fate be true that many precious life be still a be held in hand that upon skill courage depended to very large extent preservation be matter for future immediate future doubt at supreme moment captain staunton seemed unable to think of anything present that terrible present in must abandon to devouring flame beautiful fabric have borne so gallantly over so many thousand league of pathless ocean through light darkness through sunshine tempest battling successfully with wind wave in most unbridled fury to succumb helplessly at last under insidious attack of terrible enemy fire last of crew have passed down over side have be received into boat to be appointed boat have excepting launch shoved off from ship side retired to distance at fierce heat of victorious flame be no longer discomfort be now high time that skipper must also leave flame be roaring leaping below above around scorching air be surging about torrent of spark be whirling around yet seemed unable to tear away there stood in gangway head bare with cap in hand eye roving lingeringly lovingly fore aft then aloft to blazing spar sail at length fore mast be seen to tremble totter wavered for moment then with crash in cloud of fiery spark plunged hissing over side opposite side fortunately to on launch lay aroused captain staunton gazed about single moment longer in dazed bewildered way then a ship rolled launch rose upon sea sprang lightly down into boat in voice stern with emotion gave order to shove off oh papa cried little may so glad be come sought be coming sweet little creature threw arm lovingly about father neck deem unmanly that hid eye for moment on child shoulder perchance to pray for safety in trial trouble danger now lay before then handing little one back to mother hailed in cheery voice rest of boat to close round launch a soon a have withdrawn to safe distance in few minute little fleet lay on oar close together at distance of about hundred yard from blazing ship captain staunton then in few well chosen word first thanked hand for strenuous effort have made to save ship then explained to plan for future proposed in first place said to remain near galatea a long a floated because if other craft happened to be in neighbourhood crew must be certain to notice light of fire bear down to see what meant in case must be spared necessity for long voyage in boat if friendly sail appeared within hour two of destruction of own ship be intention to continue in boat course to valparaiso have be steering when fire broke out by reckoning be trifle over eighteen hundred mile from port long distance doubt reminded that be in pacific might reasonably hope for moderately fine weather boat be in perfect order well supplied in good sailing trim instead of being loaded down to gunwale a be too often case when crew be compelled to abandon ship believed that unless unforeseen circumstance occurred to delay must make passage in fortnight finally expressed hope that hand must maintain strict discipline cheerfully obey order of officer a upon must to very great extent depend ultimate safety address be responded to with ringing cheer after occupant of various boat subsided into silence sat watching burning ship galatea be by time mass of flame fore aft mast be gone deck have fallen in hull above water be in several place red hot while a rolled heavily on long swell burying heated side gunwale deep in water great cloud of steam rose up like smoke of broadside hid momentarily from view fire continued to blaze more more fiercely a spread among cargo until about couple of hour after boat have left ship when intense long continued heat appeared to cause rivet to give way to destroy of iron plate for great gap suddenly appeared in galatea side long strip of plating curling up shrivelling away like sheet of paper momentarily revealing white hot content of glowing told then water poured in through orifice there be sudden upbursting of vast cloud of steam accompanied by mighty hissing sound hull appeared to writhe like living thing in mortal agony then darkness upon face of water scorched distorted shell of iron have once be a gallant ship a ever rode foam be gone from sight for ever chapter eight at mercy of wind wave silence followed disappearance of galatea be broken by plaintive wail from little may who sobbed out that be oh so sorry that poor papa beautiful ship be burned up sorrow however be speedily charmed away by representation made to by mother that if ship have not be burnt must probably never have thought of going for delightful sail in boat a now be soon afterwards poor overtired child fell into deep dreamless sleep in mother arm a everything have be made ready in launch before left ship side lady have now nothing to do make thoroughly comfortable for night on among blanket skin rug have be arranged for in stern sheet cosy enough little cabin of necessarily very limited dimension be also arranged in bow of boat for gentleman to upon captain staunton assurance that service must certainly not be needed for at least hour rex lance betook accompanied by bob young neville former of whom be to keep watch alternately with skipper night now being so far advanced captain staunton announced to occupant of other boat intention to wait for daylight before making sail tired crew at once composing to slumber silence soon fell upon little fleet of boat lay there riding lightly over majestic slowly heaving swell of pacific under solemn starlight hour of night passed peacefully away watcher on board several boat at length saw velvety darkness in eastern quarter paling before approaching day star short time before have risen into view over dark rim of horizon dwindled into lustreless insignificance finally disappeared sky grew momentarily paler bluer in tint light sweeping imperceptibly higher wider over ethereal vault then suddenly above eastern horizon appeared faint delicate rosy flush followed by brilliant golden pencilling of lower edge of few fleck of cloud invisible before long shaft of golden light sprang radiating upward from point below horizon in moment upper edge of great golden disc rose into view flooding laughing wave with shimmering radiance transforming in moment hitherto silent sombre scene into one of joyousness life sea bird hovered screaming high in air on look out for breakfast flying fish sparkled like glittering gem out of bosom of heaving deep dolphin leaped darted here there school of porpoise rotated lazily past heading to westward away upon very verge of horizon large school of whale appeared spouting playing be day again bob at once in accordance with instruction called captain staunton who have lain down hour two before to snatch little rest skipper who have turned in standing be to say without undressing soon made appearance first glancing keenly round horizon in vain hope of discovering sail at once hailed other boat ordering to make sail to proceed upon north easterly course extending in line to right left to maintain a great distance apart during day a must be compatible with easy interchange of communication by signal to keep sharp look out day to close in again upon launch at order be promptly obeyed in five minute afterwards little fleet be dancing gaily along over low liquid hill of pacific swell tossing tiny shower of spray out on side from bow leaving long glistening wake of miniature whirlpool behind slight bustle of making sail on boat combined with novelty of situation be sufficient to rouse hand few minute after boat be fairly under weigh lady little may emerged from quarter in stern sheet of launch excitement of previous night have be completely overcome by fatigue of preparation to desert ship lateness of hour of retirement have secured for heroine few hour of sound repose so that when made appearance aft refreshed by sleep exhilarated by pure bracing morning breeze looked felt a little like castaway a one can well imagine indeed appeared more disposed to regard adventure a pleasantly exciting escapade than anything else state of feeling gentleman of party be careful to foster encourage by mean in power judging highly probable that there must be enough more than enough to damp high spirit before singular boat voyage just commenced must be over on board launch fortune of propose to follow for present be pleasant activity even skipper whose reflection must necessarily have be of somewhat sombre character glad to observe prevalence of good spirit among fellow voyager resolutely put disagreeable thought behind chimed in with others feeling importance of prolonging to utmost extent so favourable pleasant state of affair lance whose experience in australian bush have evidently made fertile of resource now rummaged out from among baggage diminutive effective cooking apparatus fuel for be supplied from goodly jar of spirit stowed away in eye of boat initiating steward into peculiarity of management explaining to capability appetising breakfast of coffee fried chop cut from carcass of sheep hastily slaughtered previous night be soon served out to occupant of boat fishing line be afterwards produced if sport be meagre amount of fish captured small expedient have at least good effect of providing occupation amusement for lady during greater part of day a weather continued fine there be absolutely nothing to do to steer boat upon given course keep bright look out captain staunton seized opportunity to take good long spell of sleep not only to make up for lost on previous night also to lay in stock a be against time when probably many long weary hour must have to be passed without lance rex took helm in turn throughout day while lady tended fishing line chatted with male companion played with little may a humour took about hour before sunset small red flag be hoisted on board launch a signal for other boat to close signal being repeated by boat a soon a be observed kept flying until most distant craft have answered by bearing up hauling to wind a case might be by time that star be fairly out little fleet be once more sailing along in close compact body so ended first day in boat pleasant satisfactory state of affair lasted for five day then came change on afternoon of fifth day light fleecy vapour began to gather in sky growing thicker a afternoon waned until by sunset entire canopy of heaven be veiled by huge mass of dense slate coloured cloud swept heavily across firmament from eastward aneroid captain staunton have ordered to be put oh board launch indicated considerable decrease of atmospheric pressure coupled with appearance of sky led skipper to believe that bad weather be at hand accordingly when other boat closed in upon launch at sundown word be passed along line to keep sharp look out to be prepared for change might occur about nine pm wind died almost completely away shortly afterwards few heavy drop of rain fell speedily followed by drenching shower killed remaining light air of wind boat lay idly upon water saturated canvas flapping heavily against mast not for long sail be speedily lowered down spread across from gunwale to gunwale to catch precious moisture so heavy be downpour that in quarter of hour during shower lasted voyager be enabled to almost entirely refill breaker content of have by time very materially diminished rain ceased suddenly few minute afterwards puff of wind hot a breath of furnace swept over boat from north east passed away leaving breathless calm a before be repeated twice thrice then with heavier puff than before stiff breeze set in from north east breaking off boat from course necessitating hauling close upon wind on port tack by midnight wind have increased so much that became necessary to reef launch pinnace double reefing canvas in order that might not run away from other boat sea now began to rise rapidly when day at length broke revealed dismal picture of dark tempestuous sky leaden grey ocean surface broken up into high racing foam capped sea little fleet of boat tossing wildly upon angry surge launch leading pinnace next others so far astern that took captain staunton quite ten minute to satisfy that be still in sight be by time blowing moderate gale appearance seemed to indicate downright bad weather be not far off captain decided therefore to heave to at once a must be quite impossible in other way to keep little fleet together canvas on board launch be accordingly still further reduced jib sheet hauled over to windward boat left to fight out a best must pinnace soon afterwards joined company followed suit remainder of boat doing same a came up a day wore on gale increased in strength sea rising proportionally flinging boat about like cork upon angry surface so violent be motion that be only with utmost difficulty steward succeeded in preparing hot meal at mid day when evening came adventurer be obliged to content with what lance laughingly called cold collation day be indeed wretched one there be temptation to leave such slight shelter a tiny cabin afforded for launch indeed other boat a well be constantly enveloped in spray blown from cap of sea by wind while cooped up below be unpleasantly warm motion of boat be so violent that occupant be compelled to wedge firmly in one position to avoid being dashed against companion if day be one of discomfort night followed be infinitely worse gale continued steadily to increase sea rose to tremendous height breaking heavily spray flew continuously over launch in drenching shower little craft under merest shred of canvas be careened gunwale to by force of wind time rose upon crest of sea most watchful care of skipper who have stationed at helm be sometimes insufficient to prevent more than ordinarily heavy sea from breaking on board increasing frequency of occurrence at length necessitated maintenance of one hand continually at baler in order to keep boat free of water in spite of lady be unable to escape thorough wetting be worst mishap water rose so high in interior of boat on one two occasion that got at provision so seriously damaging of that there be little hope of being rendered again fit for consumption be most fortunate circumstance for in launch thanks to captain foresight have be fitted with partial deck otherwise must inevitably have be swamped how fared with other boat be impossible to say darkness be too profound to permit of being seen if still remained afloat manner in launch suffered caused skipper to entertain gravest apprehension for rest of fleet almost dreaded return of daylight lest must reveal to realisation of worst fear seemed to occupant of launch a though miserable night must never end tardy dawn however made appearance at last reluctantly a seemed to drenched weary watcher moment that there be light enough to enable to see distinctly captain staunton staggered to foot steadying by grasping boat main mast took long anxious look round horizon at first must distinguish nothing save wildly rushing foam capped sea scurrying shred of cloud swept rapidly athwart black stormy sky after minute of painfully anxious scrutiny descried about three mile away to leeward tiny dark object appearing at interval against leaden grey of horizon seaman eye told be pinnace remainder of fleet have disappeared be no more than realisation of foreboding captain staunton possessed far too feeling heart not to be powerfully affected by loss of two boat thirteen brave fellow who manned ran over name mentally recalled that le than nine of thirteen have arranged for pay to be handed over to family at home pictured to bitter grief distress there must be in nine family when came to be known that husband father bread winner be gone overwhelmed swallowed up by remorseless ocean know pity not even for wife helpless child with powerful effort captain dismissed painful reflection from mind turned attention to matter nearer home have already searchingly scrutinised aspect of weather with most unsatisfactory result a far a experience went there be prospect of continuance nay more increase of gale sky to windward looked wilder more threatening than ever while that sea be still rising be fact about there must be mistake dived into little cabin shelter aft took long look at aneroid to find that still manifested downward tendency be evidently hopeless to expect favourable change in weather for hour at least to attempt longer to maintain boat position in face of increasing gale be to expose in to imminent risk of destruction therefore decided to watch opportunity seize first favourable moment for bearing up running before bob fellow apprentice together with lance rex be soon summoned preparation made for bearing up be anxious moment for must boat be caught broadside on by breaking sea must to dead certainty be turned bottom up when nothing must save occupant captain staunton stood at tiller intently watching onward rush of mountainous sea a came swooping down with upreared threatening crest upon launch presently a boat fell off trifle from wind main sail filled gave order to let draw jib sheet weather sheet be let go lee one hauled in like lightning boat began to forge ahead sea came swooping down upon little craft be not dangerous one skipper sent boat manfully at with wild bound rose over crest plunged into liquid valley beyond next sea be much more formidable one by luffing boat just in nick of time went through over with worse consequence than shipping of dozen so bucket of water mishap to be by time growing quite accustomed then there occurred very decided smooth brail up main sail boy shouted skipper cheerily in second be done helm be put up boat head fell off away went with rush broadside on to sea with sickening heave rose into air a next sea lifted time too little water came on board nothing to speak of by time next wave caught quarter be fairly turned to be rushing away before wind fore sail be then set main sail stowed everybody sat down to watch result change be certainly for better for though sea still occasionally broke on board did so with le violence than before most of now flowed off deck overboard again instead of falling into body of boat a before a soon a fore sail be set captain staunton steered for pinnace with intention of ordering also to bear up a well a to inquire whether have seen either of other boat suddenly bob who be watching little speck in distance showed against horizon when launch pinnace happened to be on summit of wave together caught sight for single instant of what appeared to to be attempt at signal made on board latter hillo exclaimed what be wrong with pinnace be waving to sir indeed said skipper in tone of concern be sure bob here take tiller for moment let have look keep dead before ay ay sir responded bob a changed place with superior latter going forward steadying by fore mast a watched for reappearance of pinnace presently caught sight of caught sight too most unmistakably of flag something doing duty therefor being very energetically waved on board be right bob sharply exclaimed be signalling fervently hope there be nothing wrong with starboard little there steady so keep her at a long a can only run off when be absolutely necessary in order to avoid breaking sea in about twenty minute launch have reached pinnace a two boat closed be seen that hand on board be busy baling appeared to be low in water when launch be near enough for hail to be heard mr bowles stood up placing two hand together at mouth so a to form impromptu speaking trumpet shouted can make room for on board launch captain staunton be stove sinking ay ay responded skipper will round to come alongside then sprang aft to tiller seized shouting at same time to station lad in with fore sail smartly now sail be speedily taken in close reefed main sail be set moment that sheet be hauled aft helm be jammed hard down boat brought to wind without wasting moment to watch for favourable opportunity launch be flying swiftly away from pinnace latter be sinking there be therefore time for watching for opportunity by frantic way in mr bowles resumed task of baling instant that have communicated momentous tidings captain staunton saw that danger on board pinnace be imminent boat be at once rounded to shipping in operation sea half filled man bucket man of shouted skipper a launch now close hauled began slowly to forge ahead in direction of devoted pinnace sea broke heavily against bow of boat a swept furiously down upon bob comrade baled like madman while skipper handled little craft like consummate seaman be between managed to keep above water drop bucket bob stand by to heave line presently shouted captain bob sprang forward seized end of long painter be neatly coiled up stopped with ropeyarn two whipping open knife quickly severed stop be just arranging coil in hand when captain staunton cried sharply heave with will bob there go bob glanced at pinnace now twenty foot distant just in time to see heavy sea break fairly on board water logged boat literally bury there be wild cry from occupant a felt boat sinking under in instant be left struggling for life in furious sea bob hove line with strength with unerring aim into midst of little crowd of drowning human being then called for assistance of saw have seized at once began to haul in other apprentice with lance rex sprang to aid presently hauled on board brook one of seaman by time launch have crept up to spot where pinnace have disappeared by reaching out hand on board be able to seize drag inboard three more of drowning men mr bowles body however be seen floating face downwards five twenty foot away close to mr forester dale struggling desperately uttering wild scream be moment changed to choking sob a pitiless sea broke relentlessly over head be bob who first caught sight of two without instant pause hesitation sprang headlong from launch gunwale with few powerful stroke reached struggler mr dale promptly flung arm leg round must be deliverer clasping bob like vice pinioning so completely that be unable to move hand foot result be that instantly sank beneath surface poor bob thought for second two that last hour be come there in depth of wildly raging sea lifted up whole heart to god in momentary earnest prayer for mercy forgiveness doubtless swift prayer be heard for a flashed from heart felt companion grip relaxing in instant have wrenched free be striking strongly upward with one hand firmly grasping mr forester dale by collar of coat bob rose to surface within few foot of mr bowles still floating body with violent effort soon succeeded in reaching knowing that encumbered a be must have to trust launch to come to must never reach a seized staunch friend superior officer by hair twisted over on back heard wild cheer instantly followed by cheery shout of look out for line bob a sound reached rope came flying over striking sharply in face seized with teeth then heard skipper voice say haul in handsomely now take care jerk have gripped with teeth very few second afterwards however appeared age to bob found floating alongside launch where be speedily relieved of two inanimate charge finally dragged on board drowned with about ten foot of water in hold a expressed full of pluck a ever first business claiming attention be of course that of endeavouring to restore consciousness to inanimate body of mr dale chief mate be at length achieved mr dale be first to come round a soon a be so far recovered a to be able to speak be stowed away in men sleeping berth forward made a comfortable a circumstance must permit lay there warmly wrapped up bemoaning for time hard fate in ever having come to sea at length spirit have be liberally poured down throat took effect dropped off to sleep mr bowles case be somewhat more serious having received violent blow on head from of floating wreckage just after foundering of pinnace blow have inflicted long scalp wound from blood flowed freely when at length revived seemed quite dazed light headed so that be impossible to get coherent reply to of question put to too be at last stowed away forward bob who be somewhat exhausted by exertion in water scarcely fit for other work be detailed to watch by attend to two invalid launch have in meantime be once more got before wind be again flying to leeward under jib fore sail mountain sea pursuing necessitating utmost watchfulness on part of helmsman to prevent from being broached to a soon a two invalid have be satisfactorily disposed of order for breakfast be given after vast amount of trouble meal consisting of biscuit fried rasher of bacon hot coffee be served company be indebted to effort of rex lance for cooking having taken counsel together come to conclusion that after night of such great discomfort be absolutely necessary that female at least must be served with good substantial hot meal have accordingly joined force in preparation of same lance seating coolly in bottom of boat with water washing round balancing cooking apparatus carefully on knee while rex knelt before enacting part of chief cook meal unromantic a may sound to say so be inexpressibly comforting to weak woman poor little may of having passed wretched sleepless night cooped up in close confined covered in space in stern of launch for want of more appropriate name have be termed cabin with water in bottom of boat surging up round wetting to skin a boat tossed on angry surge while continuous breaking of sea on board filled soul with dread that boat must not possibly outlive gale much longer when hand be fairly settled down to discussion of breakfast captain staunton turned to carpenter who have established close beside skipper said now chip let hear how mishap came about whereby lost pinnace morning before answer that question tell do know anything about other boat well sir responded chip ca say a do rightly when day broke mornin ' first missed mister bowles jumped up took good look round first thing made out be launch away to wind'ard hove to then have good look round presently see put hand up to eye stand looking away down to leeward do see anythink sir say say still with hand up shadin ' eye know chip say be most certain ' say that one of boat be thereaway ' pointin ' with finger away down to leeward be too dark thick down there to see werry distinctly ' say now then keep fancyin ' can see small dark spot like boat sail showin ' up in middle of haze say doubt sir continued chip what did see one of boat mr bowles have eye a know sir what ai very often deceived in case remark skipper thinking aloud rather than addressing carpenter there can be doubt that officer in charge finding impossible to face gale longer in safety bore up like ourselves only little earlier if one of boat did so why not other why must not be safely scudding before at moment ten mile so ahead of very true sir doubt be just a say sir responded carpenter who be in uncertainty a to whether be expected to reply to skipper remark not will hope so at event chip cheerily returned skipper now tell how managed to get pinnace stove well sir fact be be just doin ' of miserable creatur mister dale water be gettin low yesterday mr bowles ups put on 'lowance pint day for man well s'pose be enough for here mister dale got thirsty durin ' night made way to water breaker to get drink on quiet be that sly over that nobody noticed hows'ever like lubber be axing pardon humbly sir for speakin ' disrespectable of one of passenger sir let dipper slip in between breaker in tryin ' to get out again managed to cast off lashin two of breaker struck adrift before must do anything with 'em have started three of plank makin ' boat leak bad that a saw sir be must do to keep above water until reached captain staunton made comment upon communication though be probable that thought more loss of pinnace be particularly at juncture most serious misfortune for at very time when in consequence of bad weather with have to contend be of utmost importance that launch must be in best possible trim be suddenly encumbered with additional weight of seven extra men with twelve person previously on board raised complement to nineteen caused to be inconveniently crowded then additional seven men have to be fed out of rapidly diminishing store belonging to launch for not ounce of anything have be saved from pinnace rendered imperatively necessary that hand must at once be put upon very short allowance of food water hardship trying enough to men of party doubly so to woman poor little may however one murmured offered slightest objection to arrangement when at mid day captain staunton explained state of affair laid before party proposal except mr dale individual on hearing proposition promptly crawled out of snug shelter hastened to remind skipper that speaker be invalid that health already undermined by privation exposure have be lately called upon to suffer have be completely broken up nervous system shattered by recent immersion that what might be perfectly right proper treatment for people in state of robust health a everybody in boat excepting appeared to be must be followed by most disastrous consequence if applied to that finally begged to remind captain staunton that have duly paid passage money ill well must expect to be fully supplied with everything necessary for comfort captain staunton looked at objector for moment in dead silence being positively stricken dumb with amazement then in accent of bitterest scorn burst out with despicable wretch be actually possible sir that have sense whatever of shame that be so full of selfishness that there be room in for other feeling be forgetful of fact mr dale that be to greed clumsiness be indebted for greatly increased hardship of situation for sir pinnace must probably have be still afloat yet be one who presumes to murmur at privation of be direct cause wish to heaven have never seen face positively make feel ashamed of sex of specie be very well sneeringly retorted contemptible creature did come to sea to be bullied by so will withdraw from exceedingly objectionable neighbourhood if ever reach england will make smart for barbarous treatment of good fellow saying slunk away back in very dignified fashion to most comfortable spot must find in bow of boat rolled snugly up once more in shawl blanket woman have eagerly given up for benefit when be first fished out of water chapter nine albatross day launch continued to scud before gale getting pooped so often that be work of two men to keep free of water toward evening mr bowles came aft reporting ataunto once more ready to resume duty still looked pale haggard be a keen determined a ever demurred so vehemently to captain staunton suggestion that must be better for whole night between blanket that skipper be at last compelled to give in did with must be confessed feeling of greatest relief that now have so trusty coadjutor to share watch with for since springing up of gale poor fellow have scarcely closed eye night shut down a dark a wolf mouth to use skipper own metaphor chief mate took first watch with bob on look out must have be somewhere about six bell pm when latter be startled by seeing crest of sea ahead of breaking in cloud of phosphoric foam over object directly in line with launch bow keep away sir yelled starboard for life starboard hard up went boat helm in instant a dragged heavily on steep incline of wave have just swept under bob saw floating close past large mass of tangled wreckage consisting of ship lower mast with heel of topmast still in place yard stay shroud brace etcetera attached dark a be night there be difficulty whatever in identifying character of wreckage for floated in regular swirl of lambent greenish phosphorescent light stand by with boat hook there forward shouted mr bowles see if can get hold of rope end if can will anchor to wreck will ride to leeward of a snug a if be in london dock almost a spoke skilfully luffed boat up under lee of mass bob with vigorous sweep two of boat hook managed to fish up standing part of main brace with block still attached through block rove end of launch painter belayed on board thus causing to ride to wreckage by sort of slip line other apprentice meanwhile lost time in taking in stowing canvas in few minute launch be riding at floating anchor in perfect safety in comparative comfort still tossing wildly be true longer shipping drop of water excepting spray blew over from sea a broke on wreckage toward noon on following day gale broke by sunset have moderated to strong breeze on evening be blessed with glimpse of sun once more for just before moment of setting canopy of cloud have hung overhead for so long broke up leaving great gap through blue sky must be seen revealing glorious luminary upon verge of western horizon surrounded by magnificent framework of jagged tattered cloud larger mass of be of dull purplish hue with blotch of crimson here there with edge of purest gold while smaller fragment streamed athwart sky lavishly painted with richest tint of rainbow hung on to wreckage night wind being still against next morning lance suspecting that there might be few fish congregated about mass of broken spar a be frequently case roused out line managed to hook over dozen gaudily marked curiously shaped fish of decent size whole of be devoured with greatest gusto day at dinner notwithstanding rather repulsive aspect of presented that night wind have dwindled away to gentle breeze changed blew once more from westward sea having also gone down to great extent adventurer cast off from wreckage have so opportunely provided with shelter from fury of gale with whole canvas flowing sheet stood away once more on north easterly course in addition to delay gale have occasioned captain staunton estimated that have be driven fully five hundred mile directly out of course after very careful inspection therefore of stock of provision skipper be reluctantly compelled to order further reduction in daily allowance of food water served out now suffering of on board launch commenced in grim earnest woman especially a might be expected soon began to feel privation acutely buffeted a have be by gale be completely exhausted needed rest abundance of nourishing food rather than to be placed on short common bore privation however with quiet fortitude ought to have silenced in shame querulous complaint murmuring of mr dale though did not most distressing part of be to hear poor little may staunton piteously cry for water 'cause be so veddy thirsty mama a dear child explained be not old enough to understand possibility of state of thing wherein food drink be scarcity reproachful look at father when be obliged to refuse request almost broke heart not must be understood that be limited to same quantity of water a others men always excepting mr dale preferred to suffer in heightened

have resulted in dreadful deprivation terrible increase of suffering to winning helpless little creature therefore at last contented with pouring whole of daily allowance of water into may bottle cheerfully submitted for innocent sake to endure torture of damned reader have ever experienced torment of thirst while exposed in open boat to blazing ray of pitiless sun have not then thank god for earnestly pray that never may for none can realise even faintly imagine intensity of suffering who have borne woman from whom be of course impossible to conceal circumstance may be receiving more than own share of food water be anxious to follow example of male companion by also setting apart portion of own allowance for use of child be at once decidedly vetoed yet be not so easily to be deterred from generous disposition many sip many morsel must ill be spared did poor little child receive from sympathetic loving hand after storm come calm say proverb truth be fully borne out in present instance on fourth day after casting off from wreckage wind began to drop by sunset have fallen so light that launch have barely steerage way be still misfortune for if calm continued must seriously delay progress thereby protract suffering next to gale of wind indeed calm consequent delay be what have most to dread for be in part of ocean little frequented by craft of description except stray whaler now then only reasonable hope of salvation rested upon possibility of being able to reach land before starvation thirst overcame mr bowles have first watch bob be posted at now useless helm wind have subsided until be faint a breath of sleeping infant boat sail flapped gently against mast a rode with scarcely perceptible swinging motion over long stately slow moving swell followed vast blue black dome of heaven above be devoid of faintest trace of cloud countless star spangled immeasurable vault beamed down upon tiny waif with soft mellow splendour be repeated in dark bosom of scarcely ruffled ocean where reflected starbeams mingled far down in mysterious depth with occasional faint gleam flash of pale greenish phosphorescent light thin golden crescent of young moon hung low down in velvety darkness of western sky long thin thread of amber radiance streamed from horizon beneath toward boat becoming more more wavering broken up a neared until within twenty fathom of launch dwindled away to mere occasional fluttering gleam great solemn silence prevailed upon such slight sound a flap of sail pattering of reef point creak of rudder stir of uneasy sleeper broke with almost painful distinctness mr bowles drew out watch holding close to face discovered that be few minute past midnight for previous half hour have be sitting on deck near bob with leg dangling into little cockpit abaft stern sheet staring in abstracted fashion astern a replaced watch in pocket glanced once more in direction now look suddenly grew intense eager for full minute remained thus then withdrew from becket beneath seat long powerful telescope adjusted levelled for full minute gazed anxiously through tube then handing to bob to hold crept silently forward so a not to disturb sleeping woman quietly called relief watch well mr bowles said captain a rose to foot what weather have have be there wind at very little sir answered chief mate replying to last question first just cat paw from west'ard bow then nothing worth speaking about be be same through watch want to take squint through glass before turn in sir to tell whether have be dreaming with eye open why what be bowles do think have seen anything well yes do sir answered mate be so very indistinct in starlight care to trust to own eye alone without word pair moved aft when be fairly settled in cockpit mr bowles took glass from bob put into skipper hand then looked intently astern for perhaps minute when laid hand on skipper arm said d 'ye see two star sir about couple of hand breadth to south'ard of moon be about six degree above horizon lower one be southernmost of two have reddish gleam almost like ship port light yes replied skipper see mean do not pointing to ay ay sir be two now look at horizon just way between 'em tell if can see anything skipper looked long steadfastly in desired direction at length raised telescope to eye by jove bowles believe be right at length exclaimed eagerly there certainly be something away there on horizon be so small indistinct can not clearly make out do think be of other boat sir answered bowles if be anything be ship royal if be one of boat 'd be within five mile of for to be able to see at at distance sail must show out sharp distinct through glass show a say so indistinctly that must be much more than distance away therefore say that if be anything be ship royal skipper took long steady look through telescope then closing sharply said there be undoubtedly something astern of bowles under circumstance think will be fully justified in hauling wind for hour two in order to satisfy a to what really be mr bowles fully concurred in opinion boat be accordingly at once brought to wind what little there be of on starboard tack brought object about two point on weather bow if be indeed ship bowles observed captain staunton when boat course have be changed mate be preparing to go below a phrased have dropped in for rare piece of luck for to tell plain truth have hope whatever of falling in with craft of description about here will be whaler of course be long way north of usual fishing ground be well returned bowles meditatively can never tell where may fall in with one of chap follows fish see sometimes here sometimes there just where think will have best chance then have heard say that sometimes if happen to hit upon particularly likely spot such a small uninhabited island where there be chance of good sport will put boat crew ashore there with boat harpoon line stock of provision two three hundred empty barrel just to try luck like for month so go away on cruise coming back for 'em in due time often finding with barrel full perhaps yon craft be up to something of sort may be so returned captain staunton indeed in probability be so if eye have not deceived at event be be pretty sure of hearty welcome even not over clean whaler will be welcome change for hand especially for lady from boat particularly now that provision be getting low have doubt will be able to make arrangement with captain to carry to valparaiso with a little delay a possible ay ay returned bowles expect there will be much trouble about only hope will be able to get alongside must stand on too long on tack if be sir opinion be that be coming way if so ought to tack in good time so a not to let slip past to windward across bow good night sir night being so fine with so little wind captain staunton took tiller ordered rest of watch to lie down again there be nothing to do said if required assistance must call accordingly in very short time be only waking individual in launch others be only too glad of opportunity to forget a far a possible misery in sleep be of course scarcely necessary to say that skipper a sat there keeping lonely watch fixed gaze with scarcely moment intermission on part of horizon where mysterious object have be seen allowed full hour to pas then drawing out glass applied to eye sweeping horizon carefully from dead ahead round to windward have not to seek far for when tube of telescope pointed to within about three point of starboard bow small dark blot swept into field of view yes there be quite unmistakably time single moment observation of satisfied anxious watcher that saw before royal topgallant sail of vessel apparently of very great size fact that stranger topgallant sail have risen above horizon within hour since have last looked at be conclusive proof to mind that craft be standing toward that in fact be approaching other though at very low rate of speed in consequence of exceedingly light air of wind be blowing fully satisfied upon point at once put boat helm down came slowly heavily about captain easily working sheet by four bell captain staunton be able to discern with naked eye shadowy patch of darkness stranger canvas made on dusky line of horizon when called mr bowles at eight bell four o'clock in morning patch have become darker larger more clearly defined lay about one point before weather beam of launch telescope be once more called into requisition now showed not only royal topgallant sail also topsail of stranger fairly above horizon thank god for welcome sight exclaimed chief mate laying down telescope reverently lifting hat from head remained silent minute two then raising eye allowed glance to travel round horizon overhead until have swept entire expanse of star spangled heaven then with sigh of intense relief said be right do verily believe sir there be craft plain a mud in wine glass bearing right down upon very nearly so have only to stand on a be going will cross track there be very little wind be true trifle that there be be drawing together be nearing other minute there be sign of change of weather unless may happen to be that present light air will die away altogether with sunrise fancy know what be thinking of sir be half inclined to say out oar let get alongside a soon a possible be just what must say if there be sign of breeze springing up there ai ca run away from therefore what say be launch be heavy boat be hand of a weak a cat be about six mile off now must knock up to pull even short distance whereas if go on a be will drop alongside without trouble by eight bell maybe trifle earlier if wind must die away altogether will be time enough then to see what can do with oar be exactly way have be arguing with ever since called bowles returned skipper be true that be suffering horribly from thirst in way moment be of value to on other hand everybody except two self be now asleep oblivious for time being of suffering let sleep on say toil of tugging at heavy oar excitement of knowing that sail be at hand must only increase tenfold suffering without helping forward very great deal so think with that have better let thing remain a be for hour two can rouse hand at moment must seem desirable to do so now if will take tiller will just stretch out on plank here close at hand must not sleep now if whole world be offered to do so saying skipper suited action to word mate continuing chat carefully pitching voice in so low tone that lady close at hand must not be disturbed in slumber by by sky began to pale in eastern quarter star quietly twinkled out one by one bright rosy flush appeared then up rolled glorious sun above horizon wind light night have be imperceptibly dying away when sun rose bright beam flashed upon sea whose surface be smooth a oil launch lost way altogether refused longer to answer helm a for stranger there be just hull down snowy canvas gleaming in brilliant morning sunshine so clearly defined that rippling fold in sail be distinctly visible a flapped against mast to lazy roll of vessel over long sleepy swell now said captain staunton will rouse steward make prepare serve out first rate breakfast to hand then hey for pull to ship be accordingly done breakfast be prepared great matter of meal be after though last scrap of provision last drop of water went in composition when be ready cramped hungry voyager be roused with good news that sail be in sight meal placed before frugal a be be sumptuous banquet compared with late fare poor famished creature devoured ravenously feeling when be finished that must have disposed of thrice a much perhaps be just a well that there be more in condition moderately full meal even must have proved injurious to if

for second bidding in instant dozen of sprang into boat brig gangway be opened boat crew be somewhat sullenly assisted up side of brig on to deck black bearded man met a came up side held out hand to captain staunton morning straanger repeated be powerful glad to see thank returned skipper can assure be at least equally glad to see to find once more with deck beneath foot what ship be may ask by what name will call gentleman who have given so kind reception brig called albatross name be johnson at service be american cruiser presume continued captain staunton looking first at beautifully kept deck then more doubtfully at gang of desperado who crowded round sorter briefly replied man who have called johnson reply seemed for reason to mightily tickle crew most of whom burst into hearty guffaw captain staunton glanced round upon with such stern surprise that fellow fell back pace two skipper of brig first darting furious glance upon follower led way aft to cabin saying sorter waited breakfast when made out through glass that be shipwrecked crew calculatin ' prob'ly 'd be glad to find yourselves in front of good square meal crew will have to make at home in fo'ks'le if lad treat properly why must just knock down people be trifle orkard to deal with at first guess will pull together first rate arter while chapter ten captain johnson explains cabin of albatross be much larger apartment than one must have expected to find in craft of size be about twenty foot long eighteen foot broad occupying entire width of ship state room of there be two only being outside cabin at foot of companion staircase apartment be well lighted very airy light air being admitted not only through skylight also through stern port dead light fitted into side of ship fitting be extremely rich though somewhat out of harmony with other conveying to captain staunton educated eye idea that have be collected at odd time from number of other ship rudder case for example be inclosed in piece of elaborate carved gilded work representing trunk branch of palm tree have apparently be found too large section have accordingly be cut down to make fit result being that carving did not match at junction trunk of tree have also be cut off rather clumsily at base fitted badly to cabin floor while branch have be cut through in place where beam crossed ceiling have be nailed on again in such way

eye notwithstanding recent meal on board launch be chiefly attracted to cabin table whereon be spread on not over clean table cloth abundant display of plate substantial yet appetising meal to host urged to do full justice setting good example for short time while host guest be taking keen edge off appetite very little be said at length however captain johnson looked up addressing captain staunton said waal stranger a said before be real glad to see yours be first friendly face have looked upon for many long day guess be considerable troubled what to do with all see accommodation be sorter limited there be plenty of room for men in fo'ks'le here be le than ten of reckonin ' piccaninny bless dear purty little face wish 'd give kiss four year ago left just such on wharf at new york kissin ' hand to wavin ' good bye a cast off moorin guess will never see sweet face ag'in at mother suggestion little may slid down off locker on be perched somewhat reluctantly went to man chair held up little mouth for kiss johnson at once bent down taking on knee gazed long eagerly into bright young face uplifted to own in childish curiosity then kissed eagerly three four time stroked curly head tenderly with great brown hand finally burst out see here purty little dearie if e'er one of great rough men on deck there say bad word to dare to a much a look unkind at tell curse if beg pardon stranger guess did know just then what be talking about run along little 'un get breakfast child at once slid down from knee with little haste returned to former place by mother side johnson gaze following abstractedly be speaking about inconvenience to appearance seems likely to put at length suggested captain staunton guess not stranger retorted pulling together a be with jerk be simply p'inting out that accommodation for passenger be kinder limited be puzzled to know where can stow away inconvenience will be yourn stranger not mine there be reason see why must keep possession of own cabin there be reason too why mate must keep possession of his'n reckon best plan will be to clear away place for down in after hold where must try make yourselves a comfortable a can for few day will be on board a for lady 'd sorter advise to stay below can if must go on deck at let be at night time when there ai so much chance of bein ' seen where be bound captain inquired skipper waal be bound now to island a be not shown on chart have christened albatross island ' arter brig be goin ' there to refit be reply then presume have established sort of depot there interrogated captain staunton be just have hit exactly stranger answered yankee how long will take to refit be next question maybe week maybe month just depends upon whether hand be in working humour captain staunton raised eyebrow somewhat at singular answer after moment two of silence said presume must find difficulty in running across to say valparaiso if be well paid for service cash down captain staunton be about to say yes having saved from burning ship bag of specie sufficient in amount to convey entire party home in perfect comfort idea struck that must perhaps be better to promise payment after rather than before performance of service so said well must not promise must draw on owner for amount of passage money pay immediately on arrival at valparaiso waal guess will have to think over remarked johnson must go on deck now kin remain here a long a like in fact reckon 'd better stay here altogether until can get place arranged for below saying abruptly rose from table went on deck rather unique specimen of genus yankee observed rex a soon a host have fairly disappeared hope captain will succeed in persuading to take over to mainland skipper be apparently plunged deep in thought for made reply doe not strike bowles that there be something rather peculiar about craft crew remarked lance yankee be generally queer lot answered mate nonchalantly immediately afterwards made sudden stealthy movement of finger to lip while lady be looking in direction throwing at same time expression of so much caution mystery into glance that lance made attempt to continue conversation shortly afterwards captain staunton rose from seat at table touching chief mate lightly on shoulder said come bowles let go on deck see if can make term with captain johnson rest of have perhaps better follow gentleman advice in meantime remain here since evidently have motive for expressing wish a two be ascending companion ladder skipper turned whispered hurriedly to mate what be opinion of thing in general bowles ca say yet answered that individual look mighty queer though ai man o ' war be certain on reaching deck found after hatch off host in somewhat hot discussion with ship carpenter be quite sufficient heard say without trace of yankee twang in speech have order see that be executed forthwith in matter intend to have own way man muttered something in sullen undertone then turned to go forward saying must get tool set about job at once johnson turned impatiently away from with ugly frown upon brow however vanished in instant upon finding two friend at elbow see here stranger said passing arm within of captain staunton drawing toward hatchway want to show what be going to do see beam waal be going to send hand down below to trim few of bale see there up level with top of beam then will lay couple of thickness of planking over will make tol'able floor then be going to have sail nailed fore aft to deck beam dividing space into two one for woman folk one for men sail hung athwart ship will make sorter snug private guess will have to make yourselves a comfortable a can down there see brig small party large one guess be best can do for thank said captain staunton a far a men be concerned can manage perfectly well down there be afraid will be rather comfortless berth for lady yet see very well what else can be done unless indeed must come to arrangement by chief mate must be induced to surrender cabin altogether for use ca johnson broke in sharply tell stranger ai to be done reckon be fool to let come aboard here at be seein little girl of yours did added voice at once softening again guess there be going to be trouble about yet before done oh hope not returned skipper why must there be trouble with whom certainly not with waal hope not said johnson reckon will have to do just exactly a say stranger tell will not answer for consequence assuredly will observed captain staunton a for inconvenience must put up with a best can only hope will not be compelled to intrude upon hospitality for great length of time indeed might rid of presence in fortnight by running across to valparaiso think must make worth while to do so johnson turned away walked thoughtfully fore aft with chin sunk upon breast evidently in painful thought for ten minute then rejoined pair have left standing at hatchway said see here stranger reckon be use to mince matter go beating about bush thing got to come out sooner later so may a well know worst at once must give up notion of going to valparaiso because thing ai to be done be crew of free trader rover pirate if term will serve to make matter more clear to although have only be cruising in water about six month guess have made thing too hot here for to venture into port one be bound to there will be put ashore calculate will have to make yourselves useful at depot there be plenty of work to be done there not too many to do so will be valuable there wo keep on board here because can see 'd never work with be anything else anxiety to there ca do harm take advice stranger cut up rough go slow sing small when get there because chief mate who be greek be in charge there be powerful short tempered man apt to make thing downright uncomfortable for please captain staunton bowles looked other in face for full minute too much overcome by consternation dismay to utter single word then skipper recovering turned to johnson who stood by intently watching said thank sir for having come to point put position thus explicitly before with so little waste of time happily evil be not yet irreparable can never be anything source of anxiety disquietude to a have already admitted therefore trust will allow to return to boat a came by act will relieve of very great embarrassment at same time give chance very slight one be true of arriving at place be so anxious to reach too late stranger replied johnson here be here must now stay look over side will see that boat be no longer there be stove cast adrift hour ago even if have still be alongside do think men must let go now that have be aboard of seen strength tell stranger that before must get ten yard from brig must bring broadside to bear upon send to bottom riddled with grape must stop be here reckon will have to stay make best of will find trap down below there lad wanted to overhaul guess shamed out of drawing half out of pocket pair of revolver a spoke be to consider a prisoner then to look upon hold there a jail inquired captain staunton be a please retorted johnson so long a keep quiet attempt trick can come on deck a often a like only let woman folk show will get into trouble wo be able to help 'em tell to stay in cabin until be dark to night then when quiet watch below in hammock watch on deck caulking ' between gun just muffle up get down there a quick a ever can what about rest of people of who be sent forward to forecastle inquired captain staunton waal replied johnson felt sorter obliged to clap in iron down in fore hold see muster pretty strong party though must never take brig from did know what might be tempted to try when found out truth so just to prevent accident have iron slipped on to 'em will be well treated though if of like to jine so much better be uncommon short handed one way if like to jine will just be put ashore with to work at depot see here stranger go for to try on trick here ashore will be awful bad for be friendly warning mind 'd like to make friend with folk for to tell solid petrified truth ai got one single friend among hand mate hate must be glad to put out of way step into shoe be made men distrust why not retire from altogether then inquired captain staunton because ca answered johnson be outlaw dare not show face anywhere in whole civilised world for fear of being recognised hanged a pirate decidedly unpleasant position to be in remarked skipper however if there be way in can lawfully help will do so in return for will of course expect to be treated well by now bowles continued turning to chief mate let talk matter over discus manner in bad news can best be broken to others saying with somewhat cold formal bow to pirate captain staunton linked arm in of chief mate walked away two promenaded deck for nearly hour overhauling concern in bearing a bowles afterwards described finally came to conclusion that must be only fair to let companion in misfortune know worst at once then must take counsel together a in multitude of counsellor there be one might possibly hit upon happy idea whereby might be enabled to escape from new strait accordingly descended to cabin where reappearance have be anxiously looked for well captain exclaimed dale upon entrance what news have for have made arrangement for conveyance to valparaiso hope be not going to be kept cooped up very long in wretched little vessel be to leave sooner than anticipated replied captain staunton regret to say have be quite unable to make arrangement of satisfactory character a to news must ask to prepare yourselves for worst almost worst that must possibly hear be on board pirate in hand of a unscrupulous set of rascal a one must well encounter skipper then proceeded to describe in extenso interview with pirate captain throwing out such idea a presented to in course of narrative winding up by pointing out to that though situation be serious enough be not altogether desperate pirate leader being evidently anxious to escape from present position a evidently disposed to look with friendly eye upon who might seem to have in power to assist directly indirectly in attainment of purpose first endeavour said in conclusion must be to impress upon man that though be prisoner be still power by reason of number a well a of superior intelligence knowledge of world that can certainly help if have opportunity idea once firmly established in mind will listen to very possibly fall in with of suggestion of suppose need hardly say must be made with single eye to own ultimate escape future be beset by difficulty very few of can even anticipate a yet think if one will only take hopeful view of situation will be singular indeed if one of doe not hit upon mean of escape by time that have finished speaking brain of hearer be literally teeming with idea be to say except mr dale who with elbow on table head buried in hand hair rumpled abandoned to despair to loud bewailings of unfortunate combination of circumstance led to venturing upon treacherous ocean others however knew thoroughly by time none troubled to take slightest notice of except rex fortescue who exclaimed do shut up dale cease making fool of wonder that be not ashamed to behave in unmanly way especially before lady too if ca keep quiet know will have to put on deck where fancy must get something worth howling about threat have desired effect mr dale subsided into silence rest of party at once in low cautious tone began interchange of idea lasted long time brought forth very satisfactory result council finding at close of discussion pretty much where be at commencement at one o'clock thoroughly substantial dinner be served to followed by tea at six in evening at of meal pirate captain did honour with manifest desire to evince friendly disposition toward guest about nine pm quiet unobtrusive removal from cabin to new quarter in after hold be effected after most of party disposed comfortably upon bedding found have be provided for enjoyed night of thoroughly sound repose such a have be stranger to ever since destruction of galatea when friend awoke on following morning became aware by motion of ship sound of water gurgling along side that breeze have sprung up most of gentleman of in fact except dale went on deck finding watch busy washing deck borrowed of few bucket with gave other most hearty refreshing salt water douche much to amusement of crew a soon a breakfast be over lance with cool insouciance characteristic of man who have so often found environed by peril that cease to think of went again on deck with intention of mingling freely with pirate crew if possible placing upon such easy term with a must give opportunity of acquiring information might be in power to give first individual saw on emerging from hatchway be johnson pirate captain who be leaning moodily over lee rail abaft main rigging smoking well seasoned pipe good morning captain exclaimed lance genially a sauntered up to man what delightful morning how good tobacco smell have not enjoyed luxury of pipe for last fortnight have tobacco to spare help stranger answered johnson rather surlily a tendered tobacco pouch thanks said lance returning pouch after have filled lighted pipe ah how good be a took first whiff two have fine breeze after yesterday calm brig seems quite traveller in small way in small way exclaimed johnson indignantly why be flyer stranger be what be reckon know much about ship must talk like guess ai sailor be be soldier by profession answered lance for be not exactly unmitigated land lubber on contrary be quite enthusiastic yachtsman flatter know good model when see one yet take much account of brig stranger seems good enough little craft of kind admitted lance a mere trader have doubt must answer well enough strike that to gentleman of profession really fast powerful vessel be absolute necessity if must insure own safety in weather like daresay must manage tolerably well if frigate be by chance to fall in with in fresh breeze worse still in heavy weather fear must find yourselves in tight place must have under gun in le than hour be so stranger yes reckon be so conceded johnson with evident reluctance there be ship a can outsail know for have fallen in with dozen clipper must hing with 'em just walked away from though calculate that there be ever frigate afloat a must get alongside tea ship if tea ship did want to yet guess there be frigate a must overhaul in heavy weather so be yachtsman eh then reckon know something about quick sailing how fast now do calculate yacht must sail in breeze depends entirely upon build model of craft if be racing schooner of say tonnage of brig daresay speed under such circumstance a must be thirteen perhaps fourteen knot if however be merely cruising yacht such a own imagine must average more than eleven eleven knot jeosh say stranger how many knot do reckon be making just now exclaimed johnson lance looked over side for moment marked piece of weed floating past then answered about eight must think certainly not more guess be wrong stranger returned pirate skipper with animation be going ten if be going inch can easily test by heaving log suggested lance aft here two of heave log shouted johnson two men came sauntering aft at call line glass be prepared johnson made ready to test speed of brig turn cried to man who held glass a last of stray passed out over taffrail glass be smartly turned reel spun rapidly round mark flew through johnson finger countenance brightened with exultation stop sand have run out johnson grasped line just before eighth knot reached hand tarnation be right stranger angrily exclaimed waal swan made sure be going ten at very least skipper very often make kind of mistake remarked lance rather be not so much mistake a self deception must like ship to have speed of ten knot in such weather a wish be father to thought besides having formed attachment for ship be naturally anxious to give stranger also favourable impression of be so stranger sure a be standin there have exactly hit knew craft be doin ' over eight at outside way talked about yacht of yours sorter put back up 'lowed be goin ' to let have big talk to yourself about yacht of yours colonel where be now where left doubt answered lance with smile safe sound on mud of haslar creek inside portsmouth suppose a be such flyer that one of crack english builder put together inquired johnson indeed said lance be built at weymouth by ordinary shipbuilder who for aught know have never in life built yacht before be stationed there at time designed myself of course superintended construction say waal knew that soldier did most everything did 'low that designed yacht exclaimed johnson do professionally admitted lance of of whom happen to be one take up study of naval architecture a amusement who like belong to engineer corp be to extent qualified by technical education to achieve excellence in art can assure that of officer in corp have turned out exceedingly creditable craft waal now that beat ah exclaimed johnson so be engineer can design yacht into bargain stranger laying hand impressively on lance arm be real glad took aboard about schooner of yours be schooner reckon lance nodded affirmative waal about schooner of yours be pretty sea boat be a comfortable vessel a must ever wish to have under foot answered lance with just slight touch of enthusiasm will face weather frigate must dare to look at in gale of wind such a once caught in bay of biscay be great deal drier more comfortable than many frigate must be waal now call real interesting exclaimed johnson with sparkling eye s'pose be tol'able weatherly about same a other vessel of class yacht know if be least worthy name go to windward well be one of strong point do think now colonel must recollect enough to design yacht just like own schooner asked johnson eagerly well said lance slowly a first began to perceive direction in johnson thought be tending be by mean sure must however a brilliant idea dawned upon be certain that with experience have gained since designed fleetwing must build one must excel in respect waal now be what call real pleasant conversation exclaimed johnson with enthusiasm now see here colonel guess will get to draw out design right away be sure will be very pleased said lance why do wish for such thing will surely not venture after what have already told to visit civilised port order vessel to be built guess not stranger have three prize lyin ' in harbour not far off kept thinkin might come in useful day will break up to build new craft will superintend work a be engineer reckon will get to fortify harbour also so be to make thing secure in case one of frigate be talking about must come along take fancy to look inside very well said lance will do what can in matter of fortifying harbour building new craft upon express condition however must understand that be treated well a long a remain with that will make early opportunity to free a soon a work be done be afraid stranger returned johnson do best can for guess will do right thing by be bargain there be just one point occurs to remarked lance be to do what propose will require great deal of assistance now where be to find if be men mean reckon will find plenty of 'em at albatross island men ai always to be picked up at sea just when be wanted said johnson so have took to keepin prisoner alive landing there so can draw upon when want to have found that if wo cut in take hand with exactly to oncet genwilly will little later on just to escape bein ' worked to death ashore what about material persisted lance to construct battery to make serviceable know stone lime iron wood in considerable quantity be required to say nothing of gun powder shot with to arm battery when be finished have got exclaimed johnson be exceptin ' iron that be very short of there be stone in island guess can make lime from coral ca a to gun ammunition why be only three month ago that helped to whole battery full belonging to spaniard away there on mainland well said lance can not of course decide exactly how to use resource to best advantage until have seen place a far however a design of new ship be concerned can set about at once must ask however to release carpenter bob apprentice to allow to join aft carpenter be practical man whose advice assistance will be most valuable to a for bob have be brought up in district famous for yacht building will be sure to prove helpful to very well colonel reckon can have 'em said johnson only be persuaded to try trick on account of having two extra hand because if do calculate will find always ready right laughed lance will keep warning advice in mind by by before go below let suggest that a few of be like smoker pound so of tobacco now then must be regarded a delicate attention on part right be colonel answered johnson cordially will have terbacker cigar too if like guess have got plenty of on board so saying johnson turned upon heel dived below for sextant chapter eleven johnson hoodwinks frigate left to lance sauntered aft glanced first at binnacle then at sail finally essayed conversation with helmsman man proved at first to be exceedingly surly suspicious taciturn lance evelin be man of consummate tact manner be at once so refined so genial that there be very few who must for length of time withstand fascinating influence in le than hour have so won upon man who be by mean bad that everything approaching to reserve have completely vanished when johnson came on deck after working out sight found strangely assorted pair conversing a freely together a though have be old shipmate lance be very careful to confine conversation to generality religiously abstained from asking question quite realised that party to belonged be in position of great difficulty danger escape from if indeed must ever escape at must certainly be work of time demanding utmost caution patience first endeavour therefore be to create favourable impression rather than to risk suspicion by too early attempt to acquire information when johnson saw two in conversation at once edged way aft with evident intention of ascertaining what be talking about although lance at once noted movement made mental memorandum to effect that pirate skipper be clearly man of suspicious temperament gave outward sign of having observed such thing simply continued conversation a unrestrainedly a though johnson have not be there lance remained on deck until dinner time be pm on board albatross when rejoined friend below well said a seated at rough deal table have be knocked together for accommodation have spent very pleasant hope very profitable morning on deck have remarked captain staunton be glad to hear that be beginning to wonder what have become of have be doing merely ingratiating with skipper man whose trick happened to be at wheel answered lance flatter that for first attempt have managed pretty well have be obliged to blow own trumpet little be true by judicious performance upon instrument have succeeded in showing friend johnson very clearly that be in power to be of greatest possible service to have secured order to build new ship for to fortify harbour in be to be built to build new ship for exclaimed captain staunton to fortify harbour ejaculated rex brook together precisely that gentleman continued lance happened accidentally to touch upon rather sore point with by disparaging speed of brig evidently wished to persuade be almost matchless then gently insinuated to that must be very awkwardly situated if happened to find in presence of frigate in heavy weather finally mentioned to in casual way fact have designed built yacht of own must sail round brig in weather also happened to be by profession military engineer result of be a have already stated there be one other result by bye have secured release of friend robert also carpenter daresay will be allowed to join time to day well remarked captain staunton be advantage certainly man can secure make so much stronger perhaps if must get one two more something might be done in second night watch might possibly be able to take brig interrupted lance with laugh not to be thought of for single moment dear sir friend johnson be far too suspicious man have too much at stake to give such opportunity if watchfulness on part can prevent why have already anticipated possibility of such attempt on part be good enough to caution that must always find ready um ejaculated skipper meditatively be bad news have evidently difficult man to deal with have heard said more than once that man who can circumvent yankee can circumvent father of mischief about ship building fortification business do understand that regard johnson plan in respect a favourable to because if so must be very glad if must explain must admit that at present can scarcely see how be likely to derive advantage from well remarked lance must understand at present plan be of crudest description will require great deal of maturing before can be put into successful operation in anticipate that will all be able to afford greatest assistance roughly however idea be must choose if possible for ship building spot be not only suitable for purpose will also admit of being effectually defended by battery be to be built must secure a assistant a many a possible of own men when ship be built launched must contrive somehow to seize make escape in plan will admit involve many month detention here be only feasible way of escape have so far presented to mind conversation with johnson morning have convinced that have nothing to hope for from be glad to have will possibly be civil to because of ability to be of service to can see that be unscrupulous rascal who will freely make promise in order to secure aid co operation unhesitatingly break moment that end be served be busily engaged in discussion of lance project when hail be heard from aloft did not quite catch word gruff voice of brig chief mate ordering crew to make sail caused to surmise that ship have just be sighted first impulse of male in party be to rush on deck captain staunton immediately resumed seat again requested others to do so likewise pointing out that too eager curiosity on part respecting movement of brig must possibly only provoke suspicion resentment against in breast of pirate that there must be ample opportunity later on for to see how matter stood accordingly resumed discussion upon have be engaged be shortly afterwards interrupted by appearance of johnson steward who descended hatchway ladder bearing couple of box of cigar dozen stick of excellent tobacco with cap'ns compliment afforded excellent opportunity for going on deck in thoroughly natural way who smoked accordingly cut up quantity of tobacco filling pipe adjourned to deck in body for purpose of enjoying post prandial smoke johnson be standing aft near man at wheel with one eye aloft other in binnacle looked fierce excited took notice whatever of party who have just made appearance on deck feature wore so forbidding expression that be at once patent to everybody that best plan just then must be to leave entirely alone first thing noticed be that brig have be kept away off former course be now running to leeward with wind on quarter canvas have be rapidly packed upon be now slipping very fast through water with topgallant topmast lower studding sail set to windward rest of canvas fore aft a well a square tugging at like cart horse a afterwards appeared be favourite point of sailing that sail be in sight be perfectly evident nothing must be seen of from deck though horizon be perfectly clear round be therefore rather difficult at first to ascertain whereabouts did not long remain so for in about five minute mate came on deck with sextant in hand suspending instrument very carefully from neck by piece of stout marline at once made way up main rigging finally settled comfortably in cross tree facing aft bringing telescope of sextant at once to bear upon object seemed to lie about couple of point on lee quarter craft in sight must therefore be astern of brig mate movement clearly indicated that be in chase that be very anxious to ascertain ship gained upon other instrument apparently after being carefully adjusted be removed from mate eye suspended from cross tree in such manner that must not strike against mast of rigging with roll of ship then observer drew forth pipe filled proceeded to smoke with greatest apparent calmness contentment pipe be at length finished then smoker with same deliberation have characterised former movement once more applied sextant to eye well shouted johnson what news of stranger aloft there gaining on hand over fist be reply will do then may a well come down snarled pirate skipper staying perched up there like owl in ivy bush wo help come down make useful d hear ay ay answered mate be coming bos forthwith proceeded to descend rigging in careless nonchalant manner evidently drove superior almost to verge of frenzy hour passed then there appeared far away on horizon on brig lee quarter tiny white speck steadily though imperceptibly increased in size until snowy royal of large ship stood fully revealed be about half past three in afternoon at time wind showed sign of failing by half past four o'clock stranger have risen topgallant sail above horizon must clearly be seen even with unaided eye that have royal a well a topgallant studding sail set there must not be shadow of doubt that be after brig spirit of friend rose to such high pitch of exultation at agreeable sight that found difficult to conceal delight when johnson abandoning post near helmsman joined well stranger remarked with grim smile there be chance for yet see be one of cursed frigate be talking about morning colonel be tarnation sight smarter'n gave of 'em credit for being tell cap'n if have be forenoon watch instead of first dog watch must have be up with brig now feel quite so sorter anxious a did reckon that unless breeze freshens ai going to do will take craft till midnight to get alongside of if can do then why be welcome to brig aboard of curse if ai see cloud gathering away there to nor'ard be thunder storm working up wo break for hour yet calculate cloud be going to do good turn before reckon will have to make up mind to go to albatross island yet stranger dived below to cabin evidently in easier state of mind than have enjoyed hour before by six o'clock frigate topsail have risen more than height above horizon when lance captain staunton bowles returned to deck after evening meal waning light just enabled to see stranger lower yard fairly clear of water before lost sight of altogether half course have risen into view night closed down very dark there being moon sky be entirely overspread with heavy black murky looking thunder cloud completely hid star wind too have dropped to extent that occasional ominous flap be heard from canvas aloft though brig still slid through water at rate of about four knot in hour johnson be in high spirit again sat aft near taffrail attentively watching frigate through night glass long after have disappeared from naked eye when at last became difficult to make out even with aid of glass must lay down rub eye take dozen turn along deck then pick up glass again have spell at finally turned to mate who be standing near tendering glass said there take look ben tell if can pick out mate peered long attentively through telescope moving very slowly about part of horizon where knew frigate to be without success be go bos said eye be pretty good be not good enough to see through such darkness a johnson chuckled do think said look lighter ahead must sail show against cloud bank in wake of fore mast not answered mate confidently why be darker if anything ahead than be astern be so agreed johnson with chuckle now what continued what do think be last thing skipper of frigate did before darkness closed down well said mate if knew business must say must take bearing may take oath be exactly what did returned johnson now take look round tell what think of weather weather repeated mate why child almost must tell what weather going to be be going to have thunder will bring northerly breeze along with while last capital exclaimed johnson do think now that captain of man o war astern be of same opinion a be about weather be certain to be if be seaman be reply now once more proceeded johnson supposing thought of giving frigate slip a might very easily do dark night what course must steer must steer to nor'ard answered mate so a to be to wind'ard when change come knew exclaimed johnson delightedly be dead certain of now be going to give frigate slip by steering to south'ard because skipper will argue a do when find be lost run of will haul up to nor'ard directly now just pas word for carpenter to bring along water cask ordered to rig up afternoon word be passed in minute two three men came aft bearing what appeared to be water cask with pole passed down through bung hole right out through other side about six foot of pole projecting on side of cask to one end of pole be lashed short light batten to other end men now proceeded to secure small pig of iron ballast done whole be launched overboard from taffrail cask floating bung up with pole light batten standing perpendicularly above like mast to upper end of batten be lashed old horn lantern with lighted candle in after whole apparatus be suffered to go adrift now in stunsails brace sharp up on port tack ordered johnson be soon done brig now feeling full strength of what little wind there be seemed to slip along through water quite a fast a before johnson looked away out over weather quarter to where beacon lantern glimmered in intense darkness there said will perhaps help to mislead bit will take for binnacle light will keep straight on till run over then finding have played trick will haul straight up to nor'ard thinking have gone way too will soon be out of sight of one johnson kept gaze intently fixed upon tiny light a long a remained visible to naked eye when must no longer be seen in fashion deliberately set to watch through night glass more than hour have elapsed since cask have be sent adrift before manifested sign of emotion at length began to chuckle audibly now be nearing murmured with eye glued to tube can see craft clearly now have cast loose gun opened port can see light of lantern shining through 'em be creeping up to pretty fast guess have walked away from quite considerable distance too there now have run aboard of tarnation old water barrel know what 't be by time reckon skipper of frigate be ripping tearing cussing going on till air smell of brimstone for quarter of mile round ah just a expected have hauled up to nor'ard stern towards for can see light shining out of cabin window now minute will take further apart waal be glad thought of laying for with old lantern will sorter tell that be having good laugh at 'em wo colonel turning to friend addressing lance in high good humour doubtless have succeeded in greatly provoking if be object replied lance if be in place think must feel quite easy in mind yet if thunder storm have be brewing for so long be to break a may do at moment flash of lightning must be certain to reveal whereabouts to reckon will have to take chance of remarked johnson in more sober tone let keep dark hour longer care how much lightens after ah tarnation look at last ejaculation be provoked by sudden illumination of northern heaven by brilliant flash of sheet lightning revealed not only detail of vast bank of murky cloud lay heaped up a be upon horizon also distinctly showed frigate on very verge still holding steadily northward hull sail standing out sharply like block of ebony against faint bluish gleam of electric light flash soon followed then flash following other with increasing rapidity to johnson manifest discomfiture though be evidently unaware of brig be so far perfectly safe from discovery for lightning continued to flash up only in northern quarter leaving remainder of horizon veiled in impenetrable darkness so though frigate be distinctly revealed to brig brig be completely hidden from frigate lightning however though have not yet shown brig whereabouts have enabled on board frigate to ascertain that be not ahead of a have supposed for when next flash came man o ' war be seen nearly broadside on to brig heading about south west captain having evidently come to conclusion that albatross after setting lure have doubled back like hare upon former course johnson waited until flash came revealing frigate still upon same course then gave order for vessel to be kept away steering time to southward eastward about at right angle to course of frigate ten minute later latter be hull down now be safe ejaculated pirate skipper delightedly clew up furl everything lad be smart about for in five minute will have lightning flashing round under bare pole guess will take sharp eye to pick out waal colonel remarked to lance shortly afterwards reckon be narrer squeak for be if 'd be fool enough to go to nor'ard 'd have have for sure be right smart frigate be guess be yankee britisher build such smart boat a after be bound more 'n ever to have schooner promised to build for for mind owning up began to feel skeered bit when saw how be bein catched up do think now colonel must build schooner must have walked away from frigate oh dear yes answered lance be quite sure must only remember must not be interfered with in way can not have people troubling with suggestion worse still insisting upon grafting idea on to own ship must be exclusively own design then can promise will turn out craft capable if need be of running away from fastest frigate that ever be launched all right colonel trouble about be reply only say what want will be done if anybody try to interfere with just point out to that be very well returned lance then will consider that bargain now will wish good night a think there will be rain shortly have particular fancy for drenching unless come in way of duty following morning dawned bright fair thunder storm of preceding night having broken raged furiously for couple of hour soon after friend left deck then cleared completely away when captain staunton went on deck found fine breeze blowing once more from westward brig dashing along at slashing pace under topgallant sail with nose pointing to northward air be clear transparent not cloud flecked deep blue of sky overhead man who have shinned aloft at johnson order a far a main truck be just in act of reporting that there be nothing anywhere in sight so that lingering hope captain staunton may have entertained a to possibility of frigate rediscovering be speedily dashed to ground fine weather lasted three day afterwards about two o'clock in afternoon look out aloft reported land ho right ahead what be like hailed johnson from seat on skylight be look out peak sir can make out shape of quite well that be right returned johnson stay where be let know if see anything like signal in couple of hour more land be distinctly visible from deck peak spoken of a look out peak appearing first then land on side of rising gradually above ocean brim until lay stretched along horizon for length of half dozen mile a drew in towards island friend of whom excepting lady be on deck half expected to be sent below in order that might not become acquainted with navigation of harbour entrance idea did not appear to have presented to johnson who on contrary joined group began chatting with in what be evidently meant to be understood a affable manner when have approached within mile of place pirate skipper turned to lance asked what thought of harbour whether believed must make tolerably safe with dozen gun so harbour answered lance see harbour sign even of one on part of coast be now approaching can distinguish nothing rocky shore against surf be breaking heavily enough to dash to piece strongest ship be ever built perhaps harbour lie somewhere beyond low rocky point form western extremity of island if so why not steer directly for entrance to harbour be exactly in line with jib boom end just now explained johnson in high good humour guess must never know unless be told must colonel that indeed must not answered lance even now scarcely know how to believe lance might well say so for whole coast line in front of presented apparently unbroken face of rocky cliff of various height from about thirty to two hundred foot backed by grassy slope thickly dotted with dense clump of tree of various kind many of glowed with most brilliant tint from flower with be loaded immediately ahead where johnson have said entrance to harbour lay great irregular mass of low jagged rock projected slightly beyond general face line of cliff behind be gap have appearance of being caused by projecting mass of rock having at remote period broken away slipped into sea brig however continued to stand on boldly when have arrived within about three cable length of shore became apparent that large mass of rock ahead rather on lee bow by time brig having luffed trifle be entirely detached from island leaving narrow channel of water between cliff behind be not until brig have actually borne away to enter channel that entrance to harbour revealed then indeed be seen that cliff behind instead of preserving unbroken face curved inwards in form of cove eastern western arm of consisted of two projecting reef jutting out toward mass of rock in front of in turn now revealed true shape be that of crescent horn of overlapped two projecting reef forming eastern western side of harbour entrance acted a perfect natural breakwater effectually protecting harbour in weather winding way through short narrow channel between rock cliff brig hauled sharply round western point shot into cove harbour consisted of irregularly shaped expanse of water two hundred acre in extent at entrance rock on side sloped steeply down into deep blue water further in be fringed along base by beautiful white sandy beach widened a approached bottom of bay land on side sloping more gradually down to water finally spreading out where water ceased into broad lovely valley stretched inland three mile rising gradually a receded until became lost among group of hill formed background of picture at anchor in bay be three hulk doubt three prize spoken of by johnson a destined to be broken up for building of new craft on grassy plateau at bottom of bay close to beach stood two large building dozen smaller one constructed of wood behind plot of ground two acre in extent be fenced in to form garden very fruitful one proved too if one might judge by luxuriant growth apparent in various product corn of two three kind waved on eastern slope dozen head of cattle perhaps couple of dozen sheep grazed on opposite side of valley cocoa nut reared tall slender stem waved feathery branch by hundred behind again a ground sloped gently upward became more more densely covered with palm banana plantain grove thickly interspersed with various tree of considerable size dense foliage among brilliant orchid gaudy parasite of gayest hue entwined to very summit light gig shot alongside brig a anchor be let go tall swarthy man with unmistakable classic feature of greek stepped on board must have be strikingly handsome man for expression of cunning cruelty glittered in keen black eye well capitan said to johnson a joined pirate skipper so have returned once more with full hold hope people began to think be gone for good have be away so long time yes returned johnson back again alec like bad penny have not brought so very much with little have will be useful daresay brig seem to sail so well a used to fell in with over dozen fine craft that must get near just walked away from like be at anchor have come in now to give old hooker overhaul want badly enough then think will try luck further to east'ard away on t'other side of cape altogether if have brought whole ship load of plunder guess have brought what be most a good picked up boat load of shipwrecked people among there be one tall soldier looking chap over there on larboard side of skylight who say can fortify place for build out of old hulk craft will beat anything be likely to meet 'cepting perhaps steamer say ejaculated greek contemptuously ay can do too remarked johnson be one of english soldier who doe battery building fortifying business have yacht designed sail so fast that did think brig sailing amounted to shuck tell alec way talked about yacht jest set longing did sure a be there now be going to leave here with when sail next time will fortify harbour so will be safe if of sneakin ' men o ' war come pryin ' about be a near took by one of few night ago a near a near will build regular flyer of schooner on condition that be properly treated so a long a work about want to act amiable to 'em after have got help out of 'em that want care what come to 'em have got woman with worst luck seem mighty particular about so hope will see that gal come to harm see alec boy must be civil to 'em if want to do best for after have done work can have own way with whole lot greek whose name by way be alessandro ralli listened to chief in sullen silence when johnson have finished speaking beckoned to follow down into cabin worthy have be standing during short conversation just at foot of main mast seemed to be either oblivious of indifferent to fact that seaman be just over head stowing driver near enough to hear word passed individual referred to have be taking time good deal of too over task sooner be skipper greek fairly out of sight down companion than with few dexterous movement rapidly passed last turn of lashing slid down on deck be old friend bob chapter twelve on albatross island on following morning hand on board brig be stirring early assisted by strong party from shore first moved vessel down to bottom of bay until took ground on beautiful level sandy bottom then began to discharge cargo comprised most extraordinary collection of heterogeneous article including three pianoforte two of be in packing case whilst other have evidently be taken from ship cabin several case of arm large quantity of powder lead bale of silk few keg of spanish dollar fifty ingot of gold a many of silver several case of machinery large boiler in section immense quantity of provision of various kind ten brass nine pounder gun taken out of spanish ship several box of clothing large quantity of new rope bolt of canvas sail from size have evidently never be made for brig case of furniture etcetera etcetera article be landed in boat conveyed with more le difficulty up to one of large building before mentioned there housed there be great jubilation among men at sight of so rich cargo ralli greek quite laying aside former moroseness of manner exhibiting almost childish delight at sight of bullion keg of dollar men worked hard day by sunset more than brig cargo be on shore be not difficult however to detect that among men there be few perhaps dozen who took interest in labour manifesting very little curiosity a to nature of article be handling working solely because have other choice friend rightly conjectured to be prisoner who have not chosen to cast in lot with pirate early in day that portion of party from galatea in be more immediately interested have be conveyed on shore under johnson own protection taken up to one of smaller building stood on beach with intimation that be at liberty to occupy be small two story building constructed of wood upper floor being reached through trap door be led up to by wooden step ladder floor like one below consisted of single room be lighted by two window one at end two longer wall of room being fitted with three tier of bunk similar to found on board ship ground floor be fitted up with fire place shelf round room rough deal table two long bench have evidently be used a general living room place be wretchedly dirty on being inducted into first act of men be to procure abundance of soap water set vigorously to work to give thorough cleansing occupied morning at noon bell rang be signal for hand to knock off work get dinner messman of gang going to galley small building near store drawing from cook sufficient quantity of food for party to belonged bob who with carpenter have be duly liberated according to promise cheerfully took upon duty of messman for party to belonged presenting with others obtained without difficulty wherewithal to set before friend very respectable meal while be at dinner lance tore leaf out of pocket book jotted down various article such a bedding crockery utensil of various kind required on completion of list hurried away with to johnson who at once wrote at foot order to storekeeper for issue of article named be soon conveyed to hut by sunset have place in very tolerable order now that be on shore however felt that time have arrived when little more privacy must be enjoyed by lady of party so few board be obtained with partition knocked up dividing upper room into two equal part half be approached through trap door being devoted to lady while men obtained access to sleeping apartment by mean of ladder open window ladder being drawn up into room at night at six o'clock bell rang again upon hand knocked off work for day after hour devoted to cleaning up etcetera tea supper a most of men termed be served on particular evening however there be slight deviation from usual order of procedure messmen being detained at galley until be present instead of being served despatched in order of arrival when johnson made appearance on scene announced that keg of dollar landed that day from brig must be distributed in capstan house that evening at eight o'clock that of prisoner not yet belonging to brotherhood who chose to present there at hour must sign bond of brotherhood must be entitled to equal share of spoil bob duly mentioned item of information on arrival with viand be at once decided that a pirate must thus be engaged for time advantage must be taken of so favourable opportunity to give lady little fresh air exercise waited until pirate appeared to have betaken to capstan house then sallied out in body upon exploring expedition up valley be lovely night a light a day full moon riding high overhead in unclouded sky so flooding heaven with silvery light only few star of first magnitude be visible there be very little wind heavy dew be falling that after hardship of exposure in open boat be trifle so insignificant that attracted one attention walk be most enjoyable one to be especially delightful to three couple who early paired off together in quiet unostentatious fashion dropped into rear captain mr staunton have naturally much to say to other upon matter interesting only to while a for violet rex blanche lance be first opportunity for exchange of sweet nothing in lover delight since eventful evening on have be driven out by flame from unfortunate galatea tempted by beauty of night strayed long distance when at length returned to hut weary with unaccustomed exercise happier than have be for long time settlement be wrapped in silence of repose on following morning immediately after breakfast johnson presented with request that lance captain staunton carpenter must accompany on visit to prize for purpose of deciding of must be broken up to build new schooner two of vessel be barque one full rigged ship ship be teak built unmistakable east indiaman while of barque one be oak built copper fastened other soft wood vessel put together with iron oak built ship be nearly new copper covered bottom up to bend have not wrinkle on entire surface deck planking showed sign of wear be modelled for carrying rather than for speed be therefore decided without much hesitation that must be one to be broken up next point to be settled be position of building yard lance have given matter great deal of quiet consideration have come to conclusion that for many reason must be better to have yard a far away a possible from rest of settlement one consideration greatly weighed with being possibility that best chance of escape might be in launching schooner on quiet during night taking from stock direct to sea johnson have already made up mind that best site for stock must be on sandy beach immediately in front of capstan house there be great deal to be said in favour of carpenter shop being already in existence close to spot cordage tackle of description being stored in capstan house did not at chime in with lance plan so merely remarked that must do well enough if better place must be found that flatness of ground consequent shoal water at spot must prove serious difficulty in way of launching that must be advisable before deciding to give entire shore of bay very careful examination hour be accordingly spent in work site be at last fixed upon in locality thoroughly favourable to lance secret wish be small indentation in harbour face of breakwater rock marked entrance to bay indentation be about acre half in extent with smooth rocky floor sloping down into water at inclination of just right gradient for launching way be true be long way away from settlement lance argument in favour of adopting be so convincing that johnson be fain to give way at last did with very good grace matter settled lance intimated that must like to devote little more time to examination of rock a appeared to that here be proper place to construct battery be to defend harbour accordingly climbed with great difficulty to highest point of rock be immediately behind to seaward of future shipyard have elevation of nearly hundred foot above sea level top of rock be very irregular in shape lance soon saw that few charge of powder judiciously placed must give nearly circular platform of about sixty foot diameter must be ample space for battery a proposed to construct first idea have be to evade construction of battery altogether if possible little reflection have shown that time might come when existence must be of utmost importance to therefore decided to go on with work accordingly pointed out to johnson strength of position occupied complete command over harbour entrance battery must have at point effective defence must constitute to new shipyard pirate be speedily convinced of soundness of lance view point settled party returned to bottom of bay johnson then invited lance to present at eight o'clock evening in capstan house there to submit plan for new schooner to committee of pirate for approval drawing be in fact scarcely ready by working hard for remainder of day not only be completed carpenter have also prepared half model of hull by hour at committee be to meet armed with lance captain staunton carpenter duly presented at capstan house at eight o'clock be met at door by johnson who conducted up step ladder into apartment in first floor of building be room about sixty foot long by forty foot broad be apparently used a sort of general assembly room being fitted up with row of bench from door right up to platform at further end on platform there stood upon present occasion large table lighted by pair of handsome lamp surrounded by dozen chair of be already occupied when lance companion entered friend quietly seated lance on one side of johnson captain staunton on other with trusty carpenter next johnson then ordered bell to be rung to summon laggard in few minute afterwards entire committee eight men in have assembled johnson then rose to address party remarked that be already aware of purpose for have be summoned namely to inspect plan of new schooner proposed to have built have be led to understand that doubt have be expressed in certain quarter here glanced at ralli a to necessity for proceeding have therefore invited there to meet in order that might lay before view upon matter answer such question a of might wish to put to then cited several unsuccessful chase in have engaged a well a recent narrow escape from frigate a evidence in support of assertion that not only profit actual safety depended upon becoming possessed of much faster vessel than albatross a speedily a might be winding up speech by requesting that man present must give committee benefit of view on matter in hand somewhat excited debate then ensued ralli making especially conspicuous by opposition to johnson in end latter succeeded in carrying point construction of vessel be definitely decided upon lance be then called upon to submit drawing for inspection forthwith did explaining at same time peculiarity of design vessel proposed to build be to have broad willow hull with very deep keel water line be simply faultless there be considerable difference of opinion a to desirability of having vessel of type lance who be anxious above thing to build craft must carry party safely comfortably speedily home provided must be so fortunate a to obtain possession of ably combated adverse criticism in be ably seconded by johnson who seemed greatly taken with design in end have own way important point being settled meeting broke up on following morning first step be taken toward carrying work into execution vessel have be selected for breaking up be unmoored brought close in to shore abreast capstan house where be anchored strong party be then told off for purpose of loading under joint superintendence of lance johnson captain staunton carpenter of galatea who went by name of kit short for christopher lance requisitioned store of pirate with utmost freedom taking everything thought likely to be in least degree useful in way three day be consumed on fourth day hulk be once more unmoored with three boat ahead towed to rock at mouth of harbour grounded upon work of landing store material then commenced when have be conveyed safely ashore erection of workshop etcetera be begun be at period that johnson began to realise for first time how valuable acquisition to band have gained in person of lance rex brooke kit three first be quite in element when came to designing erecting of various building of battery be at same time commenced whilst kit displayed amount of intelligence in carrying out of instruction be beyond praise johnson chuckled with inward satisfaction made certain secret resolve said nothing meanwhile albatross have be careened copper stripped off where necessary replaced after caulking planking underneath copper have be scoured over down to very keel until shone like gold top side have be caulked then deck hull repainted inside out when building at new dockyard be about being begun spar sail rigging of brig be in process of undergoing thorough overhaul looked very much a though albatross must be ready for sea in fortnight at outside while lance estimated that with strength then at command must be at least month before keel of schooner must possibly be laid now johnson have set heart upon seeing done before sailed when therefore found that must be impossible unless strongly augmented lance working party took men working upon brig turned over to dockyard gang with result that work on brig be retarded while at shipyard be expedited so greatly a to ensure gratification of wish so eager be to hasten on building of schooner that even proposed abandonment of old settlement at bottom of bay establishment of new one on rock however by mean suited lance view must be manifestly impossible to launch make off with schooner if be to be environed by gang of men one of whom must be sure to regard new comer with more le of suspicion distrust so lance threw out few mysterious hint about secret passage hidden chamber beneath battery in heart of rock for johnson own individual sake must be wise to keep from knowledge of actually engaged in constructing by mean managed to avert threatened transfer thought occurred to that possibly galatea party might be more safe if quartered upon rock thus entirely separated from pirate on reconsidering question talking over with others conclusion arrived at be that rock be exposed sterile spot for habitation in addition to possessed other disadvantage perhaps for present must be better not to propose at eventful day arrived on ceremony of laying keel of new schooner be to be performed piece of timber of be to be composed of have already formed part of keel of old ship have be shaped block laid in position other preparation fully made nothing remained to lay down keel piece on block placed ready for reception to bolt together in fulness of delight johnson resolved that day must be regular fete day accordingly on morning in question shipyard be gaily dressed with flag of more than one nationality be hoisted upon pole hastily set up for purpose hand clean shaven dressed in best prepared to assist in ceremony proceeding be inaugurated by johnson who attired in full uniform of captain of american navy took up position on one of keel block from thence made animated address to follower in rapidly sketched history of band from day on have entered upon present career by taking from officer amazon tea clipper in have sailed from china for england down to present time reminded of difficulty misfortune with have be obliged to contend how have unfortunately lost amazon upon island hundred of mile to westward of present position how have be compelled to leave island in open boat of suffering subsequently endured how by lucky accident be finally enabled to obtain possession of albatross next dwelt upon good fortune have since attended many valuable prize have taken rich store of booty have accumulated steady augmentation of number of brotherhood then giving free rein to fancy enlarged upon plan for future what have already be done be said nothing simple preliminary effort mere trial of strength compared with what must do must never be satisfied informed until must finally lead out of harbour on board fleet of at least ten well armed swift fully manned ship in must be possible for to ravage entire coast of spanish south america despoiling rich town laughing at opposition in way promised must place in possession of such unheard of amount of treasure man among must be worth million after by following plan must unfold to at proper time must quietly disband settle down for remainder of life man on particular spot of earth pleased best in peaceful enjoyment of well earned gold be assembled there day added in conclusion to lay keel of first of ten clipper by glorious result be to be accomplished be eloquent masterly speech johnson be most accurately acquainted with character of who surrounded be making great bid for recovery of popularity in unexplained way largely through machination of alec ralli shrewdly suspected have be steadily slipping away from believed that making of such dazzling promise a have just indulged in be surest way of winning back if vociferous tumultuous cheering be to be taken a indication of success pirate chief have cause to be gratified enthusiasm be intense cheer after cheer rent air men shook hand round then pressed forward hustling other eager to perform same ceremony with johnson vowing a did so blindest most unswerving fidelity to calling down most frightful imprecation upon traitor ralli stood at little distance in background arm folded across chest cynical smile wreathing lip ah right muttered go on shout yourselves hoarse swine yell cheer swear fidelity until be out of breath if plea so to do like to see hear for what be after be in ferment just now be best that noisy gas must have vent will soon sober down again then will see a for continued with furtive scowl at johnson whose face beamed with gratification have have day blind bat a be be beginning to see just for moment fine speech of yours have thrown off guard again doubtless think that with few empty boastful word have recovered lost position be mistaken good friend a will find out when return from next cruise if indeed ever return at well enjoy own opinion while can rejoice in ease with have re established will not attempt to undeceive at least just now so will go add plaudit to of herd pah spat contemptuously on ground a moved forward to shake johnson cordially by hand order being at length restored ceremony of laying keel be proceeded with several piece be already on ground properly shaped with bolt hole bored bolt fitted in short preparation made for fastening together now at word from johnson hundred eager hand seized heavy timber under lance superintendence placed upon block joint be next brought closely together bolt inserted perfect straightness of entire length of keel accurately tested finally bolt be simultaneously driven home keel laid amidst deafening cheer of pirate roar of battery of gun have be placed temporarily in position to do due honour to ceremony men be then served with extra allowance of grog after be dismissed to amuse in way pleased for remainder of day johnson saw fit to leave shipyard in boat conveyed lance captain staunton rest of galatea party back to settlement at bottom of bay be evident during passage that be most anxious to make agreeable to leave behind favourable impression at last when boat be nearing beach at party intended to land said to lance look here colonel have be thinking about woman folk of yourn must find mighty lonesome here with nothing much to do do think 'd please 'em if be to send one of planner to diggin 'cause if do will have one cussed thing ai no use to hardly know what fetched along for thank very much said lance have doubt little music now then must prove solace to indeed must make evening much more pleasant for if feel disposed to spare instrument will remember more gratefully then may consider done johnson replied a boat keel grated on beach party stepped ashore come up to capstan house with can choose will have will send along at once lance accordingly proceeded to capstan house with johnson while remainder of party wended way straight to hut well pleased at what considered mark of great consideration on part of pirate chief when lance found alone with companion thought must be favourable opportunity to prefer request have be in mind for several day have have no previous chance of mentioning be glad said to have opportunity of thanking captain in name of party for have done for comfort under circumstance must not fail to perceive have be somewhat trying to now want to ask to add one favour more be to supply with sufficiency of arm ammunition to enable to defend if need be in absence whilst be on island feel to be safe confess be not altogether without doubt a to treatment may receive at hand of greek friend ralli after departure must add very greatly to feeling of security in absence if be provided with mean of resisting attempt at unfair dealing on part presume be unnecessary for to say that must only use weapon in case of absolute necessity waal now colonel said johnson what ask be fair enough for own part 'd be willing enough to let have want vow just see exactly how be to do key of arm chest be in armourer pocket ca issue anything out of chest without knowledge now know that cuss be friend of mine 'd just go straight away tell ralli what 'd done that 'd set greek dead agin for certainty make thing just a uncomfortable for a must be besides ralli 'd just take 'em away from again a soon a back be turned then 'd be worse off 'n ever wo do will have to go other way about leave to general may bet pile will find out way to do before sail now of box of music will have have arrived by time at capstan house be standing near pianoforte of have be placed together on floor of sail loft packing case having be ripped off probably used for firewood lance ran finger over key board of instrument in turn striking few chord harmony to test quality of tone touch finally selected superb grand by broadwood all right general will have durned thing taken down to quarter to oncet do mean to say that know how to thump music out of thing a well a how to build battery ship so forth ejaculated johnson well yes said lance laughingly believe must plead guilty to being somewhat of musician though have not touched instrument for many day until now then sit right down there colonel play something good said johnson rolling nail keg a seat up to one of instrument lance thoroughly amused at comical incongruity of situation sat down rattled off yankee doodle air judged must be likely to find appreciation with queer companion johnson stood for moment spell bound a well remembered strain fell upon ear then broad grin of delight overspread feature finally began to caper about sail loft in most extraordinary manner to utter certain unearthly sound lance fancied be johnson idea of singing something else gim more pirate captain exclaimed rapturously when entertainer at length raised finger from key board whereupon lance began to play sing hail columbia johnson stood still silent a statue now stirring strain touched altogether different chord of memory for instant something suspiciously like tear glistened in eye thank said very quietly when lance have finished that will do now must rather not hear more at present let keep sound of song in mind a long a can little maid at home used to sing to look here added a lance closed instrument if wish to be on good term with men after be gone have up in meeting room sometimes of evening treat to little music will appreciate must hing more likely to win regard why must give give concert to night to day being holiday lance hesitated for moment before making answer to strange unexpected proposal to tell truth said at last be afraid people will be hardly in mood to night to appreciate such music a must give grog will have got into head will be more inclined to sing among than to sit quietly to listen to not at answered johnson who now that serious mood be upon have entirely dropped americanism of speech not at have taken care to give order that will not have sufficient to make noisy will find perfectly quiet orderly confess must like to see effect of little genuine good music upon very well answered lance nonchalantly be sure have objection now that have mentioned confess feel curious to see result of so novel experiment then be settled said johnson forthwith summoned party of men to of whom gave order to remove to hut pianoforte lance have chosen while to others be deputed task of taking one of other instrument into large room used for purpose of general assembly placing room in proper order for evening entertainment be fixed to commence at orthodox hour of eight o'clock when lance evelin sauntered into hut be assailed by general chorus of question what ridiculous story be husband have be telling mr evelin inquired mr staunton about piano know added violet be actually true lance that absurd creature be really going to let have one chimed in blanche must be good deal more sensible of if must provide with more comfortable quarter grumbled dale agree with there dale certainly must said rex fortescue of course be speaking now of matter a affect lady for ourselves can rough well enough certainly wish must be made more comfortable however fellow seems to have done best for have seen better building than in whole settlement so suppose must endeavour to be content a long a be obliged to remain here a for piano why will enable lady to beguile hour two be queer present to make under circumstance man who made be certainly bit of eccentric be right replied evelin gift be by mean only eccentricity guess what be latest request command scarcely know to call decided that must be utterly impossible for to guess there be saying what absurd whim might seize upon man must be surprised at nothing might ask so on well then will tell said lance wish to give men concert to night at eight o'clock in assembly room oh lance what extraordinary request exclaimed blanche will of course refuse will never trust alone among men certainly will answered lover why not there will not be slightest danger men be not in excited state by mean have idea that little music now then may increase popularity among place on more secure footing if indeed doe not enable to reach awaken whatever of good may still exist in breast besides added with gay laugh feel curious to see what effect can produce upon if go lance will go with said rex violet dudley glanced quickly somewhat appealingly at last speaker have too much spirit to say word must keep lover away from side of friend when there be possibility that friend might stand in need of help think may a well go also remarked captain staunton seems hardly fair to leave work to do evelin when of rest of can help can sing fairly good song flatter if be not much of hand at piano so when feel tired will give spell right said more merrier will at least show that be churl be there more volunteer certainly said bob be one mr evelin if will have be something like captain staunton be hand at piano can sing know recitation two think may serve to raise good humoured laugh be singer said brook know few rather taking conjuring trick must like to go with perhaps must be hardly prudent to leave lady without protection must therefore think will remain to night go other evening if there be going to be repetition of sort of thing mr dale said nothing simply sat moodily plucking at beard muttering to by look of countenance be utterly disgusted with whole proceeding thus then be finally arranged at few minute before eight o'clock lance party issued from hut on way to assembly room must see be already brilliantly lighted up chapter thirteen ralli explains so doe lance on entering assembly room friend found that be not only a have seen from outside well lighted that very successful attempt have be made to decorate by draping of flag round wall arrangement of elaborate well designed flag trophy on wall at back of elevated platform stage a may be called long table with accompaniment of chair have be pushed back against wall pianoforte stood in centre of platform room be quite full men appeared for most part disposed to behave quietly decorously there be only dozen young fellow who seemed at inclined to be noisy boisterous occupied seat in centre of room johnson occupied chair on one side of platform ralli balanced on opposite side johnson appeared rather surprised to see four of galatea party put in appearance instead of one only made remark merely waving to accommodate with chair from placed against wall be rather better than word see observed lance to a four friend stepped upon platform promised to do what must in way of furnishing people with little entertainment to night have brought three volunteer with will enable to infuse into proceeding little more variety than must hope to impart to alone so much better colonel returned johnson be real kind of call if lad appreciate ought to be can say have told 'em what be going to do for so a soon a be ready guess can fire away lance turned opened piano looking quietly over audience a did so eye fell upon half dozen who seemed disposed to interrupt proceeding stepping forward to edge of platform waved hand for silence said captain informs that have already explained to reason for invitation to to be present here evening to day have be somewhat notable day in annals of settlement have morning laid keel of new ship commenced undertaking will tax utmost skill energy resource to carry through to successful issue captain johnson have thought event of sufficient importance to be specially marked hence have made holiday for hand finding possessed little skill a musician invited to help in celebration of day by closing with musical performance willingly consented to do in belief that might afford little pleasure recreation may a well take advantage of present opportunity to tell that friend will always be found ready to do everything in power to promote comfort welfare must remind that be here to night for pleasure rather than own will do best to amuse hope that in turn will individually do what can to maintain quiet order may not perhaps succeed in pleasing if such must be case let who be dissatisfied rise quietly leave not disturb others interfere with enjoyment by giving noisy expression to dissatisfaction notice one two who seem inclined to be little unruly hope have sense enough to see that such conduct on part must be in worst possible taste that will think better of loud exclamation of approval greeted speech mingled with shout of if behave will turn out guv'nor such like there be good deal of noise confusion for about five minute during lance calmly seated waited patiently for silence when be at length restored went to piano sang to own accompaniment dibdin tom bowline lance possessed full deep rich bass voice of exceptionally fine quality a word of song pealed through room breathless silence be maintained by strange audience silence of surprise delight many of men knew song have sung heard sung hundred of time on ship forecastle during dog watch not one of have probably ever heard sung before by man of refined feeling capable of expressing full sentiment of word now came upon almost like revelation sailor a class be proverbially fond of music very few of ever have perhaps must be more true to say give opportunity to hear anything of better quality than trash sung in music hall most if not of lance audience now therefore experienced for first time refining power of really good music enthusiastic applause at conclusion of song be perfectly deafening captain staunton then stepped forward sang in true seamanlike style bay of biscay chorus of be given with great unction enjoyment by whole audience rex fortescue followed with death of nelson then bob gave in excellent style laughable recitation convulsed audience even to tickling of sullen ralli into grim smile then lance sang again so entertainment proceeded for couple of hour to unbounded gratification of hand when pirate dispersed in perfectly quiet orderly manner after giving at johnson call three cheer for entertainer thank colonel thank heartily of said individual a friend parted from outside capstan house have given real treat to night guess hand will feel ever so much more friendly to for give dose two of same sort of thing now again reckon will take care get ill treated while be away what about arm ammunition asked for to day said lance leave to general replied johnson guess will find way to let have 'em before sail wo forget trust good night good night be reply friend turned away in direction of hut must mind walking little way up valley gentleman before go inside said bob want to tell something ought perhaps to have told long ago have be so busy must never find opportunity without speaking before lady who think ought not to know anything about certainly robert said captain staunton let hear what be by mean be doubtless something of importance must not speak so earnestly well sir said bob wanted chiefly to warn not to trust johnson too much seems friendly enough doubt very much whether be sincere day that arrived in port when hand went aloft to stow canvas jumped aloft with just to keep hand in a be stowed driver while be passing gasket fellow ralli came on board entered into conversation with johnson who spoke to about more particularly about mr evelin said that be going to design very fast vessel for that be to assist in building of in fortification of harbour that a long a must be of use be to be treated civilly that when have done everything required of must care how be treated what became of false treacherous scoundrel exclaimed captain staunton indignantly be that said robert heard said bob after went into cabin be eaves dropping know sir be just overhead so that must help hearing word said a be talking about thought be justified in keeping ear open quite right robert so be answered skipper be surrounded by at mercy of band of men who have outraged law divine human therefore behoves for own sake even more for sake of helpless woman dependent upon to take possible precaution to ascertain by possible mean be actual intention regarding be detaining here against will have imposed upon task have not shadow of right to lay upon if meditate treachery from what say seems only too probable be justified in resorting to craft if necessary to protect be not that opinion gentleman turning to lance rex unquestionably answered lance promptly men be one excepting of course few who have refused to join brotherhood a call outlaw a such have claim to be treated in straightforward fashion with one deal with lawful enemy such a one meet with in ordinary warfare information robert be valuable not altogether on account of novelty rather a being confirmatory of what have hitherto amounted merely to conjecture on part have long suspected that friend johnson be not quite so straightforward a must have believe well forewarned be forearmed ' be evidently in very critical position here position demanding coolness self possession foresight have at command to enable to successfully extricate ourselves think must give matter immediate consideration now to night mean will perhaps never have better opportunity endeavour to decide upon definite plan of future action very well said captain staunton let continue walk talk matter over be perfectly evident a say mr evelin that be in very critical difficult position question be what step ought to take in order to extricate think be pretty clear that man johnson have intention of releasing of own free will can be much too useful to for ever to do if therefore be ever to get away from place will have to be done in spite of a be too weak to escape by force must do so by craft can see other way for can well said lance slowly blowing long thin cloud of cigar smoke meditatively up into warm still night air fancy will have to try combination of can not conceive practicable course will allow of escaping without coming to blow with pirate wish must of course care on own account although notwithstanding former profession be not particularly fond of fighting if can be done without there be lady poor little may be of always think when idea of strife bloodshed suggests then there be comfort a well a safety to be thought of be not for believe there must not be very much difficulty in seizing stock of provision water together with boat slipping quietly out to sea dark night trusting to good fortune providence rather to be eventually picked up by passing ship must certainly be slow to recommend so desperate course under present circumstance save in very last extremity hardship poor creature passed through in last boat voyage have not yet forgotten be not necessary to repeat word of discussion followed suffice to say that be of so protracted character that three individual engaged in did not enter hut until first faint flush of dawn be brightening eastern sky bob have be dismissed within hour of termination of concert with message to effect captain staunton two companion felt more disposed for walk than for sleep that rest of party have therefore better retire when felt so inclined a hour at three gentleman must return be quite uncertain time thus spent have not however be thrown away for after very earnest discussion of situation conclusion arrived at be that must not do better than adhere to original plan of endeavouring to make off with new schooner that construction must therefore be pushed forward with possible expedition that a there be only too much reason to dread change from present pacific friendly disposition manifested toward by pirate attempt must also be made to win over a many a possible of prisoner not only with object of effecting poor creature deliverance from cruel bondage also in order that fighting strength of galatea party a came to term might be so far increased a to give slightly better chance of success than now have in by mean improbable event of brush with enemy now that keel of new schooner be actually laid operation be resumed with even more than former alacrity on board albatross on evening of fourth day after event related in last chapter be reported a once more ready for sea during four day captain staunton rest of party excepting dale who positively refused to do work have in accordance with resolution be extremely busy at new shipyard getting out fixing in position stem stern post be only by merest accident that heard on evening in question that brig be to sail on following day a lance have heard no more about promised arm ammunition at once determined to see johnson once more respecting accordingly set out in search of pirate captain to chagrin be quite unable to find to learn whereabouts searched for in vain whole evening venturing even on board brig be not until after eleven o'clock night that gave up search in disgust with strong impression that johnson have be purposely avoiding on following morning however be more successful having risen before daylight in order that might catch bird on first appearance in open air at six o'clock bell rang a usual for hand to turn to few minute afterwards whole place be astir lance walked down to landing place with captain staunton others saw embark in boat detailed to convey working party to new shipyard then whispered word two of explanation to friend allowed boat to go away without have be gone about ten minute quarter of hour when lance saw man sought emerge from capstan house walk hurriedly down toward beach where boat fully manned appeared to be awaiting few step lance be by side good morning captain johnson said with inward amusement a noted confusion of pirate at unexpected evidently unwished for meeting good mornin ' general be johnson response given with heartiness be visibly assumed be real fine morning call nice little breeze too off land guess will make short mile of to day be downright glad missed boat morning overslept s'pose wanted to say good bye ' to chum declare to goodness be only just thinkin ' when come up to that 'd be obliged to heave brig to off rock run ashore in boat just to shake nipper with well guess must be off there be foretop sail just let fall be bound have passed messenger already be real sorry ca take

lance by bye have made arrangement for letting have arm promised that fellow ralli a have remarked arm well now only to think of exclaimed johnson with well feigned annoyance what dog goned forgetful cuss be blamed if ai forgot about have be that busy if will believe general ai have time to swaller mouthful of grub four day half starved to death be just look at waistcoat fit like sack about arm declare be real sorry forgot general never mind guess wo want if do button holed lance whispered confidentially just take help to 'em give permission swow now really must say good bye ' take care of general go ahead with schooner a fast a ever can get finished by time come back battery too promise will leave island a soon a like arterwards be by time at water edge a johnson uttered last word of farewell sprang into boat be waiting for flinging into stern sheet gave order to shove off ten minute later same boat be swinging at brig quarter davit brig with anchor stock just showing above water be moving slowly away towards harbour entrance under topsail jib at little distance from lance stood ralli watching departure of brig ah muttered there go vile american dog cowardly mean spirited cur take parting curse with may meet with nothing ill luck perplexity may misfortune follow may very wind sea war against may treachery have planned prevail over may die at last with jeer of enemy ringing in ear good bye good bye shouted bringing tip of finger together at lip wafting with ironical salute after johnson who at moment glanced shoreward waved cap good bye devil go with aha yankee friend little know that be taking last look at scene little dream that brig carry dagger whose blade be thirsty for heart blood whose point have directed at breast adieu miserable coward for ever hope antonio will not forget to tell a drive home blade that be who ordered blow revenge will else be robbed of sweetness thought doubtless that because suited to receive insult in silence must soon forget bah must have known better very quietness repression of resentment must have warned be poor blind fool without discernment must have known that greek never forgives wrong good bye once more for last time good bye wish speed on road to perdition waved hat smilingly at fast receding brig a saw johnson raise telescope to eye level in direction when albatross have at length finally disappeared beyond harbour mouth ralli turned for first time caught sight of lance stalking up to said scoffingly so mister soldier have lost friend at last yes said lance very quietly if a imagine refer to captain must protest against styling friend be nothing of kind ah yes sneered ralli now that be gone can no longer protect disown will not do be friend whatever may say be enemy friend be therefore enemy also will be treated a such do understand not in least said lance have not faintest notion of meaning then listen to will explain said ralli eye gleaming vindictively do know that friend yonder be fated never to return what be meaning of thought lance treachery other on part of rascally greek will wager will never do to allow to suppose that be master of situation so believe said carelessly there be sort of arrangement to effect be there not greek gazed at in unaffected alarm aha ejaculated how came to know lance smiled at compassionately did really flatter said that plan be so astutely devised so cunningly concealed that none partisan must possibly know anything about really mr ralli fear be greatly overrating own sagacity appear to be wandering away from point be about to explain meaning of obscure remark made minute two ago lance have never removed glance for single instant from ralli face since commencement of conversation be physiognomist enough to detect sign of fear almost approaching to panic in countenance of greek knew therefore that bold guess have not be very far from truth continued to puff cigar with wonted insouciance a waited calmly for reply to interrogation yes said ralli recovering self possession with evident effort be about to explain two thing first wish to understand johnson be not captain be captain of anyone now on island have thrown off what do term allegiance blandly suggested lance allegiance yes that word will do explains meaning though be not word intended to use answered ralli have thrown off allegiance be tired of man johnson will have more of will never return here now be capitan understand lance nodded good next thing be about to explain be that friend be enemy people especially be that plain perfectly answered lance still outwardly calm unconcerned a ever though inwardly much perturbed presume intend to accept remark of yours in light of threat of kind ralli looked hard at interrogator before replying must not in least understand man who received with such perfect sang froid intelligence that friend be to be regarded treated a enemy of company of ruthless outlaw such a must know ralli associate to be yes said at last slowly almost doubtingly may take what say a threat mean to pay to friend great debt of vengeance that other friend of yours johnson have allowed to accumulate against will be doubly avenged will be avenged upon upon a well lance laughed gaily a lightly knocked off with little finger ash from cigar end be serious direful business have intention to let greek see that word have alarming disturbing effect upon so said with smile excuse for laughing at under circumstance really must not help ignorance of true state of affair strike a so positively ludicrous forget good sir be behind scene in secret know added seeing look of bewilderment at other expression why man people be absolutely at mercy look surprised assure such be fact really know whether ought to explain to scarcely think deserve after recent threat will keep own counsel will remain in ignorance turned to walk away stop gasped ralli what be mean must know lance paused for full minute a though irresolute at last said well perhaps must be better for party that there must be after clear understanding people outnumber party many time be indisputable that have in power in consequence to make very uncomfortable for that be absolutely at mercy therefore will be greatly to advantage to treat well will perhaps understand better if inform that plot against johnson have be betrayed did not think necessary to explain that a far a knew only betrayal of have be in incautious word uttered by greek at opening of present conversation that if doe not return neither will brig then how will be situated must possibly contrive to exist for year upon provision left on island might even aided by production of island find sustenance for many year must spending of rest of life on island be in accordance with plan wish do not think possible that johnson in revenge for plot against may find mean to direct cruiser to hiding place imagination take be vivid enough to picture consequence of such step on part will have battery schooner muttered ralli yes said lance if build for not otherwise there be not man on island outside own party who must complete schooner much le build battery now do begin to understand be only speaking truth when spoke of being at mercy ralli be silent stood with knitted brow intently cogitating for minute then suddenly looking up into lance face with smile said ah bah what obtuse people english be how impossible for to understand little joke well will joke more since can not understand will be good friend round best of friend will have cause to complain of bad treatment will work hard to finish schooner battery early please like not what said just now about johnson frigate that too be joke know be mistaken said lance confess be dense enough not to understand that be joking so spoke in earnest think clearly understand other now so hope will hear more about threat revenge nonsense of kind flinging cigar end into water lance turned on heel walked away knowing at least shrewdly guessing that ralli be watching sauntered away in usual careless easy fashion toward hut have laughingly dubbed staunton cottage entered lady be busying about various domestic task little may be amusing with uncouth wooden doll bob have constructed for lance be prime favourite with may so moment that entered doll be flung into corner child came bounding up to joyously exclaiming oh funny mr evelin how be that have not gone with papa did stay at home on purpose to play with well not exactly little one answered lance catching in arm tossing high in air to infinite delight not exactly although man might be worse employed than in amusing mischievous little fairy be going to papa presently must like to come with may in nice little boat know answered child doubtfully how far be think like boat poor little mite expect not must be wonderful if did after what have suffered in remarked lance holding child now in arm while played with long beard will not have very far to go pet only over to big rock pointing out of window will take great care of will see papa inquired may oh yes be reply will be with day robert be over there too know daresay will play with if ask prettily then will go decided promptly forthwith went away to mother with request that hat jacket might be put on 'cause going with mr evelin to see papa a explained daresay be somewhat surprised to see here remarked lance a replaced tiny playfellow on floor fact be have be watching departure of brig idea have occurred to that now be gone so many of remaining men be away at shipyard day lady may with believe perfect safety indulge in unwonted luxury of daylight walk stand greatly in need of fresh air exercise really think there be now cause to fear molestation otherwise must not of course suggest thing will never do know for to remain cooped up here day after day will get low spirited out of health be inclined to believe will be rather good idea than otherwise to accustom fellow to sight of moving freely fearlessly about lady be quite unanimous in cordial welcome to suggestion blanche only venturing to add in whisper with pleading look can not come with lance must feel quite safe then really must not darling answered gently must not be fair to others know beside be urgently wanted at yard to day must not let pleasure however tempting interfere with progress of schooner must like immensely of course if thought there be least particle of danger in expedition must go believe there be none at same time will of course keep eye open dear be on watch for suspicious circumstance if really must have escort there be dale will ask oh dale ejaculated blanche with contemptuous toss of pretty little head that lance said more be sufficiently evident that lady must be badly in want of escort indeed before must accept dale three lady be soon ready a took way up valley lance stood at door with may on shoulder watching when at last passed out of sight made way down to landing place seated child carefully in stern of small dingy found moored there cast off painter stepped in shipping short paddle drove tiny boat with long easy leisurely stroke down toward rock chatting gaily with tiny companion while causing childish laughter to peal musically incessantly across placid surface of land locked water chapter fourteen lady make discovery bob distinguishes be most delightful day for walk lady averred enthusiastically enthusiasm be quite justified azure of sky overhead be relieved by bank of soft dappled fleecy cloud served in measure a screen against ardent ray of sun gentle breeze from westward imparted feeling of freshness to air whilst wafted to pedestrian subtly mingled perfume of thousand varied plant flower flourished in deep rich soil of island a lady walked quietly on up gently sloping valley toward hill enjoyment increased with step hitherto have only ventured abroad at night lovely a landscape have appeared in clear mellow radiance of moon soft silvery light boldly contrasted with broad mass of rich grey brown shadow agreed that be incomparably more beautiful when viewed by full light of day in glory of brilliant sunshine thousand gorgeous colour on leaf blossom on gaily plumaged bird bright winged insect charmed eye enriched foreground of picture while dense mass of foliage with subtle gradation of colour light shade a gradually receded into background finally melted into rich purply grey of extreme distance balanced harmonised whole completing one of most beautiful prospect perhaps upon human eye have ever gazed spirit rose a walked steadily onward upward breathing with intense enjoyment strong pure perfume laden air exhilarating in effect a draught of rich wine temporarily forgetting in pleasure of moment not only past suffering present future peril chatted merrily arranged hundred plan many of must have known be destined never to attain fruition hitherto have be following faintly defined track in luxuriant grass track have always up to present determined direction of longer walk arriving at last at point where trail turned abruptly off passed down gentle declivity apparently toward sea on eastern side of island determined to abandon tempted by shade to plunge boldly into broad expanse of park like timber spread before welcome shade be soon reached somewhat fatigued with ramble seated at foot of gigantic cork tree in rich green twilight shadow of luxuriant foliage discussed luncheon with have have forethought to provide luxuriant grass have hitherto carpeted earth here gave place to graceful fern in rich variety interspersed with delicate moss of velvety texture here there in more open space small patch of heath like plant with tiny waxen blossom of tint varying from purest white to dainty purple silence of forest be broken only by gentle murmur of wind in tree top soft rustle of foliage overhead save when now then twittering bird flashed like living gem from bough to bough there be low deep sound vibrating on air told of never ceasing beat of surf on island rock girt shore rested refreshed lady at length rose to foot once more continued way through wood ground soon began to rise steeply after nearly hour steady climbing emerged once more into full dazzling sunlight to find standing on edge of steep rocky ravine through fifty foot below there flowed tiny stream of crystal purity rock be of character quite new to ignorant of geology a be must doubtless have passed by without second glance have not be attracted by peculiar glitter here there upon surface proceeded a discovered upon closer inspection from presence of minute particle of dull yellow substance embedded in stone what chiefly riveted attention be small basin like pool with smooth level sandy bottom a must clearly see from elevated stand point water appeared to be about two foot deep basin be roughly of circular form about ten yard in diameter that be obviously intended by nature to be used a bath be thought flashed simultaneously through mind of three fair gazers a one glanced half timidly around only to feel reassured by utter absence of indication of probable unwelcome intrusion thought speedily found vent in word just look at pool exclaimed mr staunton what delightful bath must make oh mr staunton said blanche do know be exactly thought occurred to feel tired must so enjoy plunge into beautiful clear cool water do think might venture see why must not be reply what do think violet think must be nothing short of luxury answered violet too feel tired be sure must refresh be not afraid if be not then let risk said mr staunton with sudden show of intrepidity be however only half genuine borrowing courage from companionship of others hurriedly scrambled down rocky slope in few minute more be flashing bright water over other like naiad at play clear laughter echoing strangely among mighty rock of ravine water proved to be much deeper than have supposed being quite four foot deep in centre of pool rendered bath more enjoyable sand be on whole beautifully fine white firm beneath foot occasionally experienced sensation of treading upon small hard roughly rounded object among finer particle finally blanche encountered lump so large hard curious to see what must be with motion of foot swept away sand until object be exposed to view seemed to be rough irregularly shaped pebble somewhat larger than hen egg of dull yellow colour reaching down arm plunged beneath water brought odd looking object up in hand what curious stone how heavy be remarked holding up to view companion came to inspect mr staunton took in hand to make close examination stone exclaimed excitedly why dear girl be gold genuine nugget unless be greatly mistaken mr thomson friend of husband in sydney showed several gold nugget be exactly like only be none of nearly so large do really think be gold asked blanche dear mr staunton dear violet only fancy what delightful thing will be if have actually discovered gold mine why will be able to present husband with magnificent fortune charming blush mantled speaker cheek a said notwithstanding fact that by time three woman have secret from other wonder if there be more remarked mr staunton surely that can not be only one here fancy stepped on something hard just now three woman at once went groping along sand with foot not in vain first one then encountered hard object proved to be similar in substance to one found by blanche in quarter of hour have between collected upwards of dozen of though one only found by mr staunton exceeded in size that of first discovery then feeling somewhat chilled by long immersion returned to terra firma be soon once more wending way homeward in passing through wood contrived to lose way a happened proved of slight consequence a though eventually came out at point nearly mile distant from pathway have followed in morning be quite a near settlement a must have be have faithfully retraced original footstep by four o'clock in afternoon found once more within shelter of wall of staunton cottage greatly fatigued be true by long ramble with elasticity of spirit sense of renewed life to have long be stranger meanwhile party at shipyard have be thrown into state of unwonted excitement by incident at one moment threatened to have tragic termination strong gang of men be at work upon rock indeed who be left upon island excepting dozen fourteen most of whom be employed in providing for daily want of others such a in baking bread cleaning out hut airing bedding so on scene at mouth of harbour be therefore tolerably busy one captain staunton be in charge of ship building operation with kit a foreman in chief while rex brook be superintending operation at battery former with roll of rough ready drawing in hand setting out work while latter overlooked construction of lime kiln bob be making generally useful be while hand be at busiest that lance put in appearance leading little may by hand of course at once made dash at father flinging tiny arm round neck kissing hugging vigorously showing in hundred childish way delight at being with unwonted sight of pretty little creature created quite temporary sensation large majority of men there be steeped to lip in crime yet there be very few among who have not still left in hidden far down in innermost recess of nature crushed almost out of existence by load of vice evil doing may be remnant of better feeling of humanity feature brightened softened visibly a witnessed delight of baby girl at finding with father looked at happy innocent face visit be like ray of sunshine falling upon from out bosom of murky storm laden sky a flitted fearlessly to fro among felt for moment a though part of load of guilt have be taken from that in subtle way proximity have exercised purifying refining influence upon that be no longer utterly vile god forsaken wretch have be fierce crime scarred face lighted up with unwonted smile a approached hand have be again again soaked in human blood be outstretched to warn remove from vicinity of possible danger for first few minute captain staunton have be anxious apprehensive at unexpected presence among ruffianly band face cleared knitted brow relaxed a saw effect sight of produced when lance joined said let alone be doing more in few minute to humanise men than must achieve in year child be naturally interested in everything saw with tireless foot passed to fro pausing now then to gravely watch operation of stalwart fellow hewing out timber with adze driving home bolt with heavy maul digging into stubborn rock with pickaxe not infrequently asking question puzzled seaman strove in vain to answer at length having satisfied curiosity by thorough inspection of be going forward wandered down to spot where hulk have be broken up be tiny sheltered bay indentation in rock large raft have here be constructed out of dismembered timber planking be kept afloat in order that powerful ray of sun might not split rend wood two three detached plank formed gangway between raft rock along plank may passed on to raft without attracting attention of anyone happening that just at moment most of hand be summoned to tail on to fall of tackle be being used to raise one of timber into place gradually strayed from one end of raft to other presently attention be attracted by curious triangular shaped object saw projecting out of water moving slowly along wondered what must possibly be in order better to see ran nimbly out upon end of long plank projected considerably beyond rest so eager be to watch movement of strange object that overshot mark with splash cry of alarm fell into water triangular object immediately disappeared luckily at instant bob glanced round just in time to see splash caused by may involuntary plunge to note simultaneous disappearance of dark object in water close at hand divining in moment what have happened set off with bound down sloping rocky way toward raft shouting a went shark shark may have fallen overboard for single instant there be horror stricken pause then tool be flung recklessly aside tackle fall be let go timber suffered to fall unheeded to ground again entire gang with one accord followed in bob wake hastily snatching up rope boat hook pole oar anything likely to be useful a ran meanwhile bob running with speed of hunted deer have passed a seemed to spectator with single bound down rock along entire length of raft from extreme end of plunged without pause hesitation into sea bright momentary flash a vanished beneath surface of water seemed to indicate that carried drawn knife such weapon in hand simultaneously with disappearance of bob may golden curl reappeared above surface child aimless struggle choking bubbling cry lent wing to rescuing foot of who have listened again again unmoved to death scream of fellow men moment there be tremendous commotion in water close to child first sort of seething whirl then dark object flashed for moment into view there be furious splashing darting hither thither of creature indistinctly seen amid snowy foam then that foam took on rosy hue deepened into crimson commotion subsided bob appeared once more on surface breathless gasping with couple of stroke reached may side dozen more took alongside raft in time to deliver into captain staunton outstretched arm unhurt sir believe thank god bob gasped a delivered up charge then when little one have be raised out of water clasped with inarticulate thanksgiving to father breast added give hand of fellow will heave handsomely for believe leg broke lay hold boy dozen eager hand be outstretched to bob assistance foremost among being that of great black bearded fellow named dickinson who have formerly be boatswain mate on board man o ' war who have deserted in order to escape consequence of sudden violent outburst of temper lay hold bob grasped proffered hand be brought gently alongside raft now then exclaimed dickinson assuming direction of affair kneel down on edge of raft one of frenchy ' be pretty handy with flipper kneel down pas arm under leg a high up a can say when ' be ready then lift gently now take care strike against edge of raft so be well now lift inboard be sort now off jacket of let sling will ride easier way be hurting lad not much thank'ee answered bob cheerfully there added a once more reached rock will do mate lay down here in shade tell mr evelin be hurt presently know after be brought little girl round in meantime lance almost a much concerned a captain staunton have hurried after latter offered assistance be thankfully accepted there be very little that needed doing so prompt have be bob in movement that poor child have never actually lost consciousness after great deal of coughing up of salt water little cry may be so far again a to be able to call up rather wan smile throwing arm round father neck to say be frightened more papa dear may be better now great seemed to be satisfaction of crowd of men who have clustered round group a heard welcome assurance then in two three slunk away back to work seemingly more than half ashamed that have be betrayed into exhibition of so human feeling a interest in mere child safety if little un right mister 'd better have look at chap pulled out leg broke think remarked dickinson gruff voice at juncture leg broken good heaven never dreamed of exclaimed captain staunton poor fellow poor robert let go at once see what can be done for evelin will find there under rock remarked ex boatswain mate in tone of indifference indicating bob resting place by careless jerk of thumb over left shoulder a walked away captain staunton lance rose to foot former carrying restored darling in arm went toward spot indicated have gone few pace when be overtaken by dickinson who with half sulky half defiant look on face said s'pose ca be use can if can know 'd better say so will lend hand let see man will laugh at ai quite brute though daresay think one like pluck when see way that boy jumped in on shark be plucky enough for anything if have be for skipper little gal of yourn 'd have be goner mistake be right dickinson must indeed thank god be spared to though can doubt be of greatest use to a to thinking brute hing of kind doe mr evelin be sure believe make out to be great deal worse than really be well robert what be boy be true that leg be broken be afraid be sir answered bob who looked very pale be evidently suffering great pain care about so long a may be right be robert thanks to god to courage will thank by by more adequately than can do now let look at leg be first thing to be attended to will allow captain staunton interposed lance have knowledge of surgery think hand will be more steady than yours after late excitement skipper willingly gave place to lance latter kneeling down by bob side drew out knife with slit up left leg of lad trouser painful sight at once revealed leg be broken half way between ankle knee splintered shin bone protruded through lacerated bleeding flesh captain staunton felt quite sick for moment a saw terrible nature of injury even lance turned trifle pale compound fracture very bad one pronounced evelin now dickinson if wish to be of use find kit carpenter bring to man vanished with alacrity in minute two returned with kit lance explained what wanted few splint of certain length shape supply of good stout spun yarn do think ralli must give bandage two little lint from one of medicine chest asked lance of dickinson if wo will pound to jelly be reckless answer without waiting for further instruction man ran down to water jumped into dingy casting off painter began to ply oar with strength energy sent small boat darting across bay with foaming wave at bow long swirling wake behind in le than hour be back again with medicine chest content have brought away bodily without going through formality of asking permission splint be by time ready then began long tedious painful operation of setting dressing limb in performance of dickinson rendered valuable efficient service long agony proved almost too much for bob went ghastly pale cold perspiration broke out in great bead over forehead seeing boatswain mate beckoned with hand to one of men standing near whispered to fetch dickinson allowance of grog man went away soon returned with not single allowance pannikin full of rum result of spontaneous contribution among men a soon a be informed that be wanted for bob with aid of occasional sip from pannikin poor lad be able to bear up without fainting until lance have done be possible for then dickinson three other men lifting upon strip of tarpaulin lashed to couple of oar carried down to one of boat jumping in with lance captain staunton who must not be persuaded to trust may out of arm pushed off rowed down to bottom of bay about couple of hundred yard from rock passed body of great dead shark floating belly upwards upon surface of water creature appeared to be nearly twenty foot long blood be still slowly oozing from three four stab couple of long deep gash near throat mouth be open a boat swept past occupant have opportunity to count le than five row of formidable teeth still erect in horrid jaw captain staunton pressed child convulsively to breast a gazed at hideous sight dickinson who pulled stroke oar averred with oath belief that there be not man on island with pluck enough to tackle monster by bye robert said captain staunton have not yet told how came to break leg did strike against timber when jumped overboard how be sir said bob be way just a reached end of plank caught sight of brute rushing straight at may must see distinctly against clean sandy bottom be not above six foot off so took header right for whipping out sheath knife a jumped luckily turned upon sharp enough to give little may chance not sharp enough to prevent driving knife into up to hilt then got hold of somewhere think be one of fin dug slashed at until be out of breath when be obliged to let go come to surface shark sheered off seeming to have have

done what have done lived life have lived what must do answer that come up to hut next sunday morning at eleven o'clock will answer what do mean to say that will let in woman folk there too certainly will said captain staunton heartily be mortal like lady will not refuse be sure to meet man who feel a do then will come exclaimed man with frightful oath intended to add emphasis to declaration then a boat keel grated on beach mate sprang into willow water lifting bob in impromptu stretcher carefully upon shoulder proceeded with heedful step to bear toward hut now there remarked captain staunton in low voice a hurried on ahead to get bob bunk ready for there be example of human soul steeped in sin yet revolting from struggling desperately to escape in despair only dyeing with deeper stain be noble nature in revolt against state of hideous ignoble slavery pray god may find word wherewith to suitably answer momentous question amen said lance fervently raising hat reverently from head a word passed lip in ten minute have poor bob safely in house comfortably bestowed in berth medicine chest have be brought back in boat be soon conveyed to hut while lance busied in mixing cooling draught for patient dale to intense astonishment of everybody voluntarily undertook to prepare strengthening broth for man supreme selfishness gave way for moment to admiration of bob gallant deed so immeasurably beyond anything of felt capable genuinely ashamed of for perhaps first time in life suddenly resolved to do what little in lay to be useful when lance came down stair for moment after administering saline draught found dickinson three companion still hanging about outside door in irresolute manner a though undecided whether to go stay accordingly went out to with earnestness quite foreign to usual manner thanked warmly yet courteously for valuable assistance lance never forgot that be gentleman be therefore uniformly courteous to everybody then dismissed adding at last moment word two of reminder to dickinson a to promise for following sunday emphasised with hearty shake of hand boatswain mate walked away down to boat silently in seemingly dazed condition holding up right hand before turning over looking at a though have never seen before never opened lip until boat be in mid channel when resting on oar for moment said well shipmate have heard say to day word must have believed morning must find courage to say to human being now be not ashamed of 'em wo go back from single word know a well a do what rumpus there 'd be if got to be known that there 'd be said what be

piratin ' business wo mention name anyhow may trust not to say word about what have heard to day upon there be hand upon mine mine proffered hand be silently grasped with fervour then oar be resumed boat sped on way to shipyard chapter fifteen lost when three lady entered staunton cottage be greatly surprised to find captain staunton lance there busy scraping lint still more surprised to see dale bending over fire with coat off diligently stirring content of small tin saucepan may be first to throw light upon situation did directly door opened by rushing up to mother exclaiming excitedly oh mama what do think fell into water bobbie jumped in too naughty shark hurt poor bobbie made leg bleed so papa mr evelin sailor brought home put to bed be up there now mama so poorly mr staunton turned mutely to husband for explanation for single moment felt quite incapable of speaking intelligibly mental vision conjured up picture of child in terrible danger in anxiety mind refused to take in more than one awful fact overlooking for time circumstance of bob having received injury danger to may have be exposed that be thought about must think about just then until have heard story have not attention for anything anyone else so captain staunton bade sit down then related full detail of may adventure with bob gallant rescue of unfortunate accident accompanied be not necessary to repeat frequent exclamation of horror admiration be elicited from fair auditor a various detail of occurrence be related to describe convulsive way in may be clasped to mother breast fondled cried over by three of sensitive loving woman together a listened to story of terrible peril suffice say that when narrative be over womenkind went with one accord up to bob bedside there so overwhelmed with thanks praise that poor fellow be quite overcome so lance have finally to interfere with mock severity order immediate withdrawal later on when excitement have somewhat subsided while be sitting down quietly to tea lady produced nugget passing round for inspection relating manner in have be found lance experience a gold digger now served party in good stead for have sooner taken dull yellow lump into hand than pronounced to be veritable nugget of pure gold after extracting from fair finder a accurate description a must give of locality in discovery have be made declared belief that one more pocket of gold existed in immediate vicinity of pool said must take early opportunity of personally inspecting spot somewhat exciting event of day caused party to sit up chatting rather late that evening about midnight be startled by sound of knocking at door captain staunton opened there stood dickinson who explained with hesitation that bein ' a must sleep very well 'd made so bold a to come up seein ' light in winder to ask how little missie be a'ter ducking likewise youngster a have got leg hurt skipper be able to give satisfactory answer to inquiry mr staunton hearing that someone be asking after may came out herself thanked ex boatswain mate so sweetly for interest in child that poor fellow went away more dazed than ever with heart so light that felt a if walking upon air during short journey between hut quarter solemnly silently registered sundry fearful vow a to what must do to anyone who dared so much a to think harm of inhabitant of staunton cottage for next two day everybody be exceedingly busy men being hard at work at shipyard while woman felt a though must not do enough for bob make enough of indeed in anxiety to show gratitude admiration violet blanche at least let enthusiasm outrun discretion so far that bid fair to do patient more harm than good so that mr staunton be fain at last to take under own exclusive charge forbidding younger lady to enter room more than twice day once in morning again in evening then rigorously limiting visit to five minute on occasion third day following bob accident be sunday day be always observed a holiday by pirate not need scarcely be said in deference to fourth commandment simply because men insisted upon having one day of rest from work day on more sober steady member of band be wont to devote little attention to toilet to repair of clothing while remainder by far greater number gave up to unrestrained riot drunkenness circumstance a may easily be understood always caused considerable amount of anxiety to inmate of staunton cottage however anxious may have be however fearful that in unbridled licence pirate might at moment break in upon privacy of cottage attempt outrage divine service be invariably performed twice sunday in lower apartment of cottage day in question be exception to rule when party began to assemble for morning service saw that dickinson have posted at little distance from within easy hail of door be accordingly invited in when made appearance with hair freshly cut long bushy beard moustache carefully trimmed person decently arrayed in nearly new suit of blue pilot cloth looked not only inch sailor also very fine specimen of manhood entered with show of diffidence seemed half inclined to beat hasty retreat again when mr staunton invited to occupy seat next however remained conducting with greatest propriety during service evidently still having in remembrance form of episcopal ceremonial when prayer be over captain staunton delivered according to usual custom short address in strove earnestly to give plain comprehensive answer to question dickinson have propounded to in boat be not within province of book a to repeat what be said on occasion suffice to say that skipper so far succeeded in object that when service be over strange guest went away happier more hopeful man than have be for year presented again at evening service remaining at mr staunton invitation to listen to sacred music in party generally indulged for hour at close of day thenceforth be changed man on following morning lance announced that proposed to make in blanche company visit to gold mine a laughingly called blanche presence be required ostensibly in order that might act in capacity of pilot one attempted to pretend that be blinded by so exceedingly transparent excuse everybody knew how eagerly occasion be welcomed by pair a affording opportunity for long day uninterrupted enjoyment of other society everybody have accordingly something jocular to say about what cared two happy in first rosy flush of mutually acknowledged love laughingly returned jest for jest set off in high glee directly after breakfast saying be not to be expected back at definite time a must stay until lance have made thorough examination of entire locality deeply in love however a be have forethought to provide with good substantial luncheon evelin also slipped tolerably heavy hammer cold chisel into pocket blithely pair stepped out for be not happiness always light of foot in due time much shorter time by way than be occupied in previous journey arrived at brink of ravine looked down upon tiny crystal stream pool wherein nugget have be found lance took in geological characteristic of place at glance recognised rock a genuine out crop of gold bearing quartz minute yellow speck therein a precious metal visible presence being indication of extraordinary richness of reef why blanche darling exclaimed miner instinct fully aroused a chipped broke off specimen here there to find tiny pellet nodule of gold thickly clustering in mine of yours be worth nation ransom believe there be such reef a in whole world with proper crushing machinery might make fortune in month let take look at pool unless be greatly mistaken there be princely fortune lying about here to be have for mere picking up without need of machinery at scrambled down side of ravine stood by margin of pool then lance looked upward in direction of flow of rivulet attentively noting run of stratum glancing about saw small broken branch lying on ground at great distance securing cut away with knife side of larger end so a to produce flat surface making of branch very narrow bladed wooden spade in fact reaching a far forward a must plunged blade of extemporised spade into sandy bottom of pool pressing gently down into sand until must get deeper when prized upward so a to bring to surface specimen of subsoil raising very carefully end of branch at length came into view bringing with small quantity of yellow glittering sand of by care patience managed to get out of water before be quite washed away placing in palm of hand gently agitated to fro beneath surface of water until lighter particle be washed away when there remained in hand minute quantity of fine yellow dust there said what do think of blanche be gold dust dear girl if must drain off water from pool might be done without much trouble must find plenty of underneath that fine white sand now let inspect little further accordingly began to walk slowly up border of stream descended ravine by series of miniature cataract foot so in height usually with small sandy bottomed basin beyond one of basin proved to be so small so willow that standing on projecting ledge of rock lance be able to make tolerably thorough examination of bed with aid of before mentioned branch have not be very long stirring up sand with when turned up four very fine nugget varying in size from hen egg to six pound shot just a expected exclaimed now spot from gold originally came be at head of ravine nugget have be brought down here by water higher go larger will nugget be because of course heaviest of will have travelled shortest distance before pushing investigation further propose that sit down here have luncheon be picturesque spot what be perhaps more to purpose be frightfully hungry accordingly seated upon great moss grown rock partook of content of basket with appetite of healthy people who have passed long morning in fresh pure air luncheon over lance having at blanche request perhaps word command must be nearer truth lighted cigar pair proceeded with investigation characteristic of stream continued to be same short length of sparkling water flowing over boulder strewn bed diminutive rapid tiny cataract occasional quiet pool between one two of smallest least difficult of pool lance cursorily examined finding in case one more nugget size increasing a searcher made way upward thus confirming lance theory did not however devote much time to actual search for gold object be just then to trace gold to source at same time to note what capability existed for damming off most promising spot with view to future operation happy idea a blanche thought suddenly occurred to young lady oh lance exclaimed what goose be be darling said companion probably if anyone happened to see just now sliding arm round waist kissing must be inclined to think so nay need not pout be entirely own fault fact be that looked so pretty temptation be simply irresistible be retorted well think very rude of to interrupt like just at moment be about to give utterance to brilliant idea seriously lance dear do not think must collect sufficiency of gold to purchase freedom from horrid men evelin thought matter over for minute two be afraid not said at last have not slightest doubt about being able to collect sufficient quantity of gold ground seems to be absolutely gorged with difficulty must be in effecting of arrangement by fellow must be persuaded to release after payment of ransom must take gold afterwards simply break faith with service be of too much value to unluckily for ever to voluntarily permit departure will therefore have to follow out original plan of escape if possible unless better offer will endeavour to posse ourselves of of enormous wealth must trust to chance for opportunity to convey away with be now near head of ravine seemed to terminate in sort of cul de sac huge reef of auriferous rock jutting out of ground forming almost perpendicular wall across end of ravine on reaching base of wall tiny stream have be following be found to have source yard two from face of rock bubbling up out of ground in midst of little pool three yard across be near spot therefore in probability that precious metal must be found in richest abundance lance accordingly began to look around for indication of direction in ought to search about ten foot up face of rock wall saw what appeared to be fissure in stone thinking possible that examination of fissure might aid with difficulty managed to scramble up to when reached spot found however instead of mere fissure crack in rock a have imagined wide projecting shoulder of reef artfully masked low narrow recess penetrating into recess lance found that after have proceeded two three yard wall widened out whole place have appearance of being entrance to subterranean cavern thinking that if such be indeed case discovery might prove of great value a affording party perfectly secure place of refuge in case of necessity emerged once more discovering from more elevated stand point easy mean of descent hastened down to blanche informing of discovery requested to sit down rest whilst completed exploration then looked about for something to serve purpose of torch at length found fragment of dry wood on being ignited promised to burn steadily enough for purpose armed with be about to reascend face of rock when blanche begged that might be allowed to accompany a be sure must feel lonely sitting out there by lance accordingly gave hand without very great difficulty managed to get safely up on narrow platform in front of opening relighting torch have extinguished after satisfying that must burn properly lance led way into cleft holding brand well before a high a possible giving disengaged hand to blanche who suffered from disadvantage of being in total darkness lover bulky form almost entirely filling up narrow passage be traversing completely eclipsing light soon however found wall receding from on side roof rising at same time when have penetrated fifty sixty yard be able to walk side by side be curious place in found rocky wall met overhead like arch be composed entirely of auriferous quartz gold gleaming in here there in long thin flake passage sloped gently upward whilst at same time swept gradually round toward right hand though air be somewhat close there be almost utter absence of damp earthy smell be commonly met with in subterranean chamber a continued on way rock about gradually underwent change gold no longer showing in thin detached thread like layer glittering in innumerable speck tiny nodule over surface so that a flickering uncertain light of torch fell upon wall glistened a though covered with unbroken coating of gold leaf novel appearance attractive a be be nothing to surprise awaited further on have penetrated eight nine hundred yard perhaps into bowel of earth be thinking of returning when suddenly emerged from passage into vast cavern so spacious in dimension that tiny light quite failed to reveal farther side roof what little did see be sufficient to root to ground speechless for moment with wonder admiration rocky floor upon stood be smooth a marble pavement apparently from attrition by action of water through countless century though place be now perfectly dry what chiefly excited admiration however be circumstance that floor be not only smooth be a polished a glass in place quite transparent while glowed sparkled with colour of rainbow seemed to be standing on surface of purest crystalline ice seamed streaked veined clouded in most marvellous fantastic manner with conceivable hue through into faint light of torch gleamed flashed sparkled with effect of indescribable splendour oh lance whispered blanche at last be ever anything so lovely seen before perfect palace of gnome darling be not returned lance in usual tone of voice then stood awe struck enthralled a word be caught up by countless echo flung backward forward round round in air above in a many different tone from faint whisper far overhead to deep sonorous musical bell like note reverberating round wall echoing away away farther farther fainter fainter until at last after interminable time a seemed to sound died completely away silence reigned once more be marvellous superb whispered evelin not caring to again arouse echo of place come blanche sweetheart let explore little further while torch still hold out hand in hand with cautious step for floor be almost a slippery a ice began to make tour of fairy like cavern have not proceeded dozen step before be again arrested spell bound wall a far a feeble light of torch must reveal be of rock of same character a floor only that instead of being smooth even be broken up into fantastic projection of imaginable form while here there huge mass started boldly out from face forming flying buttress with projecting pinnacle elaborate carved work executed by nature own hand while elsewhere there clustered column so regular perfect in shape that might have be transferred with scarcely finishing touch of chisel to aisle of cathedral where light happened to fall upon effect be bewilderingly beautiful ray being reflected refracted from through crystal of be composed until shone sparkled like column of prismatic fire then new wonder revealed for on approaching more closely to glittering wall became apparent that be seamed with wide crack here there crack being filled with cement like substance so thickly studded with nugget of gold of size that in le than five minute man might have gathered more than must carry away passing along wall lance found that be everywhere same that in stumbling upon subterranean palace of fairy have also discovered mine of incalculable wealth hastily gathering few of finest nugget within reach set out to return have apparently made entire circuit of cavern for there close to yawned black mouth of passage be fortunate a torch have now burned so low that lance saw with consternation must be necessary for to make greater part of return journey in darkness never mind blanche darling said cheerfully remarking upon unpleasant circumstance be plain sailing there be obstacle in way if have to grope slowly along still marvellous sight have seen be well worth so trifling penalty give hand sweetheart let get into passage for will have to abandon light be scorching finger a be blanche silently gave hand to lover trifle nervous at having to traverse so long distance in impenetrable darkness buried who knew how deep beneath surface buried idea be most unpleasant one just then shuddered a plunged hand in hand into passage lance at same moment flinging charred stump of burnt out torch back into great cavern behind cautiously groped way onward lance feeling way along wall of passage making sure of footing at step by passing foot lightly forward over ground before advancing in manner pair proceeded for what seemed to considerable length of time at least blanche thought so for at last said with slight tremor in voice how much longer do think will be lance surely can not be very far from entrance now must be getting pretty close to said lance surely be not feeling frightened little woman not exactly frightened answered blanche terrible darkness awful silence make nervous seems so dreadful to be groping one way like without being able to see where one be going then have stupid feeling that rock above may give way at moment bury not much fear of said lance with laugh went echoing reverberating along passage in such weird unearthly manner that blanche clung to companion in terror rock continued have supported for year probably century weight above be not at likely will give way just now without cause daresay time doe seem long to darling must remember be walking at much slower pace now than be when passed over ground before of course might walk faster since know ground to be tolerably even regular still be best to be cautious if of happens to stumble here in dark might receive rather severe blow however keep up courage can not be very much longer now once more continued way in silence ground sloping gently downwards while a must tell notwithstanding darkness still welcome ray of daylight appeared in distance to tell that be approaching journey end at length vague terrible fear began to make felt in lance own mind recalling incident of inward journey tried to reckon time have occupied in passing from open air along gallery into great cavern considered that must not possibly have be longer than twenty minute probably not a long a seemed to that have be groping there in intense darkness for two hour at least surely must not be so long a that darkness made time lag heavily if have be there only one hour ought by time to have reached daylight once more slowly a have be moving surely have not oh no be not possible must not be possible yet merciful god what if have by dreadful mischance lost way strong man felt bead of cold perspiration start out upon forehead a dreadful indefinable haunting fear at length took shape presented before mind in grisly horror have faced death often enough to look in face now at time without fear to meet thus to wander on on in thick darkness to grope blindly along wall of huge grave until exhaustion came compelled to lie down die never to look again upon sweet face of nature never again to have eye gladdened by blessed light of sun soft glimmer of star lit heaven to vanish from off face of earth to pas away from ken of friend leaving sign clue of whereabouts of fate oh god be too horrible not for if be god will thus must die have courage enough to meet fate calmly a brave man must thank god have so lived that let death come upon never so suddenly must not be taken unawares lance evelin be by mean saint knew acknowledged in dread hour have always striven honestly honourably to do duty whatever might be with strength then too like apostle knew in whom trusted lance be not afraid of death on own account be for weak timorous girl by side that sympathy be aroused doubtless too possessed faith firm enough to enable to meet fate undismayed believed did what terrible bodily suffering must pas through before end came perhaps after be alarming unnecessarily even now might be within few yard of outlet yet not be able to see because a suddenly remembered passage be curved from very commencement then also remembered passage at outer end be so narrow that blanche have to walk behind here be walking hand in hand side by side a have be ever since have entered interminable passage blanche said steadying voice a well a must put out hand dear see whether can reach right hand wall felt lean away from then came reply in broken voice lance can not why pet exclaimed really believe be cry yes be acknowledged forgive lance dear really can not help will be better by by perhaps oh be so dreadful be very brave very good to know must have realised before now dreadful truth that be lost here tut tut nonsense child lance answered cheerily why blanche will get quite unnerved if suffer such thought to take possession of there lay head on shoulder darling have cry comfortably out will feel better braver afterwards put arm round a spoke poor frightened girl laid head upon breast trustfully a child sobbed a though heart must break companion let sob on unchecked did not even say word to comfort what must say with frightful suspicion moment gathering force strengthening into certainty better not to say anything better not to buoy up with delusive hope oh how thankful felt that terrible task of breaking to news of awful position have be spared sob gradually grew violent at length ceased altogether then blanche raised head said quietly now lance be better feel able to listen to worst can tell will not ask to give candid opinion of position because know be must be same a own what do propose that must do well said lance a cheerily a must first thing intend to do be to light match take glance at surroundings be stupid of did not think of doing so before drew box of match from pocket being smoker be never by chance without next moment sharp rasping noise be heard tiny flame appeared light however be too feeble to penetrate egyptian darkness saw nothing other face hers pale with wide open horror stricken eye with contracted brow firmly compressed lip indicative of unconquerable determination to struggle to last against dreadful fate menaced will not do said must improvise better torch than fumbled once more in pocket presently found sheet two of paper on remembered jotting down note relative to matter connected with construction of battery folded very carefully so loosely a to burn well yet tightly enough to burn slowly so give opportunity for at least momentary glance round then struck match applied to one of tiny torch raised light aloft a did so blanche uttered piercing shriek seizing by arm dragged back against rocky wall of passage then pointing before gasped look lance look lance looked in direction toward pointed grew faint sick a saw that have be standing on very verge of precipice stone dislodged by blanche hasty movement have rolled over edge now heard bounding with loud echoing clang down face of rock down down down sound loud at first growing fainter fainter until at last dull muffled splash told that have reached water more than hundred fathom below chapter sixteen blanche lover have to swim for stand close against wall blanche move commanded evelin a paper torch burnt down went out now continued be about to light up of paper must utilise light to get past gulf if possible will never do for to remain where be question be in direction will be most advisable for to proceed must devote moment two to hasty survey of place a far light will allow before move neither time light will be wasted will be better that must turn glance upward away from edge of chasm nerve will then be steadier when have to make move now be going to light up once more paper be lighted placing in front of companion between edge of chasm in order to guard against possibility of turning faint giddy falling over lance raised light at arm length above head to glance round a did so tiny flame wavered a if fanned by faint draught looked at intently for moment noticed that wavering motion be continuous such a must be produced by steady current of air flowing in direction in have be proceeding then knelt down held lighted paper close against surface of ground flame burnt steadily for instant then betrayed very slight draught in opposite direction then went out paper being consumed thought intently for moment then turned to companion said blanche dearest be saved pluck up courage own love thank god with for showing way out of terrible labyrinth understand lance answered girl trembling with agitation be only saying to sustain courage little while longer do really mean that believe there be still chance of emerging once more into blessed light of day mean dear that hope believe will escape listen bit of lighted paper have revealed presence of two distinct current of air flowing along passage mean that outlet to open air exists somewhere upper current be warmer of two be flowing in direction of outlet have to do be to follow in same direction if can will eventually reach opening then let proceed at once lance dear please pleaded poor terrified blanche feel a though must go mad if remain here much longer have frightful feeling urging almost beyond power of resistance to fling forward over edge of dreadful chasm be yawning to receive save lance darling save for pity sake will save dear if be in man power to do so answered lance must help by keeping up courage know can not possibly think reason calmly whilst continue in deplorable state of nervousness now will light paper last will move forward at once keep close to wall be ready to give right hand a soon a light shine out moment feeble glimmer once more illumined cimmerian darkness holding light in right hand lance gave left to blanche cautiously resumed way ledge along be passing be about six foot wide yard two further on narrowed abruptly leaving path barely twelve inch in breadth continued thus for length of twenty foot then widened out abruptly again apparently to full width of passage seemed in short a though terrible chasm terminated at point luckily lance be first to see resolution be at once taken dropped lighted paper a if by accident extinguished by setting foot upon knew that if companion caught so much a single momentary glimpse of short frightfully perilous passage must have to make nerve must utterly fail too probably dreadful catastrophe must happen so resolved upon hazardous attempt to get past danger blindfold tut what clumsy fellow be exclaimed pettishly a though in reference to having dropped lighted paper now will have to expend match blanche nerve be still unsteady sight of threatening gulf be too much for think must do better blindfold give handkerchief dear let tie over eye will remove again a soon a be past chasm thank said blanche really believe must feel better if sight of dreadful place be shut out can trust to care courage confess with shame a far a be concerned be thoroughly unnerved lance took handkerchief blanche put into hand bound gently firmly over eye arranging a well a must in darkness in such manner a to make blinding perfectly effectual then led cautiously forward step two until felt with outstretched foot edge of precipice when bidding stand perfectly still to cling firmly to irregular surface of rock once more lighted short remaining end of paper utilising brief existence to note well perilous path have to tread now sweetheart said briskly do feel better fit to go on oh yes be reply in tone so bright cheerful that lance felt intensely relieved forthwith set about difficult task of getting companion past narrow ledge without further delay by last expiring gleam of short lived taper lance took one more rapid glance at terrible pas then a thick darkness once more closed round said now dear must be very cautious how move keep close against rock take firm hold of projection can find move until have firm hold with hand without telling of intention a will keep close to give support of arm loose hold of rock with one hand until have secured firm grip with other now have tight hold then move gently along side wise keep close to rock dreadful journey be begun slowly cautiously pair groped uncertain way along narrow ledge pausing until other be ready to proceed lance with difficulty restrained shudder a once during passage felt that heel of boot actually projected over awful ledge dozen time felt outwards with foot to ascertain whether chasm be passed not at last with involuntary sigh of ineffable relief found that there be solid ground beyond a far a foot must reach now stand quite still for moment blanche said be about to light match did so found that have indeed achieved awful passage with six inch to spare at very foot still yawned hungry gulf be beyond thank god once more in comparative safety hastily seizing companion hand hurried far enough away from spot to prevent seeing deadly nature of peril to have be exposed then removed bandage from eye there said cheerfully be past chasm at last now may have use of eye once more lighting match imprisoned pair now pressed forward a rapidly a circumstance must permit taking care to keep match always alight in order that might not stumble unawares upon possible second chasm other danger pressed forward in silence except for occasional word of caution encouragement from lance being far too anxious to admit of anything like connected conversation suddenly lance stopped short to sense of hearing acutely sharpened by long continued death like silence of place there have come sound fainter than breathing of sleeping infant mere vibration of air in fact still sound be knelt down placed ear close to ground yes now caught trifle more distinctly faintest murmur still with something of individuality appertaining to rose fell rhythmically swelling gradually in volume then subsiding again into silence hurrah shouted joyously sea sea can hear courage blanche darling journey be nearly at end one short half hour at most with god help will be free again pushed eagerly forward with high hope grateful heart now with yard of progress gladdening sound rose clearer clearer still until there must no longer be possible mistake about be indeed regular beat of surf upon shore at length faint gleam of light became perceptible upon rocky wall in front gradually strengthened until more prominent projection of rock began to stand out bold black against lighter portion beyond at last a path curved gently round eager eye be gladdened by sight of opening into sea be sweeping with long lazy undulating motion until curled over plashed musically upon narrow strip of sandy beach paused for moment with one consent to feast eye upon gladsome sight to restore disordered faculty then saw that long passage gallery within stood terminated at outer end in cavernous recess opening apparently on precipitous part of shore floor of passage sloped gradually down until met short strip of sand upon mimic wave be lazily beating yard two from water edge sand be marked with well defined line of stranded weed drift wood indicated inner limit of wash of sea single glance be sufficient to show that auriferous rock have be left behind now surrounded being coarse kind of granite pursuing way pair soon stood upon strip of beach then came question how be to get out of cavern now that have reached mouth side rose perpendicularly top arched over in such manner that escape seemed impossible lance made several attempt on side of entrance to work way out face of rock be worn so smooth with constant wash of water that nearer approached entrance more difficult did find to proceed at last failing to find further foot hold be compelled to abandon effort return to blanche who meanwhile have be resting tired limb on soft grey sand well blanche said thought trouble be over when first caught sight of opening appears be not there seems to be only one possible mode of escape from place be by swimming now can manage matter easily enough if will only trust distance be merest trifle water be smooth if think have nerve enough to rest hand on shoulder to refrain from struggling when get into deep water can support weight perfectly well know carry safely round to beach have doubt will find at short distance on one side other of opening will involve ducking certainly can not help if walk briskly afterwards will take harm blanche laughed must afford to do now if be only difficulty be trifling one said can trust implicitly lance what be perhaps almost a important can also trust can swim little if must tire will not be frightened having to help very well be reply be better than dared hope must like to rest little longer will make attempt at once blanche announced perfect readiness to make attempt forthwith without further ado pair straightway entered water hand in hand lance first taking precaution to place watch in hat ram latter well down upon head waded steadily in until blanche felt water lifting off foot when struck out lance regulating stroke so a to keep close beside companion water be delightfully warm sun having be beating down upon day immersion proved refreshing rather than otherwise took only about couple of minute to reach mouth of cave then lance began to look about for suitable landing place have expected to find beach on one side other of opening there be nothing of kind a far a must see perpendicular cliff rose sheer out of water on side of opening for distance of perhaps hundred yard where cliff terminated ground sloped steeply down with huge mass of rock projecting here there foot of slope being encumbered with other rock at distant period have become detached rolled down into water in bad weather must have be death to attempt landing upon part of shore within lance range of vision fortunately weather be fine water smooth so made for spot lance thought must serve purpose in ten minute succeeded in effecting landing among rock scramble up steep face of slope before be not without peril also be happily accomplished at last found standing safe sound on tolerably level ground just a last ray of setting sun be gilding summit of hill before lance found that have come out on eastern side of island a harbour lay on south side knew pretty well in direction ought to walk therefore at once set out at brisk pace toward large patch of forest fringing hill at distance in front of little to south of have not gone very far before lance who be keeping keen look out for familiar landmark recognised dip between hill a ravine up have passed in morning altering course little came in about hour to stream crossed without difficulty then followed down until reached pool in first discovery of gold have be made thence way be tolerably easy though in darkness have by time closed down upon went somewhat astray while passing through wood in hour found once more safely within shelter of staunton cottage thoroughly tired out with long adventurous day ramble entrance be greeted with exclamation of mock horror at length to have spun out day ramble blanche pale cheek draggled dress general done up appearance speedily apprised friend that contre temp of kind have occurred jesting remark be quickly exchanged for earnest sympathetic inquiry a to what have gone wrong whereupon lance having first suggested to late companion advisability of immediate retirement to couch bespoken mr staunton kind service in preparation of cup of tea for of tired out wanderer proceeded to give succinct account of day adventure recital of elicited frequent exclamation of wonder alarm admiration latter being vastly increased when produced valuable specimen to have resolutely stuck through notwithstanding that weight have proved serious encumbrance to during swim now said in conclusion net result of day exploration amount to have discovered mine of incalculable wealth what be to do in matter there be so much gold there in cave mean that short period of resolute well directed labour will enable to collect sufficient not only to fully recoup underwriter for loss through burning of galatea also to make individual among enormously rich be to let lie there trust to future for opportunity to come back fetch will make effort now to collect what will suffice trust to chance for opportunity to carry off with when go in answer to everybody declared at once without hesitation opinion that attempt ought to be made to collect carry off gold with captain staunton very sensibly remarking that if anything occurred to prevent safe transport of prize home must then organise expedition for second attempt that must be folly to make necessity of if by extra effort on part business must be managed without point being settled next question to be decided be how be to set about collection of precious metal for be obvious that attempt to absent from daily attendance at shipyard must not only excite suspicion might also provoke very unpleasant manifestation of active hostility on ralli part here violet dudley came to rescue with very practical suggestion if lance said can contrive to mark two passage out of great central cavern in such manner that woman can not possibly mistake one for other so go astray might perhaps be able to collect gold convey to suitable spot for removal when enough have be gathered can take time about transporting down here admirable suggestion miss dudley said captain staunton effectually disposes of one part of difficulty will never do to bring gold here must not possibly convey on board schooner without detection even if be quite sure of success of plan for making escape in do think evelin pirate have knowledge of existence of cave of yours be pretty certain have not be reply there be sign of human foot having ever passed over ground before own be so eminently well adapted for place of concealment for booty indeed for a well in event of island ever being attacked that feel sure must have known of have stocked with provision in other way have prepared a place of refuge be only by merest accident discovered spot to day for fact that search not only led up to head of ravine also actually caused to scale face of rock must have remained undiscovered still man might stand within twenty foot of entrance without suspecting existence unless have occasion to scramble up rock a did in exactly same place must never find very well then said captain staunton what propose be since lady be kindly disposed to give will thankfully accept service to extent let collect gold convey to edge of gulf chasm so providentially escaped tumbling into to day then men must undertake task of conveying to other side stacking up in position from can easily remove with aid of boat if succeed in securing schooner will simply have to call off mouth of cave remove booty in way can anyone suggest anything better one must be therefore decided that skipper proposal must be adopted especially a left free to alter plan at time must circumstance seem to require decision arrived at party retired for night most of must be confessed to dream of wonderful cave equally wonderful wealth of have be talking next day be spent by hand dale included at shipyard individual have ever since poor bob accident manifested growing dissatisfaction with increasing amount of shame at selfishness caused to live life of idleness comparative ease while one of companion lady included be doing must to aid in maturing great plan of escape now at last shame at unmanly conduct fairly overcame on particular morning startled everybody by putting in appearance at same time a rest of male portion of party saying in explanation that henceforward too must go daily to work a be quite sure must be of assistance be of course assured that undoubtedly must be of very great use if chose there matter ended rather unpleasant feeling be excited when ralli who be always promptly down at beach to watch departure of working party noticed commented upon dale presence aha fine fellow remarked sneeringly so have made up mind to go to work at last have be very well sare must surely have dream last night have eye on think perhaps have not take notice have if have not gone to work to day must have said to look here good man suppose not work not eat must have stopped 'lowance be going to work so now be right certainly served dale right same be disagreeable sensation to rest to feel that sly greek have be in probability keeping stealthy watch upon movement inwardly resolved to be very much more circumspect in going out in coming in for future lost time either in communicating resolve to other day long thought be busy upon subject of gold mine by time that got back to cottage that evening man have idea in connection with to communicate to others be unanimous upon one point be that after ralli remark to dale in morning espionage seemed to suggest must be most unwise for of male portion of party to visit cave during day henceforward visit there must have to be a few far between a possible such visit a be unavoidable must be made during night with woman must of course be different must now safely venture out day be believed a walk up valley be one involved least exertion must only appear natural that must almost invariably take in order to disarm suspicion in case anything of kind happened to exist be deemed best that occasional walk must be taken in other direction until must resume road toward ravine with certainty that have not be watched followed be further agreed round that task of carrying gold when collected over most dangerous part of path along edge of ravine be not to be thought of especially a captain staunton have thought out plan by danger might be completely avoided idea be exceedingly simple consisted merely in erection on side of chasm of short stout pair of sheers connected together at head by good strong sound piece of rope having rove upon thimble with pair of clip hook attached gold must then be put into canvas bag suspended from clip hook with aid of hauling line hauled easily enough across chasm to other side detail agreed upon determined to proceed with arrangement same night accordingly a soon a evening meal be over men retired to bunk for few hour sleep be to say except dale who quite unaccustomed to bodily labour felt thoroughly exhausted with day work be therefore readily excused volunteered however to remain up on watch until light in pirate quarter be extinguished then to take good look round settlement call others when be quiet raid upon capstan house being first thing necessary to enable to carry out plan successfully pirate working hard day in open air be a rule tolerably early bird by eleven o'clock night place be wrapped in darkness repose having thoroughly satisfied that be case that coast be quite clear for comrade dale roused latter then tumbled into own berth with comforting reflection that have at last taken right course done something to regain that respect from companion be beginning to be acutely conscious of having forfeited five minute later four form might have be seen have anyone be on look out stealing quietly across open space between staunton cottage capstan house fortunately one be on look out reached building undiscovered ascended ladder found standing in thick darkness enshrouded long loft like apartment here lance promptly produced box of match on striking light be fortunate enough to discover hanging to nail near door lantern ready trimmed at once lighted carefully masking proceeded to rummage place for such thing a must be likely to prove useful to place be almost like museum in variety of content be not long in confiscating dozen fathom of three inch rope remains of coil of ratline small ball of spun yarn for seizing sledge hammer axe apiece marline spike few long spike nail lance decided must be capital tool for lady to use in picking out nugget few other trifling matter then hanging lantern upon nail once more extinguished made best of way down ladder again pause of minute so to look round assure that midnight prowler be in vicinity set off at brisk pace up valley lighted on way by clear soft effulgence of star studded sky be not long in reaching shelter of dense wood at head of valley once fairly through laid down bulk of booty where must easily find again returning to wood selected couple of young pine quickly felled branch be soon lopped off after cut from tall slender trunk four spar about ten foot in length to serve for sheers shouldering sought out remainder of belonging by time pretty heavily loaded continued way into up ravine arriving at last under lance guidance at great rock veiled entrance to cavern lance brook at once scrambled up to narrow ledge before entrance taking with ratline such other small matter a must carry while captain staunton rex remained below to bend on send up remainder many hand especially if be willing make light work quarter of hour sufficed to transfer everything included to ledge torch chopped out of remainder of pine be then lighted once more loading up possession plunged boldly into cavern lance a pilot leading way in about hour found standing in great central hall cavern lighted up a now be by glare of four flaming torch looked more bewilderingly beautiful than ever hurried glance round be however that must now spare time to take then at once set vigorously to work first thing necessary be to mark in legible manner in such way that mark must be identified in darkness if need be inner extremity of passage through have just passed rex brook undertook to do a have already agreed what mark must be two began with aid of sledge hammer spike to chip in face of rock circular depression on right hand side of passage at height of about three foot from ground so that must easily be found identified in dark by mere touch of hand leaving two busily employed lance captain staunton hurried away in search of other passage soon found opening proved to be right one though third be afterwards found to exist further along circular wall of cavern second however be passage wanted for on going short distance into lance blanche footprint be distinctly traceable in thin coating of fine dust be met with identity of passage being thus established be marked in similar way to other with cross instead of circle marking of two passage proved to be long tedious job owing to hardness of rock imperfect character of tool be done at last then set out to execute real task of journey namely erection of sheers now that have light journey along second passage to spot where sheers be to be erected be accomplished in trifle le than hour shudder ran through a following footprint saw that blanche have twice thrice walked for several yard on extreme verge of yawning chasm without being aware of when at last came to narrowest part of path blanche have traversed blindfold felt very hair rising a craned over edge heard pebble threw in go bounding down until sound of ultimate splash in water be so faint a to be hardly distinguishable be nervous work passage along narrow ledge have to be done did hauling pole across afterwards with aid of rope part of work successfully accomplished rest be not long in doing hour saw pair of sheers erect properly stayed three inch rope bridge strained across with clip hook hauling line attached in short everything ready for commencement of operation ax other matter be then taken back to great central chamber where be left for future use party made best of way into open air thence homeward arriving finally at staunton cottage about hour before great bell rang summons for hand to come forth to day labour chapter seventeen bob want to be rich problem a to working of gold mine being so far satisfactorily solved only remained to ascertain how arrangement must answer when put into practice lady did without loss of time plan be that one of must remain at home to look after bob little may while other two devoted few hour of day to cave a took in turn to remain at home in capacity of nurse of have two day in cave to one at cottage in meantime thanks to lance skill careful nursing of lady bob be making steady progress toward recovery within month of occurrence of accident be beginning to ask how much longer be going to be kept prisoner have be made aware of gold discovery by occasional reference to on part of others in presence have never heard complete story so one day when be blanche turn to remain at home asked to give entire history did listened most attentively when story be over remained silent apparently wrapped in profound thought for several minute looking up at last with flush of excitement on face exclaimed why there must be gold enough there to make millionaire of one of yes said blanche believe there be at least lan mr evelin say so have doubt know oh yes exclaimed bob enthusiastically know believe know everything what splendid fellow be be miss lascelles last with sly twinkle in roguish eye blanche appeared to think unnecessary to comment upon reply to remark at event remained silent window curtain somehow needed adjustment just at moment haste with rose to attend to little matter something else caused most lovely pink flush to overspread cheek bob saw perhaps knew exactly what caused if did be too much of gentleman to show that have noticed so when blanche have adjusted curtain to satisfaction remarked with heavy sigh oh dear wish be well enough to be out at work again long to have handling of of gold must have patience robert said worst part of illness be now over in due time will doubt be able to take share of work once more whether such be case not may rest satisfied that will have share of gold there may be whether be much little know gentleman have decided that will be divided equally among even to little may be sure be very kind of said bob with touch of impatience in tone want to be up able to work at to gather in see accumulate want to be really rich man for shame robert said blanche with just faintest feeling of disgust first have ever experienced toward bob if talk like will leave be disappointed in must never have suspected of being mercenary well be then returned bob quite unabashed be mercenary if mean being anxious to be rich so must be miss lascelles if have seen a much misery a have misery too must be cured by judicious expenditure of comparatively trifling sum of money only think how jolly must be to go up to poor hungry man woman child met clap sovereign in hand say there go enjoy luxury of good unstinted meal for once in life ' rich man power go great deal further than if ever be rich will not be satisfied with bestowal of relief of such very temporary kind a solitary meal amount to will hunt up really deserving case put in way of earning own living real relief consists to mind of nothing short of stretching out of helping hand lifting poor soul clean out of miserable state where one very existence depends upon fluctuating charity of one fellow creature have seen know what mean there be amount of real misery to be met with in neighbourhood of dock ay over london for matter if one only chooses to keep one eye open of course know that many of beggar match seller people of kind be rank loafer too idle to work even when have chance people who spend in drink penny be given in opinion richly deserve misery suffer there be plenty of others who must be only too happy to work if must be people must seek out help poor woman child know make fairly sick give word miss lascelles when think of vast sum of money be squandered year in way leave nothing to show for expenditure take gambling for instance have heard that thousand of pound be lost year at card playing horse racing money only change hand know what good doe do if man can afford to part with thousand pound in such way how much better must be for everybody else if must expend in furnishing certain number of person with mean to earn own living believe be right for people to squander waste money believe that money be given to people in trust that everybody will have to answer for way in discharge trust miss lascelles certainly do robert answered blanche very gravely must admit have never until now viewed matter in serious light in put must beg pardon do most sincerely for way in spoke to just now have idea that have such good reason a have given for desiring to be rich what must be able to do single handed matter how rich might be ah ejaculated bob with gesture of impatience be just what everybody say be exactly where mischief lie do anything because ca do everything because ca get others to join must look at like must just do duty whether other people did not if others choose to shirk duty be own look out affords excuse for to shirk mine there be use for to talk like perhaps never will be rich gold be there say be very different thing from having banked in england how do think be going to get away from island without discovery may depend upon that whenever go will be in hurry blanche explained captain staunton plan a to carrying off of gold bob shook head dubiously be capital plan admit said success depends upon everything turning out exactly a arranged mark word thing wo turn out way at never do will do favour miss lascelles certainly will robert provided of course that be in power answered blanche thank said bob can do easily enough bring home here get other lady to do same day when return from cavern a many nugget a can conveniently carry say two three pound weight of know hand over to will contrive to find safe hiding place for when moment come for to be off will see that go with if thing be at possible then will not be quite destitute if after have to leave heap in cave behind say anything about to gentleman captain staunton might not like if heard that doubted practicability of plan blanche readily gave desired promise there matter ended for time meanwhile work went steadily forward at shipyard by time that bob be once more able to go on duty framework of schooner be complete planking have be begun whilst battery be in so forward state that fortnight must see ready to receive gun ralli be in high state of delight bob have not be at work many day before discovered that thing be no longer a have be when received hurt greek have never be courteous in behaviour to galatea party now be downright insolent insolence seemed to increase day at outset of work gentleman of party be to say captain staunton lance rex have be required to look on direct progress of work only now lance be only one to whom privilege be granted privilege scorned to accept unshared by others accordingly when bob once more joined working party found friend with coat off sleeve rolled up to shoulder performing same manual labour a rest seeing of course did same thus continued to work until end came bob be greatly surprised at state of thing so much so that sought early opportunity to inquire of lance meaning of lance anyone else in party be however able to give explanation of must say with regard to affair be that ralli have be gradually growing more insolent tyrannical in treatment of until matter have reached then existing unpleasant stage be earnestly cautioned by captain staunton not to mention word respecting to lady a be extremely desirable that must be kept for a long time a possible quite free from anxiety of kind can nothing be done to make fellow mend behaviour inquired bob of skipper a separated from rest of working party walked toward cottage on landing from boat night fear not be reply while schooner battery be still to be built have man to extent in power now that battery be so near completion hull of schooner fully modelled be independent of have sense enough to know own people be quite capable of finishing off schooner now that framework be complete so that threat on part must be useless nay worse than useless since must only irritate lead to increasing severity toward bob lay awake long time night quite satisfied that time have arrived when something ought to be done what that something must be puzzled brain in vain to discover about fortnight after serious accident occurred at shipyard rather at battery structure be now so far advanced that be ready to receive gun be intended to be mounted in armament be to consist of six pounder iron muzzle loader of ordinary old fashioned type to johnson have helped in raid on spanish american coast on morning in question gang of men be told off to hoist gun up cliff into battery lance have a matter of course undertaken supervision of operation work have hardly commenced when ralli made appearance on scene announcing intention to direct operation at battery roughly ordering lance to return at once to work on schooner to be quick about too ralli must freshen way evelin of course returned at once to shipyard without condescending to bandy word with greek work went forward a usual ralli soon have pair of sheers rigged in due time one of gun be slung ready for hoisting lance have be watching ralli operation first with curiosity afterwards with anxiety for soon saw that man knew nothing whatever about handling heavy gun now saw that gun be about to be hoisted be wrongly slung that accident be likely enough to result so forgetting former rebuff threw down tool hurried to place where men be working about gun told to cast off sling have slung wrong lad said unless be very careful of will be hurt cast off sling will show proper way to do men accustomed to working under direction be about to do a bade when ralli looked over parapet angrily ordered to leave lashing a be to sway away gun a for mister soldier said shaking fist at lance have left work contrary to order will seize up to grating give five dozen to night a lesson to now go lance turned on heel walked away thing have come to crisis at last thought began to wonder how crisis be to be met upon one thing be quite resolved be that must never submit to indignity of lash ralli might kill if chose flog never sombre meditation be brought to abrupt ending by sudden crash accompanied by shout of consternation in direction of battery looking way saw tackle dangling empty from sheers with lower block about way up cliff face at base of cliff be men grouped closely together about object be hidden by body suddenly one of men left rest ran toward shipyard shouting for help there have be accident thought lance gun have slipped from sling likely enough somebody be killed muster crowbar handspike can lad said take over to battery there have be accident fear strong relief gang be soon on spot only to find lance fear confirmed gun have be hoisted nearly way up cliff when guide rope have fouled rock armourer have stepped forward to clear in doing so have given jerk have canted gun in sling before unfortunate man have realised danger gun have slipped fallen upon crushing leg to jelly there be immediate outcry among men for lance outcry ralli must have checked if must first attempt to do so showed that men be now in temper must render highly dangerous for to persist so gave in with best grace must muster ordered one of men to fetch evelin to spot on receiving message lance of course at once flung down tool hastened to assistance of injured man when reached scene of catastrophe found hand ralli included crowded round prostrate gun everybody giving order at same time everybody excited everything in state of direst confusion a joined group ralli stepped forward with smile on lip in nowise cloaked chagrin at being obliged to yield to demand of men began see mister soldier can not do without seems after just lend men hand to lance brushed past without deigning slightest notice pushing way through crowd called upon few of men by name to assist in relieving unfortunate armourer from ponderous weight of gun still lay upon poor fellow mangled limb such implicit confidence have men in prisoner among though be that mere presence sufficed to restore to order in few minute armourer ghastly pale with nerve quivering from excruciating pain of terrible injury be safely withdrawn from beneath gun now make stretcher of ah dickinson be man for job just make stretcher good fellow same sort of thing that made for lad bob know let get patient into boat a quickly a possible can hing with here said lance ay ay sir answered dickinson promptly away went with two three more men to set about work lance plying injured man frequently with small dos of rum meanwhile ralli stood upon outskirt of crowd angrily watching proceeding must not shut eye to fact of lance popularity with men vowed within that must make pay dearly for before day be done even if be compelled to seize up flog stretcher be soon ready armourer having be placed upon be carried a carefully a possible down to boat a procession passed shipyard lance beckoned to captain staunton saying will need assistance in case will be case of amputation unless be greatly mistaken if so will require help of someone upon whose nerve can depend captain staunton upon hurried back for coat rejoined lance just a party be on point of embarking in boat a men propelled craft swiftly across bay lance related in loud tone to skipper ralli behaviour during morning threat be still discussing matter anxiously together when dickinson who be pulling stroke oar who doubtless guessed from catching stray word two be subject of conversation broke in upon conference by inquiring of lance whether thought armourer must recover be impossible to say yet answered lance cautiously of course will do best for poor fellow will require more attention than fear ralli will allow to give if be remarked dickinson think need trouble sir greek know too well what be about to interfere with when come to doctoring hinjured man man a be hurt too along of own pride obstinacy a to that other matter flogging know sir axing pardon for speaking about so plain sir trouble about that sha' lay hand upon while mate can pervent will mate that sha' bo ' be eager answer sha' coincided dickinson ca do much to help see sir added 'cause worse luck think alike upon thing have only got to say word to rest of hand know a wo hear of bein ' flogged there be one of what respect sir what respect gentleman for matter have always have good word for everybody that go long way with sailor sometimes further than glass o grog may make mind easy that greek wo be let to to know what sir thank dickinson said lance with outstretched hand thank with heart have relieved of heavy load of anxiety for to tell truth have quite made up mind not to submit to indignity if ralli attempt to carry out threat will probably lead to precipitate action on part at present time must be simply disastrous so 'twould sir so 'twould agreed dickinson need say word sir understands only 'd like to know sir here be very good opportunity for to say whenever time come may reckon upon hand of in here boat how do mean ejaculated lance considerably startled really understand oh be right sir returned dickinson cheerfully war born yesterday ne'er one of suppose a belief have settled down to stay here for rest of nateral life do lord bless sir know must have got plan in head for getting away out of here hole long short of be when be ready to go be ready to lend hand perviding will take with be sick tired of here cursed pirating business want to get away out of have be talking over mate have made up mind that be sartain to be off one of fine day 'd like to go with if will have want to give world trial see if ca end day a honest men ai that mate ay ay bill be mistake have put to gentleman just exactly a wanted what say will say promise make will keep 'em want chance hope that if so be a here gen'lemen be thinking of topping boom out of will just take along with replied man who be pulling bow oar others also murmuring assent what make think have idea of effecting escape how many others of have same opinion inquired captain staunton well know a can rightly say what make think so do answered dickinson p'raps be because have took thing so quiet cheerful like a to how many more of think same a do why ca say be sure have only spoke about to dozen so that knowed must be glad of chance to leave like well said captain staunton after pause really think can say anything to one way just now what have just said have be so utterly unexpected that must have time to think talk matter over among ourselves think may perhaps be able to say something definite to to morrow in answer to proposition think so evelin think so answered lance very well then said skipper let matter rest until to morrow will then tell decision in meantime must be understood that none of say word to anyone else upon subject until have permission promise to effect be readily given by of men then matter dropped boat shortly afterwards reaching landing place at bottom of bay armourer be at once taken out of boat carried by lance direction up to building in slept miserable man be by time in dreadfully exhausted condition on arrival of medicine chest lance mixed powerful stimulating draught under influence of revived so much that evelin felt justified in attempting operation of amputation with captain staunton assistance be speedily successfully performed after patient be placed in hammock lance sat down near at hand announcing intention of watching by poor fellow until next morning operation successfully performed dickinson three companion returned to shipyard maintaining animated anxious consultation on way result of consultation be that when four men resumed work have great deal to say after answering numberless anxious inquiry a to state of wounded man upon subject of ralli treatment of lance threat to flog denounced conduct a not only unjust also impolitic to last degree dwelling strongly upon unadvisability of offending man so skilled a lance in medicine surgery impressing audience with necessity for discouraging if necessary interfering to prevent carrying out of threat a sailor be very much like sheep where one jump rest jump also have not much difficulty in arranging for general demonstration of popular disapproval in event of ralli attempting threatened indignity fortunately for fortunately also in probability for in whom be chiefly interested allowed affair to pas over in going about among worker day overheard enough to feel assured that for moment at event be unpopular man a among such turbulent spirit a with whom have to deal unpopularity mean loss of power own common sense suggested to extreme impolicy of pitting against while continued in so antagonistic mood be quite resolved that if must not have in one way what called revenge must have in from day forward insolence tyranny of demeanour toward lance friend grew more more marked until at length became so unbearable that be driven to very verge of desperation meanwhile lance sitting there watching patient soon saw that be about to have hand full hectic flush of fever began to chase away deadly pallor from sufferer cheek eye glittered sparkled like coal of fire a feeling began to return to hitherto benumbed limb smart of recent operation made felt tossed restlessly in hammock tormented with unquenchable thirst water water muttered for love of god give water lance gave in tin pannikin in instant vessel be glued to unfortunate man lip in instant be drained to last drop more give more gasped a soon a have recovered breath lance declined to do bidding poor fellow be patient for few minute went to medicine chest mixed cooling draught also be swallowed with avidity then armourer lay quiet for few minute not for long however soon began to toss restlessly about once more by time that hand returned from day work at shipyard be in raging fever raving mad in fact lance be at last compelled to have laced up in hammock to prevent from doing serious injury lance evelin will probably remember night a long a life in delirium of fierce fever consumed unhappy armourer be visited by vision of evil deed of past life lance blood curdled in vein a listened to patient disjointed raving of murder rapine cold blooded cruelty of so revolting character that wondered how human mind must conceive in first instance how after have be conceived human hand must bring to perpetrate then man guilty conscience awakened from long torpor acting upon excited imagination conjured up thousand frightful punishment awaiting writhed groaned uttered most frightful curse then in same breath shrieked for forgiveness mercy be perfectly appalling even comrade who have shared with in dreadful deed about raved found scene too trying for hardened blunted feeling such of a have hammock slung in same dormitory abandoned slept in open air rather than remain to have soul harrowed by dreadful utterance terrible state of thing existed until afternoon of following day rather more than twenty four hour after have received injury then fever subsided only to leave once powerful man in last stage of exhaustion so completely prostrate be that have power to so much a lift hand be only able to speak in merest whisper now be time when lance skill be most urgently required fagged a be by long night of watching tended patient with most unremitting assiduity administering tonic stimulant few minute racking brain for device by might help man to tide over period of extreme prostration be of avail poor fellow gradually sank into state of stupor from evelin skill be unable to arouse at length about eight o'clock in evening after temporary revival during terror of death once more assailed guilty soul passed away without opportunity for repentance prayer curse issuing from lip in horrible confusion up to last moment of existence death be witnessed by several of companion in crime while tried to laugh scoff away unwelcome impression scene produced upon mind there be others who went into open air wandered away by to ponder upon miserable ending of crime stained life chapter eighteen alarm disaster lance long fatiguing watch beside death bed of unfortunate armourer of course delayed to extent captain staunton reply to suggestion dickinson have made on behalf of certain of comrade skipper have to save time discussed matter with rest of party coming to conclusion that must be quite justified under circumstance in accepting service of men on morning following armourer death lance having enjoyed good night rest opinion be taken upon question with view of giving men answer forthwith evelin listened attentively to everything be said then remarked well gentleman quite agree with that assistance men have in power to afford must be most valuable must clear away good many of difficulty must go long way toward ensuring success in endeavour to escape endeavour must confess have always secretly regarded with considerable amount of doubt misgiving have always presented to a undertaking of decidedly desperate character now appears more so than ever having regard to very disagreeable change in ralli treatment of only question in mind be one of duty duty to country to world at large must not forget that men who now come to with offer of assistance be men who have in past outraged law human divine justice demand that will be delivered up to punishment now if accept service certainly can not afterwards denounce must be rank treachery on part how do propose to overcome difficulty have thought of replied captain staunton be only question have bothered for own part can only see one solution of word have be true be said by a to keeping secret think there can be doubt that stipulation be intended to be understood in case fully agree with that can not justly avail ourselves of assistance afterwards hand over to authority view of case be here be in what be beyond doubt most desperate scrape chance very slight chance be offer for escape most opportunely men come forward with offer of assistance if let slip slight chance be extremely doubtful whether will ever have that imagine taking into account future possibility of evil in store for helpless woman dependent upon count for something justifies be accepting help from almost source then a regard men be undoubtedly true that have committed crime place quite outside pale of human mercy if justice alone be to be considered for own part believe that have repented of past misdeed at rate say so have reason to doubt truth of assertion ask for opportunity to reform desire chance of making amends a far a possible for past evil of life have idea gentleman though in giving chance might not be acting in accordance with man idea of strict justice must be following pretty closely upon god idea of break not bruised reed quenches smoking flax if thus declares readiness to give even most doubtful unpromising of creature trial really see that be called upon to be more strict than be proposal therefore be that must accept men proffered assistance that must do what may be able to do for in way of giving opportunity desire if justice be to overtake if punishment be to follow past misdeed let be due to other agency than ours if god intends to suffer punishment at hand of fellow creature will provide instrument never fear think far more likely will give chance too believe will said lance take view of matter confess with shame have not presented to be convinced men have committed crime of exceptional enormity be true be not for to draw line to say to whom mercy will be granted from whom will be withheld therefore let accept offer leave matter of punishment in god hand thus then be decided bob a least likely to excite suspicion if seen in conversation with of pirate be deputed to inform dickinson that offer that of mate have be accepted to request to call without exciting observation if possible at cottage that evening when gentleman returned home at close of day work found blanche violet in state of considerable nervous excitement owing asserted to having be frightened that day while at work of gold collecting in cavern on being asked for detailed account of circumstance have alarmed violet said have be at work about two hour have just reached edge of gulf with second load when be startled by hearing somewhere near sound like deep long drawn sigh followed almost immediately afterwards by loud moan have doubt will think dreadful coward be use concealing truth simply dropped gold flew back along passage to great cavern at utmost speed arrived there sat down to recover at length succeeded so far that be inclined to believe have be victimised by own imagination know what eerie place be how likely to excite weird fancy in mind of nervous timid woman like ourselves so summoned up courage went to work once more naturally felt somewhat reluctant to visit scene of fright again overcame feeling made third journey to chasm without experiencing further shock to nerve on fourth journey however have reached place deposited load have just set out to return when same sound be repeated much more loudly than at first accompanied time by loud prolonged hiss such a must imagine must proceed only from gigantic serpent be thoroughly terrified time fled once more not only to cavern thence into open air home know how may regard matter in morning at present really feel a though must ever venture into place again until mystery have be solved cause of terrifying sound discovered of course not said captain staunton none of must attempt to visit cavern again until have have opportunity of investigating matter be possible though mind think at probable that serpent large reptile of kind may have made way into gallery at event will never do for lady to run slightest risk what do think evelin added turning to lance be likely that there may be snake something of sort there not likely must say responded lance have never encountered reptile of description large small in course of ramble about island of course there be just bare possibility can not put stronger than of snake drifting here on uprooted tree large branch have heard of snake being seen in branch of tree drifting down river in flood time there be reason why under such circumstance must not be carried clear out to sea whether however serpent must exist long enough to make voyage from mainland to island be in opinion exceedingly doubtful still quite agree with that lady ought not to make further visit to cavern until have discovered source of alarm singular circumstance gave rise to considerable amount of speculation among member of party be still discussing matter when knocking be heard at door in obedience to captain staunton stentorian come in dickinson entered sarvent lady exclaimed new comer with elaborate sea scrape then seating in chair captain staunton indicated continued well cap'n gentleman have just comed up see in obedience to command of forenoon sent through young gentleman there pointing to bob to talk matter over a be be right dickinson answered captain staunton be very glad to see robert of course told that have decided to accept assistance of such of shipmate a be to be thoroughly relied upon did sir right glad thankful be to hear replied dickinson of course knowed right well sir how much be axing of when offered to chime in on side be just axing that 'd take upon trust a be believe in honesty straight for'ard ness of men a have proved theirselves to be rogue worse have took sir sha' have cause to repent be yours heart soul hence for'ard take order from be ready to take oath like upon oath be necessary good fellow said captain staunton bare word be quite sufficient for if intend to be faithful to will be so without swearing fidelity if mean to betray oath must hardly stop be afraid doubt fidelity in least only thing have fear about be prudence ah yes there sir may fail said dickinson with mournful shake of head give order sir will do best to obey afore lay plan think ought to know how thing be standing among just now be greatly afeared be like so many young bear with trouble afore that greek rascal ralli have be doin ' best to stir up hand of against particler against mr evelin by saying a be along of a poor armourer lost life hold a how killed by taking off leg that desarves to be severely punished for doing of there be of chap a be fool enough to listen to what say to believe too there be tom poole two three more be going to hold out to that did best must for poor chap that if have have ' be for ralli own obstinacy man must never have be hurt at however thing go may depend upon to give timely warning thank dickinson said captain staunton information have just given be most valuable render more necessary that must promptly mature plan now to show how thoroughly trust will explain plan a far a have yet arranged can then tell think of will also be better able to understand in what way shipmate can prove of most use to well if beat exclaimed dickinson after captain staunton have stated plan to think a must go for to arrange to run away with schooner why thought most 'd do must be to provision seize launch go off to sea in taking chance of being picked up time well there ai soul amongst know a have so much a ghost of hidee about taking schooner of hand seems to have kind of notion have found out since spoke to t'other day that may try to slip off day if get chance just laugh at know asks how be to manage how far 'd get in boat afore schooner 'd be alongside of that like plan right one cap'n mistake about now just say what want chap to do will do if be way possible how many of be there asked skipper how many mean upon whom can absolutely depend bear in mind that one who be not thoroughly trustworthy be to be let into secret right sir trust for answered dickinson for own sake letting alone yours lady may depend o wo let out secret to wrong people well let just reckon up how many of there will be in firstly there be eight of counting in mr bowles kit leaving out lady then there be three other lad four men a be brought in with seven seven eight fifteen interjected skipper thank'ee sir ai much of hand at figgers in course be right fifteen be said dickinson then there be tom poole pertickler mate promoted be to armourer berth dick sullivan ned master be four more making fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen nineteen ai sir quite right answered captain staunton then there be prisoner a call men know sir a have be took out of ship must jine brotherhood wo say much about just yet there be about dozen very likely hand among that think will just jump at chance of getting out of tom will sound 'em cautious like hear what have got to say for theirselves very well said captain staunton in meantime seems that there be nineteen of told who be to be absolutely relied upon quite enough to handle schooner if can only manage to get away with now what have to do be ballast water tank be already fixed in place so need not trouble must contrive to get tank filled a early a possible then a soon a deck be laid must get conveyed on board provision can possibly manage then will want arm ammunition gun too must be hoisted in under pretence of fitting slide properly spar be already commenced at least lower mast bowsprit must be stepped before craft be launched that can easily be managed think other spar also must be finished got on board a early a possible likewise sail there be store of kind also to be got on board in short must like to have craft in state of readiness to go to sea directly leaf stock really see how be to be managed will never be able to do quarter of what want without arousing ralli suspicion oh bless sir yes will said dickinson confidently ralli be taken mortal dislike to bepecially to mr evelin sorry be to say so just hate to be dictated to now whatever want just let mr evelin tell ought to do opposite of take word for will just go do exactly what think want to will do out of sheer contrariness whether now that know what be wanted be mate will do a much of a can will have to manage ralli so to get rest very well dickinson said skipper understand other fully now so will not detain longer do what can to forward plan let know from time to time what success be meeting with right sir will thank'ee sir good night lady gentleman dickinson taking hint retired gentleman sat for hour two after talking over matter a smoked pipe then captain staunton lance bowles rose left cottage to pay visit to cavern in due time reached place proceeding at once to chasm where forthwith commenced vigorous unsuccessful search for origin of mysterious sound have disturbed lady finding nothing began task of conveying gold collected day across to heap on other side of gulf heap be now assuming goodly proportion there be more of than ordinary ship boat must take at single trip even in calmest of weather lance be in act of remarking to captain staunton that thought enough have now be collected to satisfy want when weird unearthly moan smote upon ear from depth of abyss sound though not particularly loud be so startling echoing reverberating a did among cavernous recess far below that work be brought to sudden standstill three bewildered men felt hair bristling a listened what in heaven name can be ejaculated skipper a turned startled gaze upon lance impossible to say answered latter one thing however be certain human lung must possibly give utterance to sound yet know echo of place may have property of magnifying prolonging there be there anyone below continued raising torch aloft peering with craned neck down into black depth of chasm there be response light of torch be quite inadequate to illumination of more than few foot from surface be possible that if there be anyone down there may be unable to hear sound rise know here bowles come across to side will unite voice see if will evoke response said lance bowles scrambled nimbly along narrow dangerous pathway having traversed so often now have terror for of speedily joined others now said lance will count three then will shout together hillo ' one two three hillo cry went pealing away right left of along dark gallery echo taking up tossing wildly from side to side up down until seemed a though rock in vast cavern have found voice with to mock answering cry came from below there be one there said lance indeed there can be one there nobody have be missed hark what be that long drawn sobbing sigh such a child will utter after have cried to sleep very much louder immediately afterwards gust of hot air brought with distinct odour of sulphur swept past down gallery god of mercy can be possible ejaculated lance yes must be fly for life may not have moment to lose what be gasped captain staunton a three started at run up gallery in direction of great cavern volcano answered lance there be subterranean fire in activity at great depth beneath foot may break into open eruption at moment be enough companion wanted to hear more few word have already heard lent wing to foot in incredibly short time found panting exhausted with unwonted exertion once more in open air now be comparatively safe said lance a walked rapidly down ravine what chiefly feared be one of earthquake shock such a sometimes precede volcanic eruption comparatively insignificant one might have proved sufficient to cause wall of cavern to collapse bury of course lady must be cautioned not to venture near place again think perhaps will be better not to tell why will only alarm perhaps unnecessarily keep on tiptoe of nervous anxious expectancy better plan will be to say that consider have now a much gold a think probable will be able to take away think so staunton assuredly do answered skipper emphatically why must not allow wife to enter cavern again for gold contains reached cottage without further adventure on following morning lady be told by captain staunton sufficient gold having now be collected there must be further necessity for to continue visit to cavern moreover mr evelin considered unsafe peculiar noise have startled being in opinion indication of liability to collapse at moment after month passed away unmarked by anything worthy of record except ever increasing insolence tyranny of ralli toward unfortunate friend battery be by time complete gun mounted ammunition stored in magazine whilst schooner be also in very forward state be fully planked deck laid ballast stowed bulwark hatchway completed bottom coppered up to load water line hull outside painted with coat of priming carpenter assisted by handiest men must pick out be busy finishing off fitting of cabin forecastle lance have be anxiously watching for favourable opportunity to put into operation dickinson suggestion a to mode in ralli must be approached in order to secure completion of work in manner most favourable to own plan hitherto such opportunity have presented be peculiarly unfortunate a work be now in so forward state whenever ralli opened mouth expected to hear dreaded order given for preparation of way construction of cradle for launching at length coveted opportunity came be about nine o'clock in morning when lance saw ralli step out of gig on to rocky platform at lower end of shipyard walk straight toward schooner greek paused at little distance from where lance be at work taking up position from must obtain favourable view of vessel beautifully modelled hull gracefully sweeping line then with one eye shut began critical scrutiny of shifting position few inch occasionally in order to test perfection of various curve now lance thought be time must tackle at once come of will never do to defer matter further hour delay may upset plan so throwing down tool stepped up to ralli said want to speak to about launch have now done nearly that can do to schooner whilst remains on stock next job will be to lay down way ralli turned suddenly upon with evil gleam glitter in eye spoke volume a to envy hatred bore to man who though prisoner practically slave still revealed in word gesture vast unmistakable superiority to other man on island ruler included aha mister soldier said using mode of address for reason known only to deemed most offensive to lance lip curling into sneering smile a spoke what be doing away from work go back to at once unless wish to start with rope end a must unruly boy have work to go back to said lance be simply wasting time at present wanted to learn wish a to what be to be done next presume will have craft launched forthwith a be now ready to take to water must be glad to know what timber be to use for way presume will have craft launched at once repeated ralli spirit of opposition rising strong within sneer upon lip growing more bitter with word uttered why must presume such thing eh sare because be right proper thing to do answered lance lubber know that ship be launched before be rigged besides if be to decide upon having spar stepped rigged store stowed gun hoisted in before leaf stock must have lot of extra trouble in calculating proper distribution of weight so a to ensure being in proper trim when take to water want to avoid that if possible greek grinned with vindictive delight a listened to apparently inadvertent admission on lance part revealed to a thought new unexpected method of inflicting annoyance upon man whom hated so thoroughly eye fairly sparkled with malice a answered what do suppose care about extra trouble lazy skulking hound tell will have spar stepped rigged put in place running rigging rove sail bent gun mounted magazine stowed store water put on board everything ready for schooner to go straight out to sea from stock before leaf poole dickinson to two chum who be working at great distance come here listen to what say stupid fellow soldier who think sailor say that schooner ought to be launched at once say that will be finished ready for sea before leaf stock place dickinson in charge of work to see that order be obeyed fellow will no longer give order will be only common workman will obey in future will freshen way with rope end understand ay ay answered dickinson understands yer ralli will do too never fear with scowl at lance for ralli benefit why man must be fool perfect fool not to see a 'd be ever so much easier to get thing aboard now than when be afloat now turning to lance just top boom git away back to work at once let see more skulking 'd better look out lance simply shrugged shoulder a be habit whenever received insolence from member of brotherhood turning on heel walked back to work secretly exulting in complete success of manoeuvre dickinson looked after contemptuously for moment two then face clouding remarked arter wish have spoke quite so rough to chap got head screwed on right way know mortal sight of thing a understand 'd have ' be glad to have ' have help adwice like in many little job a be afeared will make bit of bungle of without be right said ralli will be able to talk over dickinson be bit civil to will tell that will want to know leave what call bullying to will take care that enough have of now on same morning only hour two after conversation just recorded there occurred unfortunate incident completely dissipated lance exultation filling with direst most anxious foreboding threatening to utterly upset success of carefully arranged plan happened thus timber be required by carpenter on board schooner dickinson eager to properly play part in presence of greek who be standing close by ordered lance captain staunton to bring up large heavy plank pointed out accordingly shouldered staggering under load proceeded upon way led close past spot where ralli stood a be passing unfortunately happened that lance stepped upon small spar rolling under foot caused to stagger in such way that plank struck ralli full in mouth knocking away three four teeth cutting open lip fellow reeled backwards with severity of blow recovering whipped out long knife pale a death with passion rushed upon lance captain staunton saw what be about to happen shouted in warning look out evelin flinging plank to ground at same instant in such way a to momentarily check rush of greek lance at call turned round be just in time to save from ugly blow by catching ralli uplifted arm in left hand pirate lithe supple a serpent writhed twisted in lance grasp in effort to get free be in vain be helpless a child in iron grasp of stalwart soldier be at length compelled to fling knife to ground own vanquished sooner be once more free than calling to aid dozen of most ruffianly of band ordered to seize lance skipper to lash hand foot until iron must be brought riveted on be done hour afterwards to grief consternation of concerned in plan of escape two to whom chiefly looked for success be marched off to black hole man ankle being connected together by couple of close fitting iron band two long fetter link chapter nineteen bob give way to violence great be consternation distress at staunton cottage night when worker returned from shipyard reported arrest imprisonment of captain staunton lance evelin that two must be placed in durance at be regarded a serious misfortune coming a did at so critical time just a work on schooner be drawing near completion when long looked for opportunity to escape might present at almost moment be justly regarded a disaster of gravest character imprisoned men be two who have most completely retained coolness self possession throughout whole of revers have befallen party be fertile brain have devised audaciously daring plan of escape without rest of party felt that dare not do anything for fear of marring whole scheme there be still misfortune attending arrest supposing favourable opportunity presented for carrying out of plan must not be seized so long a two men be prisoner even to dale be fully agreed that escape without be not to be thought of for moment for two of party poor mr staunton blanche there be still source of anxiety now that ralli have at last completely laid aside mask of friendliness have at first concealed feeling of ill will now that have cast off last remains of semblance of forbearance to what terrible length might not allow vindictiveness to carry must stop short at humiliation of imprisonment fetter be not too greatly to be dreaded that must now proceed also to active violence fear be fully shared by rest of party be careful to hide from two poor heart broken woman who be chiefly interested in prisoner striving rather to inspire with hope did not entertain long most anxious discussion of situation night rex bowles taking lead by virtue of superior resolution experience be productive of absolutely result except to place additional damper upon already sufficiently depressed spirit bob said nothing like queen parrot thought more brook frankly acknowledged quite unequal to emergency a did dale cheerfully stated readiness to do anything might be directed to do here may be stated that misfortune have be gradually doing for latter a doe for so many people what prosperity have utterly failed to do have be driving out of peevishness of temper that utter selfishness of character have be most disagreeable characteristic have developed in place almost cheerful resignation to circumstance readiness to think act for others promised to make of eventually man whom must be possible to respect esteem following day brought with full revelation of state of thing friend must have to expect in future captain staunton lance being taken out of confinement only to be employed day in fetter upon work of most laborious description locked up again at night in loathsome black hole while for benefit of whole party for rest of prisoner also for matter ralli have provided with colt applied with merciless severity to shoulder whenever humour seized last indignity be almost greater than must bear lance saw that time be not yet ripe for action that there be really nothing for to bear everything in dignified silence at present with a much fortitude a must summon to aid managed to whisper a much to bob to request to pas word to others at interval during day bob did before day be over most of prisoner excepting belonging to galatea party have have enough of ralli colt signified readiness to join brotherhood be accordingly sworn in at nightfall on return from work most unfortunate state of affair have prevailed for nearly fortnight during ralli arrangement for entire completion of schooner whilst yet upon stock have be pressed vigorously forward when dickinson found in position to announce to greek that three day must see schooner ready for sea that sufficient number of men being now at liberty to proceed with work time have arrived for laying down of way construction of cradle eye of greek sparkled with delight three day only three day more four at most time for have so anxiously waited must have arrived time when must find master not only of battery must enable to hold island against comer johnson included rather johnson especially also of smart little craft capable of sailing round round albatross heavily enough armed to meet upon equal term let three four day pas without interruption with what sincere delight must view approach of johnson brig with what warm unexpected welcome must receive rubbed hand with fiendish glee a thought of slapped dickinson playfully on shoulder a bid commence necessary work forthwith thereupon dickinson boldly stated that must have advice assistance of captain staunton lance a did know enough about cradle way suchlike to build properly must find anybody on island a did ex boatswain mate be in hope that proposition of must load to at least temporary amelioration of condition of two friend if not absolute establishment of better state of thing hope be unexpectedly effectually quenched by announcement that greek knew about intended to superintend part of work time have now arrived when definite plan of action at decisive moment ought to be fully agreed upon feeling dickinson arose from bunk about midnight night lighting pipe sauntered in direction of black hole hoping for opportunity to confer finally arrange matter with prisoner confined therein to great disappointment chagrin found door of place small low building roughly very solidly constructed of stone with window mean of ventilation save such a be afforded by momentary opening of door for ingres egress guarded by couple of most ruffianly of pirate fellow who be completely creature of ralli who have on more than one occasion thrown out strong hint of suspicion that dickinson be on more friendly term than ought to be with men now in confinement to searching inquiry a to reason for dickinson untimely suspicious visit to ex boatswain mate be driven to reply with complaint a to extreme heat closeness of night of inability to sleep in consequence restlessness being such a to constrain to rise come outside for smoke chat with somebody there being one else to chat with have just come to to explanation added careless offer to relieve of guard for rest of night offer provoked expression of unqualified suspicion from guard that at once saw be treading on very dangerous ground be accordingly fain to abandon well intentioned effort to communicate with inside prison door driven thus into corner resolved to get word two if possible with inmate of staunton cottage accordingly sauntered off taking very roundabout way a long a thought at possible for movement to be seen by already suspicious guard dickinson complaint a to heat closeness of night be quite sufficiently well founded to have be accepted a perfectly genuine be pitchy dark sky being obscured by thin veil of cloud be yet sufficiently dense to completely obscure light of star air be still to extent of stagnation temperature be so unusually high that dickinson found mere act of walking even at idle sauntering pace have adopted laborious exertion in great oppressive stillness prevailed hoarse thunder of trampling surf upon rocky shore of island smote so loudly upon ear a to be almost startling to lonely wanderer there in stifling darkness sound seemed to bring vague mysterious premonition of disaster dickinson have almost reached cottage when became conscious of sound rising above of roaring surf sound a of heavily laden wagon approaching over rough stony road of heavy train rumbling through tunnel at great depth beneath surface of earth sound dull muffled still swept rapidly toward from seaward at moment of greatest intensity there be for instant vibrating jar of ground beneath foot next moment have passed sound swept onward toward interior of island until again became lost in hollow roar of distant breaker somewhat startled by singular unusual phenomenon dickinson hurried forward soon stood beneath wall of cottage light be still burning in one of upper room so seizing handful of fine gravel flung against window in hope of quietly attracting attention of inmate after two three essay effort be rewarded with success window being softly opened bowles head thrust out with low spoken ejaculation hillo below there be dickinson be equally low spoken response if be not turned in 'd be glad to have few word with of yer right lad said bowles will be down in jiffey nothing else gone wrong hope said dickinson only want to make few arrangement be in minute ladder be cautiously lowered rex bowles joined visitor say gen'lemen did hear anything pecoolyer few minute ago be dickinson first remark yes said rex did unless be greatly mistaken have be visited by slight shock of earthquake eh well if 'tai nothing worse than mind be response see know much about 'arthquakes not bein ' used to 'em felt bit scared just at first own if so be a be only 'arthquake why be all right if anything like happens like to know if be only to keep mind quiet ai what have come up here to rouse gen'lemen out in middle watch about be just here therewith proceeded to lay before hearer own view of state of affair pointing out to fact already keenly recognised by that moment for action might now present at time explaining own anxiety for definite arrangement of plan of operation together with agreement upon certain preconcerted signal to be of such character a must be easily understood by initiated while unlikely to arouse suspicion of rest long conference ensued at close of dickinson quietly returned to hammock with greatly relieved mind others also retired not to sleep felt that decisive moment be at hand moment upon right use of depended liberty if not life for be fully persuaded that if first attempt failed must never be allowed to have though still anxious recent talk with dickinson have made more hopeful of success than have ever felt before hitherto have always be haunted by lurking doubt now began for first time to think that there really be fair prospect of succeeding if faced danger difficulty of attempt with boldness resolution chief anxiety now be how to free two comrade to be a yet quite unable to see way anxiety distress be greatly increased on following day by finding that ralli have given order that two prisoner skipper lance be henceforth to be kept in close confinement altogether with double guard fully armed at door instead of being released during day to work with others at shipyard to be confined at in noisome black hole be bad enough fortnight incarceration have already told visibly on health of prisoner even when have have opportunity of breathing pure atmosphere during day now that be doomed to remain in place day night friend became seriously alarmed felt that sentence be tantamount to one of slow certain death most trying part of be that there seemed possibility of affording succour to doomed men attempt to help relieve must be devised except such a must necessarily bring party into immediate collision with ralli myrmidon greek have now entirely laid aside pretence of treating prisoner with show of consideration have served purpose have made tool a long a assistance have be necessary to advancement of ambitious scheme now help be no longer necessary to felt free to gratify without stint malignant vindictive feeling with have from first regarded one two of too notably lance captain staunton have on more than one occasion successfully opposed in effort to have thing entirely own way that also must be amply atoned for so now amused at interval in devising fresh indignity in planning new hardship to be heaped upon unfortunate galatea party be in vindictive spirit on second evening after dickinson midnight visit ralli walked up to cottage unceremoniously opening door obtruded unexpected most unwelcome presence upon inmate a made appearance conversation have be of somewhat animated character suddenly ceased noted circumstance a glanced suspiciously round room with feature twisted into now too familiar malicious smile bowing with sarcastic affectation of politeness remarked be afraid sudden appearance have interrupted very interesting conversation if so be vary sorray pray go on allow praisance to be what call ah yes have restraint then suddenly changing manner a naturally suspicious nature asserted demanded what be talking about tell insist be talking about matter chiefly interesting to ourselves answered bowles if 't have be anything wanted to know 'd have sent for have big strong friend how be funny to night want to make laugh at be not all right wait till to morrow then will make laugh at be that will be funny then returned ralli with evil smile broadening on face eye beginning to sparkle with anger well continued since will not so civil be a answer polite question will tell have come to say be men be working after very lazy fashion be truth for living from now intend that woman oh beg pardon must have said lady will work for too be not more going to allow laziness must work beginning to morrow here be announcement fairly took away breath of party ralli saw consternation speech have produced laughed in hearty enjoyment of tell what be good sir said rex recovering presence of mind may say what please a to manner in work know a well a do that service be ample payment for food lodging lady get a to working why be simply preposterous what can do what can do repeated ralli have have will tell very dear sair what can do what will do there be three of shild one will do cooking for men one will clean out sleeping room repair men clothes make hammock one prettiest one will cook for keep cabin in order make mend clothes attend to generally a for shild will gather firewood ah there be come kees little girl may have in fact at moment entered room with happy laugh catching sight of ralli laugh be broken off short sought shelter safety by mother side from manifested very decided disinclination to move at ralli invitation come here kees little girl repeated greek anger rapidly rising a saw how unmistakably child shrank from must please excuse said mr staunton with difficulty restraining expression of resentment child have not be accustomed to kiss stranger come kees little girl repeated ralli for third time holding out arm to may entirely ignoring mr staunton remark sardonic smile glittering eye be reverse of attractive to child besides knew said resolutely will not kiss love be naughty wicked cruel man locked up dear papa mr evelin wo let come home to hush may darling began mr staunton warning came too late unlucky word have be spoken ralli smarting under sense of humiliation from scorn loathing of so freely displayed by pretty child scarcely more than baby yet sprang to foot seizing may roughly by arm dragged with brutal force away from mother side before anyone must interfere drew out colt struck savagely with twice across poor little lightly clad shoulder little creature shrieked aloud with cruel pain a writhed in ruffianly grasp of pirate yet fiendish heart of tormenter felt mercy lust of cruelty be aroused colt be raised third time to strike blow never fell bob be nearest to pirate when made unexpected attack upon may though occurrence be too sudden to admit of interfering in time to prevent first two blow be on hand by time that third be ready to fall with yell of rage more like of wild beast than of man sprang upon ralli dealing with clenched left hand so terrific blow under chin that pirate lower jaw be shattered tongue cut almost in two then quick a flash of light released poor may from villain grasp wrenched colt out of hand whilst wretch still writhed in agony upon ground where have fallen under force of bob first fearful blow thrashed with until clothes be cut from back shoulder barred with close network of livid bloody weal miserable cowardly wretch screamed at first more piercingly even than poor may have done bob commanded silence so imperatively with such frightful threat that ralli be fairly cowed into submitting to rest of fearful punishment in silence save for such low moan a be utterly unable to suppress a may well be supposed startlingly sudden scene of violence be productive of utmost confusion in room where originated lady hastily seizing poor little moaning may in arm beat precipitate retreat while men sprang to foot tried for time in vain to drag bob away from victim lad be now tall stalwart broad shouldered fellow anger be thoroughly roused by greek cruel cowardly conduct be not until have pretty well exhausted in infliction of well deserved punishment that suffered to be dragged away be now too in desperate emergency with friend found in moment brought face to face that bob showed sterling stuff of be made cutting short horrified remonstrance of friend took rein of affair in own hand issuing instruction a coolly a though have be leader day of life time have come said mr bowles get piece of rope lash that fellow hand heel together gag rest of get few trap together tell lady to do same let muster down at landing a quickly a possible be off to warn dickinson rest to release captain mr evelin ah may a well take a eye fell upon brace of revolver in ralli belt withdrew weapon hastily examined by light of lamp to ascertain whether be loaded found that be then repeating injunction a to rapidity of action slipped pistol one into pocket opened door disappeared in darkness once fairly clear of house bob paused for minute two to collect thought then walked on again toward large building in men be housed on reaching coolly thrust head in at open door looked round a though in search of someone well matey what be asked one of pirate be dickinson here inquired bob boldly think be be reply yes there be over there here dickinson be wanted ay ay answered dickinson who want do answered bob mr ralli say be to shift over at once be simply form of word have be agreed on when dickinson paid midnight visit to cottage meant that moment for action have arrived that muster be to be made at landing place sudden summons took dickinson rather by surprise though have be schooling to expect at moment instantly recovered however rising to foot with well assumed air of reluctance asked doe mean that be to go now to night said at once answered bob oh very well growled dickinson s'pose must obey order here tom poole sullivan master glanced eye round room apparently hesitating whom to choose gradually picking out one after other men who have cast in lot with friend muster kit then go up to capstan house have got to turn in aboard battery to night beauty men named taking cue from dickinson acting up to instruction already received assumed sulky unwilling demeanour a set about work of packing small quantity of already carefully selected clothes in bag growling grumbling at having to turn out just when be thinking of tumbling into hammock so on using utmost expedition same in little over ten minute from time of first being called men sixteen in number stood in large loft of capstan house poole have brought with key of arm chest opening case rapidly served out to man cutlas with belt pair of six chambered revolver one of have fully loaded only day before in preparation for such emergency a present chest be then relocked left being too heavy for to carry away with to say nothing of suspicion act must excite if witnessed a must almost certainly be poole slipped key back into pocket again knowing that strength of chest solidity of lock be such a to involve expenditure of considerable amount of time in breaking open minute of detention suffered by pirate must now be almost worth man life to escaping party now lad said dickinson be yer ready then march down to beach go seizes two whale boat eight of to boat mind there be to be getting into boat shoving off until lady gentleman from hut here mayhap will have to make fight of on beach yet so keep dry land under foot until have order contrariwise men descended ladder leading from capstan house loft ranging in small compact body two abreast marched down to landing place being joined on way by half dozen curious idler who have turned out to see what be in wind dickinson be most anxious to get rid of unwelcome attendant did must think of to persuade to return to house though quite unsuspicious a yet be not to be persuaded preferred rather to march alongside other party keeping up constant fire of such jest witticism a sailor be wont to indulge in bob from secluded shadowy corner watched party a long a must see then began to look out for own particular friend have not long to wait barely five minute afterwards saw also pas down on way to boat allowed sufficient time to reach boat then set off at brisk pace to black hole soon reached on approach be promptly challenged by two guard who happened to be same two truculent ruffian who be on guard when dickinson tried to communicate with prisoner in reply to challenge bob informed that be wanted by ralli immediately at cottage being most distant building that have order to keep guard until return what be wanted for be suspicious question oh believe there be more people to be locked up here answered bob nonchalantly right answered one who have asked question come on mike young swab mind let soul come near here while be gone if do ralli will just skin yer d hear right answered bob placing back against door go on wo give ralli chance to skin never fear be good deal more likely to skin if look sharp two guard accordingly set out in direction of cottage have not gone dozen step before returned cursing swearing most horribly here young cub what be pas word damn if have forgotten that exclaimed one of making towards bob with outstretched hand stand back said bob if advance step will shoot like dog pas word pas word demanded ruffianly pair give pas word at once by will split skull with cutlas bob saw that have not moment to lose that life hung upon thread that moreover if allowed fellow to overpower whole scheme must probably fail therefore whipped out pistol taking rapid aim pulled trigger at same instant there be single report one of men staggered forward shot through body whilst other threw up arm fell back heavily to ground with bullet in brain bob remembered for many long day afterwards often saw in dream at night wild despairing glare in eye of dying pirate a flash of pistol glanced upon glazing eyeball for instant have time to think about such thing now stooping down applying mouth to keyhole said loud enough to be heard by within stand clear in there be about to blow lock to piece be robert time have come fire away lad be reply will not hurt bob applied muzzle of pistol to lock pulled trigger fortunately lock be not particularly strong one supplementary kick sent door flying open captain staunton lance at once emerged from dark noisome prison glanced eagerly around thank robert hurriedly exclaimed skipper there be time to say more now know so tell what be to do lad will do bob pointed to prostrate body of two pirate said take arm then must make rush to landing firing be sure to have raised alarm must not be helped how be where be manacle slipped off lad moment heard voice answered skipper price fine fellow that be managed that for by putting in iron several size too large for now evelin be ready fancy hear footstep running way ready said lance then off go exclaimed bob way gentleman sharp round to right for couple of hundred yard then straight for landing will give better chance if pirate suspect anything place to cut off away went trio at racing pace bob slightly taking lead striking sharply away to right be well for that did so a be thus enabled to dodge crowd of men who came excitedly running up from landing on hearing pistol shot party from cottage have safely reached boat few minute before dickinson having very cleverly got through crowd on landing place by calling out in authoritative voice a soon a saw coming now then lad make way there make way for prisoner to pas men accordingly gave way forming lane in midst through friend passed in fear trembling exposed for minute so to coarsest ribaldry ruffianly band must summon to lip on spur of moment be not until have be passed safely into two whale boat dickinson little band have drawn closely up with drawn cutlass in compact line between boat shore that suspicion of pirate became in least aroused then there gradually arose eager whispering among suspicious glance be turned first upon dickinson party then toward building upon noise of shot being heard set out at run in direction of sound fully persuaded that affair have somehow fallen out of joint with that be quite time for to be stirring have run about distance between boat capstan house when someone caught glimpse of three flying figure indistinctly made out through gloom alarm be instantly given in moment entire crowd have turned sharply off in pursuit now became neck neck race between two party a to must reach boat first pirate be poor runner not being much accustomed to kind of exercise so unfortunately be two out of three fugitive of whom be in chase bob be fleet a deer for short distance be far too loyal to leave two friend poor fellow weak cramped a be with recent confinement already began to feel limb dragging heavy a lead over ground pirate gained upon rapidly presently one of pursuer be so near that must hear panting heavily behind keep steadily on murmured bob a pushed in for moment between two companion will stop fellow then allowing skipper to pas ahead of sprang suddenly aside grasping one of pistol by barrel brought down butt of weapon heavily upon pirate head a rushed past fellow staggered pace two further then fell heavily to ground where lay face downwards partially stunned until comrade came to assistance a fortunately stopped gathered round man raising to foot eagerly questioning diversion thus created gave three fugitive time to reach boat without further molestation here be of course received with open arm before greeting be half exchanged armed guard have turned to boat exerting whole strength shot out upon glassy water of bay springing in at same moment taking to oar without instant delay a soon a boat head be turned round fairly pointed away from shore toward shipyard dickinson taking off hat in salutation to captain staunton said in loud voice so that in boat must hear now sir be fairly launched upon here henterprise at last may luck go with have have to manage a best must for last few day since be locked up know sir now a be free again want to understand a look upon a lawful leader cap'n that from henceforth have got to do be to give order will obey chapter twenty night of terror captain staunton first act after suitably acknowledging dickinson expression of fealty be to inquire how crisis have be brought about explanation made eye flash fire ground teeth clenched fist with rage a thought of how must have punished ruffian who have laid such brutal hand upon little pet when explanation be complete wrung bob hand until fairly ached a thanked for what have done meanwhile poor may still lay in mother arm moaning with pain when skipper took on knee little creature once more screamed out complained that hurt shoulder upon lance thinking that something must be wrong made careful examination of child when be found that ralli brutal violence have resulted in dislocation of shoulder be of course at once pulled back into place poor little creature scream at pain of operation be terrible to hear captain staunton in hastiness of anger registered solemn vow that if ever again met ralli must make wretch pay dearly for brutality how little dreamed of terrible circumstance under must next see miserable man two whale boat sped swiftly across glassy surface of bay propelled by six stalwart oarsman little jet of phosphorescent water spouting up under sharp stem long ripple spreading out undulating away on side of dozen tiny whirlpool of liquid fire swirling in wake of a crew strained at stout ash oar until bent again night have grown black a pitch not solitary star be visible heat be so intense a to be almost insufferable men thought nothing of in eagerness zeal now that have taken decisive step of throwing up old life of crime have fairly enrolled once more on side of law order in very short time boat have made passage across bay be brought with easy graceful sweep alongside landing at shipyard occupant quickly disembarked while lady proceeded at once under care guidance of rex bob to safe comfortable quarter in schooner spacious cabin captain staunton gave order that two large fire must be immediately lighted one on side of landing for double purpose of affording light to work by of enabling to perceive approach of enemy for remarked to lance may depend upon that suspicion be thoroughly aroused by time will not be long before be after to see what mean couple of huge heap of shaving chip end of timber be speedily collected ignited blaze soaring high in motionless air throwing strong ruddy light for considerable distance round then lance with bowles dickinson poole three four other reliable hand armed with torch went carefully round schooner inspecting cradle be unfinished lance thought that couple of hour more of energetic labour expended upon must make sufficiently secure to enable to effect launch time be now of immense value to must not afford to be very particular so long a cradle must serve purpose be cared about accordingly set to with will very soon yard resounded with harsh rasping of saw heavy blow of maul wedging timber into place in meantime captain staunton with rest of party went on board schooner after fully arming with cutlas revolver opened magazine passed good supply of ammunition on deck cast loose gun carefully loaded cramming almost to muzzle with bullet spike nail anything else must lay hold of done skipper unwilling to leave ship called for volunteer to go to battery spike gun there lay fuse in magazine bob at once stepped forward being accepted provided forthwith with hammer sufficient length of fuse set out upon errand have scarcely disappeared in gloom when dale who have volunteered to keep look out gave warning of approach of two boat launch pinnace full of men be observed almost at same moment by lance who hailed schooner ahoy do see boat coming ay ay answered captain staunton see will give warm reception presently very well returned lance will stick to work leave to do fighting if require assistance give call right answered skipper then turning to men on schooner deck shouted run two gun out of stern port there train so a to sweep boat just before reach landing so be well now wait for word when give fire boat however be meantime lying upon oar crew apparently holding consultation fire light revealed approach revealed to also fact that occupant of shipyard be fully prepared to emphatically dispute attempt on part to land sight brought vividly to mind aphorism that discretion be better part of valour at length after twenty minute of inaction during worker underneath schooner bottom plied tool with skill energy be truly astounding two boat be once more put in motion crew directing course toward landing boat having rude substitute for white flag reared upon boat hook in bow moment that be near enough for occupant to hear captain staunton hailed with imperative order to keep off must fire into at once laid upon oar man rising in stern sheet of launch returned answer be however quite unintelligible meanwhile boat still having way upon continued slowly to approach back water shouted skipper seizing trigger line of one of gun whilst brook stood manfully at other back water of instantly will fire man in stern sheet of launch waved hand oar again flashed into water boat dashed at landing place wait just moment yet said skipper raising warning hand to brook squinting along gun at same time now fire report of two brass nine pounder rang sharply out at same moment making schooner quiver to keel severely testing construction of cradle crash be heard then frightful chorus of shriek yell groan execration a smoke curled heavily away boat be seen with planking rent penetrated here there occupant tumbling over over other in anxiety to get at oar many of have be suffered to drop overboard withdraw a quickly a possible to somewhat safer distance hearty cheer be raised by party in possession of shipyard on board schooner reloaded gun in haste hammering down below went on with if possible still greater energy boat be suffered to retire unmolested nothing further be heard of for over hour then dale who be still maintaining careful look out suddenly gave notice that be again approaching two aftermost gun be accordingly once more very carefully pointed fired captain staunton giving word a before by mischance muzzle be pointed trifle too high charge flew harmlessly over boat tearing up water few yard astern of pirate upon unexpected piece of to good fortune raised frantic cheer of delight bending at oar until seemed about to snap dashed eagerly at landing place there be time to reload gun so seizing weapon calling upon hand to follow skipper hastily scrambled over schooner bulwark making way to ground rushed forward to meet enemy who have by time effected landing two opposing force met within dozen yard of water edge then ensued most desperate sanguinary struggle pirate have by time pretty nearly guessed at audacious design of to whom be opposed have seen enough to know not only that escape be meditated that be also proposed to carry off schooner beautiful craft own hand have so largely assisted to construct in have confidently expected to sail forth upon career of unbounded plunder licence in full reliance that speed must insure to complete immunity from punishment for nefarious deed such unheard of audacity be more than enough to excite anger to pitch of frenzy fought like demon not only for revenge also for salvation of schooner if be motif spurred on to encounter adversary be actuated by incentive of still higher character fought for life liberty not only of also of weak defenceless woman whose only trust under god be in if pirate rushed furiously to onset be met with cool determined resolution be more than balance for overpowering number captain staunton looked eagerly among crowd of ruffianly face for of ralli determined to avenge with own hand multitudinous wrong insult man have heaped upon dearest one greek be nowhere to be seen on skipper right be lance on left dickinson former fully occupying attention of at least three opponent by marvellous play of cutlas blade whilst latter brandished with terrible effect heavy crow bar have hurriedly snatched up on being summoned to fight rex brook be working wonder also bowles be fighting a only true british seaman can fight in good cause dale with courage excited own most lively surprise be handling cutlas pistol a though have used weapon life steadily inch by inch pirate be driven back in spite of superior number at last after fight of twenty minute finally broke fled before determined charge of adversary rushing headlong to boat leaving dead wounded behind captain staunton did not follow up although two whale boat still lay moored at landing a have left be anxious to avail of advantage already gained in making good escape of own party rather than to risk further loss by attempt to inflict additional punishment upon adversary besides might possibly follow later on when have got schooner afloat first act therefore after flight of pirate be to muster force ascertain extent of casualty list be heavy one in first place nine of little band be missing at muster bowles

from various part of deck be ready with axe forward there kit ready sir then cut dull cheeping thud of axe be immediately heard accompanied by sharp twang a tautly strained line parted then followed sound of shore falling to ground there be gentle jar schooner began to move move move be cry hurrah now gather way yes shouted lance joyously be going success to petrel a shivered to piece on stem head bottle of wine steward anxious that launch must be shorn of none of honour have brought up from cabin hastily thrust into hand three cheer for saucy petrel lad hip hip hip hurrah three cheer rang lustily out upon still air of breathless night a schooner shot with rapidly increasing velocity down way finally plunged into mirrorlike water of bay dipping stern deeply ploughing up smooth glassy furrow of water fringed at outer edge with coruscating border of vivid phosphorescent light boat boat again suddenly shouted bowles a schooner now fairly afloat shot rapidly stern foremost away from rock good god be right in track will cut in two be look out grimly responded captain staunton if have be wise must have accepted defeat retired to shore a however have not done so must take consequence remember lad not man of must be suffered to come on board warning shout from helmsman of pinnace announced sudden discovery of danger threatened boat promptly jammed helm hard starboard launch be on port side result be violent collision between two boat pinnace striking launch with such force a to send latter clear of schooner whilst pinnace recoiling from shock stopped dead immediately under schooner stern there be sharp sudden crash a petrel rudder clove irresistible way through doomed boat yell of dismay from occupant several of whom made spring at schooner taffrail only to be remorselessly thrust off again there be chance for yet said skipper a schooner continued to drive astern leaving wretch struggling in water launch have escaped can pick up at length schooner way slackened sufficiently to enable lance by looking over bow stern to ascertain exact trim be perfect exclaimed to captain staunton a rejoined latter near companion sits accurately down to proper water line everywhere thus proving correctness of calculation result plea a much a surprise since have have to depend entirely on memory for necessary formula well captain staunton task be now finished here be schooner fully rigged fairly afloat take charge of dear sir may fully answer expectation thanks evelin thousand thanks exclaimed skipper heartily grasping lance proffered hand have indeed executed self imposed task faithfully well let be mouth piece of party in conveying to most hearty expression of gratitude for noble manner in have aided in great strait to be entirely due credit of bringing project thus far to successful issue for skill courage resolution might have be compelled to remain for year have what be that low rumbling roar be faintly heard in distance rapidly increasing in volume of sound breaking in with startling effect upon breathless stillness of night be earthquake exclaimed lance thank heaven be afloat have caught upon stock must doubtless have shaken cradle to piece in probability thus frustrated escape ominous sound drew swiftly nearer nearer filling startled air with chaos of sound speedily became absolutely deafening in intensity water of bay broke first into long line of quivering ripple then into confused jumble of low foaming surge schooner jarred violently a though be being dragged rapidly over rocky bottom there be hideous groaning grinding sound on shore soon mingled with of crashing fall of enormous mass of earth rock above must still be feebly piercing shriek of horror raised by occupant of launch shock passed be immediately followed by one of still greater intensity water be still more violently agitated schooner be swept helplessly hither thither rolling heavily shipping great quantity of water upon deck a shapeless surge madly leaped boiled swirled around finally long line of luminous foam be seen to be rushing rapidly down upon schooner from harbour mouth stretching completely across bay a came nearer be apparent that be foaming crest of wall of water twelve foot in height be rushing down bay at railway speed hold on one of for life hoarsely shouted skipper a wave swept threateningly down upon schooner next moment burst upon with savage roar luckily petrel bow be presented fairly to consequence must have be disastrous a be curled in over stem unbroken mass of water filling deck in instant carrying schooner irresistibly along with toward shore at bottom of bay let go anchor shouted captain staunton a soon a must get head above water before must be done wave have swept past rushing with loud thundering roar far up beach even to capstan house then rapidly subsiding get canvas on at once ordered captain staunton close reefed main sail fore sail jib will have wind presently please god will make use of to get out of a speedily a possible merciful heaven what now sullen roar rattling crash a of peal of heaviest thunder whole scene be suddenly lit up with lurid ruddy glow turning startled glance inland adventurer saw that lofty hill top dominating head of ravine near be situated gold cavern have burst open be vomiting forth vast volume of flame smoke a looked top of hill visibly crumbled melted away flame shot up in fiercer volume vast quantity of red hot ash mingled with huge mass of glowing incandescent rock be projected far into air terrific storm of thunder lightning suddenly burst forth to add new terror to scene to crown new rift suddenly burst open in side of hill out of there immediately poured perfect ocean of molten lava in face of stupendous phenomenon captain staunton order to make sail passed unheeded entire faculty of man on board schooner be wholly absorbed in awe struck contemplation of terrific spectacle onward rolled fiery flood wound in zigzag serpentine course down side of hill soon reached thick wood at base at head of valley stately forest withered blazed for brief moment vanished in fatal embrace now came sweeping down steep declivity toward bay terrible sight aroused vivified paralysed energy of on board petrel without waiting for repetition of order to make sail sprang with panic stricken frantic haste to cast off gasket in incredibly short time schooner be under canvas still there be wind not faintest breath of air came to stir flapping sail of now gently rolling vessel crew must hing wait in feverish anxious expectancy for long delayed breeze watching meanwhile majestic irresistible onward sweep of fiery deluge at last thank god there be faint puff of wind came sighed past died away now sail caught bellied out flapped again filled once more petrel gathered way have gradually swung round until bow pointed straight for capstan house captain staunton sprang to wheel sending with single vigorous spin hard over breeze be still very light craft responded slowly to helm at length came up fairly upon wind made short stretch to eastward tacking moment that have gathered sufficient way to accomplish manoeuvre be now on port tack stretching obliquely across bay in southerly direction when startled call from poole repeated by rest directed captain staunton gaze once more landward look look merciful power be ralli be lance horrified exclamation a grasped skipper convulsively by shoulder pointed with trembling hand to shore sure enough be ralli pirate have not waited to seek have not thought of looking for in cottage before setting out on expedition against shipyard have consequently be left there somehow doubtless in desperation of mortal fear excited by dreadful phenomenon in operation around have at last succeeded in freeing from bond be now seen running toward beach screaming madly for help stream of lava be only few yard behind have now spread out to entire width of very narrow valley unhappy wretch be flying for life terror seemed to have endowed with superhuman strength speed for moment almost appeared a though must come out winner in dreadful race 'bout ship sharply rang out skipper voice be fiend rather than man must not perish thus horribly if can save put helm hard down a spoke schooner shot up into wind with sail sluggishly flapping before have time to get fairly round helm be suddenly righted then put hard up keep fast commanded captain staunton be too late mortal power can save see be already in grasp of fate such be indeed case fierce breath of onward rolling flood of fire be upon scorching heat sapped strength staggered fell with rapidity of lightning flash be up away again merciful god see clothing be ablaze listen to dreadful shriek of fear agony ah miserable wretch now flood be upon see how wave of fire curl round throw up arm with harsh despairing blood curdling yell sink be gone surging fiery river sweep grandly on until plunge with awful hissing sound into water of bay whole scene becomes blotted out by vast curtain of steam shoot up spread abroad what night of horror be hell upon earth gasp skipper a turn eye away devotes once more solely to task of navigating schooner thank god breeze be freshening may now hope to be soon out of clear of phew what terrific lightning what infernal combination of deafening sound fortunate be for schooner crew that wind be from southward blowing directly down into bay otherwise must speedily have be lost in thick cloud of steam rose from water set on fire by dense shower of red hot ash now began to fall thickly about a be though wind be against be compelled to beat up bay wind kept back steam also to great extent falling ash notwithstanding favourable circumstance crew be obliged to keep deck deluged with water to prevent being ignited gradually however petrel drew further further beyond influence of danger soon rock at harbour mouth be sighted captain staunton be at first somewhat anxious about risking passage out to sea being doubtful whether explosion of magazine have yet taken place little reflection satisfied that must have occurred a have be drifting about bay for nearly hour determined to push on suddenly there be shout from look out forward boat ahead immediately followed by information be launch sir bottom up such indeed proved to be when schooner minute later glided past where be crew have disappeared leaving sign behind hoarse angry roar of breaker outside be now distinctly audible in five minute time petrel helm be eased up be kept away couple of point shooting through short narrow passage on eastern side of rock began to plunge with gentle swinging motion over endless procession of long slowly moving swell outside crew of schooner have time to note a swept past rock through passage that battery no longer frowned down upon bay in place there appeared yawning fire blackened chasm shipyard be thickly strewed with mass fragment of rock of size whale boat be swamped solitary gun with fragment of carriage still attached lay half in half out of water timber of dismembered cradle still floated huddled together like raft close to landing now said lance to captain staunton a soon a be fairly outside of harbour be free thank god a there seems to be immediate prospect of further needing help will go look after wounded lady poor soul what fearful time of suspense terror must have passed pent up there in cabin listening to fearful sound not knowing what mean what will be end of lance accordingly descended to find lady pale a death eye dilated with fear resolutely doing best with aid of steward to assuage agony of wounded be of course at once assailed with hundred question to however put stop by holding up hand laughingly saying pray spare show little mercy beseech to answer question must occupy for remainder of night be satisfied therefore for present with general statement that have successfully launched schooner a doubtless have long ago found out for yourselves there have be terrible earthquake accompanied by volcanic eruption bid fair to completely destroy island that be now in open ocean having made good escape that there be at present nothing more to fear where be may be asleep in berth answered mr staunton so worst of poor child pain be over doubt of answered lance fact that be sleeping be in sufficient indication of now let first thank for care of patient here to whom will now myself attend next order three peremptorily off to bed away with at once to most comfortable quarter can find try to get good night rest utterly worn out lady be only too glad to obey order accordingly forthwith retired to cabin steward have already prepared for more severely wounded be then speedily attended to injury carefully dressed comfortably bestowed in hammock after came turn of others by time lance have fully completed arduous task first faint streak of dawn be lighting up eastern horizon went on deck to get breath two of fresh air found schooner slipping along at fine pace under stitch of canvas must spread including studding sail with breeze about two point on starboard quarter clear sky above clear sea round away astern a light grew stronger must be seen dark patch of smoke low down upon horizon indicating position of albatross island land have sunk below horizon long before story be now ended very little more remains to be told little must be told a tersely a possible petrel made very rapid prosperous passage home in due time arrived at plymouth long before however wounded have completely recovered here passenger landed whilst captain staunton proceeded with schooner to london where craft be safely docked crew paid off skipper then made best of way to office of owner of galatea where be received with joyous surprise story listened to with greatest interest congratulated upon marvellous escape from many peril have encountered best of before interview terminated owner
