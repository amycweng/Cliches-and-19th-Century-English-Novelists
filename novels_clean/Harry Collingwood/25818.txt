hearing playing singing in drawing room below while be on duty on poop mr vansittart be ardent sportswoman be evident from very outset by way in sailed yacht carried on consistently day night a though be sailing in race sooner be past ushant breeze showed sign of freshening than ordered preventer backstay rigged fore aft hung on to canvas until lee rail be awash lee main deck flooded to extent from topgallant forecastle to poop that passage became impossibility except by swimming swept across bay like smoke driven by strong breeze overhauling passing everything be going way excepting big cape liner actually held own with for hour until breeze eased up sufficiently to allow steamer to draw gradually away from must have presented most beautiful picture to people aboard boat a swept along for time neck neck with snow white cotton canvas gleaming in brilliant sunlight flecked with sweeping blue shadow a yacht rushed through over foaming surge with water aboil about perfectly cut sail to three royal accurately set drawing like team of cart horse fresh easterly breeze have swept down channel in such splendid style lasted long enough to carry to mouth of tagus shortly after nine o'clock in morning of fifth day out from london by noon of day be riding at anchor off city of lisbon here remained two day next destination being island of madeira from madeira went on to teneriffe from teneriffe to gibraltar after gradually worked way up mediterranean calling in at number of interesting place on way be at ajaccio on christmas day be characteristic of skipper that so arranged matter a to spend day aboard with giving crew rare good time inviting whole of officer to dine with in evening left ajaccio on evening of new year day passing through strait of bonifacio headed for bay of

vansittart then announced that must remain there at least week during men must be granted daily leave while officer be to make own arrangement subject to approval of kennedy who be left in charge thus have opportunity not only to visit cairo also to take run out to pyramid sphinx a matter of fact remained at suez nearly fortnight awaiting skipper return when hove up anchor proceeded down gulf of suez into red sea duly noting mount sinai on port hand a passed chapter three indian ocean hurricane be not writing story a mere diary of travel will therefore push on a rapidly a possible to point where real living interest of voyage began contenting with mere brief reference to various spot at touched took eight day to make passage to aden where arrived early on certain morning leaving at five o'clock same afternoon after visit to famous tank next port of call be zanzibar whence proceeded to durban in natal from durban proceeded to mauritius remaining in port louis harbour two day to permit of visit to extraordinary natural curiosity peter botte mountain from mauritius sailed for colombo weather be glorious when left port louis for two day afterward with moderate breeze from south east toward sunset on third day out however began to notice sign of change barometer have started to decline shortly after noon a afternoon advanced breeze weakened so that from speed of fourteen knot dropped down to bare five although be under royal have staysail set be showing whole flight of starboard studding sail a well wind being about point half abaft beam at same time aspect of sky underwent subtle change clear rich blue of vault became gradually obscured by veil at first scarcely perceptible of dirty whitish grey haze from by time of sunset trace of blue have completely vanished gradually too sun became shorn of ray although there be perceptible diminution of heat until at length when great luminary be upon point of sinking below horizon have changed into semblance of huge shapeless mass of molten copper hanging suspended in midst of almost equally shapeless conglomeration of flame smoke then slowly vanished from view flaming smoky western sky seemed to blaze up for few moment into still fiercer conflagration hue deepened until became mingling of blood soot when with startling suddenness died out inky blackness enveloped ship at same time small remains of wind died away leaving yacht rolling lurching heavily upon sea seemed to have run in heaved up into great hummock only to subside again in same purposeless manner be drawing on toward end of first dog watch a matter of fact be off duty one never spends dog watch below in tropic if can be avoided kennedy have gone up on poop together to watch sunset discus with second mate meaning of portent kennedy have never before be in part of world have while did not quite know what to make of aspect of sky have already made up mind pretty well regarding what be in store for have expressed opinion a to what might expect first mate did not altogether agree with have proposed that must refer matter to briscoe who like knew professed to know indian ocean pretty well so up went presently when last gleam of light be vanishing from sky kennedy beckoned briscoe to said well mr briscoe what d think grand show away to west'ard mean mr leigh here who have be in part before say belaives be in for hurricane hurricane be hanged retorted briscoe who always seemed to find peculiar pleasure in belittling opinion might express what be in for be thunderstorm will make of ye sit up take notice guess will bring with pretty considerable squall so will be good plan to stow few of flyin ' kite of ours be doin ' good anyway will only thrash threadbare if leave abroad be so guess 'd better see about at once mr briscoe remarked mr vansittart emerging from companion at moment have apparently heard briscoe last word a came up companion way have just be looking up weather remark in indian ocean directory continued from what say guess there be hurricane brewing mr kennedy so why interrupted kennedy be what mr leigh here say mr briscoe who ought to know something about indian ocean say be only going to be thunderstorm probably accompanied by heavy squall do know indian ocean mr leigh have ever be here before demanded skipper several time madam answered once be caught in hurricane dismasted appearance of sky then be very much what be evening while barometer behaved pretty similarly to what have be doing then that settle exclaimed mr vansittart there be two to one indian ocean directory mr leigh against mr briscoe guess will prepare for hurricane stow light canvas stow everything in fact except fore main topsail fore topmast staysail then will be ready for anything come eh mr leigh assuredly much better prepared than be at present moment said if may be permitted to offer suggestion may mr leigh replied skipper yes go ahead what do advise well madam said since be good enough to give leave must advise that staysail be stowed also topsail yard lowered to cap carried patent reefing topsail royal topgallant yard topgallant mast sent down on deck a well a studding sail out of top extra lashing be put upon boat boom then have doubt will ride out may come with reasonable comfort safety when come must heave ship to with close reefed fore topsail aback also must have small tarpaulin ready to lash in weather mizen rigging in case topsail must blow away finally must direct mackenzie to see that engine be ready for starting at moment notice if need be sake alive exclaimed mr vansittart do really believe be going to be so bad a that certainly think not at improbable madam said then guess will do a say exclaimed lady be right thing to err on safe side wo take chance will be bad for men to have to work in darkness when doe moon rise be due to rise at about eight forty five to night said be afraid will be useless for to look for help from will get light from to night think not said then ah there be four bell a briscoe having descended to main deck came up on poop struck bell let men get to work at once mr kennedy watch see mr leigh suggestion be carried out say guess wo risk having topsail blown away will furl everything while be about if hurricane come will heave to under bare pole how will do mr leigh admirably madam replied will then have done everything possible to provide for safety of ship when blow come a feel sure will there will be no need to risk life of of crew necessary order be at once given repaired to several station duty be to supervise operation on mizenmast kennedy having charge of men working upon mainmast briscoe supervising upon foremast when went aft found miss anthea brother seated in couple of basket chair by taffrail be necessary for to stand quite close to for few minute have sooner taken up position than boy say to sister in tone loud enough to reach ear say 'thea why doe momma pay so much attention to what britisher say guess like like be going to speak to about who be that be to be consulted before kennedy briscoe be amuricans while be only britisher have be to sea longer than have anyway amurican be darn sight better than britisher day yes guess be right ju replied young lady only need not allow dislike to betray into vulgarity hate englishman find necessary to use word darn wish must be only common vulgar people who use must speak to momma either if be be not worth while momma think man be clever of course be will find out sooner later so that be have often wondered at attitude of latent hostility of two youngster toward now understood hated englishman well hatred did not trouble in least be passive at event be only so far active a to prompt now then to make offensive remark in hearing taking into consideration who what be must put up with good deal of have effect of putting upon mettle be determined to prove to that be mistaken in estimate of englishman not because attached value personally to good bad opinion because eventually must be man woman if lived from position wealth must give must have power of influencing opinion of fellow countryman to certain limited extent felt that be duty to do what must to lessen unreasoning dislike of fellow countryman have noticed in so many american be at time dead calm with very heavy confused swell running so that only sound heard apart from own voice be wash gurgle of water alongside a ship wallowed uneasily loud rustle flap of canvas aloft creaking of spar moreover be intensely dark to extent indeed found impossible to superintend operation from deck presently therefore sprang into mizen rigging made way aloft to mizen topmast crosstrees from directed operation of sending down royal topgallant yard afterwards took hand in sending down topgallant mast having satisfaction of finding when returned to deck that on mizenmast have beaten briscoe kennedy reckoned that on board well disciplined old fashioned british man o ' war task of sending down royal topgallant yard mast stowing canvas must have be accomplished under similar circumstance in about twelve minute at utmost took thirty five minute by ship clock thought not at bad however for in first place be nothing like so heavily manned a man o war of size must have be have hand constant practice in such evolution that frigate crew must have have main thing be that lady skipper be satisfied be good enough to say so remained intensely dark until close upon ten o'clock night when thinnest imaginable suggestion of moonlight came filtering weakly through dense curtain of cloud now overspread heaven just enough of to enable to see object close at hand avoid hurting by running foul of a have be doing while moving about deck weather still remained stark calm ship be rolling so furiously must not have be at surprised to see mast go over side at moment gear be good new however held bravely motion be so intensely disagreeable shipped so much water over rail flooding main deck necessitating battening down of hatch at length mr vansittart gave order to start engine ship be then put stem on to swell have now become more regular setting out from about north north east action brought immediate relief a enabled helmsman to keep ship out of trough though violent rolling be exchanged for almost a violent pitching thunderstorm briscoe still persistently maintained be coming failed to eventuate hour after hour dragged away with indication of immediate change save that feeble glimmer of moonlight instead of increasing gradually died away again leaving in almost a bad plight a before at midnight when went on deck to keep middle watch mr vansittart be still up thought that temper seemed to be rather on edge perhaps owing to strain of long spun out suspense at least responded rather sharply to kennedy greeting when joined on poop thought that perhaps briscoe have be talking to during watch doing best to discredit judgment for sooner have joined than turned upon in very incisive tone informed that have come to conclusion have be mistaken that there be going to be hurricane after otherwise must have come before then knew that indian ocean hurricane sometimes take long time brewing indeed in case of previous experience have threatened for more than ten hour before actually burst upon explained to also said that there be nothing in aspect of weather to make alter original opinion be still engaged in debating matter when peculiar low moaning sound became audible in air rapidly increasing to weird unearthly howl wild scuffling gust of hot wind swept over from north went whining away astern of until lost sound of altogether be coming at last madam said will probably have three four more such gust a lasting longer than one preceding begorra here come number two now exclaimed kennedy a similar sound once more became audible with vicious swoop gust smote so fiercely that yacht stopped dead unable to make headway against for full minute more seemed a though dozen separate distinct wind be battling together for mastery yacht being centre focus round battle raged on poop be buffeted helplessly way so that be only with utmost difficulty must keep foot indeed mr vansittart be literally lifted off foot for moment blown across deck with such violence have not luckily be forced straight into arm so be able to catch hold must probably have be seriously injured by being dashed furiously against poop rail thanked breathlessly a dragged by main force to mizenmast passed couple of turn of topgallant halyard round waist securing to belaying pin by time that be done gust like first have passed begged to go below before worse happened assuring that kennedy who be in charge must know exactly what to do little lady be grit to backbone positively refused to leave deck on contrary ordered kennedy to counter brace yard with head yard aback then heave ship to on port tack after everybody look out be to go below while be giving order deftly passed few more turn of halyard about so that must not possibly be blown away unless mizenmast be blown out of ship also begged loan of black silk neck scarf tied over head under chin so that yachting cap might not be blown overboard a mine have be by time air about be in state of continuous agitation wind sometimes swooping down upon in savage gust anon easing up for moment until be scarcely more than zephyr lull momentarily became of briefer duration until in space of about ten minute be blowing hard very unsteadily heavy gust following other with ever increasing rapidity now felt full benefit of earlier preparation for with counter bracing of yard task accomplished in le than minute everything be possible have be done remained be to ride out gale a best must be now afforded opportunity first have ever occurred a kennedy yelled for information to see what really magnificent sea boat have under foot for under scourging of terrible wind sea rose with appalling rapidity notwithstanding that top of sea a rose be torn off swept to leeward in blinding drenching cloud of spindrift although engine have be stopped ship lay to in most perfect manner heading well up into wind taking sea a came at a buoyantly a gull shipping very little water except what came aboard in form of spindrift scud water with occasional spattering over weather cathead be only beginning of hurricane merely awakening so to speak with passage of minute wind steadily increased in strength until wailing shrieking of through spar rigging aloft resembled tone of mighty organ drowning other sound while yacht lay down to until lee rail be completely buried water be right up to main hatch coaming a wind increased however rode somewhat easier for after time became impossible for sea to rise indeed strength of wind be such that actually flattened sea down wave a reared head being swept away a deluge of spray air be full of a full a be of water during tropical shower only manner in must distinguish from rain be by salt taste of upon lip think worst feature of however be hideous darkness in be enwrapped for outside small circle of light emanating from skylight be impossible to see anything save faint ghostly white radiance representing phosphorescent surface of foaming sea in midst of hull of yacht stood out black vague shapeless being impossible to see whole length of because of dense cloud of spindrift enveloped at length occurred to to wonder how lady skipper be faring in midst of awful turmoil of wind sea watching opportunity made dash for spot where dimly outlined in sheen of light from foremost skylight must just distinguish form huddled up against foot of mizen mast a reached noticed that seemed to be hanging limply in lashing stooping closer presently discovered that plucky little lady have fainted buffeting of wind pitiless incessant pelting of spray have be too much for unable to call for assistance to escape unaided have succumbed fact established lost time in summoning kennedy to assistance when having cast adrift managed between to convey safely to companion carry below to cabin then roused doctor lizette chief stewardess turned over to care after left there returned to deck to complete watch think that middle watch be longest four hour have ever spent chiefly because of extreme discomfort fact that there be nothing to do first of be drenched to skin conversation in be engaged with mr vansittart when hurricane started having rendered impossible for to go below get into oilskin then there be unceasing buffeting of wind seemed at time a though must drag from limb there be also continuous scourging of spray stung like lash of million whip finally there be oppression of very real anxiety for a think have mentioned yacht be a heavily rigged a frigate notwithstanding relief afforded by sending down tophamper lay down so alarmingly that at length began seriously to question whether must not eventually end in turning turtle eight bell came at length however when shortly afterward got below shed streaming garment towelled dry tumbled into bunk discomfort anxiety promptly left a sank into sound dreamless sleep chapter four save julius life when shortly before eight bell be called by wardroom steward at once became aware that change of sort have occurred in weather for on one hand list of ship to starboard seemed to be no longer so heavy a have be when turned in while on other motion be far away greater so violent indeed be that seasoned a be to movement of heaving deck experienced greatest difficulty in maintaining balance when presently went on deck previous impression be fully confirmed for although be still blowing whole gale maniacal fury of hurricane be past while sea no longer flattened down kept practically level by irresistible strength of tempest have risen rapidly be now almost terrifying sight to behold especially be case when ship settled into trough with one great foaming liquid mountain rushing away to leeward of while enormous grey back towering above a high a lower mast head came swooping down upon from to windward with hissing angry crest threatening to hurl bodily down upon deck sink out of hand yet threat be never fulfilled for yacht be behaving magnificently came to in most perfect style a climbed breast of oncoming comber heeling steeply to while turning up bold weather bow to meet onslaught then a crest curled in over turtle back topgallant forecastle smothering in whirling blowing foam spray must swing upright with lift of stern easy weather roll go sliding down into trough beyond head paying off a did so although be still under bare pole with head yard aback must see upon looking over side that be forging ahead at speed of about knot half although wind be no longer blowing with hurricane force still have strength of heavy gale while reference to barometer showed that mercury have begun to rise there be other sign of improvement in weather sky be almost a black threatening in aspect a ever with innumerable shred tatter of dirty whitish grey cloud sweeping athwart at speed made one giddy to look at while there must be question that sea be gathering height weight volume with passage of minute air be still heavily charged with flying spume spindrift necessitating use of oilskin sou'wester keeping spar rigging deck streaming must see with tolerable clearness for at least mile in direction yet although general feeling out on deck be one of dampness discomfort have not added misery of cold to deal with on contrary be so warm that shortly after went on deck having breakfasted felt long oilskin coat sea boot so uncomfortably warm that presently slipped below again for moment removing sock donned short oilskin jacket returned to deck barefooted for sake of greater comfort took for granted that miss anthea must never dream of turning out in such weather while felt sure that mr vansittart must excuse under circumstance more so a have often before come on deck while be paddling about barelegged washing deck indeed when shortly afterward emerged through companion way encased in thin mackintosh reaching to hem of dress with light sou ' wester on head in nowise detracted from good look at once set at ease by laughingly complimenting upon sensible character of attire then in very different tone of voice thanked for having come to rescue on previous night when overcome by terrific buffeting of hurricane have swooned while lashed to mast be to say mr vansittart kennedy be still standing together under lee of wheelhouse discussing weather generally probable duration of gale in particular when boy julius came up from below emerging from companion way at precise moment when ship with terrific lee roll be climbing to summit of exceptionally heavy sea precisely how happened must not possibly say occurred so suddenly moreover only saw last part of imagine that lad must have lost inadvertently released hold upon side of companion at critical moment when velocity of ship roll be at highest be that a may julius sooner stepped out on deck than went with run straight to lee rail of poop fetched up against with force must have knocked breath out of then although rail be breast high to in inconceivable fashion seemed to lurch forward upon turn complete somersault over plunge headlong into sea be mr vansittart shriek of julius look of petrified horror caused to wheel round be just in time to see lad go whirling over rail one thought move with lightning like rapidity in moment of emergency a saw boy going thought kennedy be good heavy sea boot of must drag down sink in few second must go a thought flashed through brain tore off oilskin jacket shouting to kennedy lifebuoy bend to signal halyard made dash for rail while mr vansittart shriek lent wing to foot a reached rail ship topped surge went rushing roaring away beneath to leeward in tremendous boil of foam in rear of there be space of almost glass smooth indigo coloured water down through thought saw something might be boy body without hesitating instant vaulted rail landing upon curved turtle back outboard flung hand above head plunged straight for spot where moment before thought have seen lad body went deep kicking striking out vigorously a felt water close about for thought occurred to that if boy have really hurt badly when colliding with rail must probably not rise to surface at must slowly sink a forced way downward looked about presently saw glimmering white something far below might be object of quest for boy be dressed entirely in white desperately urged downward gloom increasing with stroke at length when felt a though lung must burst must not retain breath second grabbed something scarcely knew what turning struck upward toward blue glimmer of light far overhead how managed to hold breath during seemingly endless climb to surface can not say did somehow head emerging from water at very instant when air escaped from lung in one long gasp quickly filled again looked to see what have brought to surface with found that a expected be apparently lifeless form of master julius have grabbed lad by ankle so that hung head downward in grasp must never do so treading water vigorously shifted position of body until have head resting upon shoulder at moment felt being hove up up up next instant very mountain of water went hissing roaring over head plunging helplessly hither thither momentarily threatening to tear prize from hold a soon a have again got breath looked round for yacht be nowhere in sight presently a began to wonder what have become of saw topmast head swing into view beyond head of comber have just swept past then up swept until whole of hull be visible saw crowd of people gathered aft by taffrail others in rigging peering out under sharp of hand in various direction then a craft surmounted grey back came sliding down weather slope rolling to windward until must see nearly main deck one of figure suddenly pointed toward in instant face turned way while one man whom presently recognised a kennedy put one hand to side of mouth a though shouting while pointed with other not word must hear however for ear be still full of water while such sound a entered be merely hiss roar of sea guessed what mate be pointing at more readily a saw one man paying out thin line over rail so looked eagerly about presently saw thirty fathom away white lifebuoy floating in midst of wide surface of foam ship at time being perhaps twice a far from a lifebuoy just a started to strike out for buoy heavy sea swept over treating pretty much a first have done suffocating into bargain thought that hampered a be with boy inert body must never reach buoy for seemed utterly unable to make so much a inch of progress in frightful sea once after have be overwhelmed about dozen time thought came to that if wanted to save must give up idea of saving body after must be useless task since felt certain that lad be dead must not return to ship face lad mother empty handed must picture despair under such circumstance for julius be mr vansittart only son spoiled a be believed that loved more than husband more than daughter more than own life no be not to be thought of have undertaken task must execute have raised hope must not disappoint if god must only give strength to reach buoy at length after what seemed like century of effort did reach laying hand upon nearest rim tilted over head under armpit at very moment a afterward learned when aboard have paid out four set of signal halyard to bare end of fourth set now came delicate difficult task of hauling alongside in shortest possible space of time without parting halyard on one hand drowning on other kennedy be man for job even a vaulted rail plunged into water active mind aided by past experience have enabled not only to grasp full import of hasty word concerning lifebuoy signal halyard also to foresee exactly what must inevitably happen while be in very act of unreeving peak ensign halyard preparatory to bending on to lifebuoy ready knife have slashed off taffrail be shouting for somebody to pas word for mackenzie engineer when mac already issuing from cabin to learn what sudden outcry be about received message came rushing aft in response to call in turn be fully prepared for order kennedy gave to go below set engine going dead easy astern thus by time reached got into buoy ship way through water be stopped highly dangerous though such proceeding undoubtedly be under circumstance be able to haul gradually alongside up under counter without engine of course being stopped again at right moment when once have got under lee quarter of ship rest be of course comparatively easy two of hand standing by hove couple of standing bowline on rope end one of slipped over inanimate julius head under armpit when saw that have got body safely in over rail slipped into other myself be hauled aboard amid triumphant yell of crew to swoon a foot touched deck there be nothing much matter with have swooned simply through over exertion coupled perhaps with reaction at finding once more safely aboard yacht harper surgeon having have foresight to order someone to stand by with brandy a restorative in case of need soon brought round again by kennedy order be helped below to cabin to turn in rest for bit learning a went that harper boy mother have taken charge of lad moment that be hauled aboard have carried below to cabin afterward heard however that before quitted deck mr vansittart have given order that be to be informed at earliest possible opportunity how thing be going with further learned that upon being told be doing well fell upon knee by side of boy bed bursting into tear sobbed forth audible thanks to god for preservation a for after vomiting considerable quantity of salt water be helped to undress given vigorous towelling put into bunk where having swallowed tumblerful of hot brandy water quickly dropped off to sleep remained asleep until after four bell of afternoon watch have struck then feeling pretty much former self although bit shaky on pin very sore about chest turned out donned dry suit of clothes sallied forth to wardroom with twofold object of ascertaining if there be news a to master julius fate getting something to eat upon entering wardroom found kennedy mackenzie grimwood purser somewhat to astonishment doctor present chatting animatedly moreover gathered that be talking about for a passed through open doorway kennedy looked up exclaimed begorra here be no le talk of here bring to anchor on sofa lad let have look at ye faith morning experience have taken out of ye by look of ut never ye mind that bhoy ye will weather right ye will always have memory of havin ' done gallant thing happens by piper lad be proud of ye from skipper downward came crowding round a sank upon sofa insisted upon shaking hand with saying so many nice complimentary thing to that presently began to feel quite abashed then harper interfered authoritatively there exclaimed waving crowd away will do chap let up upon youngster bit give chance what want continued turning to laying finger upon pulse be meal first not heavy meal something good nourishing then spell of sleep mac have goodness to press button for steward will give order how be appetite british hero why said to confess truth turned out because felt hungry came in here with hope of getting something to eat doctor want to know about boy did best must for be determined to bring back with if be fortunate enough to fetch ship again felt certain there be life left in even before got hold of buoy be just where be mistaken young man oh here be steward a individual entered in response to summons of bell want to go to cook tell from understand to give good big basin of chicken broth instructed to prepare bring here for mr leigh with slice of bread from loaf baked yesterday if anything of sort remains then when have brought broth go to mr marsh ask to give small bottle of mumm bring along here now get move on let have thing quick well doctor what about master julius prompted a steward retired why a happened be not dead when hauled aboard replied harper though be so near to that cost two solid hour more of strenuous work to restore animation believe will pull through now with luck dropped off to sleep about hour ago left in charge of mother chief stewardess with instruction to send for upon instant of waking how do like broth be delicious replied be enjoying although feel bit mean in taking for suppose be prepared for julius be trouble about young un returned doctor cook have order if have attended to a have doubt have there will be plenty for pair of will have more declined have have quite sufficient said thereupon harper opened half bottle of wine steward have brought poured content into tumbler ordered to toss off then go back to bunk get sleep sleep just a long a care to said worry about watch until give leave night in ought to fix up again think will see what look like when turn out for breakfast to morrow be soon asleep again first bugle call for dinner awakened feeling good deal better turned out dressed noticing a did so that ship movement be very much easier more rhythmical than when have lain down indeed have feeling that be sailing again glancing through porthole found that be so that weather have cleared sea now deep sapphire blue have gone down very considerably sky be clear of cloud upon looking more closely at water be able to detect shadow of ship upon thereby determine that be under three topsail course fore topmast staysail spanker by swirl of yeast past port estimated that must be reeling off about eight knot while be still engaged in dressing there came gentle tap at door to answered come whereupon door opened harper entered so be turning out again said after standing looking at moment how do find oh ever so much better replied indeed think may say that be practically all right again soreness of chest be gone let feel pulse commanded stretched out arm to laid finger on pulse kept there for about minute yes said will hing very much matter with now look here boy mr vansittart have instructed to come see how be getting on to say that if feel equal to must like to join saloon party at dinner to night just know alone fact be that be eager to tell what feel about exploit of morning will not be happy until have done so do feel equal to ordeal will go back say that must excuse for little while longer think can stand know what say oh yes replied dare say can stand suppose will have to come sometime so might a well get over done with say doctor just give hint to go easy with thanks will there be good fellow if there be one thing hate more than anything else be being made fuss of understand why of course do dear chap be reply be frightfully trying know must grudge satisfaction of expressing gratitude to see will take care that will not carry thing too far will tell that be not in condition to stand very much excitement just yet well then so long see again later a soon a have finished dressing seated in very comfortable revolving chair in front of writing desk to await second bugle call to dinner have scarcely done so when steward came along to cabin bearing medicine glass containing draught said doctor have sent with instruction be to take at once accordingly tossed off few minute later second dinner call sounded made way aft up companion way to drawing room where found mr vansittart daughter monroe doctor already assembled a one of steward flung open door announced mr vansittart came forward seized hand in of hers looked up into face with eye be swimming with tear for moment lip quivered speechless then recovering command of said welcome thousand welcome mr leigh doctor harper have explained to that be only by making great effort find able to meet to night give chance to express lifelong gratitude to for noble gallant deed again emotion overcame presently after brave ineffectual struggle to be formal restrained suddenly let go bursting into tear exclaimed oh dear dear boy walter how can ever thank enough be happy grateful woman to night for doctor have just assured that julius will certainly recover whereas for must must have be must get further so in lieu of word dear lady lifted hand to lip kissed repeatedly then to intense relief harper stepped forward gently taking by arm led to seat saying now dear lady will never do know must pull together will have case upon sick list if have suspected that be going to happen must not have allowed leigh to come to so soon have be very trying day for know yes have doctor sobbed of course have upset bit just leave alone for minute two will be all right again while be saying miss anthea came forward frankly extending hand expressed own thanks to for having saved brother life mr leigh continued in low voice take back one of horrid thing have said about englishman in hearing be downright ashamed of will forgive why of course will very freely willingly said please forget about a will thank said brother at moment marsh flung open door in most impressive manner announced that dinner be served thus putting end to what felt to be most embarrassing situation be to take down to dinner if please mr leigh said miss anthea linking arm in mine insisted upon explained because want to make understand how sorry ashamed be at way have behaved to through voyage said thought be agreed that must be forgotten so will be said since be so generous a to wish before entirely relegate matter to oblivion want to explain that stupid prejudice against englishman be not at founded upon experience for few englishman whom have met true have be very few have be unexceptionable know why be seems to be fashion for american to speak think of englishman a being of different clay from ourselves something infinitely inferior to in respect effete sort of thing so much be case that good many of really come to believe at last there have made confession cried peccavi have be forgiven feel ever so much happier now please tell about want to know whether have quite recovered from effect of dreadful exertion morning believe will ever forget how felt when rushed up on deck to find out what confusion be about saw swimming in water ever so far away with julius hanging over shoulder chapter five fall in with derelict meet with accident that evening short though be for harper insisted that must retire early be most delightful have ever spent although everybody must persist in talking of what termed exploit lady telling over over again how profound be gratitude to for saving life of being who be evidently to most important person in world while men said sort of complimentary flattering thing about courage in plunging overboard in such tremendous sea so on so that cheek be aflame with blush time absolute sincerity of gratitude admiration friendly warmth of feeling toward be so transparently evident in everything said that despite feeling of embarrassment oppressed be very happy more so that nothing be said even hinted at concerning reward for what have done for perhaps because of youth pride be intensely sensitive while greatly valued gratitude friendship may a well be frank enough to add admiration hint of reward must have wounded self respect to quick in consequence of doctor injunction a to early retirement night did not adjourn to drawing room a usual when cloth be removed mr vansittart announced intention of remaining with while sipped coffee harper monroe smoked cigar miss anthea also remained be then that learned how very narrow have be escape of lad julius from drowning appeared that when owing to sudden violent lurch of ship have be hurled athwart deck against lee rail of poop impact of body upon hard wood be so severe that breath be completely knocked out of while pain must have be so great a practically to paralyse for moment render quite unable to do anything to help hence probability be once in water must have sunk for good that for promptitude in diving after must never again have be seen when at length be got aboard be so nearly gone that harper skill resource be taxed to uttermost for more than two hour before sign of returning animation manifested while be not until afternoon be well advanced that medico be able to assert with assurance that lad must recover even so there be probability that with care skilful treatment must possibly receive must be at least three four day before julius must be up about again according to routine be eight hour out that night harper fiat have already gone forth be to spend whole night in bunk therefore upon leaving dining room at once retired to cabin turned in slept soundly until be called at eight o'clock on following morning when arose thoroughly recuperated feeling a well a ever first thing noticed while dressing be that be brilliantly fine morning for sunshine be streaming powerfully in through port flooding cabin with radiance next thing be that ship motion be easy buoyant from inferred that gale be over that have passed beyond area over have swept in last supposition be mistaken a be to appear later still when went on deck everything went to justify belief for sky be cloudless wind have sunk to royal breeze from eastward sea have gone down leaving nothing long low northerly swell be reeling off twelve knot easily comfortably a learned have be case ever since midnight when climbed to poop mr vansittart be already there attired in fine weather rig of white with white cover on yachting cap immediately came up to shaking hand expressed hope have entirely recovered from effect of yesterday ducking exertion then a replied in affirmative in return enquired how son be progressing deftly drew aft to taffrail out of earshot of briscoe second mate who be sourly regarding said now walter there be just word two want to say to be a good opportunity a to say will not repeat what said to last night in reference to gratitude to for saving dear julius life for hope then made quite clear to that will always regard a under obligation to will be quite impossible for ever adequately to repay be what wish to understand have decided that in interest of good discipline to guard against possibility of arousing unworthy jealousy here whether by accident design allowed gaze to rest for moment upon second mate somewhat ungainly figure will treat while on duty precisely a do other officer making distinction whatever in behaviour between feel sure that must prefer so must not of course very well then be clearly understood between thought best to mention matter so that there will be misapprehension now a to julius dear boy be very much better be thankful to say dr harper think be best that must remain in bed for to day at least find that have not faintest recollection of what happened to after fell into water until came to in bed so have told everything made perfectly clear to that owes life to of course be grateful wish to go down see little later on in order that may personally thank well if must seem not quite so grateful to a ought to be beg that will not think badly of walter having be unconscious time that be in water can quite understand can not that be unable to appreciate very clearly awful risk ran in effecting rescue magnitude of indebtedness to yes there be thing be only son well be beginning to think that perhaps have united together to spoil bit so that see poor lady be becoming more more embarrassed with word uttered therefore thought high time to come to relief so said dear madam beg that will not distress by attempting further explanation see exactly how matter stand believe will not be in smallest degree disappointed if find that julius gratitude be le eloquent in expression than own after be still very young have knowledge of what actually happened except what have told doubt very much whether boy of age posse capacity to conjure up very lively feeling of gratitude for obligation of know nothing except from hearsay therefore hope that will not allow to worry over seeming lukewarmness on part thank walter thousand thanks said laying hand upon arm be generous of to feel about a do increase load of obligation to see that perfectly understand so will say no more about a soon a dr harper say can see julius will send for interview with julius took place shortly after six bell in forenoon watch boy mother doctor being present after what former have said to by way of preparation be not at surprised to find that master julius thanks be expressed in very perfunctory offhand manner with not much of ring of sincerity about made allowance for for saw that lad be still only in early stage of convalescence also be perfectly clear that did not in least realise fact that have lost life cabin in lay be very large light airy most beautifully furnished with convenience luxury that most fastidious person must possibly desire be quite painful to see occupant on handsome capacious brass bedstead under most beautiful embroidered silk coverlet surrounded by everything that heart must wish for lying there wan peevish irritable dissatisfied with everybody everything seemingly because doting parent have gratified whim humoured caprice be quite evident that regarded with almost if not quite a great distaste a ever even seemed to consider grievance that owed life to despised britisher seeing how acutely mother be distressed at ungracious manner toward contented by saying few word of sympathy with on illness brought visit to speedy close five bell in afternoon watch have just be struck be once more on duty when man who have be sent aloft to attend to small matter hailed deck from main topsail yard to report that ten mile distant broad on weather beam there be something have appearance of dismasted wreck in reply to skipper who be on deck requested kennedy to take ship telescope up into main topmast crosstrees ascertain what object really be be done in due time mate came down reported that object a seen through glass proved to be biggish lump of craft ship barque totally dismasted with wreckage of spar still floating alongside to appearance derelict at once hauled wind shortly afterward tacked by eight bell be up with wreck hove to within biscuit toss to leeward of craft then briscoe second mate in charge of one of whaler be sent away to give derelict for such seemed to be overhaul craft be wooden vessel of about own tonnage painted black with broad white ribbon chequered with false port have dutch look about from model be evidently somewhat elderly have be ship rigged from appearance of wreckage alongside have be caught unawares very probably by recent hurricane dismasted have short full poop a rolled heavily toward caught sight of what looked like shattered framework of deckhouse close abaft stump of foremast also there be remains of two boat dangling from davit on quarter from of appearance concluded that have passed through pretty desperate experience what have become of crew there have be sign of when closed with hailed have of appeared since yet wreckage of boat hanging from davit made difficult for to believe that have abandoned ship true there be sign of longboat such a be usually stowed on main hatch of merchantman must hardly believe that crew have taken to in preference to two quarter boat for after fall of spar must have be difficult to launch so heavy boat unless indeed have run overboard fisherman fashion through wide gap in bulwark amidships on side where not only planking also stanchion have be swept away shortly after departure of briscoe drifted into position enabled to get view of stranger stern confirmed first surmise respecting origin for beneath row of smashed cabin window read word anna waarden amsterdam briscoe remained aboard wreck about three quarter of hour upon return reported that craft be derelict that there be nothing to show how crew have left except that appeared to have be with utmost suddenness for there be sign of having taken anything with even ship paper found in captain stateroom brought away with have be left behind that disaster must only have occurred very recently be proved by logbook have be entered up to within few hour of moment when hurricane struck while briscoe have found chronometer still going added that have sounded well found barely foot of water in that after careful examination have come to conclusion that hull be sound if mr vansittart must supply with crew believed must fit craft with jury rig take into port logbook showed that have sailed from batavia homeward bound for amsterdam sixteen day before date upon fell in with while paper made clear that be laden with cargo quite rich enough to justify attempt at salvage result of report be that mr vansittart summoned crew aft explained to through kennedy nature of second mate report request to be allowed to salve hull cargo then called for volunteer for job prospect of salvage money proved tempting enough to induce twenty men to come forward of whom kennedy chose fifteen including boatswain carpenter mate whereupon purser be instructed to make up men account to date pay off while first part of business namely making up of account be being attended to who have volunteered went below packed kit then brought on deck threw into first cutter mr vansittart gave after went aboard hollander got to work arrangement be that if briscoe found ship sound be if possible to follow to colombo if yacht must be there upon arrival be to turn over salvaged vessel to proper authority with crew rejoin stella mari if for reason plan must be found impracticable be to act according to own discretion preferably navigating ship to nearest port at must be refitted thence taking home half hour afterward grimwood purser reported that have made up account withdrawn from safe amount of money required to pay off volunteer be ordered to take whaler be still in water veered astern convey purser aboard other craft while be engaged upon business take look round consult with briscoe to determine whether latter have that be likely to require investigation showed a be of course to be expected that craft be amply supplied with provision water for long voyage also that be undamaged while be also well found in other respect a soon therefore a purser have finished task not without having of account disputed bade adventurer farewell wished safe prosperous voyage climbed down into boat returned to yacht after have made report to skipper filled away proceeded for colombo just a sun be dipping below horizon may mention here that saw more of briscoe crew did not turn up at colombo during sojourn there be not until long afterward that learned that after very protracted adventurous voyage anna waarden safely reached durban where refitted ultimately arriving safely in amsterdam at ten o'clock in morning of fifth day after parting company with briscoe entered colombo harbour came to anchor in six fathom boy julius be by time sufficiently recovered to show once more on deck health be still such a to cause mother anxiety therefore after anxious consultation with harper be arranged that must be taken up to kandy given fortnight thorough change of air scene whole party be to say mr vansittart son daughter monroe therefore packed up trap went ashore immediately after luncheon saw more of for full fortnight at least saw more of down aboard yacht after have be gone three four day kennedy received invitation to go up to kandy to dine spend next day there when returned brought with similar invitation for being now impossible for to be out of ship together since immediately upon briscoe departure have be temporarily promoted to position of second mate with promise of permanent confirmation in event of briscoe not rejoining so in turn up went to kandy enjoyed trip immensely being most warmly received by everybody except julius who seemed wholly unable to conquer antipathy toward when party returned to yacht be julius included looking vastly better for sojourn among hill indeed boy appeared better in health than have ever seen before thought there be shade of improvement in temper also came aboard about half past five o'clock in evening having be previously warned by letter moment that stepped in on deck hove up anchor started engine proceeded to sea in order that might avoid spending night in insufferable heat of harbour kept engine going until have rounded dondra head be heading north with adam peak square off port beam when made sail bound for calcutta where arrived exactly week later lay at calcutta whole month during mr vansittart party toured india from end to end seeing according to own account everything worth seeing while be thus engaged of wardroom did modest best to enjoy first of seeing everything be worth seeing in about city afterward engaging native pilot to take in motor launch to sunderbunds where braving malaria snake other peril spent week shooting four of who constituted party bagging seven tiger between to say nothing of other le formidable game from calcutta sailed for moulmein where remained four day getting hurried glimpse of burma burmese then sailed for singapore at southern extremity of malay peninsula on night of third day out from moulmein while be bowling merrily along with spanking wind abeam reeling off good twelve knot by log struck something conjectured to be piece of practically submerged wreckage for when afterwards came to investigate matter look out on forecastle head vowed by god that although be keenly alert have seen nothing incident occurred during middle watch while kennedy be in charge consequently be below asleep at time be awakened by shock although be not very severe kennedy rushed aft to taffrail to see if must catch glimpse of object whatever might be although night be starlit be too dark to see very distinctly although imagined that a stood there at gaze saw something break water eight ten fathom astern must not be sure wheeled about running forward to break of poop gave order to let fly royal topgallant halyard sheet to back mainyard also instructing carpenter to sound pump well for few moment while thing be doing there be confusion what with watch bustling about deck below rushing up on deck to see what have happened among being mr vansittart who appeared on poop wrapped in dressing gown presently ship be brought to wind hove to confusion began to subside especially when carpenter reported that ship be making water mr vansittart apprehensive that might have run down small native craft ordered remaining cutter to be lowered sent away in charge to investigate after pulling about for more than hour be unable to find anything at length returned to ship in response to rocket recall meanwhile carpenter have be below after most careful investigation have returned with report that must find indication that ship have sustained slightest damage consequently upon return cutter be hoisted up sail be again made on morrow with arrival of daylight discovery be made that three blade of propeller have be completely shorn off mishap little later on resulted in landing in what might have be very awkward mess possibly accident may have have effect of reminding lady skipper of something have slipped memory be that a may loss of propeller blade have sooner be discovered than issued certain order in response to several heavy case be swayed up on deck opened with result when sun went down that night stella mari be armed ship sporting two main deck battery of beautiful four inch quick firing gun of most up to date pattern six of side with two one pound hotchkisses on forecastle four maxim on poop chapter six kennedy banshee be shortly after noon on fifth day out from moulmein be just within malacca strait when wind began to fail by two bell in first dog watch have fallen stark calm yacht head be slowly boxing compass be close enough in with land to see from deck ridge of mountain range form backbone a be of malay peninsula though not coast line there be quite number of island in sight of be of respectable size while there be others must not have have area of more than few acre of indeed being scarcely more than rock most of however seemed inhabited for even on of smallest be able with help of telescope to distinguish one more ramshackle hut perched on top of long stilt like pole also there be at least hundred small fishing craft in sight a well a few proas probably coasting craft becalmed like now said mr vansittart addressing to kennedy a sat upon poop rail longing for sun to go down leave comparative coolness of night here be just where miss propeller if have not be for accident guess must have started engine must at least have have draught caused by ship passage through water to cool whereas will have to wait where be just simmer until breeze spring up again guess see sign of one a yet while glass stand very high mr leigh do happen to know whether there be such thing a dry dock at singapore have never be to singapore replied so can not say for certain seem to recollect having heard thing mentioned doe not directory say anything about there now declare to goodness that never thought to look exclaimed lady continued will go do so now if there happens to be dock there big enough to take in vessel guess will have stella mari docked cleaned propeller fixed have got spare one down below guess mackenzie be man enough to fit once get into harbour even if there be dock though hope there will be one will turn up directory now see what say therewith descended to chart room fanning with palm leaf fan a went a soon a mr vansittart be fairly out of earshot kennedy turned to said ever be through here before replied nearest have ever be to be two passage through sunda on voyage to from canton m m returned kennedy did annything out of common happen to ye voyage n o think not said trying to remember precisely what if anything have happened why do ask well replied companion chiefly think because yonder malay coast here be valuable ship becalmed helpless because have lost blade of propeller oh be sheer nonsense said be thinking about pirate suppose dear chap with incoming of steam piracy went out because no longer paid to be pirate never hear of thing in day not very often admit agreed kennedy yet be only about week before sailed from new york read in herald story of ship being picked up derelict in same strait when be boarded crew consisting of twenty seven men be found lying about deck murdered while main hatchway be open sign that have be plundered be a plain a large print indeed said remember hearing anything of case anyhow only happens once in blue moon think that with pretty double row of teeth maxim hotchkisses for close quarter fighting need be very greatly afraid agreed kennedy with laugh guess ye be right there lad wid gun hand enough to fight calculate be well fixed must beat off whole fleet of proas be rale sorry that skipper did think of havin ' mounted before so that men might have have chance to practise workin ' of bit ' there be thing here come skipper guess will spake to about at moment mr vansittart returned to poop with information that according to directory singapore possessed dry dock capable of taking in stella mari that being case must have ship docked spare propeller fitted a soon a possible after arrival very wise thing too ma'be agreed kennedy be only sorry that have got shipped very minute be returned mr vansittart looking up sharply a detected serious tone of first mate voice why reason in particular sure answered kennedy a be sayin ' to leigh minute ago yonder be malay coast here be becalmed unable to move now want to raise scare there be need for hold that be better to be ready for thing even if doe happen than to be caught unprepared doubt ye be well aware ma'be that malay have name of bein always ready to undertake piratical job if think there be chance of ut bein successful must be bit surprised if anybody be to tell that hundred of eye have be watchin afternoon owner speculatin a to sort of reception 'd meet with if few hundred be to come off to time durin ' small hour of mornin av coorse may not be here then breeze may spring up carry far enough away then again may in opinion bettin ' be against therefore if may be allowed to offer suggestion must be somethin ' like 'd recommend ye to send for bledsoe gunner to tell off crew to one of gun then let explain to captain of gun how thing work afther have done send down to magazine let sort out few round of ammunition for gun have handy to send up on deck also let gun be loaded ready in case of need if not needed charge can easily be withdrawn sent below again to morrow while if be will be ready also might be quite worth while to have small arm ready for servin ' out at moment notice exclaimed mr vansittart be quite serious mr kennedy because if be sound a though might be in for real big fight what do think mr leigh fully agree with mr kennedy madam said not so much because anticipate attack upon ship a clearly see force of argument a to advantage of preparedness yes agreed mr vansittart guess be right will act upon advice mr kennedy please send for gunner tell what to do have something of sort in mind when gave order for gun to be put on board by promptitude with kennedy sent for gunner when arrived mustered crew must clearly see that good man be distinctly anxious although did not believe have much cause to be so still quite agreed with that wise proper thing be to be prepared for possible contingency cheerfully did share of work fortunately bledsoe be ex man o ' war man have held gunner warrant in united state navy therefore knew business from to z gave help that needed first hand be mustered paraded then crew be told off to gun including hotchkisses maxim kennedy undertaking supervision of hotchkisses of maxim bledsoe next took gun crew separately in hand showed one how to work weapon left to practise movement of loading sighting firing sponging while passed on to next until battery be assiduously engaged in repeating several motion time after time finally worked way round to explained mechanism of maxim showed how belt of cartridge be fixed gun be handled be very simple picked whole thing up in few minute weapon being to so large extent automatic finally piece be loaded ten round for be brought on deck cover be put on hand be piped down be eight hour in night by time have come to be regular custom recognised thing for to dine in saloon on such occasion be to say other night arrangement with regard to kennedy being similar so that dined in saloon on alternate night doctor purser two engineer forming other guest thus a soon a exercise with gun be over rushed off below took tepid bath then dressed for dinner completing preparation just in time to respond to second bugle call there be disposition to make merry over kennedy scare a boy julius must persist in designating a lad be only one who seemed to regard matter purely from jocular point of view conversation be soon steered in more agreeable direction spent very pleasant evening breaking up shortly after ten o'clock before retiring to cabin went up on deck to take look round be most glorious night still breathless calm heaven perfectly clear save for low cloud bank hanging over land star shining brilliantly half moon shedding soft mysterious radiance upon scene powerful enough to enable to distinguish with tolerable clearness nearer island dozen craft lying becalmed within two mile of inshore moon must set about midnight yet even then must still have star if night remained clear kennedy be seated in deck chair with powerful night glass reposing upon knee when went up on poop informed that although have be keeping careful watch upon matter inshore have seen nothing whatever of suspicious character then explained did expect to if malay be a 'cute a take to be be cherishing design against may bet bottom dollar that will be careful not to do anything must appear to in least suspicious may be fool thing look almost too quiet ashore there to be wholly satisfactory to must rather see little more movement fishing boat two coming out something like why have known case where ship bein ' becalmed a be widin few mile of shore native have come off in score wid fruit fish curio to sell chap ashore there have kept most religiously away from ah well that cloud yonder be risin ' slowly admit still be risin ' hope will bring breeze wid if be only enough to give steerage way like thing a be not least little bit why man exclaimed what be matter with to night if did know better must be almost inclined to think be afraid afraid be ut laughed begorra what must be afraid of in such ship a wid beautiful gun what not to purtect leigh be not afraid be a know well yet have curious feelin ' ca describe ut be sort of feelin ' of howly sailor what in nation be that did ye hear boy hear must think so so have other individual on deck if one might judge by sudden silence fell upon men grouped about fore deck followed by equally sudden fusillade of low quick ejaculation swift rush of bare foot to rail began a low weird moan rose rapidly to sort of sobbing wail culminated in sharp unearthly scream sent cold shiver running down spine caused hair of head to bristle upon scalp seemed to come from water almost immediately under bow saw little crowd of men spring up ladder leading to topgallant forecastle rush to rail peer eagerly down into black water then one of straightened up suddenly hailed poop there did ye hear that strange cry sir ay ay answered kennedy heard right enough d 'ye suppose be deaf what be ut anyway be makin ' there be brief animated confab on forecastle then voice have hailed came back ca see anything anywhere sir sound seemed to come from away yonder on starboard bow instantly there arose hubbub of protesting voice one of louder than rest must be heard exclaiming chump what d 'ye mean by sayin that ye know difference between starboard port be away off here to port that sound came from assertion in turn be contradicted by first speaker adherent so that in le than minute strenuous argument be proceeding on forecastle party to seemed to be in wrong ay ay there ye be commented kennedy nobody know where sound came from 't be banshee bhoy be what ut be oirishman aboard good ship be goin ' to lose number of mess shortly oh nonsense exclaimed surely believe that have got so far with protest when again blood curdling cry rang out over dark water time sounding more distant than before once more clamorous dispute arose on forecastle a to direction from sound proceeded for curiously enough two individual seemed quite agreed upon point while even felt impossible to make authoritative statement a to whether cry arose from ahead astern in midst of discussion up came saloon party en masse to enquire what be matter be for not very definite reason glad that kennedy did not again assert banshee theory merely stated fact of case leaving others to draw own conclusion boy julius sooner heard chief mate statement than be ready with explanation in high pitched tone of voice must be distinctly heard from one end of ship to other positively asserted that cry be of sea bird although have never in life heard sea bird utter such terrible sound have men forward if one might judge by low contemptuous laughter from forecastle with assertion be greeted although kennedy demurred boy insisted that be right knew about finally rushed off to cabin for book certain passage in declared must support contention seized opportunity thus afforded to retire in good order to own cabin when went on deck again at eight bell moon be just on point of ruddily setting while cloud bank have noticed earlier in evening hanging low over land have risen until upper edge be almost over mast head blotting out about star be now so dark away to eastward that nothing must be seen not even faintest loom of nearest island while if have not be for faintly glimmering light here there must not have told that there be craft of kind in neighbourhood there have be repetition of strange weird sound have startled earlier in night so kennedy informed be still firmly convinced that have emanated from banshee when laughingly tried to argue out of conviction took up rather sharply with assertion have be of irish birth extraction must know better than to make light of matter to amazement seemed quite depressed low spirited at mere mention of so quickly dropped subject asked if during watch have observed anything to confirm earlier suspicion that might possibly be attacked admitted that have not added niver expected to see annything so long a light lasted be now that will be beginnin ' to make musther if ginks mane comin off to at so for love o ' mike keep eye skinned ear wide open through watch can keep off aisily if only get warnin ' enough if by anny chance can conthrive to creep up close enough to take unawares lay aboard may take ship through sheer force av number why said talk a though felt absolutely certain that attack will be made upon ship ca understand bit to night be fact faith boy can not undherstand mesilf replied kennedy seriously have never before felt a do blessed night somehow know that something goin ' to happen then there be banshee oh interrupted banshee be hanged thought be much too sensible fellow to be moved by superstition of kind now take advice have got touch of sun go down to doc get to give good stiff dose of quinine turn in will feel different man when be roused at eight bell find that ship be right a to anything creeping up taking unawares may trust to see that nothing of sort happens will keep bright look out never fear well hope ye will be returned kennedy a stepped toward head of poop ladder on way below by by there be one precaution ye may a well take unship side light stow somewhere handy where gleam will not show be quite useless since be becalmed unless steamer must happen along if doe ye will see light hear propeller in plenty of time to show where ye be mask skylight too then maybe if annybody come lookin ' for wid evil intention will not find good night keep bright look out with final caution first mate took off much to relief for truth to tell undisguised anxiety uneasiness be beginning to get bit upon nerve a soon a be out of way went forward in obedience to what took to be order caused red green side light to be unshipped placed inboard just inside topgallant forecastle door at same time cautioning look out to keep eye skinned a be in somewhat dangerous water then went aft masked skylight slipped into saloon for moment to extinguish light save one draw blind across open port task took le than couple of minute then returned to poop took good look round must see nothing except four dim glimmer of light spaced at irregular interval took to be light of becalmed craft have seen inshore of earlier in evening a for sound there be nothing to be heard save occasional faint gurgle of water under counter when ship lifted to almost invisible swell accompanied by low flap of canvas aloft gentle patter of reef point slight creak of parral block sheave so breathlessly still be night that sound faint a really be sounded almost appallingly loud there be not smallest murmur of subdued talk for'ard for watch have curled up in most comfortable place must find in order to steal caulk did not attempt to disturb knowing that at first call must be upon foot in moment to keep awake proceeded to pace poop to fro in rubber soled shoe taking care to avoid passing over portion of deck formed roof of lady skipper stateroom while be thus engaged nearly collided with ghostly figure proved upon investigation to be that of monroe tutor parson in pyjama slipper explained that found too hot to sleep below so have come up on deck in hope of being able to cool off bit prior to having try fell into step alongside began to talk in low voice presently turning conversation to kennedy queerness of seemingly rooted conviction that must be attacked let talk on until appeared to have said that have to say upon subject be about to go below again when said to be glad that came up on deck because affords opportunity to say something that kennedy queer talk have rather forced upon mind be if by chance must be attacked will undertake to see that mr vansittart daughter boy be of prevented from coming on deck presence here under such circumstance must be of possible assistance to on contrary must be distinct hindrance yes acknowledged monroe see what mean suppose that of must take into head to come on deck how be to prevent have authority over not even over boy must bring moral suasion to bear upon if need be said point out to that beating off of piratical attack oh hang what bosh be talking to be sure a though there be least likelihood of such thing talk of as kennedy seems to have hypnotised a well a to return to what be saying if utterly improbable thing must happen point out to that fighting be men work that presence of woman child must be worse than useless at time let remain below exercise authority over boy of hers to make stay below also suppose that miss anthea must need persuading agreed monroe be right on whole very sensible girl despite foolish pride let give hint leigh in event of a say such exceedingly unlikely thing a attack occurring trust too much to power of persuasion act upon own responsibility lock door of drawing room mr vansittart will be unable to get out on deck however anxious may be then slip down below lock master julius into cabin be will need to do there will probably be row afterward will back up by saying that what did be done by advice now good night feel trifle cooler than did hope will be able to hallo listen did hear anything chapter seven attacked by pirate halted listened intently monroe with one foot on top step of companion on way below what did think heard questioned in half whisper well can scarcely say be low spoken reply a matter of fact be not sure that heard anything be beginning to think that kennedy stupid talk must have affected aft here more le certainly seemed to that while be bidding good night just now caught faintest suggestion of ah by jove there be again did catch yes said unless believe be imagination thought heard sound like groaning of oar against thole pin distance off in direction with flourish of hand toward east yes agreed monroe describes sound exactly surely kennedy apprehension can not have be well founded after can know in least returned guess will very soon now meanwhile since must be obvious to can not possibly leave deck at juncture perhaps will have goodness to slip down below do that key turning trick suggested to just now sure will answered parson be advice will take responsibility of carrying out vanished down companion way a disappeared went down poop ladder at run hurried forward made way to forecastle head where found look out leaning against guard rail with arm folded chin sunk upon chest be not asleep for a heard light patter of shoe upon ladder straightened turned to see who be coming have very shrewd suspicion that stillness of night have induced in condition very much reverse of alertness be that johnson demanded sharply sir replied be maguire then maguire said be afraid have not be keeping quite so wideawake a ought considering that be look out for instance have heard unusual sound such a ought to have reported since came on watch sir replied man a to will do interrupted now pull together listen set intently to listen before dozen second have passed heard loud voice of monroe boy almost immediately afterward of mr vansittart parson in remonstrance boy in loud angry protest that of lady in anxious enquiry seemed a though monroe have somehow mismanaged rather delicate task for a started to go aft again heard lad shout will go on deck if feel like monroe be going to stop a for britisher do think care what say here mr vansittart cut in with injunction to julius to hold tongue following up with enquiry a to what fuss be about felt that be time took hand so cautioning maguire to keep bright look out listen for be worth sprang down forecastle ladder on way aft a did so ran into couple of men who have just crept out from beneath launch evidently curious to learn what disturbance be about halting for moment ordered two men to rouse watch quietly stand by for hand call then continued on way aft meeting trio just by foot of poop ladder mr vansittart be evidently in something of temper for a joined party turned sharply demanded be that mr leigh be madam replied hush julius continued for boy also have turned angrily upon pray stop outcry for heaven sake silence be of vital importance to at moment for may be on very verge of crisis mr monroe be of opinion that very recently heard certain sound know about interrupted mr vansittart mr monroe have already explained that to what want to know now be by what right presumed to instruct to lock door of drawing room so prevent from coming out on deck yes added boy in high pitched clamorous voice of must carry so far over water on night what right have to order to be locked in cabin who be must like to know craft on port quarter two of 'em three four whole fleet of small craft headin dead for yelled look out at moment good heaven ejaculated then kennedy extraordinary premonition be right after unceremoniously quitting little group under break of poop rushed forward shouting hand to general quarter throw open port off with gun cover slew gun point out through port pas word for gunner send aft to then turned went aft again once more encountering saloon party now made complete by appearance of miss anthea clad like mother in very becoming dressing gown madam said addressing mr vansittart there be time for explanation at moment for unless be very greatly mistaken be about to be attacked by fleet of pirate craft most earnestly beseech to retire below taking son daughter with out of harm way if suspicion be well founded none of can be of slightest assistance on deck while at moment may have shot flying about ear yes skipper agreed be quite right mr leigh be perfectly right julius therefore order to go to cabin at once too anthea mr monroe if julius will not go quietly authorise to use such force a may be necessary to compel to go when have seen safe in cabin lock in bring key now sir very haughtily to be good enough to accompany to poop let see what justification there be for sudden alarm confusion be very evident that lady be tremendously indignant with at when came to think of be not greatly surprised for certainly be tremendous liberty for second officer to consent to much le order locking of skipper owner in own cabin therefore followed very much crestfallen up poop ladder at once looked away out over port quarter in search of supposed pirate fleet be at time so very dark that for several second must see nothing moon have set bank of cloud already referred to have overspread more than sky moreover mist have come creeping up from eastward not dense enough to merit name of fog yet sufficiently thick to dim light of star still shining in western half of heaven while added still more to darkness gloomed away to eastward of presently down in midst of dusky blackness broad on port quarter caught glimpse of small indeterminate shape of still deeper blackness then until have counted ten of concentrating gaze intently upon felt sure must occasionally distinguish small evanescent silvery gleam like of sea fire stirred into brilliance by slow passage of moving object through water yes exclaimed pointing there come ten of if not more have particular order to give madam will leave defence of ship to mr kennedy why of course leave to kennedy to do best can replied mr vansittart know nothing at about fighting tactic will not attempt to interfere further than will go below although like idea of quitting deck at approach of enemy for be sensible enough to recognise can do good up here must only be in way walter never under circumstance again dream of turning key upon be most unwarrantable liberty not even such crisis a can justify for few minute be really furiously angry with believe what did be done with very best of intention so will say no more about now here come kennedy so will just say word two to then go take care of dear boy see that get hurt there be time for to express gratitude to lady for exceeding kindness in thus overlooking what at best must only be described a serious error of judgment although even so must not refrain from reminding that fault originated with monroe for at moment first mate came bounding up poop ladder struggling into jacket a came whoopee shouted a reached level of poop what did tell ye bhoy where be shpalpeens show to oh beg pardon ma'be did expect to find here where did expect must be then pray mr kennedy demanded skipper hiding in shaft tunnel suppose by piper ye might be in worse place than same ma'be up here for instance interrupted kennedy mr vansittart be in mood to discus unfortunate subject further just then at event therefore cut in upon first mate remark by saying now will do mr kennedy please listen to for time be pressing have just be explaining to mr leigh that know nothing about fighting therefore will leave to do best can for defence go below out of way since can be of use up here good night take care of yourselves let know when be over with lady took off to intense relief now then exclaimed kennedy turning to where be cut throat pirate that be afther hearin ' about there be le than mile off replied pointing be coming along very slowly hoping to catch unawares perhaps goodness know that young rip julius be making noise enough just now to be heard at double distance to show that of at least be broad awake then briefly explained what order have so far given waited to hear what have to say have small arm be served out yet demanded not yet answered be ready at moment notice right approved let be served out at once cutlas brace of fully loaded automatic to man not forgettin ' noble self with maxim will not need rifle guess turned away to issue order when be met at head of poop ladder by bledsoe gunner sent for sir asked did bledsoe said come up mr kennedy be here may have order for then turned to kennedy said here be gunner sent for few minute ago thinking might wish to see also have in mind to order to send few portfires up on deck occurred to that if fellow insist on closing with must be good plan to have hand up in maintop with portfires must enable to see what be doing must that agreed kennedy will do ut see to mr bledsoe if ye plaise ye may also send up ammunition for four inch maxim guess will not need hotchkisses will do gunner let have ammunition quick mr leigh be good enough to attend to matther of shmall arm then come back here take charge of maxim be about time let ginks know that be awake so will step down to main deck see about throwin ' shot over descended to main deck together hand being by time on deck at station while went below to attend to sending up distribution of cutlass automatic kennedy planted in rear of number gun of port battery minute later deep ringing report jar of discharge be heard felt with what effect knew not being on deck beneath minute later second gun roared overhead while ear be still ringing with report heard boom of distant gun listened breathlessly for impact of shot heard nothing however so concluded that missile have flown wide by time that third gun spoke task below be completed therefore snatched at cutlas buckled belt round waist took brace of automatic pistol from man who be loading thrust into belt rushed up on deck encountered kennedy near foot of poop ladder reported to what have done received from order to go up on poop open fire with maxim forthwith have hit one of thim seems to be sinkin ' said rest of divvy be comin ' for like mad wid sweep churnin ' up wather like paddle of one av london tug shtop from layin aboard if ye can bhoy want hand to hand fightin ' thim for will outnumber ten to one calculate added last item in confidential whisper dashed up on poop to great satisfaction found maxim manned well supplied with ammunition although be now easy enough to hear grind splash of sweep with attacker be urging craft through water ay even to hear shout of encouragement to other darkness mist together still combined to render too indistinctly visible to permit of effective firing from maxim therefore shouted to kennedy suggestion that must order man in maintop to light portfires so that might have light to see what be about kennedy be in very act of giving order when three of approaching craft fired upon almost at same instant moment later heard sharp splintering crash followed by dull crunching sound below on main deck one of enemy round shot have got home through port bulwark so far a must judge be in perfect fever of impatience to get additional light though be ever so little have about made up mind to open fire with maxim without further delay for approaching craft be by time perilously close not more than two cable length distant believe when caught faint flicker of light from aloft next instant baleful blue white glare of portfire illuminated scene revealed ten small sailing craft foaming down upon under impulse of from twelve to sixteen powerfully manned sweep apiece craft carried gun looked to be about calibre of twelve pound smooth bore mounted in eye of deck be crowded with malay of most ferocious malignant determined aspect caught gleam flash of light from innumerable kris rifle barrel a owner waved above head in savage anticipation of presently getting to close quarter with be evident that be confronted with most formidable dangerous situation demanding utmost promptitude of action at once turned to crew of port maxim with command upon lip to to open fire when cry of horror arose from gun crew on main deck immediately below where be standing man looking up to pointing with hand shouted that mate be killed glancing down over poop rail saw body of poor kennedy stretched out on deck in midst of pool of blood with top of head shot away doubtless by round shot that few second earlier have heard crash through bulwark let have content of gun will bear shouted then turning to maxim crew added open fire upon nearest craft first clear deck of men if can before get alongside light be only thing that lad pirate too apparently have be waiting for for next moment gun of port battery crashed forth one after other while port maxim only one of two must be brought to bear started savage thud thudding tattoo in le than minute ship be enveloped in cloud of acrid smoke hanging motionless in stagnant air effectually cloaked approach of attacking force a effectually prevented anything like accurate shooting be enemy one whit behindhand in availing of assistance afforded by light of portfires indeed have rather best of for although hull of yacht be speedily enveloped in smoke portfire brilliantly illuminated canvas thus afforded excellent guide in aiming now round shot began to fly thick fast while bullet slug hummed sang about ear like swarm of angry hornet luckily for aim of pirate be atrociously bad probably fire of maxim disconcerted although afterward found that five round shot have passed through sail only one struck hull while by what seemed like miracle bullet missed body though in many case by only merest hair breadth for perhaps minute fire of pirate be maintained with utmost fury then in moment died away to few desultory shot presently ceased putting whistle to lip blew shrill blast upon followed up with order main deck gun cease firing a uttered word thought felt faint draught of air upon face be not mistaken for at same moment heavy pall of smoke enveloped began lazily to shape into fantastic wreath slowly swept away to westward while lighter canvas rustled gently then filled to small air from eastward a happened sail be correctly trimmed so that be needed be just to allow ship to come up to proper course when gathered way meanwhile with dispersion of smoke be able once more to get glimpse of enemy that glimpse revealed to be in full flight must have suffered frightfully from fire before courage gave way for of ten craft constituted original attacking force only six be now visible while one of appeared to be more le in difficulty three of indeed very much more than le perceived that only one of half dozen appeared to be working full complement of sweep while be hobbling off under impulse of single pair shell though be of four inch diameter be capable of inflicting serious damage when hit explode breeze at first came away a mere breathing gained steadily in strength until yacht be sliding along at six knot pace must have be easy for to have overtaken audacious attacker sunk out of hand have doubt a to whether of must remain afloat long enough to get back to small hidden harbour from have emerged while in case seemed to that rascal have received so severe punishment that must be long before again attempted to attack seemingly helpless ship therefore allowed to go way without further molestation boarding fore main tack brought ship to course done gave order for gun to be secured charge to be drawn unused ammunition to be returned to magazine small arm to armourer deck to be cleared up generally meanwhile poor kennedy body have be carried forward laid upon fore hatch covered over with tarpaulin poor chap be sincerely grieved at loss for be first rate seaman thoroughly stanch messmate a passing round deck to satisfy that order have be satisfactorily executed paused for moment to gaze regretfully at shrouded form under tarpaulin must not help wondering little at memory that only victim must have be one to have experienced premonition practically amounting to certainty not only of encounter also a now felt convinced that must prove fatal to having completed inspection of deck satisfied that everything be right called boatswain aft to take temporary charge then entered drawing room intending to pas through to door of mr vansittart cabin to make report on entering apartment be surprised to find lady seated there fully dressed evidently waiting with impatience for news a advanced rose to foot held out hand to well walter exclaimed be over dreadful fighting mean be unhurt be not so then a briefly replied in affirmative continued why be looking so serious why have come to instead of mr kennedy most sincerely hope that nothing dreadful have happened have got off much more easily than at one moment dared to hope said grieve to inform that fight have cost life of one man man whom can least of afford to lose will guess at once that mean poor kennedy who be killed by round shot only shot did damage worth mentioning for moment mr vansittart seemed scarcely able to credit news believe that up to then have never quite realised fact of peril now that one of men have actually lost life be suddenly brought home to with startling vividness be correspondingly upset stared at unbelievingly gasped what neil kennedy killed oh walter can not possibly mean then a nodded head sank back into chair burst into tear thought best to let have cry out in peace for tear seem to be natural safety valve of woman emotion while sat there with face buried in hand tear streaming through finger miss anthea monroe julius came up from below of course wanted to know what be matter be obliged to explain in course of explanation took something of form of brief narrative of entire adventure happened to remark what puzzle more than anything be how happened that fellow be able to find so accurately on so dark night took greatest care to mask light effectually yet when first sighted be heading a straight for a if be in plain sight so be remarked monroe for have to thank young friend julius here when in obedience to mother command took below to cabin before fight began not only found open port of cabin uncovered three of electric light ablaze so that port must have shown up in dark like lighthouse young gentleman explained to that must sleep because of heat have therefore be reading in bed chapter eight weird startling experience untimely death of poor kennedy resulted in being promoted to position of first mate of stella mari young a be while boatswain who knew nothing of navigation be excellent seaman be temporarily given post of second mate until someone more suited to position must be found at ten o'clock in morning following brush with malay hand be mustered for church parade a on sunday kennedy body be committed to deep with solemnity monroe read burial service so impressively that even lad julius be visibly affected while mr vansittart daughter of attired in black for occasion wept freely three day later arrived in singapore on following day yacht be docked for examination fitting of spare propeller upon examination hull be found to be quite undamaged yet must have hit wreckage whatever be that ran foul of pretty severe blow for not only be weed completely scoured off ship bottom where contact have occurred anti fouling composition have also be removed a effectually a though scraper have be employed stayed at singapore exactly week then with bottom scraped clean two fresh coat of anti fouling composition applied outside of hull up to level of rail repainted spare propeller fitted sailed for hong kong be mr vansittart intention to ship second third mate at singapore forbore to do so no suitable men happening to be available during stay temporary arrangement be therefore allowed to stand little longer lady skipper hoping to find what required at hong kong went to sea in fine weather made excellent uneventful progress during first four day of trip then on fourth night out when be in neighbourhood of vanguard bank wind fell light finally died away leaving becalmed very much a have happened with in strait of malacca time however there be land craft in sight be therefore under apprehension of repetition of experience on occasion ought by way to have stated that upon arrival at singapore duly reported adventure to authority with result that british gunboat cormorant be dispatched to scene of outrage be given to understand that must probably prove exceedingly difficult if not impossible to lay hand upon guilty party a matter of fact afterwards learned that only result of cormorant visit to spot be discovery of considerable quantity of wreckage several dead body floating about a have said wind began to drop late in afternoon of fourth day out from singapore by eight bell of second dog watch have lost steerage way a soon a happened matter be reported to mr vansittart enquired whether wished engine to be started replied that be in especial hurry to reach hong kong therefore a there be particular reason for pushing on must not waste gasoline engine be therefore permitted to remain inactive furled light canvas to save wear tear hauled up course leaving ship under topsail topgallant sail jib fact be that none of quite knew what to make of weather glass stood fairly high with rising rather than falling tendency yet sky be hazy without being exactly overcast considering where be be weather particularly hot atmosphere however seemed surcharged with damp although rain fell with going down of sun fell exceedingly dark for moon be far advanced in last quarter did not rise until very late rather in early morning while haze be thick enough to shut out light of star effectually water be smooth excepting for low easterly swell to remind of breeze have died away chanced to be eight hour in night a have become firmly established custom on such occasion be dining with saloon party with of whom excepting julius be now upon excellent term mr vansittart have graciously listened to explanation of accepted apology for colossal liberty have taken in suggesting that must be locked in cabin on memorable night of piratical attack upon not only have freely forgiven believe that after have fully explained motif actuated felt almost inclined to admit be to certain extent justified possibly must have admitted for fact that admission might have be subversive of discipline monroe have always got on splendidly together even once haughty miss anthea have at length thawed completely even to extent of singing duet with playing accompaniment while sang fiddled be only boy whom seemed utterly unable to placate have taken violent dislike to from very first not even fact have undoubtedly saved life seemed to make apparent difference in attitude toward since leaving singapore have resumed musical evening after dinner temporarily interrupted by kennedy death be enjoying a usual on evening of be now speaking when while be playing violin solo to miss anthea accompaniment be startled by sudden very slight jarring sensation a though ship have lightly touched ground for moment knew that be in neighbourhood of vanguard prince consort prince of wale bank although also knew that according to position a determined that afternoon course distance since run ought to be far enough away from to be perfectly safe thought for moment seized that in extraordinary wholly unaccountable manner might have be mistaken flinging down violin rushed out on deck closely followed by mr vansittart monroe on reaching deck found that jar have already created quite small commotion boatswain watch being on alert while hand below awakened by unaccustomed sensation be swarming up to learn what have happened parker boatswain be shouting for one hand to bring along hand lead to to bring lighted lantern first glance be over side be so dark must see nothing save faint gleam under lighted port then men with lead line lantern came along took several cast of lead bottom be report even while line be being coiled up after last cast same sensation be again experienced time little stronger then while be debating what must possibly mean one of hand from forward came along reassured know what be sir explained have felt very same thing before not very far from here too while be lyin ' in manila harbour must make out what mischief be at first when skipper went ashore shortly afterwards told that there 'd be slight shock of earthquake explanation seemed quite reasonable satisfactory so after little further talk returned to drawing room resumed music shortly afterward be again disturbed twice by recurrence of same phenomenon accordingly gave up went off to cabin debating within whether must change into working rig turn in finally decided upon former alternative since did not feel much inclined for sleep when have effected change went up on deck thinking possibly spell of fresh air must bring on desired drowsiness a reached main deck four bell ten o'clock be struck look out have just responded with stereotyped cry of well when there occurred shock so violent protracted that of hand cried out in terror be difficult to gauge passage of time accurately at moment think shock must have lasted nearly if not quite two minute sensation to can most nearly compare be that of ship being swept jolted over rough surface of coral reef by red hot tide so strong so alarming be shock that created something almost amounting to panic among crew few of whom in alarm raised cry to launch boat be not without difficulty that be eventually persuaded that yacht be quite uninjured that be therefore far safer on deck than must possibly be in boat be not greatly surprised at alarm for phenomenon be of so unusual startling character to confess truth felt own self possession little inclined to wilt a companion must probably have put meanwhile saloon party like everybody else have rushed on deck in alarm be eagerly discussing occurrence monroe assured two lady that need not be in least degree uneasy since strange a phenomenon might be to be really not so very extraordinary unusual especially in region where now found ourselves be making good headway in effort to reassure audience when suddenly there occurred still more violent shock be so pronounced that set sea quiver with ripple seemed to run in direction of point of compass crossing recrossing other at conceivable angle with such rapidity that shaling of water be like of strong rapid while interlacing so to speak of ripple created sort of network of miniature breaker easily visible because of phosphorescence set up jar jolting of last shock be so severe that really began to entertain serious fear a to whether ship must withstand seemed to that if thing continued very long rivet in must be shaken torn out of place entire fabric must fall to piece for deck be now quivering jolting so violently that to maintain footing instinctively clung to nearest thing must lay hand upon must confess be more than little astonished at courage manifested by mr vansittart daughter there must be doubt that be greatly alarmed yet be more self possessed than of rest of so much so indeed that mr vansittart voice be almost steady a directed to find mackenzie instruct to start engine think must feel more comfortable if have ship under command explained have just executed commission returned to poop ship be already beginning to gather way when above hiss of agitated water low rumble became audible increasing with inconceivable rapidity to frightful deafening roar vibration grew still more violent suddenly with awful ear splitting explosion saw great column of flame shoot high into air two mile away almost directly ahead of looked for world a though gigantic cannon planted vertically in sea muzzle upward have be discharged except that flash of fire instead of being only momentary a in case of gun be continuous remained visible for quite ten minute probably endured for much longer period emission of flame be accompanied by frightful roaring sound like of thousand blast furnace intermingled with frequent terrific explosion continued to hear long after have lost sight of fire at first outburst of flame instinctively sprang to wheelhouse ordered dazed terrified quartermaster to put helm hard port let ship sweep round in complete half circle so that might get away from dangerous spot a speedily a possible have hardly begun to turn in response to hard over helm before dense cloud of steam commenced to rise from water round about flame soon obscured to extent that glare at first be almost a strong a daylight rapidly dwindled until became merely great shapeless luminous blotch growing le le brilliant until lost sight of altogether a went at full speed ahead away from be quite quarter of hour before be fairly clear of extraordinary danger have so suddenly leaped up in path within first minute following explosion great mass of incandescent rock mingled with flaming cinder began to fall about on side so regard a nothing short of miracle that none of larger mass fell upon deck have done so must inevitably have be destroyed a be be kept busy with hose for fully hour extinguishing cinder fell upon deck not least remarkable circumstance connected with phenomenon be that soon after started pump water rapidly became so hot that men must not bear contact of upon bare foot be obliged to don sea boot hurriedly at first be fearful that dense cloud of steam generated by flame must spread overtake be spared for almost immediately small breeze sprang up blowing toward fire a advanced strengthened until became quite stiff breeze to circumstance attribute fact that none of sail be set on fire by falling cinder for necessitated hurried clewing up furling of canvas for full hour travelled south at full speed then having apparently run beyond limit of danger zone shifted helm headed east until daylight when perceiving sign of eruption wind having drawn round from eastward set canvas stopped engine week later arrived at hong kong without further adventure be amazed to learn that nothing be known there of submarine volcanic outburst for such of course be from have so narrowly escaped destruction although remained week in roadstead during several craft arrived from south two from philippine must learn that others than have beheld phenomenon before arrival at singapore have be mr vansittart intention to proceed from port to manila being somewhat curious to see something of united state farthest east possession on way north united state consul at singapore have very strongly dissuaded from making such visit therefore skipped philippine after spending week at hong kong during saloon party made trip to canton back weighed stood out of harbour en route for yokohama have good run up through china sea doing trip in ten day from port to port without being obliged to use engine at arrived in magical land of chrysanthemum lady skipper spread a graphically expressed devoting full month to exploration of country returning to ship loaded down with priceless treasure of porcelain picture carving lacquer work mostly designed a present for more stay at home friend in little old n'york when must get back of course child went with monroe equally of course went along a escort while mr vansittart party be enjoying crew also have opportunity to see something of what many regard a most wonderful country people in world same generous rule with regard to shore leave prevailing here a elsewhere for did not see nearly a much of country a must have liked for unfortunately happened that at time of visit relation between japan united state be somewhat strained in connection with settlement of japanese subject on united state soil star stripe be not altogether welcome in japanese port indeed within first week of arrival in harbour have reason to suspect that malicious attempt have be made to damage to destroy yacht a be in charge during owner absence did not care to leave for more than day at time only once a long a of course must be understood that such ill feeling a undoubtedly existed be only openly manifested by private person almost entirely of lower class official japan be very essence of politeness urbanity whenever came into contact with there be just one element of regret for mr vansittart in visit to japan be unfortunate fact that monroe developed typhoid on very day of party return to yokohama have to be left behind in hospital must most willingly have prolonged stay until patient recovery harper doctor intervened pointing out that since next cruise be to be among pacific island must be most inadvisable for person newly recovered from typhoid to accompany a relapse must almost certainly follow that better plan must be to arrange for monroe return home direct by mail boat via 'frisco be accordingly done mr vansittart making arrangement for care comfort of patient during sojourn in yokohama journey to new york in ease comfort afterward before giving word for departure hove anchor out of mud of yokohama harbour at ten o'clock on certain lovely september morning a mr vansittart informed incidentally happened to be anniversary of yacht departure from new york starting engine proceeded down yedo bay through uraga strait so to sea passing cape mela about eight bell in afternoon watch then to fine spanking westerly breeze set plain sail headed south for ladrones arrive now at point where for space of over two month find entry in diary of incident worthy of special mention period may therefore be dismissed with simple remark that be spent in visiting several of most interesting island in pacific archipelago sailed from taputeuea in gilbert group in middle of november for more than week headed west making good headway on whole although there be time when be detained by vexatious calm to counterbalance carried on when wind favoured have clear sea ahead such happened to be case on certain day in first week of december have slashing easterly breeze behind fine clear weather chart told that there be lurking danger in path therefore gave yacht whole flight of studding sail on side laid out to make up little of lost time be doing so in handsome style too for ship reeled off fourteen knot hour after hour until end of afternoon watch when wind suddenly hauled four point to southward freshened although shift of wind necessitated handing star board studding sail gave fore aft canvas chance to put in good work did ship speed going up to sixteen knot within next hour for sailing ship sixteen knot be very respectable speed let tell although can recall more than one occasion when logged nineteen that not only for brief spell for three four hour at stretch still sixteen knot be pretty good pace be exhilarating sight to watch rush of white yacht over glorious sapphire sea with sail accurately set trimmed tugging at beautiful hull like team of cart horse long weighty swell chasing wind whipped capped with seething crest of snow white foam while great glass bow wave went roaring away on hand with hissing leaping crown of froth sparkling like gem in ray of declining sun think mr vansittart be never more proud of beautiful ship than be on particular evening a stood with on poop critically marked rush through water perfection of hull spar sail yacht be lovely picture even a beheld by from poop must have given trifle for privilege of seeing a must have appeared at moment from passing ship have there be craft a happened there be not have sea to ourselves for chanced just then to be traversing stretch of water very rarely frequented by craft of description happened to be eight hour out on particular night when at eight bell of first watch turned ship over to parker boatswain be still reeling off sixteen knot with fresh steady breeze from south east be dark night for moon be only two day old have set long ago while thin veil of cloud hid most of star have be in much frequented water must perhaps have considered bit reckless to drive ship so hard through darkness be not retired to cabin with easy mind undressing at once tumbled into bunk fell sound asleep almost a head touched pillow chapter nine wrecked how long slept have mean of knowing can remember be that from sound dreamless sleep be startled into sudden wakefulness by experiencing shock of such tremendous violence that first real consciousness of anything being amiss be caused by finding hurled headlong out of bunk to deck of cabin fell so awkwardly that seemed to land fair upon right temple after instant of sharp pain forthwith lost consciousness for length of time must have be considerable although never have mean to guess even approximately remember one thing distinctly even a be in very act of falling terrific rending crash sounded in ear thought flashed through brain there go mast by board return of consciousness manifested in hazy quite detached perception be being violently shaken by shoulder while voice pitched in aggrieved petulant tone presently recognised a of lad julius exhorted to wake up at first exhortation produced particular effect upon be aware of be have definite meaning so far a be concerned did not even trouble to ask why must wake up then after period of silence during perhaps slipped back into unconsciousness became aware that water be being vigorously dashed in face while julius voice resumed petulant appeal oh say dash do wake up leigh heard boy exclaim wake up tell momma blocked into cabin si ca get out be only one of crew left suppose wit must have be reasserting by time for word conveyed sort of definite meaning to especially that last statement be only one of crew left only one of crew what crew why of course crew of stella mari in have recollection of having spent very pleasant time then a memory began to work recalled tremendous shock have hurled scarcely awake out of bunk jarring rending crash have reached ear in very act of falling what did thing mean asked answer came without much groping for what must mean except disaster have overtaken yacht opened eye by light of rapidly growing dawn perceived first be still in own cabin secondly that julius be bending over with water jug in one hand tumbler in other from latter of have just dashed quantity of water in face also be conscious of splitting headache burning smarting sensation in right temple put up hand passed over seat of pain be immediately conscious of increased smart a lowered hand looked at stupidly be smeared with blood oh be nothing commented boy a looked questioningly at ruddy stain have cut forehead bit be thank goodness have woke up at last thought at first 'd handed in check now say just get up come with to drawing room momma somehow pinned in cabin want to get out right said will come what have happened to ship seems to be dunno replied boy be wrecked that be can tell three mast be broken exceptin ' momma be only person left only person left ejaculated a staggered to foot good heaven boy what do mean just exactly what say returned master julius see here continued aggressively dare to call boy ' again like wo have see certainly replied with smile at lad astonishing touchiness at moment see hear right apologise now what be say about mother be jammed in cabin ca get out will go attend to first when have be released must look into other matter of missing crew guess first thing will do after have got momma out of cabin will be to get breakfast ready forget retorted boy while talked have be hastily dressing until have finished said nothing suppose be blow on head have received coupled with growing consciousness that disaster far more frightful than have thus far dreamed of have befallen that made suddenly irritable short tempered then anyhow lad manner jarred upon at moment to extent that a be about to lead way through doorway of cabin halted turned upon youngster look here lad said if what say be true that only mother sister be left aboard ship somebody will have to take charge of thing somebody will be there will be multitude of thing to be done will have to lend hand will see that do so henceforth will be who will give order understand young friend if give order will execute will know reason why hitherto seems to have be spoiled by too much indulgence if ship prof to be wreck a more than suspect be case there will be no more spoiling for will see if can not make something like man of now just turn that saying over in mind let have more of nonsense now will go see what can be done for mother come along for moment really thought that boy meant to strike kept eye steadily staring into presently saw that have mastered for moment at event gleam of mingled anger defiance faded out of eye muttered right let go a wended way from cabin to drawing room abaft mr vansittart cabin be situate have time to note several matter first of be that ship be evidently hard fast aground for although rolled slightly from time to time motion be not continuous like of floating ship intermittent with interval when did not move at lay motionless with list to starboard also when moved there be gritty grinding sound at once suggested to that be lying upon bed of coral there be also sound bumping sound accompanied by perceptible jar of hull recurring at frequent pretty regular interval set down to bumping of wreckage alongside next thing observed be that lee side of deck be about foot more deep in water showing that very considerable quantity must have come below greater part of probably through hatchway although have doubt come in through open port then went up hatchway ladder to main deck heaven what picture of wreck ruin there beheld three hollow steel mast be snapped off close to deck now with attached be over starboard side still fast to hull by standing running gear lay confused raffle of wire hemp across deck mizenmast heel upward leaned against side of poop in slanting position showing that have fallen forward a well a sideways immediately to leeward in water heaved seethed round rose fell tangle of wrecked spar sail rigging inch of bulwark from poop to topgallant forecastle on side have disappeared leaving only bent broken steel stanchion standing here there deckhouses be gone a be one of boat except motor launch even be represented only by shattered fragmentary skeleton four of six main deck gun in starboard battery be either smashed missing altogether in short whole appearance of main deck be such a to suggest that ship have be repeatedly swept from end to end by succession of tremendously heavy sea thing observed during brief passage from after hatchway to face of poop also observed that land be in sight from main deck therefore if have hit unknown atoll during night must be so small a to be entirely hidden by poop followed submissively enough by boy who now seemed tongue tied passed through cabin into drawing room gave quite sharp pain to see dreadful havoc have be wrought in splendid apartment since have left only few hour before for not only have port be left open during night for sake of coolness skylight companion have be swept away from appearance of thing ton of water must have flooded place even now when have have time to drain away to small extent lee side of room be flooded to depth of fully four foot chair ottoman table grand piano organ latter capsized in fact everything movable have settled away to leeward now lay in confused heap in water rich carpet be everywhere sodden several of electric light shade be smashed two three of picture have fallen in short destruction be practically complete there in midst of ruin stood poor little anthea most forlorn pathetic looking object hastened toward with idea of saying something comforting though what must have said be sure know happily forestalled by coming to meet with outstretched hand oh mr leigh exclaimed be just awful be so glad be here for momma be in cabin ca get out jule have be strong enough to help say that wardrobe have fallen across door can not move right said will see what can do to help moved toward door in question think have better get of men to help demanded girl guess that wardrobe be pretty heavy piece of furniture what be looking at like for what have done to head have julius told asked ignoring last question told what returned anthea then without waiting for reply continued have told thing in fact have seen since left nearly hour ago to get help of course know that be wrecked goodness know be bad enough there be nothing worse than to tell be there know for certain said fear so julius say that three mother be remain of entire ship company pray heaven that may be mistaken however will free mother then will take good look round have scarcely have chance to see anything yet walked up to closed door of mr vansittart cabin anthea julius accompanying knocked be walter leigh cried julius tell that be blockaded in room madam can not force way out may see what can do pray do if please be response have be shut up here for hour terrified half drowned want to get out have anybody there to help only julius replied daresay can manage between believe can retorted mr vansittart there be wardrobe right across door be so heavy that can not move still may try right replied stand clear if please now julius put shoulder to door close to frame throw whole weight upon will help door must not move strive a might soon realised that lad be hindrance rather than help so told to stand aside be then able to bring whole weight strength to bear presently felt door move ever so little have started after minute of strenuous heaving managed to force so far open that with little tight squeezing might push through aperture did having first asked permission once inside room managed to shift blockading wardrobe without very much difficulty so to release imprisoned lady when have hooked back door so that way be open mr vansittart turned to said thank ever so much walter now tell what dreadful thing have happened be stranded be not what be matter with head be bleeding tell worst walter whatever be believe can bear to confess truth madam said scarcely know yet what be full extent of misfortune that ship be ashore on coral reef a believe totally dismasted be certain fear that be not worst of julius tell that four be only survivor of entire ship company can hardly believe that there must be of crew left somewhere in ship although saw sign of when came here from cabin probably must not have be here now for fact that when ship struck be hurled out of bunk with such violence be stunned be julius who found revived with permission will now take thorough look round then return to with report please do so assented mr vansittart search ship thoroughly from end to end then let know exactly how matter stand be sure can not be anything like so bad a say of poor fellow may have be indeed probably be swept away by awful sea broke over ship when first struck of oh can not be so bad a that must be too terrible will go at once said beg that will prepare for bad news for from what saw on deck just now on way here be afraid report will be very distressing one therewith hurried away for saw that poor lady be quite overwhelmed must probably be relieved to find alone for time searched ship thoroughly penetrating to part of in be possible for man to hide found nobody until at length made way to stewardess quarter there huddled up in cabin shared between discovered chief assistant stewardess quite unhurt half crazy with terror so frightened indeed that be only with greatest difficulty at length succeeded in persuading that danger be over for present induced to join mistress in drawing room then proceeded to investigate condition of wreck yacht have be constructed like liner with double bottom conclusion at arrived be that actual bottom of ship be so seriously damaged that must never float again that inner skin be intact that water in interior of there be very considerable quantity have come in through hatchway port with regard to loss of crew believed must understand exactly how have come about for wherever went whether to men berthage in 'tween deck to officer cabin indication be same pointed to conviction when ship struck man below leaped out of bunk hammock dashed up on deck in something of panic where be washed overboard with watch already on deck by terrific sea that must at once have swept ship from stem to stern awful power being sufficiently evidenced by scene of destruction presented by deck having completed investigation below ascended to poop shinning up by one of port mizen shroud trailed across deck hung down over face of poop ladder being missing when got up there be able to see round ship thought began to understand little more clearly what have happened during darkness of preceding night found that ship have piled up on small atoll two mile in diameter only very small portion of le than hundred yard in length showed above water portion consisting of low bank of sand highest point of must not estimated be more than three foot above level of ocean surface lay directly astern of ship distant about mile from position wreck then occupied surmised that in darkness of preceding night must have rushed headlong upon weathermost portion of reef beaten through terrific surf everlastingly broke upon deck have be swept of everything animate inanimate in process until vessel have settled down on top of reef in comparatively smooth water then surrounded though boiled seethed round wreck have power only to cause to stir gently at interval upon coral bed when extra heavy swell swept across reef of course wreck ought not to have occurred parker boatswain who be in charge of ship when piled up unfortunately happened to overhear mr vansittart remark only day before disaster that be then in part of ocean be not only very sparsely used according to chart be supposed to be absolutely void of danger hence imagine must not only have grown careless must also have permitted look out to become so also with result on pitch dark night a preceding one have be ship must be absolutely on top of danger escape from impossible before existence be discovered well plight although bad enough in conscience might easily have be good deal worse for if ship have remained afloat few minute longer than actually did must have driven completely across reef sunk in lagoon when probably whole of who happened to be below must have gone down with disaster must have be complete a be there be dozen of who have escaped drowning although prospect for future be anything brilliant to start with diminutive sandbank astern of wreck be impossible a place of prolonged residence though might perhaps if driven to contrive to exist for few day upon shellfish doubt might be collected along margin of inner beach assisted perhaps by few sea bird egg there be fresh water so far a must discover with aid of ship telescope be there so much a blade of grass in way of shelter therefore be perfectly evident that must stick to wreck until something came along to take off until must put together something in nature of craft raft capable of being handled under sail of making voyage to nearest civilised land that a anyone who have used sea will know be pretty tall order for young fellow like with such assistance only a four woman boy must afford of course there be possibility that wreck might break up during next gale hardly thought must because must have driven to present berth while last night breeze be at height from look of thing generally doubted whether sea heavy enough to destroy must ever reach where then lay reef must break up render practically harmless before must get so far a spot occupied still realised that must not be wise to trust too much to belief determined to get to work upon sort of craft at earliest moment possible meanwhile however since under most favourable circumstance wreck must obviously be home for time to come unless indeed must be lucky enough to be seen taken off first thing to be done be to clear ship of water get cabin dry again a speedily a possible determined must make that first job having now decided upon something in nature of plan of campaign returned to drawing room descending to by way of companion stairway of be still intact with object of making report to mr vansittart submitting plan for approval when reached apartment found occupant in very act of descending to dining room in order to partake of breakfast have be prepared by two stewardess senior of whom young frenchwoman lizette charpentier who also acted a mr vansittart maid have just made appearance with information that meal be ready therefore decided to postpone what have to say until after breakfast believing that everybody must be better able to listen to bad news if be first fortified with good meal chapter ten adapting to circumstance to ward off enquiry sprang to mr vansittart lip moment appeared be little difficult managed by simply declining to say word until after breakfast when however presently sat down at table together soon perceived that task of breaking to full extent of night disaster to have be looking forward with dread be likely to be le painful than have anticipated for mr vansittart be far too experienced in nautical matter to be easily deceived moreover during absence there have be time for to think to draw own conclusion not only from what saw heard also from what failed to see hear particularly sound of men voice footstep so that a meal progressed began to understand that must require very little effort on part to bring complete realisation home to poor lady felt very sorry for not so much on account of possible hardship privation danger that only too probably awaited for be grit through knew that must face without murmur be easy to see that be grieving over terrible loss of life have attended disaster also rather imagined blamed for for when ventured to beg not to take matter too much to heart looked at through tear retorted how can help taking to heart walter if have be content to enjoy life in same way that other woman of class do must never have happened must need go gadding about world in yacht be have come of replied that yachting be not in more dangerous than many other form of amusement must easily be named that thousand indulged in year after year with impunity that what have befallen be neither more le than pure accident for certainly must in nowise hold responsible since have navigated ship with skill observance of necessary precaution went on to say that accident have arisen simply from existence of coral reef nobody have thus far suspected argument sound a felt to be seemed to influence lady very little if at must only hope that time reflection difficulty lay before must gradually divert thought from sorrow just then seemed to posse at conclusion of meal took up on poop allowed to view surroundings expounded theory of various happening have brought to present pas explained step suggested must be immediately taken to responded by saying very well walter think necessary do will help to utmost of ability can sail navigate ship a have seen there seamanship end have not knowledge skill experience intuitiveness imaginativeness to deal adequately with such matter a shipwreck when people be in such plight a ourselves be man who must take hold of situation handle trust entirely to to do what think best a said before woman will help can thanked very heartily for trust in proposed that must forthwith set to work first task being to free habitable portion of ship from water so that might become dry comfortable again with least possible delay suggested that must begin with own sleeping cabin to made objection there be one other matter added demand immediate attention must at once determine exact position of wreck having done so must prepare statement briefly setting forth plight requesting assistance statement must be copied out several time a many time a please indeed copy enclosed in sealed bottle sent adrift at say daily interval will be strange indeed if out of four five dozen bottle not one be picked up suggestion appealed to mr vansittart pronounced idea good one a time condition be alike favourable forthwith proceeded to carry out first taking set of five sight for determination of longitude while noted chronometer time then vice versa taking sextant chronometer then adjourned to chart room worked out calculation independently result agreeing within ten second of longitude difference of only few hundred foot of course be quite near enough for practical purpose did not completely satisfy either of mr vansittart being like something of stickler for absolute accuracy therefore tried again time working problem of equal altitude before day be out have arrived at identical result a to latitude longitude then while tackled task of clearing living quarter of water mr vansittart set to work to draft out statement setting forth circumstance of wreck appealing for help have still copy of document in possession run a follows yacht stella mari new york yacht club usa mr cornelia vansittart owner latitude north longitude east to whom may concern full rigged auxiliary screw yacht stella mari stranded on uncharted coral reef situate in above mentioned position during night of wednesday day of december with lamentable loss of hand excepting owner son daughter chief officer walter leigh of newton ferrers devonshire england lizette charpentier chief stewardess susie blaine second stewardess of new york usa a only land in sight be very small bare sandbank quite uninhabitable above named survivor be remaining upon wreck although totally dismasted badly bilged will afford refuge so long a weather remains fine may break up during next gale chance to occur mr vansittart offer reward of ten thousand dollar american reimbursement of expense incurred to person person who will effect rescue of herself companion in misfortune finder of document be earnestly besought to make public content a soon a found signed cornelia vansittart first copy of appeal be dispatched that very day by simple process of wrapping carefully in oiled silk inserting in empty bottle be tightly corked sealed heaving overboard to take chance a stood watching bottle progress be gratified to see that there be one knot current setting across reef hoped must carry clear into open sea though whether must ever be found by anyone capable of making intelligent use of be quite matter chance of being seen be small of recovery still le determined to increase before dispatching next message did by routing out paint setting boy julius to task of painting number of bottle over in alternate band of red white ordinary floating bottle might be seen passed without smallest effort to pick up even though condition for recovery must be favourable argued that if bottle be seen bearing distinguishing mark be obviously put upon with object of attracting attention person sighting might reasonably conclude that must be worth while to salve ascertain content if sight of first call for help drifting placidly seaward across lagoon be agreeable sight there be appeared later on be by mean so agreeable dorsal fin of several shark cruising lazily here there about lagoon thought must make pretty shrewd guess at meaning of presence there therefore devised number of pretext for keeping everybody off poop so that there might be a little chance a possible of anyone beholding gruesome sight there be so many matter demanding immediate attention that be difficult to determine of must first be taken in hand a weather be fine barometer stood high exhibiting tendency to rise still higher thus promising continuance of fine weather be agreed that for health sake living quarter must be cleared of water thoroughly aired made wholesome first of be accordingly done task keeping busily employed for best part of three day then provision have to be made against further flooding of mr vansittart cabin drawing room by rain for a have already be mentioned skylight companion have be swept away corresponding aperture in deck be quite open unprotected very fortunately large quantity of timber scantling planking of various kind dimension have be shipped by far seeing owner for purpose of effecting repair at sea if required a soon a cabin have be cleared of water therefore of timber be brought on deck with aid of carpenter tool julius proceeded to plank over opening make weather proof by covering planking with tarpaulin tightly nailed over when first invited boy to help refused point blank upon two distinct plea first of be that saw reason why must work at seeing be there to do what needed to be done while in second place if chose to work at must do only such work a pleased in case be not going to be ordered about by darned britisher so just let severely alone for first day loafed about smoking cigarette pretending to fish in troubled water over side when however on second day seeing needed help mother sister came to assistance sight of working while idled be too much for even spoiled selfish temper with many grumbling muttering below breath ordered mother away took place so intractable be so unwilling to receive slightest suggestion hint from darned britisher so determined to do thing own way not at eventually have to tell plainly must consent to do a be told drop work altogether finally gave in mainly in consequence of sister outspoken comment upon behaviour be with very bad grace having made living quarter of ship once more habitable safe against bad weather next task undertaken be salving of sail a many of spar a much of rigging a possible be lengthy heavy job in performance of became necessary for to be frequently over side in water cutting sail from yard stay clearing unreeving rigging so on must have be exceedingly dangerous have shark have seen during first few day remained in lagoon seemed to have gone again for saw nothing of although absence enabled to work with utmost freedom must not make very rapid headway single handed in water while hoisting inboard of heavier spar sail assisted though be with such appliance a derrick tackle snatch block winch taxed energy to very utmost be done at last however most thankful be when last spar be possible for to secure came up over side for not only have saved considerable quantity of material might possibly prove of utmost value to have also rid ourselves of menace of having ship holed by wreckage bumping alongside big task be completed exactly six week from day upon wreck have occurred of working strenuously from dawn to dark day after day excepting sunday mr vansittart insisted must be observed a day of rest during conducted service morning evening in drawing room christmas day occurred three week after wreck be also observed a holiday despite forlorn rather precarious situation contrived to make fairly jolly day of only discordant element being boy julius who early became sulky for unaccountable reason spent entire day upon topgallant forecastle with rifle shooting at sea bird wasting two hundred round of ball cartridge felt strongly inclined several time to take rifle forcibly from mere hint of such thing seemed to distress mother so keenly that did not refer to second time yet must confess that bitterly begrudged utterly useless expenditure of so many good in case valuable cartridge now must not be supposed that in anxiety to recover a much wreckage a possible forgot to keep diligent look out for passing ship for did not did neglect to dispatch copy of appeal for help securely sealed up in bottle regularly day thus far horizon have remained blank while daylight lasted therefore if perchance ship have passed must have done so during night up to have be working so hard that have deemed hardly worth while to sacrifice hour of rest for very doubtful advantage of maintaining night watch with conclusion of what considered heaviest task so far a actual labour be concerned decided that might be of advantage to keep look out at night time at least during moonlit night must then be able to see passing ship at distance a must enable to attract attention by mean of flare accordingly be arranged that four of namely julius two stewardess must take one watch in succession in latitude be only few degree north of line day night be approximately of equal length for practical purpose night might be reckoned a beginning at six pm ending at six be therefore if of kept watch of three hour must cover twelve hour between by arrangement same person must keep one particular watch night of course least arduous of watch must be that from six o'clock to nine o'clock pm therefore decided to split watch into two dog watch of one half hour by arrangement regularity must be broken of must get benefit of first dog watch in succession seemed to be not only fair desirable thing to keep night watch however without possessing mean to attract notice of passing ship must be useless therefore constructed sort of framework consisting of four twelve foot plank set up on edge in form of square enclosure on after extremity of poop securing firmly to deck planking by mean of batten plank be nine inch wide consequently when work be complete have kind of open box twelve foot square nine inch deep in to light flare something be needed to protect deck from action of fire next act therefore be to nail together sort of light raft consisting of six fifteen foot plank laid side by side secured to other by cross batten forward end being bevelled to reduce resistance to raft passage through water then fixed up arrangement on side of raft whereby with aid of rowlock must work pair of scull so propel raft through water job took two day to complete when be done have raft must sustain not only own weight something to spare placed upon couple of wash deck tub put shovel in one of paddled ashore to small sandbank about mile away a rowed away from wreck standing up to work facing forward fisherman fashion took rather wide sweep whereby be enabled to obtain good view of pitiful sight presented bereft of three mast with jib boom snapped short off odds end of rigging trailing overboard great gap in starboard bulwark fair whiteness of hull disfigured here there with rust streak sat with list to starboard be trifle down by head from latter circumstance concluded that forefoot bottom forward be most seriously damaged part of a indeed be only reasonable to suppose seeing that must have hit reef stem on oh be distressing to look at still beautiful though dishevelled hull reflect that have be brought to present lamentable condition by pure negligence raft travelled more easily through water than have dared to hope in about quarter of hour reached sandbank sprang ashore taking precaution to secure raft by painter made fast to one of oar loom of drove well into sand then walked to highest point of bank looked about with exception of few bunch of dry rotting seaweed bank be a bare a back of hand colony of gull have settled upon by cry indicated resentment felt at intrusion looked round to see if must discover egg for fresh gull egg be not at bad eating must perhaps afford welcome change of diet to woman folk found none so concluded that be not just then season for bank measured by pacing little over eighty yard long by forty broad diligently examined seaward side of to see whether perchance there might be spring of fresh water gushing out of hardly expected that there must be be therefore not greatly disappointed at failing to find such thing found margin liberally strewed with small shellfish a well a with numerous empty shell of be so exquisite in form in colouring must not resist temptation to waste few minute in securing specimen of most beautiful for delectation of mr vansittart daughter done returned to raft hauled broadside on to beach proceeded to fill two wash deck tub with sand with designed to fill square box like arrangement on poop a protection for deck from flame of projected flare needle to say two tub of sand did not go very far toward filling box be not until following evening have everything ready then with goodly pile of combustible consisting of dry seaweed chip kindling wood coal heaped up in middle of sandbox have everything ready for lighting flare at moment notice most pressing necessity having be attended to found time to attend to matter seemed to come next in importance hitherto have be favoured with finest of fine weather nothing bluest of sky often without smallest shred of cloud rain only most gentle of zephyr knew that condition of thing must not last for ever change must inevitably come sooner later if change must chance to take form of gale from southward have scarcely shadow of doubt that unless must happen to be of very briefest character wreck must go to piece under foot therefore seemed to that task now clamoured most loudly for immediate attention be construction of craft of sort must enable to escape in last resort now there be very few task in connection with craft mercantile jack can not perform in more le efficient manner can unrig ship rig afresh if of spar must be sprung can fix up in such fashion that will serve purpose very well until new spar can be procured can knot splice rigging can patch rope sail there be thousand other thing that can do very deftly there be one thing can not do unless have served apprenticeship at least part of apprenticeship to be build boat can repair damaged boat grant put in new plank replace damaged timber to build boat a understand term be altogether beyond best that can do be to construct sort of makeshift problem now confronted be what form be makeshift to take first be requirement if came to being obliged to abandon wreck through stress of weather because of conviction that appeal for help have gone astray that must give up hope of rescue effect own deliverance must mean boat voyage in turn must mean that craft must be good sea boat capable of facing weather weatherly reasonably good sailer big enough to accommodate six people four of whom be woman whose comfort welfare must receive special consideration together with stock of provision water sufficient to last for say five week at least have already discussed matter with mr vansittart have expressed determination to try for manila in such case being american possession secondly have material have skill strength to build boat with such assistance a companion must afford be question now demanded answer in consultation with mr vansittart now diligently proceeded to seek reply chapter eleven suspicious sail heave in sight a have already hinted be boat builder knew good boat when saw have very fair notion of correct proportion of such craft when came to point of draughting vessel line very soon discovered upon making attempt be at sea must mr vansittart help a matter of fact quickly came to conclusion that knew just enough of subject to be painfully conscious of own ignorance of course might have laid keel attached to stem stern post then with help of few mould roughed out something resembling boat when in imagination have got thus far found face to face with mystery of properly shaping plank when be done of bending to correct curve then realised that job be too much for be clear that boat of usual form be out of question so something very much simpler must be thought out something must be straight line if there be curve must be of such character a to be producible without such special apparatus a for instance steaming trunk then mr vansittart began to overhaul memory in search of most simple form of floating craft that have ever seen be not long before decided that thames punt filled bill craft so familiar to frequenter of reach of thames example of may be seen in boulter lock sunday in summer be a everybody know thing of straight line flat bottomed flat sided in fact open box with two end sloping instead of perpendicular quickly decided that anyone with enough of carpenter skill to knock box together ought to be able to build punt later on discovered that be not quite right in assumption be sufficiently encouraging to form basis upon to make start now sea voyage in open boat be something to be attempted only a last resource trip of few hour duration in suitable weather be very well be indeed very enjoyable experience in gale when one be exposed hour after hour to fury of element be in momentary danger of being capsized have to bale for dear life well who have be through know what that mean have be through therefore knew that for delicately nurtured woman be not to be thought of for moment boat must be decked be certainty decision led naturally to question of one of principal dimension namely depth of proposed craft must be deep enough under deck at least to allow occupant to lie down sleep in comfort after careful consideration fixed depth at five foot in clear with a ruling dimension be not difficult to decide that suitable beam breadth must be ten foot after much consideration fixed length at thirty foot on water line decided must afford sufficient room for immediate indispensable belonging sufficient supply of food water to carry to journey end taking pencil paper proceeded to draught out boat that might see how looked estimate quantity of material needed for construction first sketch showed contour of thames punt pure simple when pictured in heavy seaway endeavoured to imagine what behaviour must be under such circumstance quickly came to conclusion certain modification be imperative proceeded to make forthwith final result being craft of dimension already determined upon flat bottomed in cross section curved fore aft with enough sheer to lift fore end of well above water being flat bottomed must naturally be of light draught must consequently make good deal of leeway when close hauled unless special provision must be made to meet case therefore decided to extend two flat side nine inch below bottom so a to form two keel thus provided believed must prove to be fairly weatherly be to be decked over with only small cockpit aft light be to be furnished to interior by four of glass port window to be removed from wreck be to be sloop rigged completed finally approved design cost afternoon to produce when be done be very well satisfied with believed that craft ought to behave fairly well even in heavy weather while design be so simple a to demand special skill in carrying out such loose timber a have supplemented by certain quantity of deck planking must be sufficient for purpose next thing to be done be to proceed with actual work did forthwith be not going to inflict upon patient reader wearisome detail of work step by step believe may safely be left to imagination moreover have other more interesting thing to tell will therefore dismiss part of story by mentioning that although work of building craft proved to be considerably le easy than have anticipated chiefly because of lack of knowledge of detail of carpentry made very fair progress after first two three day especially after have acquired knack of handling plane properly have to do stroke of actual work woman merely helped by holding various part in place while bored hole drove nail julius positively refused to lend slightest assistance because forsooth have not be consulted during preparation of plan must sit smoking cigarette fishing watch unmoved mother sister to say nothing of two stewardess straining to help to lift heavy weight bend stout bottom plank to required curve also chiefly think because knew that objected must persist in shooting at gull with rifle until at length in fit of exasperation risked mother displeasure put end to wastage by locking up ammunition taking possession of key have already mentioned arrangement have made in matter of night watch of course only applied to night when moon afforded light enough to permit passing ship to be seen instruction be that in event of sail being sighted be to be called at once when must decide a to advisability otherwise of making flare to attract attention of crew be quite prepared to receive master julius refusal to participate in night watch strangely enough did not thereby hang tale watch have be established month more sail have be seen then on certain morning when julius called at three o'clock watch followed went on deck to amazement discovered flare have prepared to serve a signal blazing brilliantly having evidently be lighted for quite quarter of hour full moon be hanging high in cloudless sky star be shining with usual tropical brilliance so bright be light of flame must see nothing outside rail of wreck therefore descended to boy cabin entering without ceremony demanded to be informed of reason for lighting fire because saw ship replied saw ship repeated then why did not at once come down call surely can not have forgotten that made clearly understood be to be called if ship must heave in sight that nobody be to light fire without first consulting to there be reply lad merely lying in bed scowling sulkily at repeated question in slightly different form naw answered at length did forget guess be about time that understood ai going to take order from remonstrated mother have given full power to act a think best under circumstance presume young a be have sense enough to understand in community however small there must be leader whom rest must obey under circumstance be more imperative than in such case a ours surely consider that must be head leader do bet do be amazing reply anyhow continued be not going to obey mister britisher so may clear out leave to have sleep see here since like way keep watch wo do more now git got with precipitation lest must lose grip upon give youth trouncing that so richly deserved desired above thing to avoid for knew that nothing must distress mother so much a that darling must be chastised though ever so lightly returning to deck found fire still blazing high for not content with merely kindling flare master julius have taken trouble to fling whole of reserve stock of fuel upon there be merest breathing of wind out from eastward fanned smoke right along deck made eye smart to extent be compelled to get down off poop shelter under break of even here out of direct range of glare found impossible to see anything outboard mere reflection of flame being bright enough to dazzle awaited coming of daylight appearance of alleged ship with utmost eagerness not altogether unmingled with anxiety on beach of one of island have visited shortly before wreck of yacht have observed rib of what have once be fine ship scotsman who have taken up abode on island a trader in copra shell have told grisly story concerning that ship have haunted memory from moment when have awakened to find stella mari piled up on coral reef that story be to effect that ship have one morning be sighted ashore on beach apparently undamaged with sign of crew aboard when scotsman at length succeeded in boarding have found twenty three corps lying about deck in state of putrefaction rendered craft veritable pest house precluded possibility of close examination deck bulwark be so abundantly smeared bespattered with dry blood a to point unmistakably to fact of general slaughter of crew while open hatch state of cargo showed that ship have be pretty effectually plundered informant added that while such case be rare there be reason for believing that adjacent sea be haunted by certain individual who made business to hunt for wreck for sake of what must be salved from be not above perpetrating little piracy when condition be favourable be memory of story have caused to give such explicit instruction be to be informed of presence of stranger in neighbourhood before making plight known by ignition of flare unruly youngster have wilfully disobeyed with result that for knew to contrary attention of band of ruthless outlaw bloodthirsty pirate have possibly be invited must only hope that might not be case that stranger if stranger there really be must prove to be honest be by mean easy in mind about when one imagination becomes obsessed by unpleasant idea there be natural tendency for anxiety to grow while one be held in suspense at event be so with on particular occasion for seemed to that daylight must never come meanwhile however flare after blazing fiercely for full half hour gradually died down finally burned out made attempt to replenish for knew whatever result might be work be effectually done remained be to await result a patiently a might be a soon a flame have died down sufficiently to allow of seeing anything got ship night glass diligently searched entire horizon with presently picked up something gradually resolved into craft from stunted rig set down in own mind a junk with solitary exception perhaps of malay proa chinese junk be very last kind of craft under circumstance desired to see while of course be by mean case chinese junk carry pirate crew chinese generally especially chinese seaman be regarded by european with certain measure of dubiety a possessing code of moral peculiarly own of such character for one must hesitate long before placing still more companion in hand at mercy still there be nothing for now to wait see how matter must turn out when first saw doubtful craft be in south western board seven mile distant heading to southward apparently close hauled moving very slowly a have said wind be mere breathing although moon be now well down in western sky stranger sail be in shadow there be certain indefinable something in appearance told that be wrinkling collapsing with heave of swell kept telescope bearing steadily upon for be drawing down toward part of sea be shimmering in liquid silver under moon ray knew that when reached that radiant path must get clean sharply cut silhouette of be able to determine exact character with certainty a luck must have however tacked before reaching moon track be still left in state of doubt although doubt be fast giving way to apprehension in case unless breeze must freshen might with coming of dawn several hour must elapse before stranger must arrive at reef if be making for a seemed certain at length after what appeared to interminable period of suspense blackness of eastern sky melted into pallor spread along horizon even a watched revealing long low hummock of swell slowly heaving in ebony lower star dimmed vanished a pallor strengthened warmed into delicate primrose tint spreading to right left upward a did so then star after star went out before advance of light turned indigo of zenith into purest ultramarine primrose hue in east flushed into orange great shaft of white light shot suddenly upward from midst spark of molten flaming gold sprang into view darting long line of liquid fire across gently heaving bosom of sea spark grew into throbbing palpitating dazzling blaze in instant be day star have disappeared sky glowed in purest sapphire placid ocean laughed under beam of triumphant sun air few minute before have carried sudden touch of chill in came warm to skin breeze freshened trifle at length be able to secure clear convincing view of stranger be indeed junk a have surmised be now undoubtedly beating up toward reef for headstrong boy wilful disobedience of instruction might have held on upon original course by time be hull down with wreck out of sight from deck there be now possibility of evading visit from crew thank goodness there must be ample time to prepare for visit reckoned that unless breeze continued to freshen must not possibly reach in le than six seven hour question with be what sort of reception be to give when at length must arrive there be of course possibility that crew might be just plain honest trader in case might regard a rescued from imprisonment on reef having regard to precariousness of situation on wreck must perhaps go to piece in next gale might spring up at moment be important especially for woman folk that chance of rescue must be let slip junk might be heading for in response to one of many urgent call for succour have sent out sealed up in empty bottle spirit rose little at thought only to sink again at reflection succeeded be in highest degree improbable if perchance one of message must fall into hand of chinese seaman that must be able to comprehend act upon be rather perplexing problem for young fellow like to be confronted with decision at ultimately arrived be that while recognising possibility of junk crew being friend must be wise to be prepared to meet a enemy having come to decision went below called stewardess who since wreck have assumed charge of domestic arrangement susie second stewardess proving to be past mistress of culinary art allowed others to sleep on for there be reason why must prematurely awaken mr vansittart only perhaps to worry needlessly by pouring into ear tale of doubt fear at eight o'clock daughter came on deck caught watching slowly moving junk with telescope glued to eye looked exclamation of delight burst from lip to be instantly followed by demand from mr vansittart why have not at once called to impart good news of course have to explain at length to uncertain state of mind under be labouring a already indicated fired flare mr leigh exclaimed anthea pointing to frame on poop from thin haze of smoke still arose why did do that if felt uncertain a to character of junk said brother did that on own responsibility if anybody must bear blame be sorry that did because if junk be indeed coming in response to call for help may be sure that there be somebody aboard who be navigator enough to find way to reef without need of special signal from whereas if be a be somewhat disposed to fear there may be fight before suppose be what mean interposed mr vansittart oh well continued have plenty of weapon ammunition be not afraid of few chinaman be sure dear boy did what considered proper thing oh momma cut in anthea for goodness gracious sake talk such foolishness be stupid wrong thing to do after mr leigh have given explicit order that be be then take just mind own business exclaimed well known quarrelsome voice behind next instant master julius who have crept up noiselessly behind in rubber soled deck shoe smote sister resounding box on ear a rule be most placid tempered person somehow that blow instantly aroused in fury made see red for moment wheeling sharply seized boy by scruff of neck shook until teeth fairly rattled in head young ruffian exclaimed how dare strike sister deserve downright good thrashing for deed mark boy if ever so much a attempt to do thing again get to hear of will rope end until can stand sit lie down ought to be ashamed of flung from with such violence that went staggering along deck for three four yard before recovered of course there be at once pretty to do be cry more think at mortification of being struck than for other reason while mr vansittart instantly went into violent hysteric shrieking that darling boy be being murdered young gentleman meanwhile slunk away down companion stair eyeing a went a though by mean certain must not yet fall upon inflict punishment that must have known richly deserved then up rushed two stewardess in response to mr vansittart shriek between anthea be piloted below be to be presumed ministered to restored for shriek outcry presently died away about hour afterward lizette head stewardess summoned to breakfast at same time explaining that mr vansittart be taking meal in own room with julius be dr r readfully angree with monsieur leigh girl informed care be time that somebody must take boy in hand be everey day growing more execr r rable chapter twelve conversion of julius when went down to breakfast anthea lizette be already in dining room former have quite recovered composure although eyelid be still trifle red swollen while small beautifully shaped ear be crimson from force of blow have received have already mentioned that young lady attitude toward have completely changed from moment when saved brother life frosty almost insolent aloofness have entirely disappeared giving place to frank cordial friendliness of disposition rivalling that of mother admit be mightily agreeable to in short believed to be intensely grateful for what have done on occasion perfectly willing must know so now be not at surprised when upon entrance came forward laying hand upon arm said oh mr leigh can not tell how dreadfully sorry be for what have happened momma be frightfully angry with for what be pleased to term violent cowardly behaviour to julius be word please remember not mine think indeed be almost certain that upon reflection will recognise that man must stand by permit to pas unreproved such outrage a wretched boy inflicted upon fact be can see for now have combined together to spoil julius with result that have become thoroughly selfish conceited unfeeling unmanageable boy be high time that somebody must intervene that somebody must not be mr leigh have right to interfere know be sure that momma must never tolerate anything of kind from at same time feel impelled to say here eye sparkled amused smile lighted up face that believe interference have done julius good frightened think will feel that henceforth will have to behave little more circumspectly while be around want please to promise that will not interfere with again will take up matter will talk very seriously to momma see if can not open eye to very serious wrong injury that be doing to boy by petting pampering humouring whim however outrageous may be so will give promise to be very patient with wo know that have be atrociously rude provocative to please say more interrupted think may safely promise that rudeness provocation on part levelled at personally will be allowed to move in slightest degree if ever young monkey again dare to lift hand against in presence will will yes yes know need say interrupted in turn once more eye sparkled with merriment will be something too awful for word well will tell julius what say perhaps information may have good effect upon now let to breakfast for see lizette be in perfect terror lest coffee must be allowed to go cold sat down to breakfast opposite other chatted more merrily intimately together than have ever done before when meal be over put merriment aside for there be approaching junk to be thought of provided for when rose from table requested anthea to procure from mother key of magazine bring to a proposed to make possible provision for defence of wreck must such unhappily prove to be necessary while went to mother for required key made way up on to poop took look at junk there be close hauled on port tack evidently working up for reef be slow tub breeze be still so light that sail barely remained asleep a heaved rolled ponderously upon long low pacific swell plainly saw must have ample time for such preparation a must be possible to make for reception flung look round horizon searched sky for weather sign sky be clear a bell of deep rich ultramarine tint in zenith shading off by imperceptible gradation to soft warm colourlessness at horizon there be not slightest hint of haze cloud in whole of visible vault breeze be mere warm breathing with nothing to indicate that might possibly freshen must that must fall calm before junk must enter lagoon in case must be able to judge of friendliness otherwise by number of boat must dispatch to went to flag locker drew forth club ensign ran up reversed to head of ensign staff for wonder have escaped general destruction in hope that must evoke sort of response from crew of junk to serve in measure a guide to have just belayed halyard when anthea came to with key glanced from to flag back again questioningly explained see said very well here be key do hope will not be necessary to fight remember malacca strait affair when have entire

be hurt killed shivered violently what then will tell said seizing hand in mine crushing fear in passion of horror persistence conjured up will give mother stewardess revolver if by evil chance that junk must prove to be enemy must get upper hand of must shoot yourselves rather than fall alive into hand of chinaman of course need not take such desperate step until very last moment when have become evident that escape be impossible when moment arrives do think will have courage to do a say yes whispered hoarsely will will oh walter hope pray that may none of be driven to frightful alternative now must leave for want to have good heart to heart talk with momma will see again before before yes yes said hurriedly for saw that poor girl be becoming trifle overwrought have uncomfortable feeling that emotion carried something of contagious character with be necessary to get away from emotionalism down to commonplace of life once more so nodded smilingly at anthea ran briskly below jingling key in hand a went have said that must pin faith principally to maxim if came to fight so fully meant to do at same time by mean overlooked fact that four inch shell two might prove very convincing argument under certain condition therefore began preparation by conveying eight shell corresponding number of cartridge up on deck loading into eight main deck gun still remained to after carefully sponging out latter next gave attention to maxim preparing for action with meticulous care overhauling cleaning oiling mechanism of satisfying that be in perfect working order placing belt of cartridge in position in taking care to have abundant supply of relay in hand while doing thing kept one eye pretty constantly upon junk in hope that must respond to display of ensign by hoisting sort of signal might interpret a of friend coming to rescue in answer to appeal for help showed bunting beyond small whiff at mainmast head meant nothing having prepared artillery next turned attention to subject of magazine rifle dozen of brought up on deck loaded laid handy on poop near maxim with box of cartridge although doubted whether after other weapon have played part there must be much opportunity to use finally produced loaded six revolver two of thrust into belt of cutlas girded round waist while other four designed for use of woman in last dreadful resort boy did not greatly trouble about feeling pretty certain that must look after have finished preparation be sitting on poop rail intently scanning slowly approaching junk through ship telescope taking due note of such detail particular a be thus brought within ken when slight rustle of feminine garment at side caused to lower glass mr vansittart be standing at elbow be still very pale eyelid be swollen red with recent weeping smiled wanly a offered hand walter said there be tremor in voice a spoke while blood surged up into cheek for moment want to apologise be afraid certainly not dear lady cried seizing hand must not dream of such thing on contrary be for to apologise to for sudden violent ebullition of temper do most heartily can not imagine what be that possessed just then smile broadened brightened little a raised left hand to silence must let speak walter let say what want to say resumed anthea have be talking to said thing have opened eye to what fear must call own folly have made see have be altogether wrong in attitude toward julius have shown that in blindness intensity of affection for be only son know walter have indulged allowed to have own way in everything to extent unless be very careful will be utterly spoiled ruined rendered totally unfit to go out into world take worthy place there when time come for to do so there have be occasion before to day when have be troubled by suspicion that something be going wrong with dear boy be not doing duty toward a wise mother must be not until within last half hour that eye have be completely opened now intend to adopt entirely different attitude toward trouble be that know how to set about how be brought up walter must not avoid smiling at naivete of question yet must also sympathise with questioner well said naturally loved parent a naturally loved never allowed affection to blind to little childish fault failing like other child suppose soon developed diligently devoted to task of checking so in addition to loving parent be soon taught to honour obey then when be five year old be sent to school where mixing with other boy especial conceit of might have have be quickly nipped in bud at school in addition to fair useful education be taught to reverence respect senior superior to be obedient to submit to discipline to be honest truthful to despise selfishness viciousness to fear god honour king that in brief be way of bringing up mr vansittart although many of thing learned have to be hammered into with cane wielded by willing vigorous arm can truthfully assert be not whit worse rather better for to day companion regarded smilingly for moment then said so that be story of how came to be what be well walter be compelled to admit that parent be wiser than mr vansittart have be be going to alter method now can only pray that may not be too late must talk further upon matter later on think that perhaps may be able to help now what about junk be looking at through glass when came up have be able to discover anything must afford clue to character not very much replied be bound to confess that what have seen be not altogether reassuring for instance have not responded to display of ensign believe that must have done so in one form if be coming to rescue in answer to appeal for assistance then although can not see deck very well because of high bulwark appears to be carrying good many men too many think for honest craft of size notice also that have gun eighteen pound smooth bore judge from appearance mounted on forecastle while if will look at through glass will see three port in port bulwark through protrude muzzle of other cannon look like twelve pounder have not slightest doubt that there be three more of same kind grinning through starboard bulwark yes replied mr vansittart peering through telescope have handed to see gun mention can catch through porthole glimpse of number of men moving about deck a say there appears to be good many of do really regard that a sinister sign must not vessel trading in water carry good strong crew gun for self defence doubt must agreed can only hope that yonder junk be such craft will know for certain in about two hour from now in case be quite ready for mr vansittart looked round at preparation smiled yes assented preparation certainly appear to be reasonably complete have done what must walter have well be going below for sun be terribly hot must not get headache just now if can possibly avoid of course will come help if there be fighting to be done indeed exclaimed beg that none of will dream of doing anything of kind must only be source of anxiety embarrassment to must rather not have even julius for must not trust be not amenable to discipline be quite on card at critical moment might take into head to do wrong thing with disastrous consequence to very well will see be smiling reply a lady skipper disappeared down companion way again took up telescope to resume study of junk continued to do for next half hour more then master julius made appearance on deck came straight up to a looked at expecting fresh unpleasantness detected new expression in eye on feature look of sullenness discontent have disappeared actually smiled a looking square in eye held out hand exclaimed say mr leigh let be friend will sure old chap replied adopting americanism with have become quite familiar a grasped outstretched hand very best of friend if like why must be be perfectly willing if be then be deal answered seating at side on poop rail say continued do think be going to have to fight that junk be impossible to say a yet replied hope not if must be necessary do want to take hand bet life do exclaimed boy be what have come up to talk about momma say that wo let help because be not amenable to discipline be afraid that wo do a be told if promise on word of honour a gentleman will do exactly a tell will let come in certainly will be delighted to have help replied then be deal repeated lad again offering hand must confess be puzzled astounded at sudden amazing change have come over boy secret soon came out appeared that mother sister have be talking to a seemed have never before be talked to in life have told number of home truth in language that seemed there be possibility of misunderstanding have done so convincingly that dormant spirit of good be in have be effectually awakened withering scorn with sister have commented upon behaviour in general offensive contemptible trait of character that have flaunted so flagrantly in face have scorched shrivelled boyish soul picture of a others saw be so repulsive that have be overwhelmed with shame better still repentance if be to be believed have caused to determine upon altogether new line of action for future scorn contempt contumely dislike be disagreeable thing to swallow now that mother sister have drawn aside veil allowed to get glimpse of real opinion of be rather more than must bear pride self respect have be grievously hurt did not like to be despised detested so be going now to make everybody respect admire have very great faith in conversion must confess seemed altogether too sudden to be genuine be not going to say do anything might neutralise good might have be done listened with interest to that boy have to say replied encouragingly sympathetically so time passed until lizette appeared to summon to luncheon when junk be still two mile in offing working in very slowly there be sign of intention to hoist out boat attempt to communicate with in way so knew must have sufficient time to snatch mouthful of food before moment for action must arrive descended to dining room with easy mind chapter thirteen be attacked by chinese pirate wrecker have finished luncheon be on deck watching junk when about past two o'clock having by time arrived within about mile of lagoon entrance saw heave to minute two later became evident that be preparing to launch boat boat be now close enough in for to see with aid of telescope pretty nearly everything be happening aboard be far from reassured when noticed that man upon poop probably junk captain who be directing operation wore formidable looking broad bladed chinese yatagan girded to side while when faced in direction once twice pointing felt almost certain must detect one if not brace of pistol in belt presently saw boat of very respectable dimension rise above junk bulwark slowly disappear over lee rail be followed by second third of at least equal size three boat exclaimed that settle if be here upon friendly mission must not send in three boat to take off dozen people be wrecker only too probably pirate a well people know that there be survivor on wreck flare during night ensign to day will have told that much know how many of there be so skipper be sending in enough men to make quite sure of a belief gun too by george continued a saw old fashioned smooth bore cannon in sling top rail rascal mean business be quite evident so do be going below to bring up dozen more shell be just possible that may need meanwhile madam will kindly keep eye on junk while be gone report to what have seen when return thrusting glass into mr vansittart hand hurried away to magazine brought out six additional shell with necessary cartridge conveying up on deck placed conveniently near gun of port battery now saw be only main deck piece be at likely to be of use to having at length completed task rejoined little group upon poop saw that boat have already pushed off from junk be pulling at good pace toward opening in reef while junk have filled away again be beating up in same direction there be three boat walter a see said mr vansittart handing over telescope to if look at carefully through glass will also see that be crowded with men at least twenty in boat must say dare say will also notice a did glint of sun upon many weapon unless be very greatly mistaken boat have gun mounted in bow be afraid there can be possible doubt a to intention of men agreed a raised telescope to eye doubt whatever mean to wipe out if can then plunder wreck will not do while be alive able to resist now continued two lady have revolver so have stewardess be fully loaded have already explained to miss anthea why have given to most fervently hope that there will be need for to use in way must there be one never know may be bowled over killed rendered helpless by shot pike thrust implore not to hesitate too long must be infinitely better that must die instantly painlessly by well directed pistol shot than that must fall alive into hand of crew of chinese pirate colour ebbed away from cheek of mr vansittart daughter a uttered concluding word saw look of firmness determination tightening about lip while elder lady said have fear for walter hope with that may not be driven to such desperate step must be have courage enough to take so think have two maid thank replied be relief to to hear speak so bravely act pray until very last moment until have become clear beyond question that everything be lost now since boat be within easy range will just give hint that want to have nothing to do with that have better keep distance swung down off poop on to main deck running to forward gun of port battery be gun must best be brought to bear on advancing boat at moment levelled piece aiming to strike water at point few fathom ahead of middle boat of three be advancing in line abreast calculated that shot must rebound fly over head of crew close enough to frighten bit make think twice before advancing farther be rather difficult risky shot risky for in boat mean pulled off successfully shell dashed up great column of snow white spray completely hid boat for moment when cleared away saw that boat crew be holding water evidently taken good deal by surprise apparently undecided what to do bravo walter beautiful shot exclaimed mr vansittart saw snatch up telescope peer through held to eye for full minute then without lowering instrument cried there be man standing up in stern sheet of middle boat apparently haranguing crew for be flourishing arm about great deal ah have stepped down again now yes oarsman be giving way again two outside boat look a though be turning back be only opening out into wider order be coming on again try with shot walter perhaps if can hit one of boat others may be induced to go back ay ay replied with flourish of arm carefully sponged out reloaded piece did not now want boat to return wanted to come on be destroyed be by time convinced that matter must be fought out to bitter end that must destroy that junk whole of crew if must not be destroyed if boat be driven back vessel must hang about watching opportunity possibly return night during dark take unawares be life ours hung in balance therefore when have reloaded piece ran eye along sight be in act of training upon middle boat when attention be distracted for moment by distant boom of gun looking up saw that junk have fired knew by ring of report that gun be shotted presently saw shot come skipping toward just inside reef fell good way short turned to own gun again now when wanted actually to hit mark found that be not quite so easy a have imagined to aim straight be easy enough even where be boat presented small mark be constantly disappearing in trough of swell be therefore necessary for to wait until particular target reappeared before firing although next two shot went very near indeed did not actually hit meanwhile junk be firing rapidly making short tack to keep a nearly abreast of a might be shot be gradually dropping nearer to seeing insisted that lady at least must go below a now shot might at moment come aboard julius begged hard to be allowed to remain mother raising objection willingly consented a there be knowing when might be glad of assistance three boat be now so close to passage through reef that be obliged to alter formation to line ahead in order to pas through be at moment that with fourth shot caught leading boat fair square literally blew to piece thought that perhaps might check advance of remaining two boat not bit of did not even pause to pick up of survivor of leading boat crew probably there be survivor came on with blood curdling yell evoked faint shriek from thought somewhere in neighbourhood of companion almost immediately afterward round shot from junk struck water at little distance away then went humming directly over head so close that felt wind of at juncture became aware of fact that wind what little there be of be falling lighter ensign be drooping from staff dead while junk sail be flapping with roll little curl of water about bow have disappeared afforded grain of comfort for must not draw very much nearer though to be sure be near enough already if gunner eye be straight enough to hit great hope be that heavy rolling must distract aim so cause shot to fall short of to fly over have time to meditate at length upon chance two boat be drawing dangerously near must stop by hook by crook before actually got alongside therefore quickly recharged piece carefully pointed at inner end of passage through reef have barely got done to satisfaction when leading boat thrust nose through bang four inch barked out greeting moment later that boat disappeared in flame smoke to intense relief mentally patted on back now surely thought that remaining boat will turn tail will have chance to wipe out on way back to junk on came crew yelling like demon churning placid water of lagoon into foam with oar sprang to foot at stroke that might throw whole weight of body into while man standing in stern sheet frantically waved most murderous looking blade above head jumped to next gun there be time to reload now hastily levelled a did so saw flash burst from bow followed by gust of smoke ball struck waterway close by foot hurtled past sending shower of splinter flying distracted aim missed shot harmlessly struck water distance astern of boat to be greeted by occupant with yell of mingled triumph derision matter be becoming frightfully critical now must have time for shot wondered a thought flashed through brain rifle shot rang out from poop glancing way saw boy julius with remington repeater at shoulder aiming at rapidly advancing boat what have absolutely forgotten saw also maxim standing there ready for action to dash up on to poop level port maxim at enemy be work of moment next instant deadly little weapon be thudding away pouring leaden stream fair into boat at range bare three hundred yard be impossible to miss in few second occupant of boat be dead wounded oar trailed motionless in water boat lost way in le than minute became evident that craft be sinking literally riddled with leaden hail hurrah yelled there go last of thank god that danger over now for junk must be settled there will be safety for made way down to main deck again very nearly tumbling head over heel over mr vansittart daughter whom found seated upon stair of companion way paused just long enough to explain situation to then rushed out on deck in time to see last boat submerged to gunwale slowly roll over go down bow first leaving few form feebly struggling on surface junk be by time completely becalmed have lost way nevertheless maintained fairly steady fire upon of shot came so unpleasantly close that thought well to order julius down off poop where must be of further use got to work with main deck gun again possibly because must take time pleased over aiming did very neat shooting fired six shell in at junk one of first went home three of close to water line be destructive missile shell bursting a hit blowing great hole in junk side soon became apparent that vessel be sinking rapidly therefore ceased firing went up on to poop to see last of died game for crew maintained steady fire upon until foundered last shot being fired at very moment when be plunging stern first beneath wave by unlucky chance that last shot came slap aboard wreck struck teak poop rail within foot of where stood scattered number of splinter one of heavy one caught in side of head very nearly scalped sent reeling to deck senseless recovered consciousness slowly first sensation being that top of head seemed to be on fire then became aware that be being partially supported by somebody knee behind shoulder that head be being bathed finally opened eye to find mr vansittart bending over with sponge in hand be just withdrawing from basin of bloodstained water while boy julius supported in semi recumbent position a lay on deck ah be better exclaimed mr vansittart a bent over be coming to lizette raising voice hurry with brandy be head very painful walter feel a though be being held much too close to fierce fire replied in addition be aching most atrociously be most unfortunate that yes be indeed poor boy replied mr vansittart a paused feeling of deadly nausea sweeping over ah continued a chief stewardess appeared with tumbler in hand here be brandy sip walter will revive a soon a be able to move must get below must attend to head dress properly then must go to bed endeavour to get sleep have taken splendid care of morning now will be turn to take care of oh thank very much murmured hope unlucky blow on head be not going to make nuisance to a to turning in simply can not do careful watch must be maintained for several hour yet lest of men from junk must swim to wreck get aboard even so few a dozen able bodied chinaman must make lot of trouble for just now yes agreed julius must guess be not going to give chance will just have to turn in a momma say leave to look after thing see here mr leigh worry about anything will keep look out if swimming chink come meandering around here will just give 'em sock bet be reassuring for if boy be willing to undertake duty must quite easily keep considerable number of swimmer at distance with assistance of remington few sip of brandy served to restore strength greatly presently with help of mr vansittart lizette be able to make way below to drawing room there passed particularly unpleasant three quarter of hour while lady skipper snipped most of hair off afterwards coaxed lacerated scalp back into place securing in position with strap of sticking plaster finishing off by dressing of healing ointment bandage when be done two stewardess helped to own cabin after have left somehow managed to undress get into bunk be glad enough to do for be beginning to feel distinctly ill have hazy recollection that after have be in bunk little while mr vansittart came to administered dose of medicine told be intended to make sleep then seemed to pas into condition wherein be victim of long succession of hideous nightmare during be perpetually battling with thousand awful peril be lying helpless in hand of cruel relentless savage who be inflicting most dreadful torment upon be close muggy suffocatingly hot day when at length emerged from condition of extreme mental physical suffering cabin port stood wide open close to head not even faintest breath of air came through presently became aware of sound quickly identified a of torrential downpour of tropical rain lashing surface of sea outside deck above stirred uneasily in bunk wondering vaguely how long have lain there strove to rise upon elbow might look through port might a well have striven to lift deck over head seemed not to have ounce of strength left in sank head back upon pillow with weary sigh a did so became aware of slight movement beside bunk turning eye in direction saw miss anthea in act of rising to foot from chair immediately beneath port have book in hand placed face down upon top of desk beside a rose to foot then coming to side of bunk bent over gazed into eye gradually little smile of gratification illuminated somewhat pale worn feature eye noticed have very weary look a though from prolonged sleeplessness presently a smiled in answer spoke be feeling better wal mr leigh asked do know assuredly miss anthea answered why must not know spoke with most disconcerting difficulty word halted lip seemed scarcely capable of forming oh be splendid exclaimed straightening body clasping hand together after manner of girl who hears good news be feeling better persisted have be ill then stupidly asked indeed mind be at moment tenanted merely by mass of most confused incoherent memory of must make little nothing have indeed replied dreadfully ill raving in delirium so violent that be miracle did not do of serious injury continued stopping a attempted to speak thank god be over now hope remains be for to take a much nourishment a can do a be told get well strong again a quickly a possible must run away leave for few minute to tell momma good news arrange to have food prepared for with nod smile of encouragement left cabin minute two later mr vansittart entered stepped quickly up to side of bunk looked at presently laid slim cool finger upon pulse holding there for several second ah commented a removed at length guess be ocean better than be at time yesterday fever be gone skin be delightfully cool moist moreover be in right mind once more be something gained expect wound in head be healing although have be able to look at properly for nearly week will attend to now a soon a have taken little food star walter have have time with lucky for that have taken into head to become sensible again guess 'd have be sick people in day two do know how long have be ill answered be afraid that have be much too long know where to find word in to express regret for regret repeated regret nothing must help dear boy got hurt in defending be just duty to look after nurse a best must be there be to have be ill ten whole day be eleventh morning since junk appeared during best part of ten day have be raving in delirium with occasional outbreak of violence when taxed energy of five of to utmost to restrain oh guess have have very lively time with walter off on thank god be over now ah here come lizette with broth for have be hoping for change for last five six hour have got ready for now lizette guess have got to climb right up on to chair seat on edge of bunk support mr leigh in sitting posture while feed take care that hurt head so be right lean back against head of bunk rest head against shoulder gently girl gently reckon poor boy be aching over with weakness there be right be pretty comfortable walter good now then that have got to do be just drink broth right away rest for spell then will come along again dress wound on head chapter fourteen gale week elapsed before must convince mr vansittart be strong enough to be permitted to rise from bunk sit in chair for short time after recovery be rapid wound healed nicely strength returned five day later be able to dress with assistance make way up on to main deck where julius helped by others with forethought for must certainly never have given credit have rigged up sort of makeshift awning for especial benefit learned with utmost satisfaction since memorable morning of junk appearance boy have behaved with almost unbelievable goodness talking to have received from sister seemed to have awakened better nature now assured that a indeed seemed be everything must be desired of one thing at least there must be possible mistake strange antipathy to have entirely vanished now seemed anxious to be a friendly agreeable a before have be objectionable be nearly six week after appearance of junk when at length felt strong enough to resume boat building operation even then be only able at first to do such comparatively light work a shaping planing plank gradually however got back again to heavier work came from time to time when be necessary to shift framework of hull while working upon day witnessed certain amount of progress until at length open shell be finished caulked then by combined effort placed boat in position ready for launching bow first off sloping deck since be now so heavy that further lifting must be possible brought time on to five month few day from date of wreck during whole of period have be favoured with glorious weather except for few day of calm accompanied by heavy rain about time when be emerging from state of delirium few day after have completed shell of boat while be preparing planking with to lay deck there occurred sign of change wind usually blew moderate breeze from eastward died away to calm sky became veiled by thin film of haze gradually thickened until sun be completely blotted out atmosphere grew almost unbearably sultry so that seemed to breathe only with utmost difficulty while work even lightest became almost impossible barometer fell so rapidly that even veriest tyro in weather lore must not have mistaken sign night rather in small hour of morning thunderstorm broke over like of for violence duration have never seen started dry for four hour heaven be incessantly ablaze with lightning vividness alarming character of be quite impossible to describe while continuous crash of thunder immediately overhead a seemed be terrific causing very wreck to tremble with vibration a left cabin went up on deck to watch felt that sooner later wreck must inevitably be struck indeed frequently thought actually have be for lightning seemed to be playing about suppose escaped somehow at least if be struck apparent damage be done then about time when daylight be beginning to make apparent suddenly began to rain warm fresh water from cloud pelting down in perfect deluge totally obscuring everything beyond hundred yard radius water poured off deck in cataract while from poop gushed through scupper discharged on to main deck a though flowing from spout of pump in ten minute deck be a effectually cleansed a though have be scrubbed with soap water thinking pity so much delicious fresh water must be permitted to run to waste went below brought up several small breaker proceeded to fill one after other until have lot numbering about twenty brimming full time thunderstorm continued to rage with unabated fury filling of breaker during continuance of terrific deluge naturally resulted in getting wet through to skin upon completion of task therefore retired to cabin effected complete change of garment have barely finished toilet when sound of gong summoning party to breakfast while be discarding drenched garment donning dry one became aware of fact that thunderstorm be at last easing up little lightning flash be no longer continuous blaze thunder no longer be one continuous uninterrupted crash crackle boom like firing of two enormous fleet engaged in fighting fiercely contested action peal be separate distinct with momentarily increasing interval between peal thus when presently met sat down to breakfast conversation of sort be possible although by mean easy topic of moment be of course storm be not at surprised to learn that entire party have be thoroughly terrified be by mean reassured even now when if be indisputable that storm be passing be rather inclined to be silent at meal mr vansittart daughter confessed to possession of distracting headache result doubt of terror even julius be in distinctly subdued mood nobody ate at heartily think be glad when laid down knife fork made possible for to rise from table lady julius announced intention to retire to respective cabin in hope of obtaining relief in slumber a work on deck be quite out of question so long a rain continued decided to follow example having lost hour of sleep accordingly carried out resolution soon sank into condition of semi oblivion during be only partially conscious of fact that although rain be still sluicing in torrent thunder lightning have dwindled away to few distant rumbling occasional flash finally consciousness also passed fell sound asleep when awoke rather more than hour later at once became aware that rain thunder have entirely ceased be still so dark that until referred to watch have impression must have overslept that night be coming on then flung open port of cabin have be closed to exclude rain poking head out saw that sky be still overcast with enormous mass of blackish lurid looking cloud a watched saw be working slowly in strange writhing fashion a though agitated by several conflicting internal force went up on deck observed that overcast condition of sky of have obtained partial view from cabin port extended in direction right down to horizon visit to chart house revealed fact that barometer still stood alarmingly low be fact perhaps in conjunction with disquieting aspect of sky subconsciously awakened in sudden anxiety to hasten work upon craft for want of better name have spoken of a boat be that a may remember that flung off light jacket for appearance ' sake wore at meal time when otherwise in company of lady set to work a though very life depended upon a have already mentioned shell of boat be finished caulked placed in position ready for launching in addition to beam upon deck be to be laid be fitted fixed planking planed up roughly cut to shape next task therefore be to complete fitting of plank nailing of in position at once proceeded to do with fixed determination to finish job before dark determination carried out although necessitated working for hour by lantern light when at length knocked off have satisfaction of leaving boat completely decked with exception of cockpit coaming of also insisted on fixing before must persuade to lay down tool day have be one of lowering breathless calm with insufferably close atmosphere rendered hard work exceedingly trying black working canopy of cloud that overhung continued to writhe twist into most extraordinary shape while showed sign of dispersing state of affair continued until about four o'clock in afternoon when light puffy southerly breeze sprang up gradually freshened until when at length ceased work for day be blowing quite gustily while sea came rolling in over reef soon caused wreck occasionally to rock lightly upon coral bed be very tired after strenuous labour that day moreover have not yet fully recovered strength have lost during illness therefore under ordinary circumstance must have gone to cabin turned in soon after dinner a be felt uneasy did not at like look of weather felt convinced that be booked for blow possibly heavy one further reference to barometer fully confirmed in conviction if foreboding must prove to be correct what must be probable result must wreck remain where be must doubt be right nothing worse must befall than possibly unpleasant anxious night if did not what then must gradually bump way over few yard of inner edge of reef then reach lagoon in must probably founder unless indeed remained afloat long enough to drive across fetch up again on opposite reef be possibility have long since recognised now a looked out into night dimly saw breaker thundering in upon outer end of reef shattering into wall of madly leaping water thirty foot high then continuing course across reef in form of foam flecked wave power of be rapidly dissipated a swept inward toward wreck began to doubt whether stella mari must ever again shift berth be true that wave a swirled foamed about have power enough to cause hull to rock little now again a to lifting bodily throwing into lagoon well thought unlikely reflected that when in first instance piled up there be strong breeze blowing heavy sea running that have hit reef stem on under heavy press of sail yet have not then be flung right across reef sea have brought so far then power have failed to move inch farther why must not that be case now there be something comforting almost reassuring about line of argument yet at back of mind there be something seemed to tell must not take data too much for granted that there be possibility of must not permit quite to lose sight therefore set to answer question in event of other possibility happening how be to meet there be one answer with boat unfinished destitute of equipment a be must undoubtedly be obliged to trust to if worst came to worst point settled next question asked be what must require to take with supposing that must come to being obliged to take to boat in hurry night in fact provision water of course in such abundance a boat capacity must permit pair of oar coil of line baler bucket few tool say dozen rifle good supply of ammunition for same why tool may be asked because if once be compelled to trust to boat without mast sail must be compelled to go practically wherever wind chose to drive might be to uninhabited island where tool must be worth weight in gold carpenter chest stood on deck close by boat have be using tool only few hour earlier thought came to that might a well be in a out of therefore emptied chest since be too heavy for to lift full having decided upon most suitable spot for stowed inside boat then proceeded carefully to replace content done hunted up pair of twelve foot oar put aboard found pair of rowlock then remembering have a yet made provision for shipping proceeded to cut out good stout pair of cleat firmly secured to gunwale of boat there be plenty of rope lying about deck neatly done up in coil salvage of running gear from selected mizen topgallant halyard a of suitable size putting into boat unstopping bending one end to hole in stem head bored for purpose having gone so far decided must complete preparation so that in event of being driven to last extremity might be ready considered little a to what must next put into boat fixed upon case of ammunition must stow alongside carpenter chest being desirable in order to secure stability that heaviest article must be at bottom accordingly dived below to magazine now remington rifle cartridge be done up in small tin box of one hundred sealed up in air tight tin case be in turn stowed in stout wooden chest containing one hundred tin consequently chest contained ten thousand round be large quantity yet not too large decided considering uncertainty of position therefore emptied case apart from content be fairly heavy to drag up on deck carried up to boat stowed in position then returned for small tin case transport stowage of occupied time involving several journey up down between deck magazine when have finished job be distinctly tired nevertheless brought up six remingtons cutlas brace of automatic pistol box of cartridge for latter stowed in boat before knocking off for rest work have given appetite since be now close upon midnight went below routed out good substantial cold meal consumed while rested then why attempt to conceal truth overcome suppose by unusual protracted exertion fell asleep a sat remember that a slept dreamed that be away back there at entrance to strait of malacca where lost blade of propeller felt again shock of collision with supposed wreckage to attributed loss start gave awoke instantly became aware that be blowing heavily for howl whoop of gale came distinctly to ear also wreck be rolling heavily from side to side for moment thought be afloat until harsh grinding upon coral reached above tumultuous cry of wind staggered to foot for realised that matter be becoming serious at instant felt hull lift a wreck heeled over come down again with jar that jolted off foot also unless be greatly mistaken caught among other sound thud of water falling heavily on deck made spring for ladder in couple of second be out on deck to find in midst of living gale coming up out of lighted room found night intensely dark yet a stood there by open hatchway clinging to main fife rail presently became dimly aware of more immediate surroundings a chanced be about time of full moon although planet herself be completely hidden by dense mass of cloud that drove wildly athwart firmament light filtered through presently be able to see a far a outer edge of reef where surf brilliantly phosphorescent plunged madly down upon burst into leaping fountain of spray came driving over wreck like heavy rain though knew be not rain by bitter salt taste of on lip surface of water round wreck on hand in fact over whole of weather portion of reef be mass of swirling phosphorescent foam rose fell a roller came sweeping across reef be roller be causing ship to roll on bed of coral while occasionally one heavier than others must lift bodily break furiously over shift foot more toward inner edge of reef a judged by feel of before dashed down again instinctively glance flew to where boat must lie yes thank god be still where have left held down mainly believed by weight of thing have put in for when sea broke over deck water surged past to leeward with quite weight enough to wash off have be empty rushed at snatched rope have bent to stem head led across deck to stump of stanchion made fast with clove hitch thus ensuring that boat must not be washed off deck so long a rope held then stood for minute two looking about taking careful note of detail of situation be in essential complete realisation of fear have haunted ever since wreck short time before have be inclined to deride a highly improbable gale heavy sea sweeping in across reef only question whether wreck must be battered to piece where lay be washed off to founder in deeper water of lagoon heavier sea than have preceded surging in at moment making clean breach over wreck washed off foot must have swept overboard have not chanced to have in hand rope by have secured boat lifted wreck slued nearly half round swept good fathom nearer danger point inner edge of reef began to realise that peril be imminent momentarily growing more so that immediate action be necessary without pausing to consider further rushed below hammered at cabin door of anthea julius be contiguous upon receiving reply shouted to to dress at once join with speed in drawing room then sped to stewardess quarter roused finally made way to mr vansittart cabin where met lady fully dressed just emerging must have read in countenance that there be trouble ahead for came forward at once with outstretched hand exclaiming what be walter doe dreadful gale mean danger to doe indeed madam greatly fear replied proceeded to explain situation rapidly to while be doing so anthea brother made appearance naturally be greatly discomposed at statement of imminence of danger never for moment did flinch on contrary woman appeared to be good deal more calm composed than be asked what be to do when told set to work quietly expeditiously collecting quantity of food of various kind in tin being assisted in by two stewardess who now came upon scene meanwhile wreck have be bumping more more heavily a stood hurriedly conversed sea after sea have broken over with ever increasing violence be now in very fever of anxiety touching safety of boat a soon therefore a have started little crew to work rushed out on deck again to see how matter be going there be sooner in open than perceived that even during short absence from deck condition have changed very materially for worse wind be now blowing with hurricane force evidently piling up water on reef for sea now swept across be momentarily gaining in power weight almost one reached wreck lifting bodily shifting fathom so ever in fatal direction of edge of reef worst feature of case after be that while shifting wreck sea have canted so that now lay fair square broadside on to one struck made clean breach over threatened to destroy to sweep away boat even a stood be lifted must have be washed away for restraint of rope by have secured must see plainly however that rope must not bear strain much longer than few minute perhaps even second that if must lose boat doom must be sealed therefore rushed back to drawing room called little party together bade take a much a must carry watching chance make dash for boat set example by gathering in arm a many tin bottle a hand arm must hold rushed out on deck just missed being washed overboard hurriedly tumbled load into cockpit anyhow then suddenly remembered that a yet there be water in boat dashed aft to where have left water breaker have filled with rain water passing other member of party on way attempt to return for load shouted to a passed get into boat stow yourselves under deck weight will be more useful there than anywhere else will attend to rest seizing one of breaker proceeded to roll quickly along deck until after hazardous adventurous journey arrived at boat into with julius assistance lifted got into cockpit to stow breaker securely woman having already entered stowed away when just a matter be satisfactorily arranged be in very act of leaving boat to secure armful of provision tremendous sea struck wreck heeling over until starboard waterway be buried breaking sea swept deck like cataract lifting boat clean off just a sprang back into cockpit there be little jerk twang a rope parted in instant be afloat driving rapidly away to leeward across lagoon chapter fifteen be compelled to leave reef for perhaps dozen second stood there motionless in cockpit of dancing boat paralysed with dismay there be six people adrift in contraption of craft must not even be sure be water tight about behaviour of be absolutely ignorant be without mast sail have only small quantity of provision about fourteen gallon of water to furnish with food drink for heaven alone knew how long recognising vital necessity for instant action however groped for oar found threw out over lee quarter of boat at same time staring into darkness in endeavour to locate sandbank now be only hope for to drive out to sea in such craft a ours on night a simply meant speedy destruction boat low a sat on water without even so much a naked mast for wind to act upon be skimming along at surprising speed must soon be in open ocean unless must find sandbank secure to thought for moment of bearing of bank in relation to position of ship direction of wind then having decided point brought boat to wind on starboard tack so to speak found that answered helm better than have dared to hope forging ahead with pressure of wind on weather side ten minute later have satisfaction of feeling ground bring up dead upon something must be none other than bank be so anxious to reach moment that grounded wave although be not very much more than mere ripple here began to slop in over weather side that knew must never do for if did nothing worse must at least interfere with comfort of passenger therefore since be already wet through to skin nipped over side into knee deep water put shoulder under boat slanting bow shoved afloat again with broken painter in hand waded along margin of bank towing boat after until presently have worked round to lee side of bank for few yard breadth water here be perfectly smooth grounded afresh dragging up a high a must on bank anchoring by painter to oar thrust a deep into sand a must force clambered back into boat thrust head in under deck shouted be here yes be here quite safe so far answered mr vansittart what have happened walter have be washed off wreck have not yes replied be now grounded on lee margin of sandbank where believe be reasonably safe provided that strike adrift think there be not much fear of must remain here for rest of night indeed until gale subsides then if wreck be still above water will return to complete equipment of boat preparation for voyage say if wreck be still above water ' be there possibility that may not be demanded mr vansittart very greatly fear so said when involuntarily left be being steadily driven ever nearer to edge of reef if pass that point believe will sink like stone still there be use in anticipating worst must recommend to compose yourselves to sleep if can until daylight then will know for certain exactly how stand by way be boat leaking at for few second there be reply mr vansittart be evidently feeling round for indication of leak presently spoke there have be little water here walter replied believe came in through cockpit in form of spray now doubt have run aft with tilt of boat there be nothing worse now than little damp be sorry said be afraid will have to make best of thing a be luckily be anything cold if can get to sleep will soon forget discomfort will keep look out so saying backed out from under deck in first place proceeded to search for water complained of found right aft a mr vansittart have suggested in order to test tightness of boat baled out at least a much of a must be got rid of with baler leaving more than perhaps tumblerful then wading ashore sat down on sand with back against upright oar to boat be moored began to review situation five minute later despite soaked clothing general state of discomfort be fast asleep when awoke sun be just showing on eastern horizon sky be clear save for few tattered fragment of ragged looking scud speedily disappeared wind have died down to piping topsail breeze sea bird have evidently be driven out to sea by gale be wearily winging way back to sandbank filling brisk clean morning air with mournful cry looked for wreck reef be bare have vanished leaving not trace behind save few plank remaining of stock from have built boat upon looking more carefully about saw floating in little bunch near middle of lagoon clothes have dried upon during sleep be feeling just trifle chilled air be already warming up brisk walk along edge of water back again soon restored circulation climbed aboard boat barefooted padded softly along deck until reached cockpit into dropped softly then peering in under deck looked to see whether of occupant be stirring appeared to be asleep except boy who a soon a eye became accustomed to obscurity saw be sitting up rubbing eye yawning presently saw be evidently about to speak silenced with gesture beckoned to come to in cockpit obeyed when be standing beside staring round in wonderment pointed out floating plank to said have just occurred to julius that one of plank rather small portion of one of will be exceedingly useful to be therefore going to swim off fetch one want to stand here keep watch while be gone if anyone wake want to come out from below just tell be having swim that will be much obliged if will stay below until return be dressed clothes be dry now want to wet again so will strip understand sure get right answered lad wo let of out until be ready to be seen again better git ' a quickly a can have nodded springing up on deck quickly threw off clothes spread in sun so that lingering moisture might be dried out of during absence dropping lightly to sand dashed into water struck out be gone about hour be not until be returning with captured plank that thought of possible shark occurred to however saw none got safely back to bank where having hauled up plank at once proceeded to dress in now thoroughly dry clothes swim have greatly refreshed felt in excellent form for good hearty breakfast ala remembered slender stock of provision stifled longing a best must presently woman folk emerged one after other standing in cockpit looked about in something approaching amazement at change passage of few hour have effected when entered boat about midnight black hurricane be raging now be brilliantly beautiful morning mr vansittart be greatly concerned on account of disappearance of wreck realised a clearly a did that involved leaping down upon sand with assistance walked with to highest point of bank intently surveyed aspect of sea question have to decide be whether not be yet safe for to put to sea have be provided with mast sail must not have hesitated moment indeed breeze if trifle fresh must have swept along at merry pace soon brought land of sort into ken in present condition risk of being overrun swamped be a yet too great be however of vital importance that must make start at earliest possible moment for stock of food water be exceedingly meagre though must have to suffice until be either picked up must reach more kindly shore than sandbank in case must not make start for at least hour for experience of previous night during brief passage from wreck to sandbank have shown that in absence of rudder have not yet made provision for steering oar be absolute necessity hence anxiety little earlier to secure one of floating plank be by time eager for breakfast therefore before doing anything else took careful account of stock of food water estimated that with care might be made to last week be better than have dared to hope for must be strange indeed if in course of week did not fall in with craft of sort reach solid earth must afford at least mean of sustaining life measured out allowance of food sufficient to serve for one meal in accordance with scale agreed upon quickly disposed of upon opening water breaker however be vexed to find that be not full to bung hole a have confidently expected to find on contrary there be quite gallon short supposed must have be lost while rolling along wreck deck previous night that missing gallon so must have to make up by slightly curtailing person allowance unless indeed be blessed with shower two of rain during voyage having quickly disposed of rather meagre breakfast got out tool chest using plank have retrieved made cleat for reception of rowlock firmly fixed to boat transom so that when necessary must use one of oar to steer with for sculling purpose job occupied for best part of hour when be finished suggested that since be doing no good where be might be worth while to take cruise about lagoon see whether must find flotsam from wreck must be of value to did found nothing except few plank dozen of hauled in laid on boat deck to dry upon off chance of eventually proving useful to then made way to spot where thought wreck have sunk eventually found submerged within about forty fathom of inner edge of reef showing that must have gone down almost immediately after being washed clear there be about fathom half of water over poop a gazed down upon craft clearly visible through crystal water of lagoon poor mr vansittart shed few pardonable tear over grave of ship of have be so proud have loved so well be agreeably surprised to find so called boat bulky clumsy a looked to eye proved quite easy to propel with pair of oar handled by julius except indeed when tried to force to windward then became decidedly heavy sluggish in movement showed that must be hopeless to dream of shaping course other than to leeward at best with wind abeam wind be at moment blowing briskly from southward be fair wind for caroline group in one of if must only manage to hit right one might hope to meet with hospitality at least if not actual mean to return to civilisation after discussion therefore determined a wind seemed inclined to moderate little to risk start without further delay since if boat be to be of real service to ought to be able to live in such sea a be now running outside be about eleven o'clock in morning when reached open sea first discovery made with regard to boat be that thanks to double keel must forge ahead with wind anywhere at abaft beam not at great speed certainly with wind only about one point free still fast enough to enable to control with steering oar when bore up before wind moved under impetus of breeze almost a fast a have be able to row in lagoon second discovery with regard to be le pleasing owing to peculiar shape of floor will be remembered sloped up fore aft somewhat after fashion of of fishing punt rode sea with extraordinary buoyancy a dry a bone being without chart compass must not of course steer definite course therefore kept craft dead before wind sea julius wielded oar until boy be tired when susie second stewardess who be fine strong strapping girl took spell soon picked up trick of rowing when be tired lizette chief stewardess must need try hand proved much le adaptable than assistant did little more than blister hand julius then took spell by time be tired be tired too therefore gave up rowing for bit mr vansittart undertook to steer boat by mean of oar over stern by time have dropped reef out of sight astern be beginning to realise fully that be veritable castaway fact think have never hitherto quite come home to of thing worried most be absence of sail on boat now that have definitely irretrievably embarked ourselves fortune in wanted to get over ground at good pace instead of drifting snail like before wind sea set to consider whether with material at command must not rig up something must serve purpose of mast sail have best part of coil of good useful line in boat dozen three by nine inch plank of be twelve foot in length be excepting of course that priceless treasure carpenter chest a stood looking contemplatively at plank occurred to that three of say placed edge to edge reared upright on boat deck must catch quite appreciable amount of wind sooner have idea suggested to than got to work first act be to take one of plank saw off end two foot six inch in length piece next sawed into six equal strip batten task occupied much longer than have anticipated chiefly on account of limited space in be obliged to work because have nothing boat gunwale to steady plank against got six batten at last four of nailed at equal interval of about two foot three inch across three plank laid close together side by side while nailed fifth athwartships on deck at point where intended to rear plank length of batten being three inch more than combined width of three plank projecting end of top batten afforded very convenient shoulder for support of shroud stay cut from coil of line having got fixed seized reared structure on end against deck batten with assistance of julius two stewardess set up shroud stay nailed batten in front of contraption to keep in place behold have mast sail in one twelve foot long two foot three inch wide capable of catching holding quite appreciable amount of wind that be actually case at once became apparent boat speed quickly rising to about three knot while did not now lose way when sank into trough of sea be so pleased with success of experiment that immediately began to elaborate original idea new scheme be to saw one of plank into very thin veneer like sheet nail together at edge make veritable sail out of hour work sufficed to convince that to saw three inch plank into even quarter inch board with ordinary handsaw demanded far more skill in carpentry than possessed afternoon night passed quietly shortly after sunrise feminine member of party made appearance upon enquiry be informed that have passed comfortable night slept well be quite cheerful courageous indeed be amazed to see how quickly thoroughly adapted to circumstance although in case of mr vansittart daughter at least be first experience of anything in nature of real hardship breakfasted early that morning of declaring to be more than ready for meal then experienced most unpleasant shock for upon serving out first allowance of water for day discovered that stock have suffered further mysterious depletion during night upon investigation proved to be due to leaky breaker leak be not very serious one certainly stave seemed to be taking up bit leak growing le still have lost about three pint be pint apiece be not difficult to picture condition under might make difference to between life death day passed like night uneventfully breeze held steady continued to blow along northward mr vansittart daughter taking spell spell at steering oar while endeavoured to make up arrears of sleep of course sharp look out be maintained in hope that sail land might be sighted although air be crystal clear horizon remained bare throughout entire circle toward wind manifested tendency to drop shortly after midnight fell dead so that when julius aroused at two o'clock in morning found boat heaving gently upon oil smooth swell calm if must last for length of time must be nothing short of disaster be of vital importance that must find ship shore capable of providing with sustenance within next four five day must be subjected to horror of starvation positively dreaded to think of what might be effect of upon woman therefore that might not lie there absolutely helpless started to scull boat with steering oar be heavy for style of propulsion estimated that progress did not amount to more than three quarter of mile per hour chapter sixteen perishing of hunger thirst be night of great discomfort storm of wind rain arising day followed be little if better same weather condition prevailing throughout continued to scull boat at interval through day be horribly distressing work distress being aggravated by knowledge that be for so small result since estimated that by end of day have accomplished little more than six mile of progress be about four o'clock afternoon when fast failing energy received fresh stimulus have be wearily toiling at oar for about hour facing west so that might be guided in course by pale blotch of light represented position of sun when cry from julius who be only alert member of party caused to turn head saw pointing eagerly toward north eastern quarter be mast of ship over yonder mr leigh boy asked looking in direction of pointing finger caught sight a boat lifted over swell of two microscopic object at once recognised a vessel mast head stood out fairly clear against gloomy background of lowering sky after prolonged scrutiny of came to conclusion that belonged to small schooner fifteen mile distant probably one of craft make business of trading among island of western southern pacific be right julius be cried eagerly do feel equal to handling oar for hour two bet do answered lad with equal eagerness be equal to doing anything will help to get out of beastly boat on to ship once more right exclaimed come along then let see what can do craft be only about fifteen mile off if calm will last long enough be bound to fetch hastened to adjust rowlock into position for using oar meanwhile remark have stirred rest of party from listlessness into action sat up looked eagerly at two tiny pin point on horizon mr vansittart climbing down into cockpit exclaimed yes guess be ship right have got to reach will help jule strength mine together ought to be equal to walter so between will keep boat going straight stewardess good plucky girl must not agree to with one voice declared that be not going to sit still let mistress work so end of be that arranged to take one oar working at at once while julius volunteered to help presently have two mast head bearing straight ahead boat moving through water at rate of about three mile hour two girl being perfectly fresh doing quite a much work a julius strenuously toiled when at light failed have risen craft sufficiently to determine that be fore aft schooner then difficulty began for there be star within ten minute of time of sunset fell pitch dark from moment course be largely matter of guesswork two girl julius declared that be so tired hand be so raw that must do more whereupon mr vansittart anthea took one oar while laboured on at other by time too be weak trembling with exhaustion to extent must scarcely lift blade of oar out of water while thirst be so intolerable that at length be fairly driven to proposal that must risk indulgence in extra ration of water even revived for few minute finally have to confess to feeling of such dizziness confusion must no longer be responsible for course of boat have to beg mr vansittart to assume that duty next hour be one of absolute torment to arm felt a though be about to drop out of socket back ached intolerably breath drew be like knife piercing lung head throbbed a though must burst eye be sightless then there came small four knot breeze out from about north north west be too shy wind for with unadjustable substitute for sail with knowledge unless schooner happened to be bound in direction must miss effort must be thrown away dropped insensible in cockpit so remained for full hour more despite effort of others to revive when at length came to myself brisk westerly breeze be blowing boat be scudding before with mr vansittart at steering oar moon be just rising so little of light a yet came filtering through veil of cloud overspread sky that be impossible to see anything more than faint sheen of light upon briskly rippling surface of sea although scanned whole visible horizon in search of light must indicate position of schooner search be unrewarded to be brief saw more of schooner a night progressed wind increased until by morning be blowing so strongly that must hing run before luckily craft proved to be unexpectedly good sea boat scudded dry although behaviour be at time so unlike of boat of normal model that be somewhat puzzled a to what be going to happen next scudded day whole of succeeding night by time wind have raised what be to formidable sea that deemed wise to heave to lest heavier sea than usual must break aboard swamp with great difficulty considerable danger to therefore lowered arrangement of plank served a mast sail combined bending painter to rode to a to sea anchor by time be feeling really ill hard work exhaustion be telling upon with increasing severity almost hourly now upon top of came bitter anxiety heart ached for companion especially woman folk did utmost to seem cheerful be pitiable to see dreadful languor of movement hollow cheek dark marking under eye above terrible look of suffering despair be beginning to reveal in eye yet not word of discouragement complaint passed black cracking lip simply lay about moving a little a possible endured silently a for must think of nothing hing to help be horrible that gale lasted four interminable day before blew out did later in afternoon about sunset of same day consumed last scrap of food remained to then with moan of utter despair poor dear woman crawled into lair beneath deck to die a verily believed a for julius be nearly a bad a be last day in wreck nine day in boat have wrought miracle in perversity selfishness of character have before distinguished have gone have come out of fire of adversity suffering purged new right gallant manly boy how manly did not know until time afterward when came out that watching observing that took trifle le food water than served out to others have surreptitiously returned portion of own meagre allowance poor boy so far a usefulness be concerned be already a good a dead for must hing just lie where have flung down utterly exhausted moan piteously being naturally robust still retained small modicum of strength utilised by hauling in sea anchor with superhuman exertion setting up in place again not so much with hope that must blow to land a might attract attention aboard passing ship lead to bear down upon rescue last bit of exertion finished off too have not enough strength left even to stagger aft to cockpit simply collapsed on deck knew more must have lain thus through night for when at length consciousness returned be broad day with sun about hour high in sky of exquisite stainless blue long hour of unconsciousness sleep perhaps partook of have somewhat restored sat up staring about merciful heaven be eye deceiving have gone crazy be what beheld real stared stared with eye seemed to be starting out of head vision if vision be remained stable there lay fair island with tree seemed to wave gently in brisk morning breeze hill might almost be termed mountain nearly in centre that island be dead to leeward of that have to do be to run down to land upon if god must only be merciful enough to allow fair breeze to last with queer kind of croaking memory of disturbs sleep even now occasionally intended to be yell of rejoicing staggered to foot stumbled aft to cockpit half leaped half tumbled into shipped rowlock in after cleat got out steering oar with labour that made groan pant contrived to head boat toward glorious vision of island for have be drifting toward broadside on then bent down to where lad julius lay unconscious at foot shaking roughly by shoulder called on to awake for there be land in sight not more than four mile away for time poor boy made response to effort to arouse began to think that be dead when suddenly opened eye whispered land land who talk of land do hearty replied walter leigh wake up old chap see for think can poor boy gasped seem to to can help mr oh mister exclaimed that be done with long ago here give hand old man be now heave with will right steady boy grip coaming there be now then look straight ahead tell what see boy stared out over boat bow for long minute more never will forget look of exquisite rapture gradually grew in glassy eye a stared then suddenly down dropped again into bottom of boat covered poor emaciated face with hand a gave vent to storm of dry choking sob stooped patted on shoulder encouragingly there exclaimed soothingly be right old man cry if want to when have done slip in see if can make mother sister understand that there be land in sight that will reach in about two hour yes yes will whispered boy be of be thinking got upon hand knee crawled in under deck where remained about five minute thereabout then reappeared eye wide with horror walter gasped walter ca rouse guess be dead dead croaked oh surely not must be too cruel that must have endured so much only to perish when that need be within sight take dipper there be still little water left see if can get to swallow drop two then if will take at give good drink dipper more mind tell that in two hour will be ashore on fairest island god sun ever shone upon go at once old boy few minute may make difference between life death must go be afraid be too weak to stand steer be not protested can steer right 'd ever so much rather that went in there than will manage better than must walter be afraid afraid that must wake for thought saw what be matter with lad feared that mother sister be dead shrank from converting that fear into certainty therefore surrendered steering oar to drawing small quantity of water from almost empty cask crept in under deck where found four woman lying by a far apart from others a possible of apparently dead yet although place smelt close stuffy enough must detect trace of taint in hot climate so quickly betrays presence of death with renewed hope proceeded to task happened to turn to miss anthea first although light in there be too subdued to enable to distinguish very clearly ravage wrought by slow starvation ease with feeble a be raised poor emaciated form into semi sitting posture be eloquent enough lay with closed eye quite inanimate in arm upon bending over thought must detect that still breathed although be by mean certain dipped finger in pannikin of water have brought with moistened dry cracked lip repeating operation two three time presently distinctly heard sigh saw that be making feeble effort to lick lip whereupon held pannikin to allowed little water to trickle into mouth endeavoured to swallow effort be so painful a to extort low groan from then opened eye looked about vacantly a though did not recognise surroundings when found bending over smiled faintly smile strangely gladdened heart be feeling better whispered try to swallow little more of water hold in mouth for moment two first then will give more listen there be land in sight most lovely island embowered in richest verdure where be sure will be able to get food need be quite near so near that will be there in about two hour from now surely can hold out two hour longer if give enough water to quench thirst smiled again land do say whispered land food oh yes be sure can mere thought of will sustain be sure walter quite sure absolutely certain answered julius have seen too be steering boat straight for now drink little more water then let help to get into fresh air will feel ever so much better out there on deck drank again time avidly almost savagely small teeth clenching on rim of pannikin poor thin finger grasping tightly when attempted to remove from lip when knowing that in condition to drink freely must be hurtful to forcibly removed pannikin poor girl cried pitifully whispered be cruel presently pacified with promise of little more a soon a be outside at last with le difficulty than have anticipated got out on deck where after administration of about quarter of pint of water with just suspicion of brandy in revived in most marvellous manner then went below again pursuing same tactic with others eventually have happiness to restore to animation get out on deck where sat feasting eye upon glorious prospect be gradually unfolding before to achieve result have to expend very last drop of water must be coaxed from breaker a did so realised to full what torment of tantalus must have be not drop have passed own lip during previous twelve hour to witness ecstasy with others absorbed precious liquid be almost more than must endure in then weak state a crept slowly in toward island naturally obtained more distinct view of characteristic let try to describe from north to south island to measure little over eight mile long at about third of length from north end there occurred sort of peak to land sloped in direction from extremity seemed to consist of rocky cliff ranging from about forty to perhaps two hundred foot in height except towards north where soil sloped gently down to white sandy beach about mile in length within about mile half of southern extremity there be elevation sort of knoll about mile further south knoll about height of neighbour cliff be almost black in colour above there be glimpse of most inviting grassy slope peeping coyly out from between great mass of umbrageous tree among felt must be strange if did not find fruit tree of sort indeed detected certain palm be morally certain be coconut palm while unless eye deceived believed must also descry foliage strongly suggested idea of plantain banana tree about hundred yard from southern extremity of island quite detached from there towered out of sea great vertical column of black rock like rugged pillar with rounded top looked quite inaccessible naturally headed boat in first instance for only bit of beach in sight when have arrived within about mile of shore detected break in cliff seemed to hint at existence of small harbour near southern part of island between two knoll recently mentioned at once headed boat for spot finding wind just free enough to permit to reach chapter seventeen island twenty minute later boat slid in between two cliff about seventy foot high found in channel quarter of mile wide trending south east for nearly mile then on left hand cliff towered up boldly in form of headland to about hundred foot in height while shore on right fell away forming sort of cove mile wide at widest point of grass covered soil sloped steeply down to water edge rising again in form of cliff a cove took bend away toward north east rocky cliff seemed to be composed of basalt with thick covering of rich deep red soil upon vegetation flourished luxuriantly breeze following trend of channel water in seemed deep enough to float battleship wafted gently forward headed boat for point where grass sloped down to water edge being only visible spot where landing be possible when have nearly reached inner end of cove became revealed saw about mile quarter farther on small strip of sandy beach offered ideal landing place sweeping boat head round steered for at point be now on left hand miniature estuary narrowed to stream scarcely wider than length of boat that be fresh water be beyond doubt for at far end of gorge saw water foaming steeply down in series of tiny cascade stretched away upward until reached more than halfway to peak formed highest point of island a crept slowly toward chosen landing place under impulse of sculling oar wind having by time failed began to get ever nearer glimpse of beauty of island rocky face of cliff on hand be splashed with colour from numerous small flowering shrub seemed to spring from invisible cleft in basalt while close down by water edge great clump of maidenhair other fern grew in extravagant luxuriance thing be observed a be subconsciously eye in boat being fixed intently upon little strip of beach toward be heading while longing to feel foot once more on terra firma grew more intense a minute slipped by have not remotest idea whether not island be inhabited though scarcely thought possible that paradise must be devoid of inhabitant if beach toward be heading have suddenly become black with hostile native be quite sure feeble a be must have fought desperately for right to land won that right perished in attempt native appeared however there be sign of life that must discern save few gaudily plumaged bird flitted hither thither sometimes sweeping right over boat a though curious to ascertain what new thing be that invaded solitude presently craft have be home for ten day seemed more like month to slid with thin grating sound on to sand stopped scarcely waiting to lay in oar scrambled out of cockpit reeled along deck dropped over overhanging bow on to hot sand held up arm to help others ashore first to come be mr vansittart who be followed by daughter two stewardess julius bringing up rear when at length be ashore mr vansittart said rather whispered for have lost voice before do anything else move step let go down on knee return thanks to almighty god for great mercy in bringing to delectable land did so then there with tear of deep sincere gratitude be by time about ten o'clock in morning yet so deep narrow be gorge in found that beach where stood be still in shadow air comparatively cool therefore after have taken care to secure boat to great boulder of basalt that lay conveniently at hand suggested that must remain where be while went prospecting for fruit to agreed then thought suddenly striking waded into water scooped up palmful tasted be deliciously sweet cool turned to rest said water be perfectly fresh may therefore drink of drink in moderation beg taking just mouthful at time few minute until thirst be quenched for if drink too freely after long abstinence effect may be harmful instead of restorative set example by taking small quantity only just washing out mouth with before starting upon quest how delicious taste of clean sweet water be to only who have gone nigh to perishing of thirst can ever know resolutely resisting almost overpowering temptation to drink freely quench thirst scorched like fire left water allowed gaze to wander over face of cliff towered eighty foot aloft from inner margin of beach soon saw steep a at first sight appeared to be there be so many flat fragment protruding from face that scaling of must be comparatively easy matter assuring companion must not be gone longer than must possibly help began ascent soon discovered that in undertaking to climb that cliff have be reckoning without host be to say have failed to take account of weakness before be halfway up felt must never reach top after arduous climb of twenty minute during experienced at least dozen narrow escape from pitching headlong to bottom flung over top edge lay gasping for breath on long sweet grass waved about what glorious prospect be that now revealed to enraptured eye on left front distant about mile rose higher of two knoll to have before referred while square away to right distant perhaps two mile towered bald peak be highest point in island ground in front of a lay rose somewhat steeply to kind of ridge seemed to run from one to other of two elevation have just mentioned whole of ground not clothed with grass be studded with great clump of splendid tree of be thickly starred with flower while here there be coconut palm with smooth curving trunk smaller tree might possibly be fruit bearing profusion of plantain banana among long pendulous green leaf of must distinguish even where lay great cluster of ripe yellow fruit sight of fruit be enough for be even more entrancing than glorious landscape unrolled to right left postponing contemplation of latter to more convenient season rose to foot staggered forward few minute later found gathering quantity of golden fruit even then allowing time to choose best ripest then with dozen more banana in hollow of arm returned to edge of cliff at point hundred yard so to north of where have made ascent at once saw that here cliff be of much more practicable character than where have ascended negotiating descent with very little difficulty soon have intense satisfaction not only of seeing of other member of party devouring banana with indescribable avidity also of eating one can safely say that never in life have so thoroughly enjoyed food a did that banana what be one banana to people who be on very brink of perishing from starvation only served to whet appetite for more must not however allow to have more just then be cruel to be kind resolutely turned deaf ear alike to entreaty reproach a did to craving of own ravenous hunger insisted that at least hour must elapse before ate again kept to word sooner have half hour expired than again fell to consumed banana after insisted on everybody taking hour rest did at end of hour felt so much better that be resolved to attempt ascent to plateau without further delay took longer easier route after toilsome climb occupied nearly hour reached goal woman folk be too utterly exhausted to do other than stretch out on grass feast eye upon glory of scene feeling that might now with safety venture upon light meal julius set off in search of what might find soon returned with three fine coconut stripped of outer husk with knife few minute later be feasting upon sweet delicate fruit after having shared milk among finally through careful judicious system of feeding by about four o'clock in afternoon have contrived to allay hunger thirst to recover enough strength to enable to move about accomplish short distance without undue fatigue next concern be to find sort of refuge in to pas coming night of course in last resort must be quite possible for to return to boat sleep on board a usual that idea have charm for under deck quarter be very confined altogether inadequate for accommodation of four woman moreover imagined that must be willing to put up with certain amount of discomfort if by doing so must secure greater measure of privacy than boat afforded therefore set off upon exploring expedition to see what must find be not going to be too particular at outset weather be fine temperature high enough to allow to sleep with comfort in open air there be heavy dew of tropical night to be considered feared might be productive of fever ague to people in debilitated condition immediate ambition therefore extended further than to find in suitable spot tree of thick enough foliage with widespreading branch near enough ground to afford good protection from dew beneath bed of dry fern something of sort might be arranged for night on morrow must see if must not contrive something more effective in shape of hut while ultimately if circumstance seemed to demand might seriously consider possibility of erecting simple form of house a to situation of sleeping quarter recognised must be for time being abode decided that ought to be a near a possible to water therefore began exploration by following course of cliff edge upward toward where stream came tumbling down ravine walk of about mile brought to point where ledge have be traversing terminated abruptly in face of cliff on left at point where cut across blocked narrow ledge where be standing there be irregularly shaped hole fissure about two foot wide by perhaps five foot high looked very much like mouth of cave determined to explore upon attempting to reach found impossible of access rocky face of cliff be so absolutely smooth so completely devoid of smallest projection that not even monkey must have reached looked around again time taking especial notice of more immediate surroundings if opening happened to be really mouth of cave must be made easily accessible ought to form ideal dwelling there be pure sweet water in abundance far exceeding utmost requirement spot be unapproachable except by way of narrow ledge along have come must therefore be easily defended in case of need cave if cave really be ought to be at least a dry roomy a house must possibly build how be to gain entrance there be one way must think of by mean of ladder determined to construct one forthwith set off upon return journey with intention of going to boat procuring axe from carpenter tool chest however by time rejoined others who seemed be beginning to feel anxiety a to what have become of sun be so low in heaven at once perceived impossibility of carrying out plan night therefore searched for soon found two suitable tree within easy hail of other under one of woman might sleep comfortably on soft bed of dry grass while julius took possession of other when have partaken of moderate meal of banana sun have set night be fast closing down upon therefore wended way to respective tree flung down upon grassy couch be soon wrapped in sweet oblivion of dreamless sleep following morning found awake with rising of sun felt amazingly refreshed by night sleep quite strong comparatively speaking saw that julius have awakened invited to go with have swimming lesson for boy must not swim stroke have decided be high time must learn so started off noting a went that woman folk seemed to be still asleep under own particular tree walked to cliff edge looked down upon beach boat be still there exactly a have left stripping to buff deposited clothes on boat deck entered water be of just right temperature to be refreshing while swam delightedly thither master julius who be extremely fastidious in matter of personal cleanliness carefully removed trace of grime have unavoidably accumulated during voyage from reef then swim ended did same after gave companion first swimming lesson boy showing such aptitude acquitting so well that when finally left water be actually able to swim stroke two unaided before dressing explored upper end of harbour where stream discharged into be fortunate enough to find spot at in about three to four foot of water woman must bathe with enjoyment absolute safety having dressed entered boat procured carpenter axe after ascended to top of cliff near there met mr vansittart daughter of whom declared greatly better for sound refreshing night rest be about to prospect for spot where might enjoy luxury that julius have just be indulging in so leaving boy to direct to place have discovered afterwards to gather banana for breakfast shouldered axe set off northward intent upon exploration of aperture in cliff believed might prove to be mouth of cave a went looked keenly about for sapling small tree might serve a ladder before long came upon exactly kind of thing wanted be young tree somewhat resembling yew about twenty foot high with number of branch springing from trunk close together radiating in direction lowest branch being about seven foot from ground tree at once attacked wood being soft while axe be keen fell ten minute later lopping off a much of upper part of trunk a considered too slim weak for purpose found that by cutting off lower part just below bottom branch must have nice straight pole about twelve foot long did afterward lopping off branch to within about six inch of trunk stump to serve a rung step there be ladder complete light enough to be easily handled hoisted on shoulder carrying axe in hand in case must need proceeded along ledge to extremity here reared ladder against cliff face found a have expected that be just of nice convenient length enabling to reach opening with utmost ease a have fully expected cleft proved to be mouth of cavern for a stood at top of ladder peered in saw that extended way back into cliff widening a went how far extended must not tell when eye became somewhat accustomed to gloom be able to trace passage for such seemed to be inward for distance of at least ten foot beyond be black darkness having seen thus much must not have be human have not desired to see more therefore climbed into opening with due precaution proceeded to investigate little farther floor of entrance if may so term be very awkwardly shaped resembling v so that in reality there be floor at properly speaking merely rough side of cleft meeting together at bottom little way in however about six eight foot from face of cliff side began to fall away from other leaving surface might be walked on without much difficulty told that if in other respect cavern proved suitable a dwelling awkward character of entrance might easily be rectified still making way carefully with watchful eye for possible snake have seen none thus far have not least idea whether not there be on island still be a well to be careful gradually worked inward until estimated be at least twenty foot from mouth here be obliged to bring exploration to temporary end for lack of light by careful pacing from side to side found that passage be at point eighteen foot wide with tolerably flat floor while height be such that must not reach with upstretched arm length must not tell seemed to extend considerably farther inward to determine just how far however must need torch therefore decided to return to rest of party report upon find bring back with after breakfast that might pas opinion upon possibility chapter eighteen war canoe breakfast that morning consisted of banana mango coconut of island seemed to produce in profusion a well doubt a many other fruit when must have time to seek for at present main concern be to establish in shelter of sort where must find complete protection in kind of weather expressed a eager to inspect cavern of have be telling to do effectually torch be needed mean to kindle latter be fortunately at hand in shape of large powerful magnifying lens with julius be fond of amusing habitually carried in pocket with regard to torch well doubtless dry branch must be found lying about under tree failing flambeau must be made of dry grass bound up into bundle decided that dry branch must best serve purpose accordingly julius plunged into nearest clump of timber in search of what required quickly returning with bundle a big a must conveniently carry bound together with long strip of monkey rope of there seemed to be inexhaustible quantity in wood be necessary to carry fire with since path must have to traverse to reach cave a well a cave lay in deep ravine into sun ray struck only for about three hour during course of day therefore collected little heap of dry grass leaf set fire to by concentrating sun ray upon through julius burning glass from ignited branch carried along with distance from temporary camp to cave be about mile quarter took nearly hour to cover for directly entered gorge there be frequent pause to admire splendid vista bend of path opened out in due time reached cavern entered when other torch be kindled so that member of party might be provided with light soon became apparent that cavern be spacious enough to accommodate very much larger party than ours be so extensive indeed that be obliged to defer complete exploration for lack of sufficient number of torch saw enough of to determine to enter upon occupation forthwith accordingly made way to beach where have left boat proceeded to transfer few belonging from to cavern belonging be not very many consisting in fact merely of empty water breaker arm ammunition carpenter chest few plank have found afloat in lagoon after sinking of wreck succeeded in effecting transfer of whole before sunset thus far have be much too busy to attempt anything in nature of exploration of entire island now that safe shelter have be found for party one capable of being very effectively defended too if necessity must arise felt be high time to make fully acquainted with new home capability a at least temporary abode be especially anxious to ascertain beyond question whether harboured other inhabitant than therefore on morning after have installed ourselves in cavern took rifle filled pocket with cartridge set out with intention of making complete circuit of island left julius in charge warned companion not to be anxious on account must not return by nightfall a meant to take time explore island thoroughly before returning starting from cavern immediately after breakfast proceeded southward descending to beach indulged in swim a preliminary then returning to top of cliff continued way southward until reached point overlooking harbour entrance from struck inland toward one of two inferior elevation previously mentioned base of mound be completely surrounded by tree intermingled with undergrowth so dense that be only with difficulty be enabled to force way through wished to reach top of mound if possible because appeared to be very suitable spot upon to build big flare for purpose of attracting attention of ship must such chance to heave in sight therefore persevered eventually came out at base of elevation be clear of tree then started to climb after hour arduous toil reached summit side being exceedingly steep consisting for most part of fine ash from suspected be climbing cone of extinct volcano suspicion be fully verified when arrived at top for found upon narrow platform roughly elliptical in shape dozen yard wide from gazed down into interior of crater two hundred foot deep side of be nearly vertical while bottom be apparently willow pool of stagnant water rim must serve admirably a site upon to build bonfire side be so steep soil so loose that foresaw must be difficult almost to point of impossibility to climb with load therefore decided to see whether peak near centre of island offered better facility before descending took good long look round horizon be not very greatly surprised to discover that there be le than seven separate distinct indication of land to northward nearest of judged must not be very far away walked round rim of crater to northern side made descent there en route for peak near centre of island having first fully satisfied that sea round be entirely bare of craft of description way now lay again through timber more le dense scrub beyond found small patch of open grass land then more timber now for inscrutable reason there be little scrub tree be more lofty wider apart intermingled with what may term timber tree be fair number bearing fruit among found several specimen of breadfruit abundance of mango guava custard star apple plantain banana few other variety thus there be assurance of ample supply of food so long a might be compelled to remain upon island be past noon when reached base of peak have sooner come to than perceived from ash scoria thickly strewed side that also be volcano yet be determined to climb to summit if possible if only for perfect panorama of entire island that knew must obtain from there so rested for little while utilising time by making good meal of fruit then addressed to task side of volcano be not nearly so steep a of other dust ash however be just a fine rendering task of climbing slope extremely difficult have learned wisdom by time instead of attempting ascent in straight line from base to summit described spiral round peak in way accomplished ascent in almost a short time a with far le fatigue than if have attempted to go up by shortest way conviction that peak also be vent of volcano be verified moment reached summit general aspect character of other being almost identical rim on now stood be however quite three hundred foot higher than first view from be consequently much more extensive in addition to seven indication of land seen from top of mound be now able to trace three more quite distinctly while in farthest distance thought must descry faint loom of still more land however be not for far away to northward so far a to be no more than just visible caught hint of faint pearly gleam on horizon felt certain must only be that of sun on ship white sail heart swelled with thankfulness for here be unmistakable assurance that craft of sort occasionally visited water having at length thoroughly searched entire circle of horizon turned gaze nearer home proceeded to view island whole of lay spread out beneath like large scale relief map scarcely know how to describe nearest thing to can compare shape of plan be ghoorka khookri heavy knife point directed northward edge facing west with widening of blade near junction with handle widening being broken into by little harbour at upper end of boat lay surface of island be very irregular be almost completely covered with tree of various kind interspersed with small patch of open grass land island rose sheer from sea everywhere except in one spot inside harbour where grass sloped down to water edge at spot on north western shore where for length of about mile land sloped seaward to strip of white beach source of rivulet discharged into sea appeared to be situated about three quarter of mile south of spot whereon stood from point be easy for eye to follow course past cavern down steep rocky course to harbour whole of ravine traversed lay open to gaze be now able to assure with full conviction that cavern must only be approached from one direction namely narrow ledge have traversed to reach island be to appearance uninhabited save by ourselves there be canoe on beach to north west sign of smoke indicating existence of village yet if not near harbour be where village must certainly be since be only place where men must possibly beach canoe idea of inhabitant of island without canoe be unthinkable nevertheless although felt convinced that party be only people on island determined to make exploration complete accordingly after long last lingering look round plunged down northern slope of cone pushed northward through forest arriving at most northern extremity of island dead tired about sunset camped in open night finding abundance of food wherewith to satisfy hunger water latter however be of trivial importance since fruit staved off excessive feeling of thirst tended to confirm conviction that there be native to be found in part of island on following morning followed western line of cliff until reached beach aforementioned when descended to most carefully examined whole surface in search of human footprint found not slightest trace of one on entire stretch of beach therefore perfectly satisfied at last that have whole island to ourselves course for home a already began mentally to name cavern reaching about mid afternoon found that during absence others have be busying in variety of way to make cavern comfortably habitable julius for instance have collected quantity of stone have so arranged at mouth of cavern that v shaped floor have be nicely levelled up made smooth so that be now possible to pas in out without risk of badly spraining one ankle while woman have collected enough dry fern to make comfortable bed for also interior of cavern have be more carefully systematically examined with result three separate distinct adjoining chamber have be found two of must serve admirably for sleeping apartment while third very lofty one have large hole in roof situated apparently in midst of clump of tree admitting sufficient light to make quite pleasantly habitable a general living working room of course be very well quite a must have be wise reasonable policy to make ourselves a comfortable a must during sojourn upon island how long be that sojourn to last be matter now uppermost in thought be to sit down wait patiently until something must come along take off be to take initiative while availing ourselves of hospitality of island contrive mean whereby failing other help might effect own rescue by making way to civilised spot from must be possible to return to respective home have be thinking good deal of late about poor mother in little house at newton ferrers be now over five month since stella mari have be cast away more than six since have last written home knew that by time dear soul must be fretting heart out with anxiety on account be therefore growing day more eager determined to find way of deliverance if only that maternal anxiety might be allayed what must do there be boat certainly after recent dreadful experience in knew that nothing must induce mr vansittart to undertake boat voyage have already said so with much emphasis others have echoed resolution indeed must not blame single experience of kind be quite enough for lifetime have possessed sail matter might have be different for despite queer model of craft have proved to be excellent sea boat quite a good indeed a boat of usual shape to be at sea in without sail be to be simply at mercy of wind wave racked brain to distraction in effort to evolve practicable plan for obtaining sail even going to length of endeavouring to weave one of grass be good for a soon a grass dried became so tender brittle that must never have borne pressure of even very moderate breeze much le gale about month later when after numerous experiment have found myself obliged to abandon hope in direction chance rather investigation in direction revived hope began to believe must see way be about two month from time when be driven out of wreck compelled to commit ourselves fortune to mercy of open sea by time clothing have become so dilapidated that necessity for something to replace be growing urgent therefore while busied daily upon task of conveying combustible material to summit of peak a have named highest point on island that might be able to kindle fire raise big smoke in event of sail heaving in sight while julius undertook to find daily supply of food for party woman explored island in search of material might be converted into clothing by merest accident at length found what believed might serve be inner bark of certain tree consisted of long white thread filament after being steeped in water for time must be separated from other proved to be so exceedingly tough that be able to make excellent fishing line of so secure most welcome addition to daily diet thread be rather coarse believed that might be worked up into kind of sheeting while perhaps rather stiff uncomfortable when fashioned into garment must make very good sail devoted moment of spare time to gathering preparation of stuff idea being that after have made suit of sail for boat if others still refused to undertake second boat voyage might agree to going away alone in search of help about month later when four woman be busily laboriously engaged upon tedious task of weaving by hand stock of thread into coarse tough cloth dramatic interruption of labour occurred for mercy of god might have have most tragic ending have by time accumulated upon top of peak sufficient quantity of material to make blaze smoke that might be seen in clear weather at least thirty mile away have therefore ceased to devote whole time to adding to pile employing instead in industriously collecting thread like bark out of be making cloth nevertheless be habit of mine to wend way to summit morning immediately after breakfast in order to take good look round on chance of sail being in sight repeated excursion daily after midday meal collecting load of combustible on way carrying up with in order that in case journey might not be quite useless be during afternoon journey on day in question that having reached summit of peak sent long searching fruitless look round horizon turned to descend by short cut frequent passage down have beaten in loose friable soil when be arrested in very act of plunging down slope blood turned to ice by sight of great war canoe crowded with native just emerging from under cover of western cliff heading southward a though bound for little harbour a still stood gaping at scarcely able to credit evidence of eye followed making four in manned by forty fifty native have be creeping along so close inshore at first have be invisible to hidden by high cliff curve of shore line have caused to head out little farther to westward so brought within range of vision suddenly became aware of sign of commotion in leading canoe there be cessation of paddling arm be uplifted flourished next moment realised with horror that figure standing out clear clean cut against pure azure of sky have be detected native be pointing directing other attention to indeed almost believed must catch above soft sough of wind faint sound of voice shouting to other a pointed then gesticulating suddenly ceased paddle be resumed churning water into foam with energy thrown into stroke canoe raced forward at fully double original speed waiting to see more plunged recklessly down slope running sliding stumbling once rolling headlong in frantic haste to get back to cavern felt assured that original purpose might have be savage must now most assuredly land if only to hunt for secure head a trophy must be race between a to who must reach cavern first moreover there be horrid possibility that of woman julius might be abroad fall into hand in case god help chapter nineteen rescue never in life think have run so fast a did that afternoon while covering mile half of ground that lay between base of peak nearest point at must overlook harbour be imperative must reach point before returning to cavern since might very easily happen that julius have launched boat be in mid harbour fishing a have be wont to do of late if so must be saved at cost have rifle with pocketful of cartridge having become habit with to carry went abroad believed at pinch might be able by good shooting to hold savage off long enough to enable boy to land make good escape luckily when arrived at point for be aiming first object to catch eye be boat empty moored in usual place beach be entirely bare from end to end scarcely have satisfied myself of when sharp nose of leading canoe shot into view past point where narrow entrance widened out harbour proper began before have time to withdraw from edge of cliff yell of delight conveyed to unpleasant news have again be seen have however by time got wind again after long run so keeping far enough back from edge of cliff to ensure invisibility from below started at long swinging trot for cavern be fortunate enough to run into julius loaded with big bunch of banana just at point where narrow ledge leading to cavern began be on way back from stroll happening to sight particularly attractive bunch of fruit have determined to take home with be practically safe now since anywhere along narrow ledge way to cavern single person armed with rifle must defend hold road so long a supply of ammunition lasted therefore slowed pace to walk taking banana from boy handing rifle cartridge to in return rapidly explained situation to bade play part of rearguard while carried fruit weight of be almost too great for felt tolerably certain that must reach cavern before being overtaken a did be everybody at home shouted a having climbed into cave after julius drawn up ladder behind to prevent unauthorised use made way toward inner apartment used a living room yes came reply in mr vansittart voice everybody be to say julius be here with cut in a entered room saw four of woman diligently engaged upon tedious task of weaving cloth met at beginning of path brought home with also fine bunch of banana good fairy prompted to cut must use carefully for with what else may have in cavern may have to last for several day why what do mean walter demanded mr vansittart in tone of alarm while others paused in work to listen mean that four big war canoe loaded with savage have just entered harbour chance be that may have to stand siege cut in julius who have followed in hillo exclaimed in surprise here will never do just trot back to mouth of cavern keeping enough in darkness to avoid being seen from outside keep look out while explain thing to mother then will come relieve if see anything of savage give low whistle will join cut now keep eye skinned how be off for water mr vansittart oh know think have breaker about full replied lady will do will be ample for until to night said then must slip out in darkness endeavour to fill then proceeded to relate at length have seen kept fear to myself merely impressing upon little audience necessity for staying well within cavern out of sight did not attempt to conceal that quite expected savage must subject entire island to thorough search might possibly extend over three four day expressed opinion that if must remain completely hidden during time must depart rather than waste further time in hunting for one man for of course have seen only must not possibly know have companion oh be awful exclaimed mr vansittart when have finished just think of what might have happened if have not come when did anthea be beginning to feel tired bit headachy with sitting so long over horrid weaving so be lizette susie be talking about going out for good long walk just a came in why might have be captured carried off mere contemplation of such fate with that implied be too much for poor lady reduced to speechlessness be right assented lucky turned up in time to prevent a be be afraid that must regard boat a lost to beggar will be sure to see indeed can not avoid doing so if take with when go will almost certainly destroy out of pure spite sufficient unto day be evil thereof must keep spirit up powder dry speaking of powder reminds that will only be reasonable precaution to open few box of cartridge load rifle by jove be happy inspiration prompted to put into boat even then have suspicion that might be useful day got out weapon loaded filled pocket with cartridge carried loaded rifle to outer cavern where must be handy then joined julius whom found lying prone rifle in hand maintaining careful watch on ledge so far a knew be only possible approach to cavern boy informed that thus far have seen nothing of savage at piece of information scarcely knew whether to be glad sorry be of course just barely possible that enemy having first seen on summit of peak might come to conclusion that lair be somewhere in direction hunt round about there for on other hand have be told that pacific islander taking a whole be by mean unintelligent must naturally think upon finding boat must make habitat a near a possible accordingly proceed to hunt for sign of in immediate neighbourhood besides have last seen on cliff top if be at expert at tracking must be able to pick up spoor without much difficulty thing most greatly feared be that suspecting to be lurking in neighbourhood few of have gone into ambush at great distance hoping must ultimately show while rest be scouring island julius maintained watch until nightfall then a soon a be a dark a be likely to be that night made arrangement for replenishing stock of fresh water julius be to mount guard in mouth of cavern with rifle keeping sharp look out along ledge be just visible enough in starlight to permit of boy being able to detect approach of enemy if saw anyone coming be to give warning shoot if necessary to cover retreat for part be to take only bucket fill with water pas up to susie who be to receive in mouth of cavern carry to breaker empty into latter until be full be not long job for breaker be only of small capacity accomplished in le than ten minute without interruption of kind winding up by taking full bucket into cavern a supplementary supply then drawing up ladder after cavern be now provisioned watered for at least four day must endure for length of time without much difficulty hardship after ventured to hope anxiety respecting savage must be at end relieved julius a guard sent to inner cavern to get food few hour sleep prior to relieving in turn fondly believed that existence of cavern be unknown that have be fortunate enough to replenish stock of water unobserved afterward have reason to suspect contrary maintained keen watch at mouth of cavern until about midnight estimate of time being based upon position posture of southern cross in sky constellation being visible from mouth of cavern when mr vansittart came stealing out to with whispered enquiry a to whether be not tired enough to require relief a matter of fact be did not hesitate to say so since night be quiet have seen nothing of suspicious character julius have have good long rest lady retired presently julius came along gaping yawning stretched out beside remained with conversing in low whisper for about ten minute until be satisfied that be broad awake then with final word of caution left retreated to own couch where soon fell asleep have be asleep about hour when be startled into instant wakefulness by sound of five rifle shot fired in quick succession rushing to mouth of cavern found julius in high state of excitement seizing arm a came beside exclaimed see that walter looking in direction toward lad pointed be able to descry just dimly motionless something lying in pathway about ten yard from mouth of cavern while something else still more dimly visible recognisable a little crowd of men appeared about twice a far away evidently in somewhat hasty retreat believe hit continued julius teeth chattering with excitement a fidgeted with rifle hit interrupted must think there be very little doubt about that man appears to be dead a word left lip be joined by woman folk who awakened by rifle shot came in body to where stood clamouring to know what be matter let tell just what happened interposed boy be lying down here watching path with rifle beside a have be doing ever since walter left everything be quite quiet have not seen thing heard sound be beginning to feel bit sleepy so stood up moved about bit to keep awake since walter have told be of utmost importance that good look out must be kept just walked across across mouth of cavern three step way three watching path time about ten minute ago thereabout thought saw sort of shadow darkness have not noticed before out there at far end of path stood still watched presently be sure that there be something moving coming nearer so grabbed rifle lay down waiting with remington pointing straight at nearer nearer came until at last be certain that what saw be two savage carrying something on shoulder with other savage behind waited until be so close that felt must miss then let drive five shot one after other right into thick of 'em savage lyin there flung up arm keeled over while other chap seemed to stagger bit thought heard something fall sounded a if 'd dropped pole then whole crowd turned scooted be pretty sure that hit chap a well a one lyin ' out there excellent exclaimed have done splendidly julius saved from very ugly surprise now lady danger be over for present therefore may retire finish sleep in peace a for julius will get out ladder while watch with rifle will slip out roll fellow over edge into torrent want lying there so said so done lowered ladder climbed down to pathway with loaded revolver in hand a precautionary measure for during cruise among island have heard one two rather gruesome story of craftiness ferocity of certain savage while out on warpath in present instance precaution be needle prostrate savage be quite dead pushed over edge of pathway into torrent roared over precipitous rocky bed thirty foot below whence body must doubtless be swept along until reached harbour then found thing that have be carrying put safely inside cavern be trunk of young tree trimmed in similar fashion to own ladder from circumstance inferred that lurking somewhere unseen possibly among bush on other side of ravine of savage must not only have seen replenishing water supply also have noted character of contrivance used for gaining access to interior of cavern copied toward afternoon of next day proposed must set out upon reconnoitring expedition leaving julius on guard intention being to go along ledge to point from must obtain view of beach so ascertain whether canoe be still there others must not hear of denounced project a unnecessary dangerous when found that argument scarcely sufficed to dissuade mr vansittart flatly refused consent asserting that if mishap must befall julius alone must be utterly unable to protect rest of must inevitably fall into hand of savage to must find effective reply for there be just enough truth in to be almost convincing so agreed to defer expedition until at least following day there be discussion among remember a to where savage have come from why have called at island a to former be impossible to say while own opinion be that visit to island be for purpose of replenishing supply of food water night next through intervening day kept rigorous watch ward while supply of food water dwindled until be almost a badly off a during last day in boat further attempt to replenish stock of water made in desperation during night of fourth day of investment showed that enemy be not only still present a watchful pertinacious a ever that night rather in early hour of following morning came climax when wily foe made last desperate attempt to rush defence overpower by force of number have taken first night watch from six until ten julius middle watch from ten until two o'clock in morning when relieved have informed that have seen heard anything of disquieting nature during watch have left about ten minute thereabout when a lay prone near entrance of cavern with gaze intently fixed upon path outside slight rustling sound came to ear must not at first locate so crept closer closer still to opening until head be actually protruding beyond portal a glanced cautiously about keenly alert to draw back at first swish of spear felt something presently identified a fine dust dropping lightly upon neck head drew head back instantly suspecting ruse waited next thing of became aware be slight crackling sound followed by faint flicker of light rapidly grew stronger a watched came from somewhere immediately above cavern entrance few second later down came immense bundle of blazing brushwood hung suspended immediately in front of upper part of opening brilliantly illuminating place where lay next instant thirty more spear dart came flying across ravine into entrance impinging sharply upon rocky side of cavern to right then falling to ground with rattle quickly brought julius to side gasped with astonishment a saw blazing bundle spear dart lying upon floor of cavern be time for explanation for pad of many running foot at great distance drawing rapidly nearer recognised that determined attack be about to be made upon blazing brushwood served double purpose of brilliantly illuminating mouth of cavern dazzling eye pretty effectually preventing seeing what be happening outside so drew julius into shelter of projection behind have already ensconsed whispered rifle quick then get back to inner cave warn woman not to come out on account bring out whole stock of cartridge promise to be serious projecting ledge of rock behind have sheltered chanced to be most conveniently placed shaped for defence of cavern entrance be broad enough to afford two three more complete shelter while there be nick in outer edge of just right height size to serve a rest for rifle barrel standing comfortably behind placed barrel of repeater in nick levelled at spot where expected first of foe to appear calmly waited have not long to wait julius have just rejoined with pocket stuffed full of cartridge have murmured momma others be right promised not to come out shoot will reload when fast increasing sound of padding foot suddenly ceased just outside cavern entrance heard few guttural word spoken sounded like muttered order then came light thud of ladder like pole placed in position saw upper extremity distinctly in light of fire overhead sighted rifle directly upon ready to deflect muzzle to right left on instant a might be necessary a pole dropped lightly into position shrill whistle sounded on instant perfect storm of spear dart stone came whirring into cavern of splintering on side major portion falling far in beyond causing to pray fervently that woman must have sense to keep well under cover next instant hideously decorated head of savage rose into view a ascended ladder before have risen foot rifle cracked whirled backward into blackness without cry have bare time to eject spent shell jerk cartridge into place when second head appeared only to be disposed of in same fashion be followed by third neatly plugged between eye while be happening shower of spear dart stone two latter in particular continued unabated with extinction of third man there came pause of took advantage to exchange partially emptied remington for while julius attended to reloading pause be not long one presently saw top of pole moving again in moment fourth head appeared savage however be clever one be not going to be shot through head if must help for when cranium rose into view be being rapidly jerked from side to side so waited until body appeared then plugged through lung so attack continued enemy displaying most dogged indomitable determination a well a most extraordinary disconcerting cunning maintaining incessant fire of dart stone seemed to be saving remainder of spear while a fast a blazing faggot burned out be replaced by others evidently attack have be carefully thought out most elaborate preparation made for then at moment when be beginning to ask seriously how much longer thing be going to last party must be able to hold out longest most dramatic interruption came nothing le than boom of heavy gun from close in under cliff not far from harbour mouth moment later perceived through flickering light of blazing faggot white glare of searchlight focusing upon path outside there be yell of dismay from attacking force loud shout then quick thud of swiftly retreating foot a savage broke fled before must possibly have reached end of path gun spoke report being immediately followed by explosion accompanied by terrible outburst of yell shriek amid believed heard sharp patter of shrapnel on face of cliff while other yell arose from party who have be attending to business of keeping up supply of burning faggot above opening of cavern be saved by extraordinary combination of circumstance ship ship of war at have come upon scene at very crisis of fortune attracted possibly by light of blazing faggot have approached near enough to hear sound of rifle fire doubtless greatly intensified by reverberation of cavern probably guessing pretty shrewdly at what meant have intervened in very nick of time hurrah shouted ship ship savage have fled go tell mother others julius will keep look out here there be need for julius to play part of messenger for report of gun followed by jubilant exclamation brought others forth with rush from innermost recess of cavern eager to know just exactly what have happened rest of story can soon be told to mr julius vansittart absorbed in conduct management of mammoth engineering business thought one morning occurred that considerable time have elapsed since have last received news of wife family that letter from must be about due on referring to last letter received noting date of arrival instantly perceived that letter be not only due considerably overdue knowing how regular methodical wife be in matter of correspondence did not take very long to arrive at conclusion that something must have gone wrong with yacht conclusion once arrived at got move on humped a expressed consequence be that vansittart being man of powerful influence be not long before admiral in command of squadron stationed in pacific received communication from washington acquainting with most recent contemplated future movement of stella mari a furnished by mr vansittart coupled with information that be overdue instruction to dispatch vessel in search of missing yacht result of be dramatic arrival of gunboat jefferson off island at psychological moment appeared that have already be engaged for nearly month in systematic search for yacht during have picked up le than three of bottle have dispatched from reef containing appeal for help have accordingly visited scene of disaster only to discover sunken wreck of yacht in lagoon surmising rather hoping that might somehow have contrived to effect escape commander of jefferson after careful study of prevailing wind current in water have mapped out definite plan in pursuance of after unsuccessful call at number of other island have headed for one upon have found shelter have be sighted just before dark jefferson have headed for at speed intending to lay to in offing upon arrival send boat ashore in morning when still ten mile off land light light of savage blazing faggot have be seen regarding a possible signal command for full speed ahead have be rung down to engine room when jefferson arrived close under cliff searchlight have be turned on fact that fight of sort be in progress have become evident making shrewd guess at actual state of affair jefferson have taken hand with result already recorded by aid of searchlight sounding lead gunboat then cautiously groped way into harbour came to anchor about mile from beach upon lay four big war canoe apology for boat sight of not only suggested to astute commander at last have got upon track also confirmed surmise a to state of affair ashore sooner be anchor down than dispatched heavily armed boat officer of be instructed to make way instantly to cave investigate meeting be for party joyous one a savage have be seen by landing party have evidently fled into wood lost time in making way to beach taking rifle ammunition with from beach to jefferson where be cordially welcomed highly complimented upon vigorous defence of cavern have put up to infinite satisfaction found that acting upon instruction commander of gunboat have brought with well selected wardrobe for of on off chance of search proving successful article being needed consequently when few hour later sat down to breakfast in commander private cabin scarcely recognised other clad a now be once more in garb of civilisation in place of discarded rag war canoe boat be burnt where lay on beach thus leaving savage prisoner on island done got under way for manila where arrived nine day later from manila cable message be dispatched to mr vansittart immediately upon arrival informing of safety on following day reply came from expressing delight at news together with cabled credit on bank for fund amply sufficient to convey entire party to new york where via yokohama san francisco eventually arrived safely by freak of coincidence two year to day from date of departure from london
