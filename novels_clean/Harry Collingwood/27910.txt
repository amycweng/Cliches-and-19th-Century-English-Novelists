received sympathy that aching heart craved for sir robert reached home that night only just in time to dress for dinner so there be therefore neither time opportunity for discussion of affair until meal be over have adjourned to drawing room then while be sipping coffee host turned to said have be thinking good deal about to day between while swinburne at last think have discovered way to help by lucky chance happens that viscount hayashi japanese minister to great britain know with whom have be brought into very close touch of late be dining here en famille to morrow night in order to have

read character from face really said that be indeed terrible misfortune must scarcely have thought must possibly happen in such service a yours where have always understood such matter be inquired into with most scrupulous fairness so be excellency replied expulsion be not in sense due to remissness on part of officer who tried be due to fact that for reason named by lady gordon deliberately refrained from producing evidence must have resulted in own acquittal conviction of actual culprit thus member of court martial be in course of duty compelled to find guilty to pas upon sentence of dismissal see yes think understand observed viscount feeling of gratitude must induce to take extreme step of ruining entire career must have be wonderfully strong find incident remarkably interesting

night glance round saloon table showed that at least seventy five per cent of passenger be japanese while of remainder half perhaps be english rest being composed in pretty nearly equal proportion of french german somewhat to surprise russian last however eventually transpired have booked only a far a hong kong from whence be probable that intended to proceed to port arthur although said nothing to effect passed through strait of bonifacio messina in due course arrived at port said without incident except thanks to nakamura soon became upon friendly even intimate term with japanese passenger in saloon a well a ship officer there be one old gentleman in particular rejoicing in name of matsudaira hashimoto ex professor of language at imperial college of tokio who happening to hear be anxious to utilise large amount of time occupied by voyage in acquiring a much knowledge a possible of japanese language at once came forward with offer to gratuitously teach in order that a remarked might be equipped with working knowledge of language upon arrival so be in position to immediately render service valuable old gentleman appeared have be remarkably successful in day a teacher of language working upon system have invented luckily for system be so excellent that working with for five hour daily actually succeeded in redeeming promise so thoroughly that when at length reached yokohama be able to manage quite fairly well without service of interpreter by way be part of skipper plan to replenish bunker at port said operation involving detention of three hour therefore went ashore posted letter to friend gordons attaching to number of stamp of different denomination for benefit of ronald who be enthusiastic collector then roved about town finding nothing to interest soon returned to ship found enveloped in cloud of coal dust be playing havoc with fresh white paint despite canvas screen spread to protect got under way again shortly after three o'clock afternoon two of passenger russian who looked very much like military men in mufti cutting thing so fine that be actually compelled to follow after in steam launch when at length overtook scrambled aboard went at once to cabin shared skipper with whom nakamura have become very chummy caught eye signed to to come up to cabin on bridge ship then being in charge of canal pilot with chief officer standing beside on navigating bridge accordingly sauntered up in nonchalant sort of way a though intent upon watching progress of ship through canal for there have be something of furtiveness in skipper action seemed to hint that did not wish sign to be observed by others led at least to imagine that there might be something in wind so apparently there be for when have entered cabin skipper softly closed door drew curtain across two after port a though desirous of concealing fact of presence in cabin then having produced whisky soda box of cigar seated on sofa facing said in english saw two russian come aboard just now after nearly losing passage when nodded affirmation continued be wondering whether circumstance mean trouble for for reason when be ashore about hour ago have business that took into mcintosh store now mcintosh be very good fellow whom have known for time be very friendly to japanese have knife a english term into russian well after chatting together for little while took into inner room informed that there be steamer flying russian naval ensign russian destroyer lurking near southern extremity of red sea seem disposed to give trouble to japanese merchant craft appears that only last week one other of mcintosh be not sure stopped boarded mishima maru insisted upon examining paper inspecting passenger for what reason mcintosh must not say a have merely heard bare fact of case about quarter of hour later shortly after have left mcintosh place saw two russian who nearly missed enter telegraph office began to smell mischief of course may only be imagination remembering what mcintosh have told wondered whether by chance be wiring to dgiboutil news of arrival warning friend to be on lookout for why wire to dgiboutil demanded because replied kusumoto dgiboutil belongs to french who be strongly pro russian craft must have sort of headquarters at may receive news instruction where can replenish bunker storeroom know of place so likely for a dgiboutil see said yes be most probably right so far why on earth must fellow interfere with japanese ship by what right do claim to do two country be not yet at war may be case within next few month be true agreed skipper mouth of red sea be long way from japan have warship anywhere near there to protect russian be by nature very high handed people not too scrupulous when dealing with prospective enemy perhaps think that before japan must make effective protest may be at war have other thing than pin prick to occupy attention very true assented may be so must like to know upon what pretext presume to molest interfere with japanese ship such action be contrary to international law in fact be closely akin to piracy if indeed be not piracy pure simple now suppose fellow attempt to interfere with do propose to do ah ejaculated kusumoto be exceedingly difficult question to answer want to come aboard if can be helped for to let into secret cargo consists of munition of war of various kind if russian must discover fact a must if board force to show paper may be unscrupulous enough to play trick upon jeopardising cargo possibly detaining in way until war be actually declared then confiscating ship cargo must think matter over try to hit upon plan of besting ' a english say perhaps two gentleman will also give thought be only mercantile shipmaster have have experience in matter of sort to guide be military men out of knowledge may be able to suggest something helpful to of course nothing may happen may not fall in with russian at will be so much better if must encounter must attempt to interfere with want to be prepared continued to discus matter for time longer be not necessary to repeat more of what be said sufficient having be already recorded to indicate nature of trouble be possibly waiting for engine be only stopped long enough at suez to enable to land pilot big searchlight have shipped at port said to help through canal done steamed on into gulf of suez red sea passage down red sea be quite uneventful until hanish island hove in sight over port bow uneventful be to say with one exception only be exception seemed to cause two russian passenger much perturbation of spirit for chat nakamura have have with skipper shortly after leaving port said have be succeeded by on following day outcome of be that kusumoto with full approval of friend nakamura have resolved to take very serious step of broaching cargo with result when passenger came up on deck on morning found off shadwan island be amazed to discover two pounder hotchkisses mounted one on forecastle head other right aft over taffrail while maxim graced extremity of navigating bridge circumstance with reason seemed to make such step necessary desirable be recorded at length in matsuma maru official log signed by skipper countersigned at request by nakamura a accessory so to speak be about three o'clock in afternoon when hanish island hove up above horizon at moment a happened nakamura be in captain cabin where indeed have spent most of time of late when be not in bunk hanish island be roughly speaking within about one hundred mile of strait of bab el mandeb a have not be interfered with thus far have practically made up mind that if russian intended to molest at must be here back of island affording excellent place of concealment from to dash out upon passing ship be disappointed in expectation for when have brought northernmost island square abeam long black four funnelled destroyer suddenly slid out past southern extremity heading west so a to intercept looking at through glass saw that be flying international code signal heave to wish to speak so be time for to be making move nakamura said quite understand line be to take with fellow skipper good then

engine be still running at full speed safety valve be lifting allowing feather of steam to show at head of waste pipe while quartermaster grimly kept stem pointed fair square between second third funnel of russian then skipper kusumoto raised megaphone hailed destroyer in russian with destroyer ahoy why be lying athwart hawse do wish to run down there be two officer on destroyer bridge one of whom sprang to engine room telegraph thrust over to full speed ahead while other seized megaphone hailed back stop engine instantly sir did not understand signal wished to speak starboard helm confounded fool hard starboard will be over then get out of way retorted kusumoto starboard little to quartermaster just shave stern will teach to lay tin kettle athwart japanese ship bow destroyer leaped from under bow like frightened thing though not so quickly that caught quarter with rounding of bow gave pretty severe shaking up skipper shook fist at stamped on bridge with fury then raised megaphone again hailed infernal scoundrel will make suffer for outrage heave to at once will fire into boat be sweeping round on starboard helm be now running practically parallel to at distance of about hundred foot will fire into if stop say be russia at war with country then hailed kusumoto there be silence for minute two aboard destroyer during two officer on bridge consulted eagerly together must see that engine room telegraph stood at full speed yet strange to say be only just holding own with then commander of again raised megaphone instruction be that be to examine paper of foreign vessel passing down red sea shouted must insist that heave to let board will hing of kind retorted skipper admit right to board so try if dare believe be nothing le than pirate masquerading a russian ship of war will treat accordingly if sheer off defiance be more than enough for proud choleric russian accustomed to have order servilely obeyed such unparalleled insolence from little yellow skinned monkey a russian have already begun to dub japanese in presence of own crew too be unendurable must be severely punished called order russian seaman who have be standing about deck listening half amused half indignant to altercation made move in direction of destroyer pounder port torpedo deck tube skipper have be expecting keenly on watch for move now hailed again destroyer ahoy keep away from tube gun men if see man attempt to approach either will sweep deck with maxim fire do hear what say a dozen men continued to slouch toward tube open fire there starboard maxim nakamura be at gun mentioned be keeping steadily trained upon tube at word fired single shot bullet spattered into star a struck mounting russian halted a if turned to stone glanced anxiously at commander kusumoto raised megaphone hailed be that enough will have more now sheer off at once if please if will fire again next shot with hotchkiss gun will be at waterline boiler russian commander be by time literally foaming at mouth seemed speechless beside with rage there be knowing what outcome might have be have not second in command here intervened forcibly seizing by arm shook violently a said something be too far off to hear meanwhile ever since firing of shot helmsman of destroyer have be quietly edging away from presently at sign apparently from junior officer put helm hard over to port venomous looking craft swung sharply upon heel listing heavily a did so few second later be speeding away in opposite direction to ourselves even now have not quite done with for almost immediately swung round to cross stern moment later saw silvery flash of torpedo a left tube kusumoto however be not to be caught unawares apparently more than half suspected something of kind be on watch for instant watched bubble marked course of missile then shouted order to helmsman matsuma maru swerved from course torpedo sped harmlessly past hundred yard to port too have quite expected that fiery russian must not allow to go scot free if must help therefore moment that destroyer swerved away from sprang off forecastle ran aft to other hotchkiss reached too late to prevent discharge of torpedo saw men clustering about pounder a though about to bring into action a be more afraid of gun than of torpedo unhesitatingly opened fire upon at fifth shot have pleasure of dismounting be enough for russian realised at last that have caught tartar bore away for lurking place behind hanish island where eventually lost sight of a soon a destroyer have disappeared kusumoto retired to cabin wrote lengthy account of affair in official log book getting nakamura to sign a before in testimony of veracity did in order to justify for broaching cargo temporarily mounting hotchkiss maxim gun may be said here that not only be justification accepted conduct be highly commended by authority about four bell in first watch night passed through strait shifted helm for cape guardafui not calling at aden since

boat with fujisan always dominating everything else be novelty to railway doe not run right into city of tokio have terminus at village of shimbashi on outskirt here therefore left train engaging

imminent preparation for struggle be being breathlessly pushed forward day night of evacuation of manchuria by russia must have be completed on th of preceding october there be still sign on contrary everything pointed to determination on part of russia to make occupation permanent action be said speak louder than word while diplomat on side be still engaged in apparent endeavour to settle matter amicably action of on russian side be characterised by systematic procrastination delay admitted of one interpretation namely that russia have intention to quit manchuria until be compelled to do so by force being state of affair interpreted baron yamamoto order literally leaving tokio by first available train took back to yokohama where only quitted because found must proceed farther until nine o'clock night at hour then made fresh start not to dwell unduly upon part of story reached sasebo late in evening of th january having be delayed upon road owing to congestion of traffic caused by war preparation sasebo be very hive of activity to extent indeed have greatest difficulty in finding quarter hotel be packed to utmost limit indeed know how must eventually have fared have not luckily encountered unmistakable briton whom halted to whom confided plight asking if must direct to place where must find accommodation for night turned out to be scotsman named boyd in business at sasebo

here there with grey though be little difficult to correctly estimate age of japanese set down at about fifty subsequently learned be not far out like baron yamamoto admiral asked quite number of question at length when found that have qualified for gunnery torpedo navigating duty have seen service in destroyer said seem to have exceptionally good record for young man of year mr swinburne so good indeed that feel disposed to avail to utmost possible extent of service foresee that in coming war destroyer be destined to play most important part while anticipate that service that class of craft will be called upon to perform will be of most arduous description of course exceedingly dangerous will also afford officer exceptional opportunity to distinguish now happens have one destroyer kasanumi one of best boat for thus far have be unable to find suitable commander arrival come therefore at most opportune moment for perusal of record convinces that be very man for whom have be looking rather flatter that be good judge of character believe that will do a much credit to ship a will to now what do say will command of destroyer be satisfactory to indeed will sir replied more than satisfactory have not dared to hope for such big slice of good fortune know not how to adequately express thanks for confidence be reposing in nay answered togo there be need for thanks at least in word can best show appreciation by deed for promise will be afforded abundant opportunity now if be anything like what take to be will be anxiety to see ship be not so very well will find in small graving dock where be being scraped repainted go down have good look at inside out if can offer suggestion for improvement on board will give best consideration do know way to dock if not will find somebody to act a guide for be very much obliged sir replied must prefer to find own way if please have be studying japanese during passage out be anxious to make most of opportunity to increase knowledge of language good exclaimed togo in japanese believe will do very well do understand that added in english yes sir replied in japanese be much obliged for good opinion speech be bit halting pronunciation by mean perfect be evidently intelligible for whole party applauded shouted word of encouragement of understood while others puzzled then a turned to leave room admiral said when have have good look at ship mr swinburne come to aboard mikasa where will be morning found dock without difficulty in smaller graving dock lay kasanumi first command seen thus out of water looked craft of quite important dimension a indeed be being more than two hundred foot in length have four funnel space between second third being only about between number one two three four have beautiful line

torpedo tube firing whitehead of effective range of eight hundred yard at speed of thirty knot carrying charge of one hundred seventy one pound of gun cotton enough to destroy battleship if happened to hit right spot dock foreman who happened to be englishman told that be british built thorneycroft boat believed that on trial have steamed a much a thirty three knot here be craft reasonable man might be proud to command there then registered vow that must not be fault if did not make name for herself during coming war be painted white with lead colour bottom four funnel be white with black

pot of paint white black blue with three compounded smoky grey tint of medium depth believed must be practically invisible by day quite invisible at night tint applied to small piece of board requested foreman to take care of for then went aboard have look at kasanumi interior arrangement engine boiler room torpedo room magazine naturally absorbed large proportion of interior space accommodation for officer crew though trifle cramped be sufficient to ensure quite reasonable amount of comfort everything of course be done to economise space fitting be quite plain cabin must be

boat ahead astern also be so piercingly cold that even long lamb wool coat with have taken precaution to provide seemed utterly inadequate fortunately excitement joy of finding not only once more under pennant actually in command with war before in felt convinced must have ample opportunity to prove mettle helped to keep warm there be pride too pride in ship pride in crew for there be not

when about seven o'clock evening negotiation of passage between island have be successfully accomplished found fairly out at sea shifted helm to pas to northward of quelpart island soon found that be in for regular dusting for presently ran into high steep sea shift of helm brought almost square abeam yet just enough on starboard quarter to set rolling squirming most atrociously particularly mosquito division roll whether to port starboard sent gunwale under so that be only with utmost difficulty managed to retain footing while more than half complement on deck a well a below suffered

cruiser asama to chase in south western board in little more than hour afterward rejoined fleet accompanied by russian steamer argun a prize flattered that honour of capturing first prize of war have fallen to later on learned to disgust that when argun be taken into sasebo there be already three more prize there to keep company arrived off mokpo about ten o'clock morning when akashi came out to meet make report of rank file so to speak did not of course know at time be nature of report be for admiral ear alone later on leaked out that be to effect that russian fleet at port arthur have begun to move on last day of january by warping towing certain of ship out of harbour movement have continued on first second day of february by end of time entire fleet be anchored in roadstead seemed pretty evident that admiral alexieff be preparing to vigorously carry war into enemy country be great fear have be haunting togo from moment when received instruction to put to sea dread be that russian fleet must forestall by getting to sea first steam to southward getting into touch with one more of craft be certain to be watching japanese fleet must lie perdu until fleet have passed to northward then fall upon ravage unprotected japanese coast at first sight seemed to be russian admiral intention for on th of february fleet having coaled weighed steamed out to sea leaving only two battleship sevastopol peresviet in harbour where have perversely stuck on mud refused to be got afloat again for moment at least russian twenty six ship strong inclusive of eleven destroyer having cleared roadstead steamed slowly to eastward be same day sighted in offing from wei hai wei apparently practising evolution on following day returned to port arthur anchored in roadstead under gun of battery pith of akashi report therefore be that there be two russian ship new cruiser variag gunboat korietz at chemulpo four cruiser armed merchantman at vladivostock while remainder of russian fleet be at port arthur possessed of knowledge togo issued order to rear admiral uriu in takachiho to take command of squadron consisting of in addition to own ship asatna chiyoda niitaka miyako with eight destroyer with to convoy transport to chemulpo taking measure upon arrival to insure that russian ship must not interfere with landing of troop be only order of be aware in light of what occurred after uriu arrival at chemulpo be probable that vice admiral be given considerable amount of latitude with regard to further proceeding be about seven o'clock in evening when two fleet parted company mikasa signalling congratulate in anticipation of success to takachiho replied thanks for kindness then signal be given by wireless for main fleet to proceed on north westerly course in extended formation of line abreast with destroyer scouting on wing great shout of banzai nippon went up for everybody knew that north west be road to port arthur where togo fervently hoped prayed might find russian fleet still at anchor for if not must certainly mean that alexieff have proved better strategist of two have contrived in subtle manner to slip past to westward when one two of three terrible thing might happen might realise togo original terrible fear of attack on undefended coast of japan might make for chemulpo destroy japanese squadron transport upon arrival there might pas through korean strait northward to vladivostock there unite two force when must be strong enough to give end of trouble if not indeed to defeat out of hand so decide war at one fell stroke be exceedingly difficult to know what to do for best gallant little admiral felt to full responsibility attaching to momentous decision a be made manifest when about two bell in first watch order be wirelessed to fleet to alter course twenty two degree to northward evidently with object of falling in with russian must by chance be making for chemulpo next order be to clear for action to further increase difficulty embarrassment weather have again changed for worse sun have set in wrack of wild storm riven cloud painted with hue of fire smoke louring threateningly have overspread sky with incredible rapidity completely obscuring light of star wind still icy cold have breezed up again savagely kicking up tremendous sea spray from quickly drenched in destroyer to skin despite oilies sou wester sea boot yet staunch little vessel though rolling pitching in most distracting manner rode like gull sea to seemed to be literally running mountain high true speed be only about twelve knot what kasanumi behaviour must probably have be at double speed in such sea shuddered to think be destined to know in not far distant future when ito lieutenant called at midnight to relieve informed that wireless message have just be received from flagship ordering shift of helm for elliot group of island distant sixty mile from port arthur for speed to be increased to sixteen knot order have acknowledged executed a discovered moment tumbled out of hammock for boat be kicking up heel more madly than ever while few second there resounded heavy thud on deck overhead craft shivered from stem to stern a drove sharp nose into heart of great comber throwing water in ton over be rough side of work aboard destroyer with vengeance spent four miserable hour on navigating bridge drenched to skin pierced to marrow by bitter cold thing come to end however sooner later about two o'clock next day steamed into sheltered water of elliot island came to anchor be spot admiral have selected to serve a rendezvous lurking place from must sally forth with good chance of cutting off port arthur fleet must venture to stray far from shelter of fortress subsequently be often referred to in dispatch a certain place chapter four council in mikasa cabin a entered roadstead found there at anchor small chinese junk of dilapidated weather beaten appearance that seemed a though might go to piece at moment be flying japanese mercantile flag white flag with red ball in centre be also japanese jack soon learned that in case a in many others appearance be deceptive for be assured that be a staunch a staunch must be be officered manned by chinese crew be ostensibly loaded with brick surrounded by brick be only blind be sturdy little closed in engine boiler smoke from latter issuing from unusually big chimney of galley stove while engine worked small powerful set of pump strongly sucked in water through bow discharged equally strongly from stern under water of course giving speed of seven knot in smooth water when sought further information with regard to mysterious craft be informed by ito who seemed to know about that have be purchased by japanese secret service department fitted with engine boiler pump by ingenious japanese engineer that business be to go to fro between port arthur certain place ostensibly a trader in reality that skipper particularly bold clever spy might obtain information for japanese spy name appeared be hang won rather ominous name thought under circumstance while name of junk be chung sa have arrived from port arthur about midday be hang won first essay in japan service have brought from port arthur two item of news be likely to prove most valuable to one of being that russian destroyer be being sent to sea night to reconnoitre that upon return always showed white light above red to indicate that be russian while second item be to effect that day th february happened to be name day of madame stark wife of russian admiral that in honour of day great banquet be to be given at nine o'clock night at admiral house be to be followed by special performance at circus chanced to be in town moment that information be communicated to togo recognised magnificent possibility offered by occasion for be morally certain that between banquet circus most of officer possibly also good many of men of russian fleet must be ashore night what better opportunity for attack upon be likely to offer chance be very much too good to be missed signal be at once made for captain of craft destroyer included to repair on board mikasa be one of last to reach flagship for destroyer be anchored outside rest of fleet when arrived admiral cabin be full of men a many of a must find room being seated round table while rest be accommodated with chair be talking indiscriminately together for council have not yet begun be characteristic of togo that saw instant entered cabin rose to shake hand with exclaiming ah here come young british giant then pointing to chair near motioned to be seated saying a did so with humorous smile well mr swinburne hope find kasanumi nice steady comfortable ship be there room enough in for to stretch will have to lengthen few foot be splendid little craft sir said heartily far better than british boat in saw service be magnificent sea boat came through wild weather of yesterday last night without turning hair true be bit cramped between beam have already raised few bump on head while trying to stand upright in cabin be ready to go anywhere attempt anything in be right remarked togo show true nelson spirit sir spirit expect to find in briton spirit so greatly admire be humbly striving to imbue japanese seaman with so be ready to go anywhere attempt anything ' eh excellent hope to afford opportunity to show what can do before be many hour older then turning to where captain ijichi stood near cabin door said in japanese be present ijichi dozen officer have followed close upon heel noticed that a entered mikasa skipper have ticked off something on list held in hand present sir answered ijichi referring to list good remarked admiral then be so good a to tell sentry that be on account to be interrupted then close door find seat for with closing of cabin door general conversation have be proceeding came to abrupt termination tense silence ensued togo looked round cabin a though taking stock of then in few terse word communicated to information have just learned from hang won who by way be still in cabin ready to answer question might be put to now gentleman continued there be need for to enlarge upon splendid opportunity madame stark celebration of name day offer to strike heavy blow at enemy fleet be sure that will see for yourselves only question be in what way can best avail ourselves of opportunity what form be blow to take so far a be concerned be seventeen ship strong apart from destroyer while friend hang won informs that russian fleet consists of fourteen ship again apart from destroyer be therefore three ship to good of fourteen russian ship seven be battleship while muster only six furthermore whole fleet be anchored under protection of port arthur battery further tremendous advantage to notwithstanding however opportunity be such splendid one be hand free must be strongly disposed to take whole fleet into port arthur roadstead engage russian ship at close quarter trusting to find unprepared do a much damage a possible with heavy gun trust to destroyer to complete destruction while confusion of surprise be at height gentleman can not do order from cabinet elder statesman be clear precise under circumstance be to disobey be that be never to risk ship especially battleship by exposing to fire of port arthur battery if obey order how may expect that order will be obeyed strict unquestioning obedience to order be a know almost article of faith with therefore sorely tempted though be to disobey just once dare not set example might be fraught with most disastrous consequence hence gentleman have summoned afternoon to assist with counsel may mention that keeping in view fact that superior government have given certain order must obey only thing can see for be to send in destroyer let do best can of suggest better plan for full minute more tense silence reigned in cabin everybody apparently waiting for somebody else to speak first then young officer in lieutenant uniform whom subsequently learned be le personage than prince kasho one of mikasa officer rose bowing first to admiral then to rest of said in japanese of course do understand admiral that question carry with permission to to express candid opinion assuredly answered togo good returned prince then since one else appears to have suggestion to offer perhaps may be permitted to do so though happen to be junior of most of honourable officer present told just now sir be hand free must be strongly disposed to take entire fleet into port arthur roadstead where understand almost russian ship of importance in eastern water now ride at anchor make end of speaker be here interrupted by low murmur of applause from many of officer present who seemed to have shrewd suspicion of what be coming togo held up hand for silence prince bowed smilingly to audience who felt have with resumed tell sir that be not free to exercise own discretion that hand be tied by certain order have received have reminded that implicit obedience be supreme virtue almost article of religious faith with japanese with sentiment sir be scarcely need say in perfect whole hearted agreement there be point wish to make be cabinet elder statesman be a designation indicates statesman be soldier sailor while will not attempt to dispute wisdom right to formulate certain general rule for guidance of general admiral feel must not be doing full duty to country in circumstance now confront if did not boldly declare fixed conviction that such general rule a have just alluded to ought to be regarded accepted by merely a guide not a definite imperative order be under circumstance whatsoever to be disobeyed here little murmur of applause more general decided than first ran round cabin a died away speaker resumed can not believe sir that order laid upon be intended to deprive of power to exercise own discretion under such exceptional circumstance a present therefore take upon responsibility of saying here in presence of officer that believe must be amply justified in acting in manner that indicated few minute ago there be mistaking meaning of applause rang through cabin now be perfectly evident that with solitary exception of admiral prince have man present heartily with have very few more word to add speaker resumed when applause died away be what have told concerning to night projected happening in port arthur seems to indicate that opportunity such a may never occur again now offer for to strike blow at enemy that will be impossible for ever to recover from if striking of blow doe indeed involve actual disobedience of precise order venture to assert that result will amply justify deed prince resumed seat amid thunder of applause rang through cabin for at least couple of minute when at length died down togo rose to foot gentleman said gather from plaudit that fully agree with prince kasho honourable speech for beg to most heartily thank although place upon horn of dilemma let pas for moment however what want now be that of must in a few word a possible express opinion upon prince suggestion must take whole of ship into port arthur roadstead engage enemy in pitched battle in response to appeal officer rose one after other apparently in order of seniority man expressed hearty concurrence with prince kasho proposal concurrence being accompanied in many case by expression of sundry lofty beautiful sentiment extolling virtue of patriotism valour at length everybody have spoken except be heartily hoping must be passed over a person of so little account that opinion must not be considered worth having not so however admiral turned to said with smile now at last come to honourable english friend captain of kasanumi what have to say upon matter have heard have be said although have perhaps be unable through restricted knowledge of language to grasp full meaning of may possibly have understood enough to enable to comprehend way in momentous question appeal to japanese heart intellect now kindly favour with view a hard headed englishman take of really sir said in english springing to foot in confusion must very much prefer to be excused if will kindly allow must be most rank presumption on part to cried several voice among distinctly recognised that of prince kasho let hear what honourable englishman have to say quite right gentleman said togo fully agree with know something of english even though mr swinburne may differ from will warrant that will not suggest action be not consonant with honour a seaman loyalty to emperor pray proceed mr swinburne very well then admiral gentleman since do honour to insist will said must permit to begin by reminding that be only boy that be first experience of actual warfare therefore if venture to express opinion on have be justly described a most momentous question do so with utmost diffidence at same time although have have previous experience of war must like to say have studied subject deeply with intense interest be with equal interest have listened to expression of view on question now under consideration be filled with admiration of noble patriotic sentiment have to day be spoken within wall of cabin sentiment with most cordially agree since happen to accurately coincide with own gentleman may dare venture to remind that patriotism valour splendid admirable a be be not only quality must distinguish soldier sailor who fight for country inspired by man may doubt accomplish great thing wonderful thing briton have proverb declares that discretion be better part of valour in humble opinion repeat advance with utmost diffidence present be one of occasion when valour a heroic self sacrificing a will must go hand in hand with discretion with kind favour will briefly mention picture arose in mind while prince kasho be advocating plan of taking entire fleet into port arthur roadstead engaging russian in pitched battle readily grant that information communicated to admiral by hang won seems to indicate to night small hour of to morrow morning will afford magnificent opportunity for coup let consider consequence coup must entail may be that must be able to take russian by surprise be exceedingly probable that of officer perhaps good many of will be ashore to night recognising fact that russia japan be at war do gentleman a reasonable sensible men really believe for moment that russian fleet will be left defenceless in open roadstead that vigilance of lookout will be relaxed if not approach of such formidable array a ours must assuredly be detected alarm given long before must arrive within effective striking distance then what must be ultimate result have not doubt that must be victorious at what cost must remember gentleman that must be not only engaging fleet slightly inferior in strength to own battery a well be in battery that danger lie know not what armament of battery may be think may safely assume that will consist of weapon heavy enough to sink many of ship while be doing best to sink theirs with submission think must be height of folly for to assume that must fight battle without serious loss to ourselves point wish to emphasise be how be going to make good loss russian can make good theirs by sending more ship out from europe where be to get more need not labour question gentleman be sure will see what mean therefore understand why say that altogether apart from question of slavish obedience to order otherwise think admiral be fully justified in decision not to risk ship in such exceedingly hazardous enterprise thank mr swinburne said togo offering hand a sat down have spoken pretty much a expected must then turning to one of officer who have be busily writing time be speaking said captain matsumoto be correct in supposing that have be taking down mr swinburne remark quite correct sir answered skipper of fuji then said togo do favour to read over aloud in japanese for benefit of officer who have be unable to closely follow mr swinburne english be done when matsumoto sat down there be silence for few moment succeeded by faint murmur of applause then admiral rose gentleman said have now spoken tender most hearty thanks for frank expression of several opinion have listened with greatest interest satisfaction to everything have be said must pardon if say at once frankly that leave a unconvinced a ever not unconvinced on contrary be more convinced than ever apart a mr swinburne have remarked from question of slavish obedience to order must be guilty of serious even disastrous error of judgment be to take battleship cruiser into port arthur road give battle to russian fleet only alternative be to employ destroyer will be glad of suggestion may be pleased to offer a to best method of attack nobody spoke be easy to see that officer of battleship cruiser deeply imbued with somewhat fantastic high flown idea of japanese with regard to almost divine virtue of heroism self sacrifice be profoundly disappointed that be not to be afforded opportunity to display possession of virtue have one suggestion to offer demanded togo in tone of surprise what say swinburne turning to must greatly help sir said if hang won must give even approximate idea of position of russian ship in roadstead be right sir must answered admiral turning to chinaman addressed to question in what imagined to be chinese man be replying at length when togo interrupted turned to skipper of flagship captain ijichi said chart of port arthur if please chart be brought won after poring over awhile took pencil with meticulous care jotted down certain mark upon when have finished togo turned to said here be mr swinburne mark indicate position of of russian ship a nearly a hang won can remember a see be moored in wedge shaped formation point of wedge to seaward point be occupied by tsarevich battleship next inshore come poltava also battleship then sevastopol battleship abreast of in second line battleship pobieda of position of be certain say having taken particular notice of a came out of rest be not so sure except that there be thirteen of exclusive of askold anchored inside tsarevich askold be cruiser according to hang won be performing patrol duty to fro outside rest of fleet will readily recognise from fact that be only craft with five funnel there be point in favour of employing destroyer appears that admiral stark sends out destroyer flotilla night to patrol coast a far a dalny there be about twenty mile north east of port arthur if upon approaching roadstead boat show light usually exhibited by russian destroyer white light above red on return from dalny ought to be able to get right in among russian fleet do tremendous amount of damage before identity be discovered will confidently look for important result accordingly now gentleman have own idea a to how attack must be conducted have heard said that in many councillor there be wisdom therefore must be glad to have view on subject one after other officer present gave general opinion being that destroyer ought to approach to within about five mile of shore at moderate speed showing light then dash in at top speed discharging torpedo right left continue to do so regardless of consequence until russian ship be destroyed finally be called for to give opinion again found obliged to differ from others if be leading attack sir said must time to arrive at about eleven o'clock being time imagine when banquet special performance will be at height at distance of about five mile from shore must slow down instead of increasing speed because must then have fear of flame escaping from funnel so betraying approach must then divide force into two one of must sweep well away to nor'ard while other sheered off toward south object being to get boat well into concealment of shadow of high land east west of roadstead under cover of shadow must creep close along shore until be well inside enemy fleet when must wheel outward get good way on boat torpedo enemy ship after ship a came out by plan must be heading seaward ready to make good escape a soon a alarm be given believe will be within few second after first torpedo be fired then must run for out to sea at top speed for be convinced that once alarm be given searchlight be turned on will be afforded further opportunity to do mischief see sense in sacrificing ship life uselessly have heard remark made more than once that be glorious thing to die for one country one emperor so be when sacrifice of one life be necessary to secure certain object maintain that be still more glorious to live for one country one live man can render more useful service to country than hundred dead one again there be little half hearted murmur of applause togo expressed approval in half hearted manner dashing fist upon table exclaimed by hachiman japanese god of war be right mr swinburne told little while ago that be only boy have brain wisdom of man sir plan of attack be right one can not see that be gentleman will be followed by attempting other plan must in probability lose boat man with better result while by adopting mr swinburne plan may save at least two third of now gentleman before terminate council have one better plan to propose glanced round cabin inquiringly one answered then captain matsumoto commanding battleship fuji rose a one whose knowledge of august english language be perhaps superior to of most present honourable self sir excepted said addressing admiral must like to say have listened to remark of honourable commander of kasanumi with profound interest doctrine that be more glorious to live than to die for one emperor be new one to japanese confess that for moment shocked a saw that shocked most of if one come to reflect one see that there be sound sense in therefore must like to record entire approval of projected plan of attack upon enemy fleet for by adopting there be good prospect that many life many craft must otherwise be uselessly sacrificed may be preserved to render further valuable service to japan emperor applause time be real hearty enough several of officer who be sitting near offered hand smilingly complimented very well then gentleman that matter be settled most satisfactorily too in humble opinion now a to detail division of destroyer flotilla will attack fleet at port arthur division will proceed to dalny in quest of russian destroyer said to reconnoitre in direction nightly will inflict a much damage a possible upon enemy captain matsunaga of asashio will command division while captain nagai will command division flotilla will start at five o'clock evening be dismissed gentleman thank for honourable attendance assistance have rendered chapter five baptism of fire weather have cleared somewhat during afternoon when at few minute before five o'clock mikasa made signal for destroyer flotilla to weigh proceed cloud have gathered afresh be looking a wild a ever be exactly five o'clock when asashio followed by kasanumi led way out to sea a began to move admiral signalled go in sink enemy fleet pray for success elliot group of island from started upon great adventure be situated sixty mile north east of port arthur within seven eight mile of mainland nearest best way therefore under ordinary circumstance must have be to creep down coast close inshore must have involved passing dalny on way there be russian destroyer be said to patrol a far a place night to be reckoned with did not desire to encounter on way so afford chance to slip back to port arthur give alarm object be to get in between port arthur so cut off retreat also have decided to approach port arthur from south west so a to give idea that be russian boat returning after scouting excursion in offing therefore headed due south at start speed being fifteen knot be later increased to twenty two a course have decided upon took far out of way nearly doubled distance to be run sun disappeared beneath horizon in heavy squall of rain wind breezed up fiercely be piercingly cold night shut down upon dark a wolf mouth only relief to intense blackness being phosphorescence of bow wave a swept roaring scintillating away to port starboard faint gleam of shrouded lamp vessel bore at taffrail a guide to craft next astern of well so much better darker night better for purpose only fervently wished that water have not be so brilliantly phosphorescent for in intense darkness gleam of be visible for quite considerable distance feared that if russian be keeping sharp lookout must prematurely reveal approach have cleared for action before getting under way boat carried two torpedo in tube gun loaded ammunition ready to pas up on deck at moment notice hour after hour steamed on describing arc of big semi circle a altered course from time to time until at length be heading west west for port arthur during whole time have not sighted craft of description at length about half past ten darkness ahead seemed to grow blacker than ever turning to ito who stood beside on bridge said do see that darkness ahead ito surely be loom of land yes answered ito who spoke english excellently without doubt be high land on side of port arthur have there be pinnacle rock light straight ahead by jingo a honourable english say captain matsunaga have hit off splendidly see there a light began to wink at from bridge of asashio ahead there be signal for th th division to part company yes there go now a again honourable english say sha be long shivered involuntarily quarter of hour more that blackness ahead must be pierced by blinding ray of inexorable searchlight stabbed by fierce flashing of artillery glare of bursting shell radiance of star rocket must be in midst of must be first experience of actual warfare wondered how must pas through ordeal have already learned that japanese soldier sailor be absolutely most fearless creature in existence fear death a little a fear sleep provided that come to in service of emperor country to die for emperor indeed who be to a god be very highest honour greatest glory that male japanese can look forward to face death with same pure joy same exaltation that early christian martyr displayed when be led forth to die for faith be spirit eagerness enthusiasm to die in battle caused enormous loss suffered by japanese during war made invincible how be conduct going to compare with of men like who be animated by more lofty sentiment than desire to do duty to best of ability to play part a man must above to uphold honour dignity of race be happy in conviction must not disgrace by exhibition of craven fear what dreaded be that in excitement of moment must get nervy lose head if only figuratively perhaps forget to do something ought to do to miss opportunity ought to see seize brace up paul said to myself pull together for honour of dear homeland forget about think only of work lie before did thought went back to talk with admiral in mikasa cabin afternoon suddenly remembered that work in hand be to be carried out a have planned in moment anxiety vanished be own man again mentally planning what must do from moment felt a cool collected keen a be ito who stood beside a tail light of th th division of flotilla vanished in darkness on port quarter asashio signal lantern began winking again ito read off translated message to reduce speed to twelve knot be ready to show signal lantern if required when starboard helm division one will follow while division two three will port helm sheer off to eastward single flash from own carefully shrouded signal lantern informed commodore that message have be read understood be opaque darkness once more rain have by time cleared off atmosphere be much clearer so clear indeed that outline of hill ahead showed with tolerable distinctness water be getting smoother lighthouse light be showing very bright clear by time two three other much dimmer light like of house showed here there in shadow of hill gap between hill marked harbour entrance be also visible while faint glare in sky to right of showed that port arthur be still awake everything seemed absolutely peaceful there be sign of alertness have expected to find suddenly lighthouse light upon gaze happened to be fixed seemed to blink several time in very curious manner then disappeared altogether for moment saw great black shadow seemed to rapidly increase in size a stared at then glimpsed at base of shadow ghostly gleam of phosphorescent foam such a be piled up by bow of ship travelling at speed high above rolling swirling cloud of blackness spangled with evanescent spark moment later saw be issuing from three of group of five tall funnel by jove ito exclaimed here come patrol cruiser askold be heading straight for gun tube crew stand by quartermaster light two signal lantern white above red bend on to signal halliard stand by to hoist away when give word yes agreed ito voice tense with excitement have seen intends to speak see have stopped engine be hailing asashio what jolly bloomin ' chance ito be very proud of command of english slang availed of possible opportunity to air to honourably torpedo will honourable swinburne augustly grant humblest of servant permission to do so heaven man exclaimed not for world pray that matsunaga may also have sense to refrain from doing so why honourable friend why demanded ito literally dancing with eagerness impatience because see honourable duffer that if did so explosion must put port arthur fleet too on qui vive long before must get at thus spoil chance of bagging battleship replied certainly not let cruiser go be battleship want there go asashio lantern hoist away quartermaster yes yes see replied ito in crestfallen tone be honourably right of course aha there go cruiser honourable captain matsunaga have evidently honourably satisfied honourably speaks russian like native be exciting moment tense a be must not help being amused at pertinacity with ito like japanese dragged in word honourable upon possible impossible occasion arises of course out of desire drilled into generation after generation to be extremely polite doubtless when speaking in own tongue word be never unsuitably used when undertake to talk english be frequently pitchforked into conversation in most incongruous even ludicrous fashion decided that must only be kind to give ito lesson upon absurdity of employing inappropriately opportunity came few minute later askold apparently satisfied with captain matsunaga explanation put helm hard starboard swept on presently vanishing in darkness minute two later asashio made signal for division to separate a arranged starboarding helm a did so leading number division to westward while division ported swerved sharply away to eastward critical moment be at hand said be so good mr ito a to go down on main deck assure that everything be ready that men be standing by tube gun then ito turned upon poured out impassioned entreaty that might be honourably permitted to take charge of fire torpedo considered for moment man who might chance to score hit in coming attempt must gain immense kudos knew in probability promotion also by right of course ito station must be by to take place must chance to be hit be just a liable to be hit on bridge a anywhere else also must be doing kindness to grant request so now look here ito said be of paramount importance that men in charge of tube to night must be first rate shot a cool a cucumber for hit miss suppose will be afforded chance to discharge more than two torpedo already in tube therefore must hit now be good shot with torpedo ito solemnly assured that there be not better torpedo shot than in whole japanese fleet be nerve right mean be perfectly cool demanded a cool a honourable cucumber asserted feel unworthy hand must not help laughing here be inevitable honourable being dragged in again seized hand held loosely in mine for few second be firm steady a rock good said will do ito go down work tube boy see that excel to night ito if love for heaven sake forget to withdraw honourable safety pin from honourable fan before honourably fire honourable torpedo will make honourable hit honourable night do honourably take there have fired off little joke on ito illustrated to fondly thought absurdity of indiscriminately dragging in word honourable in out of season how must take wondered august captain may honourably rely upon unworthy lieutenant to do honourable best gravely answered next moment be honourably descending bridge ladder to deck miserable attempt at jocularity have absolutely missed fire dear innocent fellow have accepted speech a uttered in seriousness be at moment that first caught loom of russian ship showing up deeper black against black shadow of frowning cliff away to starboard second two later long brilliant beam of intensely white light shot out from one of black shape slowly swept hither thither now striking heaving surface of black water anon vividly illumining one of sister order have be not to discharge at higher range than five hundred metre slowly beam swept round toward until halted rested steadily upon great lump of craft towered out of water like castle almost immediately between luckily dazzling light be hidden from eye by bulk of ship upon rested invested with sort of halo of radiance against stood out black grim perfect silhouette be big craft evidently battleship with lofty superstructure three big funnel cased half way up long overhanging bridge two stout military mast with fighting top two yard across be just within range seizing megaphone be in act of raising to lip to order ito to let fly at when saw long silvery shape flash out from after deck few second later great cone of water leaped into air fell like deluge upon great ship seemed to lift half out of water a though hove up by giant heavy boom followed have extreme gratification of knowing that little kasanumi first whitehead have got home explosion be quickly followed by several others in midst of sudden transformation took place pitchy darkness gave way to glare of perfect network of searchlight beam streaming out from ship after ship from cliff above sweeping here there everywhere lighting up fleet cliff channel leading to harbour lighthouse everything in fact except destroyer seemed to miss in most miraculous way excited shout came pealing across water to from deck of various ship boatswain whistle shrilled order after order be hoarsely bellowed with rattling crash of gun fire perfect tempest of projectile be sent hurtling out to sea from now thoroughly awakened panic stricken russian not solitary shot of came anywhere near for enemy seemed to have not slightest idea of actual whereabouts then to add to turmoil confusion fort on cliff above opened fire with heavy gun heard shell go muttering angrily far overhead a gunner ashore also fired into offing fleet a whole now lay broad on starboard beam in kasanumi be crossing bow of two funnelled battleship from position a outermost ship of fleet knew must be tzarevich when out of tail of eye so to speak again caught flash of one of whitehead a leapt outward plunged into sea breathlessly awaited result presently to delight saw that second torpedo have got home good old ito exclaimed aloud a spoke man stood beside two hit gasped almost inarticulate with excitement delight kasanumi have done duty to night have agreed so have splendidly old chap mean immediate promotion for ito for may rest assured that if get out of alive will not fail to report to admiral what have done see ah interrupted real credit of belongs to not for if have not warned must certainly in excitement have forgotten to withdraw pin before firing torpedo a be very nearly did so when firing first luckily warning flashed into mind at very instant when be about to fire be afraid that many of men have forgotten that essential for although torpedo must be by time discharged think that many ship have be hit have noticed same thing be about to say so at moment russian ship opened fire with heavy gun conversation up to now have be difficult enough became quite impossible owing to deafening din observed that ship battery be firing out to sea whereas destroyer be by time between fleet land completely absorbed in deep shadow of lofty cliff so that up to moment believed have remained unseen then asashio flashed signal for number division to retire at full speed putting helm hard port a did so for by time be running parallel with shore on west side of harbour few minute more must have taken to harbour mouth be now brilliantly illuminated by ray of half dozen searchlight be essential for to avoid if wished to escape instant annihilation be at moment when be eagerly taking note of most distinctive feature of harbour entrance brought thus prominently into view with idea that such knowledge a might then be able to acquire might prove useful at future time three destroyer coming out of harbour at full speed rushed across illuminated area turning sharp round pinnacle rock headed almost directly toward single glance sufficed to show that be russian craft for be of different model from ours four funnel be arranged differently from ours being in pair for moment believed that saw be about to engage therefore laid hand upon ito arm to attract attention pointed to boat then yelled in ear russian stand by to give broadside a pas ito nodded comprehendingly vanished from side minute later leading russian destroyer came abreast asashio captain matsunaga showed that be a wideawake a rest of by plumping pound three pound shell into then came turn did same of four japanese boat in turn firing gun must bear upon of three russian boat a came up without receiving single shot in return for strange a may seem russian appeared to have suspicion of whereabouts until actually fired upon perhaps must have be wiser have allowed valour to be tempered with discretion refrained from attacking enemy destroyer for flash of gun low down near surface of water be instantly observed by hundred sharp eye eagerly seeking whereabouts of elusive enemy almost immediately searchlight on ship shore swept round until rested full upon thereafter inexorably following movement while perfect tornado of shell rifle fire hissed whined about ear for might have be not very difficult for to have inflicted further damage upon battleship cruiser a be there be only one thing to be done namely to effect escape with utmost expedition if indeed escape be still possible for to remain until fresh torpedo must be got up on deck placed in tube must mean swift certain destruction before opportunity came for to work further mischief a be be simply miraculous that be not instantly blown out of water for with dozen more searchlight bearing full upon be a plainly visible a though have be broad daylight yet strange to say not shot struck of circumstance can only be accounted for upon assumption that russian gunner be so unnerved by sudden unexpected attack for moment have completely lost ability to shoot straight through frightful tempest of shot shell tore at top speed fragile hull of boat bucking quivering to impulse of tremendously powerful engine water cleft by sharp bow curling almost to height of navigating bridge drenching occupant with spray while flame roared out of four of funnel a stoker below toiled like fiend to feed furnace maintain full head of steam to add to difficulty glare of so many searchlight directed full upon dazzled sight to blinding point so that be only with greatest difficulty be able to find way formation in russian fleet be moored helped however for presently found rushing across bow of weathermost line steered accordingly then quite unexpectedly came upon three russian destroyer again of who happened to be prepared of kasanumi be one gave further peppering to a before made reply now at last be reaching end of line gauntlet be almost run for a drew out to seaward inshore ship be compelled to cease fire for fear of hurting friend instead of there be one more ship to pas a drew near to saw that have decided list to port be floating so deep aft that admiral walk stern gallery be very nearly submerged steam be roaring from safety valve a came up to small curl of water under bow swirl at stern showed that be under way be tsarevich heading for harbour evidently in sinking condition have satisfaction of knowing that by night work have put at least one of russian battleship hors de combat crew be much too busy to pay attention to quarter of hour later be beyond zone of awful merciless fire be heading south east for mokpo where have be ordered to rendezvous did not of course at time know extent of damage that have succeeded in inflicting upon russian fleet trustworthy information reached later that tsarevich have be struck aft torpedo blowing big hole in hull flooding steering compartment to extent that captain have be obliged to beach to prevent from sinking retvisan have be struck amidships large hole blown in pump compartment rendering necessary that also must be beached in order to save two battleship constituted kasanumi share of bag very pleased be with ourselves when news became known since two ship be far away best in russian fleet loss of even if must prove to be only temporary be very serious matter for russian in addition to pallada cruiser volunteer cruiser angara be also hit be obliged to be beached to save from foundering thus have done not at all badly although surprise be felt that considering favourable circumstance under attack be made by mean unsuspected approach time elapsed before searchlight actually found have not done great deal more for division have attacked russian fleet consisted in of ten destroyer of have discharged two torpedo twenty in of twenty only four apparently have got home be not result to be proud of have suspicion must have put finger upon explanation have be asked to do so must have be night be bitterly cold so cold indeed that spray froze a fell upon weather be simply atrocious result being that by time flotilla arrived in port arthur roadstead limit of even japanese physical endurance have be almost if not quite reached most of deck hand have be more le severely frost bitten not only body also mind be benumbed by arctic severity of weather thus came to pas at least so reasoned out that when moment for action arrived faculty between physical suffering mental excitement became so confused that many of made mistake against have warned ito failed to withdraw safety pin before discharging torpedo thus rendering missile ineffective be also ito opinion will remember by time that reached mokpo be in most deplorable condition nearly half of deck hand of expedition being compelled to go into hospital suffering from frost bite few of case being of so severe character that patient lost hand foot while one man lost four member narrowly escaped dying outright ito be somehow lucky enough to escape without serious injury developed virulent attack of inflammation of lung put hors de combat for nearly three week there be doubt that recovery be greatly facilitated by intimation reached while be still in hospital that have be promoted to rank of commander meanwhile thing have be happening at port arthur elsewhere on morning following attack togo sent three fast cruiser in toward fortress to reconnoitre ship having discovered pretty much how matter stood there reported to admiral whole fleet stood in engaged ship battery at long range firing only inch inch gun range being too long for others weather have changed be now bright comparatively warm atmosphere so clear that even comparatively small object be clearly visible mikasa opened ball by firing sighting shot from one of inch gun in fore barbette at same moment russian ship be seen to be getting under way at low speed japanese fleet steamed past port in line ahead firing a went after engagement lasting forty minute drew off hoping that russian fleet must follow in be disappointed ship be hit several time sustained certain amount of damage luckily not of serious character be reported that lost four killed fifty four wounded none of wound being serious enough however to necessitate men being sent ashore to hospital be time before reliable information reached a to extent of damage sustained by russian when came be to effect that several of shell fell in town scattering pile of coal on wharf creating general panic poltava be so badly hit that must not move shell blowing bow open petropavlosk pobieda be also hit though not seriously old friend askold be hit on waterline set on fire a be also diana while novik have steamed out toward fleet be sent flying back with rudder damaged so that have to steer with propeller affair caused admiral stark to be superseded successor being admiral makarov said to be finest seaman russia then possessed at same time general kuropatkin be appointed commander of russian land force two day later russian lost mine layer yenesei in dalny bay be particularly hard bit of luck for inasmuch a have practically completed work when disaster happened mission be to sow dalny bay with four hundred contact mine in order to prevent japanese from using bay a landing place for troop have successfully laid two of four hundred mine when three hundred ninety ninth mine be launched overboard floated instead of sinking to prescribed depth captain of ship be said to have opened fire upon with light gun to explode in appears to have be only too successful since not only exploded also blew up ship sank almost immediately most of crew going down with on following day small cruiser boyarin went ashore in dalny bay became total wreck thus in le than week port arthur fleet have become reduced in strength by le than three battleship five cruiser one mining ship exclusive of cruiser variag gunboat korietz destroyed at chemulpo encouraged by success of first destroyer attack upon port arthur admiral togo arranged for repetition of experiment on night of th february attempt duly came off th th division of destroyer flotilla being time told off to conduct attack division consisting of eight boat have not participated in previous attack togo doubt wished to give opportunity to acquire kudos at same time by arousing emulation spur on to outvie performance unfortunately however for expedition weather be even worse than with have have to contend cold be intense gale be blowing tremendously heavy sea be running to cap terrific snow blizzard be raging result of combination of adverse condition be that destroyer very soon lost touch with other only two of succeeded in entering harbour asigiri preceding hayatori by nearly two hour asigiri entered harbour unseen discharged two torpedo of captain commander isakawa believed have got home then fled encountering enemy launch on way sinking explosion of asigiri torpedo of course raised alarm searchlight flashed wildly hither thither gunner blazed away madly so great be panic that several of russian destroyer opened fire upon other did lot of damage when commander takanouchi in hayatori arrived two hour later confusion be still at height taking advantage of too slipped in unnoticed a believed successfully torpedoed cruiser before fled seemed very doubtful whether after of japanese boat did much damage for when japanese cruiser reconnoitred next day none must be detected then on night of rd february russian ship being inside port arthur togo sent in five steamer under commander arima whose instruction be that be to be sunk across harbour entrance in such position a must effectually block passage approach be prematurely discovered so terrific fire be opened upon from battery two be sunk while other three steering gear being shot away went ashore outside attempt be consequently failure while ten men lost life in making on night of th february morning of following day japanese fleet made second attack upon port arthur bombarding town fleet for twenty five minute russian cruiser bayan novik askold be hit shell exploded in battery town be set on fire in two place damage done be inconsiderable at length in accordance with instruction to on account risk battleship by engaging fort togo felt obliged to retire chapter six sealing up port arthur gallant indefatigable little admiral seemed to spend spare time in scheming out plan for discomfiture of enemy about time evolved one seemed to posse element of brilliant success knowing that russian spy swarmed everywhere prepared elaborate scheme to sow port arthur roadstead in front of harbour entrance with electro mechanical mine with ostensible object of preventing russian fleet from coming out mine be stated to be of peculiarly dangerous deadly character invented by captain odo with great ingenuity detail of scheme be permitted to gradually leak out so that in due time came into knowledge of russian spy be promptly transmitted to port arthur a matter of fact however mine be proposed to be actually be sown be of very innocuous character togo object being to imbue russian mind with idea that japanese mine be so useless that might be safely disregarded then when object have be achieved genuine odo mine must be sown with disastrous result to such russian ship a might chance to run foul of task of sowing innocuous mine be entrusted to two division of destroyer consisting of five craft first division being composed of asashio kasanumi akatsuki while akebono sazanami constituted second division ito have happily recovered from indisposition by time be able to rejoin fleet in time to participate in projected operation although promoted to rank of commander be left in command of kasanumi ito got step up ratline being given command of akatsuki while youngster named hiraoka be given in place on th march be busy day shipping harmless mine at eight o'clock in evening weighed under easy steam proceeded from base at elliot island bound for port arthur roadstead accompanied by fast cruiser squadron duty of be to support in event of being attacked cover escape by pm be within ten mile of roadstead at point parted company with cruiser who now hove to for hour to allow time to reach destination at expiration of time light two be accidentally revealed on board cruiser for few second just long enough to give port arthur lookout opportunity to detect when be extinguished ruse be successful attention of lookout have be attracted instantly searchlight from station on cliff to eastward of harbour be turned upon cruiser kept steadily bearing upon be of course so far away that be only dimly descried too far distant to make worth while to open fire upon movement be of set purpose of so suspicious character having once detected russian be determined not to lose sight of again attention of lookout having thus be attracted to cruiser in offing in destroyer be able to slip into roadstead undetected arrived there lost time in sowing mine field right athwart harbour mouth have be so minded must have finished work retired before daylight to render admiral scheme successful be necessary that must be seen nature of work recognised nd division therefore reserved few mine to be dropped after daylight when came be at once discovered dropping mine in state of apparently feverish haste fort of course at once opened fire upon before must get range destroyer launched remaining mine overboard took to heel task being accomplished now remained be to patiently await course of event thus see how far part of togo plan have be successful game however be not yet finished while have be busily dropping mine what thought rather brilliant idea have occurred to ceasing work for while steamed up alongside akebono of nd division imparted idea to commander tsuchiya who be pleased to very heartily approve of in accordance with scheme therefore st destroyer division completed task before daylight quietly steamed off round to westward of liau ti shan where remained snugly concealed close in under cliff idea be that if nd division be discovered a be necessary must be russian must probably send out few destroyer to attack event proved that surmise be correct six russian destroyer be dispatched from harbour presumably with instruction to wipe akebono sazanami off face of water a soon a latter saw enemy approaching on course intended to cut off retreat to eastward two boat swerved sharply away to westward with funnel belching great cloud of smoke indication that crew be in terrible state of fright with engine working at only about three quarter speed russian stimulated by nd division apparent terror finding also that be steadily gaining upon chase strained nerve to overtake at length came pounding round point in great style meanwhile two retreating japanese destroyer have already swept past thus giving signal to be on lookout veering round in wide semi circle formed up in rear of st division having already started engine a soon a hove in sight on came russian destroyer rolling pitching on long swell with water spouting curling under sharp bow to height of bridge moment that first of swung round point over went indicator of engine room telegraph to full speed ahead gun crew have be standing to gun for time past ready for action a swept out to seaward crossing russian bow let fly at with twelve pounder a many of six pounder a must be brought to bear concentrating fire a much a possible upon enemy gun several of succeeded in dismounting feel bound to admit that taken by surprise though be russian put up splendid fight although be superior to in number men must not be denied worked gun a coolly with a deadly precision a though have be at target practice russian boat be hulled again again cloud of steam arose from fire broke out aboard of so closely be engaged that must occasionally hear cry of wounded arose a shot swept deck fight be very hot one lasted twenty minute by time russian have managed to get back round point under cover of battery followed to very mouth of harbour fighting inch of way at length with heavy shell falling round in case dropping so close that deck be drenched with spray became imperative for to be off accordingly ported helm made off followed by salvo of shot big small until be out of range then slowed down engine proceeded to take stock of injury so far a kasanumi be concerned have got off pretty lightly although there be period of about three minute when be hotly engaged by two russian destroyer at same time deck be rather severely scored by flying fragment of shell have three shot hole in hull have one man killed two wounded one of being chief engineer who although severely wounded by fragment of shell burst in engine room gallantly stuck to post until fight be over when be able to turn engine over to second akatsuki have received severest punishment one of steam pipe being severed four of engine room hand scalded to death in lost in fight seven killed eight wounded none of boat be very seriously damaged meanwhile nd division consisting of akebono sazanami have vanished without leaving sign of whereabouts be now daylight weather tolerably clear yet although hiraoka swept whole surface of sea with glass entirely failed to pick up asashio akatsuki be within hail of engaged like ourselves in temporarily patching up hole in thin steel side through water be pouring in whenever rolled extra heavily hailed inquiring whether of have seen anything of missing craft affirmative reply came from friend ito aboard akatsuki who informed that shortly after fight began on other side of promontory have momentarily caught sight of steaming hot foot after destroyer be in full flight heading toward pigeon bay scarcely have reply be given when sound of light gun fire faintly reached ear from direction mentioned few minute later two destroyer flying russian flag came foaming round point firing a came while close behind appeared two missing boat also firing for be worth russian boat be running in line ahead seemed to that skipper of leading boat be manoeuvring in such manner a to keep consort a nearly a possible between pursuer at event sternmost boat seemed to be getting biggest share of pursuer fire at once shouted order for men engaged upon repair to hasten work bring to sort of finish at same time signing quartermaster to put helm hard over intention of course being to go back render such assistance a might be required while asashio kept on stood by ito who have hand full with severed steam pipe be impossible for now to steam at greater speed than about three knot for have attempted to do so must have washed overboard men who be making repair a well a washed repair away in uncompleted state consequently long before must get near scene of action fight be over one of destroyer leading one managed to get safely into harbour while other turned out to be stercguschtchi riddled with shell lost speed to extent at sazanami be able to run alongside throw boarding party upon deck found that deck veritable shamble le than thirty dead being counted upon naturally took craft without resistance worth mentioning for there be very few left to resist while of who remained greater number jumped overboard rather than surrender of only two be picked up while two others too badly wounded to either fight take to water surrendered at once sazanami took prize in tow craft be so seriously damaged that despite effort to save rapidly filled sank towing hawser parting a foundered meanwhile akebono be in somewhat parlous condition for during fight have be struck on waterline be now limping along a best must with two compartment filled when therefore russian boat foundered sazanami went to consort assistance took in tow for two russian cruiser identified a novik bayan be now seen to be coming out of port arthur harbour be high time for to be off happily for by time that russian cruiser be fairly out of harbour five of own cruiser have hove up above horizon steaming rapidly shoreward to support whereupon russian turned tail retreated a cruiser came up flagship signalled to proceed to rendezvous after ascertaining that must look after ourselves needed assistance shortly afterward fell in with main fleet under togo bound for pigeon bay whither admiral be proceeding for purpose of testing theory that fortress must be successfully bombarded by high angle fire projected over high land between pigeon bay town signal be made for commander tsuchiya to proceed on board mikasa where jointly made report with admiral be pleased to express satisfaction too be anxious to know whether required assistance finding that did not ordered to proceed to rendezvous get repair put in hand without moment delay arrived safely at destination early in afternoon within next hour damaged craft be in hand of strong repairing gang so prompt be japanese to act main fleet arrived at rendezvous shortly before sunset anchored looked keenly at ship after ship a steamed in must detect sign of injury to of so after dinner took dinghy rowed across to mikasa with several of officer of be by time on quite intimate term first man happened to run into however upon passing in through gangway be captain ijichi commanding ship a anxious to hear yarn a be to hear instantly pounced upon marched off to own cabin where be presently joined by lieutenant prince kasho for whom ijichi have sent here be made to start proceeding by spinning at considerably greater length yarn have related to admiral earlier in day be now able to supplement with additional information that nd division have chased russian destroyer of have started in pursuit into pigeon bay where have sunk honour of day be of course with for have accounted for two russian destroyer whereas of st division have only given five of enemy very severe mauling nevertheless little audience be good enough to stamp performance with marked approval then skipper of mikasa related story long range bombardment of port arthur be not very exciting affair seemed be successful in so far that proved correctness of admiral theory that must be done by firing over high ground dropping shell upon unseen mark on other side attempt be of twofold character one part of be to test above theory while other be to destroy russian signal station upon island of sanshan off dalny from spot enemy be able to observe report to port movement of fleet task be successfully accomplished by detachment of cruiser a regard long range high angle bombardment of fortress be accomplished in following fashion battleship proceeded round to westward of promontory of liau ti shan to spot where high land hid from sight of port arthur battery elevating muzzle of inch gun to required extent discharged five round from four gun one hundred twenty shot in one shot at time while first cruiser squadron stationed off port to south east carefully noted spot where shell dropped reported result by wireless to battleship thus enabling to adjust aim rectify inaccuracy result be that one of shell hit golden hill fort exploding magazine doubtless doing considerable amount of damage to structure while mantow hill fort on west side of harbour be hit several time considerably damaged several shell fell in new town of port arthur setting fire to number of house there causing tremendous panic great loss of life fifth shell fired by battleship struck russian battleship retvisan while fell aboard sevastopol exploding on armoured deck yet of shell struck train happened to be just entering port arthur station destroying locomotive a subsequently learned killing engine driver severely wounding fireman finally retvisan adopted own tactic retaliated by firing heavy gun over intervening high ground while of fort did same party of signaller being stationed on crest of hill to direct aim a result of shell at length began to drop near ship whereupon admiral in obedience to instruction not to risk battleship hauled off fleet a went observing three dense column of smoke rising from city seeing that ship be retiring russian admiral led out to sea such of ship a be fit for service with evident intention of luring ship into zone of fire of fort might a well have saved coal for togo be much too wary bird to be caught with kind of chaff on following day learned by wireless from one of cruiser scout that russian fleet be being cautiously taken out to sea through mine field off harbour mouth innocuous character of have already ascertained a intended by admiral later on further information reached that fleet be at sea carrying out evolution while cautiously working way southward later still be informed that russian learning from scout that none of ship be in vicinity have proceeded a far a miao tao island off shan tung peninsula subjected to careful examination under impression a subsequently learned that island be being used by destroyer a hiding place from to make raid hand of immediately made preparation to weigh at moment notice fully expecting that admiral must seize what seemed such splendid opportunity to intercept enemy give battle in open sea order be issued be given to understand that there be certain good sufficient secret reason why opportunity must be permitted to pas great deal of surprise not to say dissatisfaction be caused by strange decision discipline be so strong idea of implicit unquestioning obedience have be so thoroughly instilled into japanese mind not word of grumbling passed of lip on night of st march tactic of th of same month be repeated including laying of harmless mine off mouth of harbour high angle bombardment of fortress by fuji yashima from pigeon bay affair be uneventful may therefore be dismissed with bare mention of russian ship again came out of harbour ranged in battle formation in roadstead wile of ours must tempt to leave protection of fort so drew off returned to rendezvous among elliot island during night of nd march four merchant steamer purchased by japanese government arrived at rendezvous from sasebo in response to request from togo admiral with characteristic energy at once proceeded to prepare for task of making second attempt to bottle up fleet in port arthur harbour be fukui maru chiyo maru yoneyama maru yahiko maru old craft practically worn out of very little value ship like used in first attempt be loaded with stone scrap iron consolidated into mass by pouring liquid cement over thus converting into sort of reinforced concrete underneath be buried explosion charge destined to blow out bottom of ship sink upon arrival at destined station hirose now promoted to rank of commander for gallantry displayed upon occasion of first attempt be given command of largest ship fukui maru while to intense surprise gratification be given command of chiyo maru craft of ton expedition be in charge of commander arima who went with ship be armed with few old hotchkiss quick firers for use against torpedo craft must attack preparation be completed late in afternoon of th march immediately weighed proceeded to sea escorted by flotilla of destroyer torpedo boat among be kasanumi temporarily under command of subordinate young hiraoka who have already proved to be very capable discreet courageous lad weather on occasion be everything must be desired perfectly clear with wind sea so calm that veriest cock boat must have safely ventured upon only drawback be that there be moon well advanced in first quarter floating high in sky dappled with light fleecy cloud through enough light percolated to render even small craft distinctly visible on horizon after must not greatly matter indeed must be advantage to always provided of course that be not prematurely sighted by keen visioned swift steaming russian scout for moon must set about midnight while two o'clock in morning be time set for attempt run to offing of port arthur be like pleasure

be avoided when boat touched water at eleven o'clock commander arima signalled destroyer flotilla five of fastest of at once went full speed ahead spreading out in fan shaped formation ahead of on bow to reconnoitre roadstead at ten minute to midnight moon great golden half disc swimming in violet sky flecked with great island of soft fleecy cloud touched high land of liau ti shan a sank behind order be given to stop engine lay to for short while a have made good passage be somewhat ahead of scheduled time also to await return report of destroyer be now about twelve mile off port arthur far enough beyond range of searchlight to ensure presence being undetected with setting of moon cloud seemed to bunch together acquire greater density fell very dark such starlight a filtered through canopy of cloud only barely sufficing to enable to detect next ship ahead astern land about port arthur loomed up in darkness like shapeless black shadow stretched along horizon to west north pierced only by long beam of searchlight on golden hill sweeping slowly to fro at interval watching for want of something better to do presently noticed that for reason not explicable to beam never travelled farther south than certain point where invariably paused for few second then slowly swept round toward north again wondering whether arima also have noticed rang engine ahead for revolution two hailed fukui to inquire appeared that have not be in middle of suggestion observance of must believed enable to get close in undetected when destroyer came rushing back with information that everything be clear ahead that prospect of success looked exceedingly promising whereupon arima hailing directed to take lead in chiyo steering such course a seemed desirable rest must follow accordingly in chiyo went ahead fukui falling in next astern other two retaining original position started at speed of six knot only to give stoker chance to get boiler into best possible trim to raise good head of steam for final rush a soon a safety valve began to blow off increased number of revolution until when arrived within four mile of harbour mouth be racing in a though for wager at point destroyer stopped engine lay to have done first part of work must now wait until have done ours meanwhile have quite made up mind a to proper thing to do accordingly shaped course by instead of running straight in so crossing track of searchlight beam edged away to southward westward traversing arc of circle so just keeping outside range of beam of course sort of thing must not go on indefinitely to enter harbour must sooner later get within range of light when arrived within two mile of harbour mouth further concealment became impossible have done not at badly for ten minute rush must now see where wanted to be if in meantime be not hit blown out of water a came within reach of searchlight called down to engine room enjoining below to give old packet ounce of steam must muster engineer responded by calmly screwing down safety valve ignoring fact that by doing so risked bursting of boiler be time for caution if worn out kettle must only stand strain for ten minute might be well slowly searchlight beam came sweeping round toward until rested fully upon swept on for yard two switched back paused for few second then began to wave wildly to fro seemingly by way of signal while solitary gunshot pealed out upon air then light came back to fully revealing four steamer making headlong rush for harbour entrance following that solitary gunshot there be tense silence lasting for perhaps minute while searchlight after searchlight be turned upon from height from ship so placed that must be brought to bear then a though at preconcerted signal battery on height two gunboat anchored at harbour entrance opened fire upon darkness of night be stabbed pierced by jet of flame while air became vibrant with hiss scream of projectile of description fell round lashing surface of sea into innumerable jet of phosphorescent foam crash of heavy gun fire sharper crackle of quick firers raised terrific din that quickly became impossible to make one voice heard crew have already received order moment that got within range opened steady fire with two old hotchkisses upon gunboat at harbour mouth while destroyer pushing boldly in after opened fire upon searchlight hoping to destroy endeavouring by possible device to distract attention of gunner to draw fire from in be unsuccessful russian at once divined intention to seal up harbour recognised that be vastly more important to to frustrate purpose than to waste fire upon elusive destroyer doubt whether single gun be turned upon on through tempest of projectile rushed old patched up engine rattling clanking groaning a worked under pressure of steam a have not known for many long day stoker after final firing up came on deck by order of engineer went upon topgallant forecastle to assist with gun took up station by wheelhouse to con ship to appointed berth be immediately under golden hill about hundred yard from shore one of two gunboat be guarding entrance be anchored so nearly in way be sorely tempted to give stem sink where lay successfully resisted temptation for have sunk be too far out to have become obstruction while must probably have smashed in own bow gone to bottom before arriving at station a surged past however within twenty fathom peppered smartly with quick firers receiving in return ragged discharge from entire battery including shell from inch gun happily passed through starboard bulwark out through port without exploding foretopmast be at moment shot away fell on deck hurt one funnel be riddled with shrapnel bridge stanchion within foot of where be standing be cut in two none of be hurt next moment shell struck mainmast sent over side luckily severing rotten shroud stay also so that fell clear did not foul propeller few second later shell dropped upon after deck exploded blowing jagged circular hole of twenty foot diameter in setting plank on fire few bucket of water promptly applied sufficed to extinguish blaze meanwhile be plugging along in grand style drawing so near to destination called to men to cease firing for two of to stand by to let go anchor while rest came aft held ready to jump into solitary boat when gave word be wonderfully exciting work for a drew nearer in came into range of fire of other fort ship air seemed to be thick with missile while shrapnel be bursting round water be torn by flying shot to extent that deck be streaming hand of be wet through with thrown up spray at length appointed berth be so close at hand rang down to stop engine signed to helmsman to put helm hard port while stationed close to electric button pressure on must fire explosive in hold blow bottom out be now so close in under cliff that golden hill gun must no longer reach also be out of range of great searchlight consequently be enshrouded in darkness yet fort on west side of harbour still maintained fire upon be now lost in deep shadow of cliff shot flew wide minute later called down tube to engineer to send engine astern to check way then come on deck be still ascending engine room ladder when shouted to men forward to let go anchor fell with great splash a have snubbed at short scope quickly brought up in exact spot destined for lower away boat tumble in men shouted word be hardly out of mouth when murmur of fall through block splash of boat a hit water few muffled ejaculation followed a men slid down fall then came rattle of oar a be thrown out finally voice cry ready captain only wait for good ejaculated rammed down button tremendous jolt that flung off bridge accompanied by not very loud explosion followed ship trembled a though have be sentient thing sound of water a though pouring through sluice reached ear down ladder rushed on to main deck seized one of davit tackle slid down into boat a men replied to question that be present bowman thrust boat away from sinking steamer side oar churned up water a pulled away give way lively lad cried a seized tiller will get close inshore where nobody can see save skin in way have happily escaped thus far must be pity for of to get hit now there go old chiyo have taken long to sink bless be worth lot more where be at bottom of port arthur harbour than be when afloat chapter seven koryu maru meanwhile fukui maru have also reached destination a pushed off in boat from side of own sinking ship heard through din of firing explosion of bursting shell roar of cable a crew let go anchor be sitting with back turned toward intent upon getting boat a close inshore a possible when engineer who be sitting beside touched arm pointed turned looked to see hirose ship brought up right in mid channel berth assigned to bearing down upon russian destroyer funnel gun spouting flame smoke a tore furiously through water instant destroyer swerved just clearing stern of fukui there be flash of torpedo from deck tube terrific explosion fukui seemed to be hove up out of water on top of great cone of leaping sea intermingled with smoke flame ship have be torpedoed quite uselessly indeed worse than uselessly for russian have simply saved people trouble of sinking destroyer passed on temporarily lost sight of in darkness wreathing smoke saw fukui boat lowered crew get into remained alongside so long that only got away barely in time to avoid being dragged down with ship meanwhile shell be falling not only all round also aboard fukui presently saw that be on fire a well a sinking nearly quite dozen shell must have struck before finally foundered be not until next day that learned full extent of tragedy then appeared that explosion of torpedo have disconnected shattered wire connected with explosive in fukui bottom petty officer named sugino have gone below to explode charge chanced that man be blood brother of hirose not returning to deck a be expected to do hirose went in search of after ordering boat to leave ship few second later shell be seen to strike hirose on head of course killing instantly later on heard that floating body have be picked up in harbour by russian who to do justice buried with military honour small air of wind at time came breathing down harbour momentarily dispersing thick veil of smoke overhung water be thus enabled to see that third ship yahiko maru have also succeeded in reaching berth assigned to be at moment in very act of sinking close to pinnacle rock great monolith rose high out of water on western side of harbour mouth thus far therefore everything have gone well with expedition now remained be for fourth ship yoneyama maru to close up gap still remained looked round to see if must see anything of presently shifting of searchlight beam from yahiko revealed coming along in fine style heading straight for appointed berth hitherto russian battery have be too busy attending to others to take much notice of appeared to be ataunto quite uninjured felt curious to see what be going to happen to gave crew order to easy lay on oar a did so russian destroyer must not tell whether be craft have torpedoed fukui emerged from darkness heading straight for yahiko a though to run down must dare wondered surely not if did not there be reason why yahiko must not be stout built merchant steamer old a be must shear through destroyer thin plating a though be brown paper if have be in charge of yahiko must not have hesitated instant indeed must have jumped at chance in excitement leaped to foot making funnel of hand yelled frantically yahiko ahoy give stem man give stem at precise moment russian gun opened again time directing fire upon yahiko hail be effectually drowned by crash of explosion be of opinion that moment later commander of yahiko saw chance just too late to fully avail of at event bow of steamer suddenly swept round although destroyer instantly shifted helm be too late to entirely avoid collision rounding of yahiko bow struck roughly shouldered aside craft reeling under impact at instant destroyer let fly gun must bear fire from actually scorching japanese crew who be at moment preparing to lower boat yahiko passed on so did destroyer latter vanishing in darkness to seaward while yahiko centre of very galaxy of bursting shell staggered on in sinking condition went down at very moment when with astounding skill coolness skipper have brought to exact spot for be intended then be seen that through miscalculation more probably because russian have widened channel there still remained unfilled gap wide enough for single ship to pas through be most vexatious thing after trouble that have taken ordeal have passed through must not be helped be fortune of war stay though why must not be helped be needed be steamer perhaps two steamer to fill gap thing be done hang be game to do job to morrow night when russian must least expect to do job effectually be highly necessary to know exact width of gap depth of water in now be time to ascertain particular while be on spot must do then came very practical question how what mean have to take sounding to measure gap between sunken fukui yoneyama looked about found that have with be boat painter piece of rope seven eight fathom long might serve a sounding line if only have sinker of sort unhappily have not then one of men in boat realising what wanted informed that while preparing boat for lowering have chanced to glance into locker in stern sheet have noticed fishing line there must that be of use of course must very thing for sounding at event have line out in double quick time cut away hook then proceeded to knot at exact interval corresponding with length of boat after thwart precisely what that length might be must ascertain afterward how to measure width of gap there seemed to to be one way to do be by taking length of boat a unit of measurement not very satisfactory method admitted yet better than nothing so thereupon set to work starting at fukui mainmast dropped sinker of fishing line over stern paid out until reached deck then giving way with oar felt way along deck to taffrail lifted sinker dropped again clear of wreck until touched bottom then noting depth a so many knot fraction of knot jotted result in notebook while oarsman keeping boat in position cast be made at bow end of boat proceeding in manner taking utmost care to obtain accurate result accomplished task in about hour under heavy fire from russian on height strange to say injured none of done pulled out to sea be soon afterward sighted joined by tsubame aotaka japanese torpedo boat took aboard exultingly informed that quarter of hour so earlier have engaged driven ashore russian destroyer afterward proved to be silny craft have torpedoed fukui have narrowly escaped being run down sunk by yahiko torpedo boat crew made much of believe must have given everything have if must have taken contented with pannikin of saki to counteract cold of drenched clothing then asked to run off alongside own ship kasanumi be hove to about mile further out crew received back with literally open arm loud shout of banzai nippon when allowed to be known that have succeeded in doing that have be ordered to do young hiraoka be disposed to regard a hero to treat a such commencing long complimentary speech of homage congratulation cut short by remarking be perishing of cold dived below to give good rough towelling to change into dry kit when went on deck again dawn be just brightening eastern sky then noticed that seemed to have more than proper complement of men aboard inquiring reason learned that kasanumi have picked up crew of fukui maru poor hirose ship furnished with particular of gallant fellow heroic death also learned that while have be engaged in endeavour to block harbour destroyer have be busily employed in sowing further harmless mine in accordance with admiral plan to convince russian that japanese mine be useless need not be feared a daylight strengthened revealed fleet strung out along horizon admiral having followed blocking ship destroyer upon off chance that russian might be tempted to come out attack in event of failing in mission at first appeared a though chance might be afforded for a steamed away to eastward saw smoke rising from funnel of of ship in harbour shortly afterward cruiser bayan novik askold came steaming out with battleship following be go russian opened long range fire upon to gave reply slowly retiring instead in hope of enticing enemy ship to follow beyond cover of battery russian admiral however be too wary refusing to be drawn putting up helm returned to harbour nevertheless event be not altogether unprofitable to for a russian ship re entered harbour petropavlosk ran foul of sevastopol damaged so severely a to render unfit for further service until must be repaired meanwhile destroyer being no longer required devoted to task of reducing to intelligible state sounding measurement have that morning taken by time that be back at rendezvous have little sketch plan of harbour mouth ready for admiral showing exact width of gap depth of water in thus enabling to determine precise size of craft required to fill also volunteered to return fill up gap very night if must let have ship of required dimension appeared that have ship must at time be spared consequently job have to wait togo be profuse in thanks for offer be pleased to be exceedingly complimentary in remark touching gallantry in matter of taking sounding a also upon conduct generally in taking in blocking ship under terrific fire sinking exactly in required position expressed great grief at loss of poor hirose who be without doubt remarkably promising officer must assuredly have further distinguished gone far have lived just before arrived at rendezvous that night high pressure cylinder developed bad crack possibly through unsuspected flaw in casting a there be mean of repairing except temporarily where be a in meantime boat be useless received order to have crack patched up a far a possible then to proceed to sasebo to have new cylinder fitted mishap involved absence of kasanumi from rendezvous for ten day a event proved did not matter in least for admiral doubtless for good sufficient reason now permitted period of inaction to occur during nothing happened beyond usual watching of port arthur harbour availed of opportunity thus afforded to have little ship docked scraped repainted while engineer took engine entirely to piece subjected to thorough overhaul replaced few brass other matter be showing sign of wear also overhauled boiler fitted quite number of new tube so that when at boat left dry dock be in first class condition ready for service must be reasonably asked of found awaiting at post office quite nice little batch of most cheering encouraging letter from friend gordons to duly replied at considerable length giving especially ronald full particular of adventure up to date receipt of letter made feel that while man have such staunch friend a have proved to be world be not such bad place after got back to rendezvous at elliot island on afternoon of th april little kasanumi looking a smart spick span a new pin hull funnel mast gun everything in fact except deck painted that peculiar tint of medium smoky grey experience have proved to render almost invisible even in daylight absolutely so at night moment that anchor be down proceeded aboard flagship to report also to deliver mail for fleet dispatch for admiral have brought with there did not seem to be very much doing at rendezvous when arrived beyond rebunkering of such craft a needed noticed rather smart looking steamer of about four thousand ton fitted a mine layer with lighter on side of out of number of very business like looking mine be being hoisted when got aboard mikasa be shown into admiral cabin found little gentleman up to eye in business a usual dropped work however when be announced rising from chair greeted in most hearty friendly manner then bidding be seated asked how have spent time at sasebo expressed utmost satisfaction with everything have done presently when orderly brought in bundle of letter paper from mail have brought opened latter selecting from particular sheet tokio asahi believe be opened glanced eagerly at particular column then with smile pointing finger handed sheet to have be opened at page containing naval intelligence glancing at perceived to amazement delight have be gazetted to rank of captain a from th march in recognition of conspicuous gallantry in connection with second attempt to close port arthur two other surviving skipper have also be similarly promoted scarcely knew how to find word eloquent enough to thank togo for generous recognition of service such a be must not listen to word of thanks insisting that have honestly earned promotion thoroughly deserved now concluded be going to give further opportunity to distinguish have in hand work successful execution of demand man who can be depended upon to keep head nerve under most trying condition such a existed when took sounding measurement under fire other day indeed be that piece of daring caused to select for work may perhaps have observed steamer shipping mine did yes thought must well that steamer be koryu maru very smart boat steaming twenty two knot have have fitted a mine layer russian have passed to fro over mine field off port arthur have have full opportunity to learn that mine be so harmless that may be regarded a negligible so now propose to teach new lesson mine koryu be shipping be not harmless on contrary be exceedingly formidable affair containing charge ranging from one hundred to two hundred pound of shimose explosive be arranged to automatically adjust to varying depth of water ship strike one of will be done for having told so much will readily understand that be ticklish affair to handle particularly when come to laying hence choice of captain swinburne to supervise execute task will be glad if will go aboard at earliest convenience make thoroughly acquainted with mode of handling be essentially different from of handling mine to have be accustomed thanked admiral for fresh manifestation of trust in took leave pausing only for few minute on way to gangway to exchange greeting with of officer of ship reply to congratulation upon promotion news of have already got abroad then went down side got into boat be pulled across to koryu where found delicate operation of shipping stowing mine in brisk progress introduced to officer in charge who at once proceeded to explain to structure mechanism of class of mine being dealt with thus enabling to understand danger to be guarded against while handling after conducted to cabin perched high on boat deck immediately took possession sending boat back to kasanumi with note for young hiraoka requesting to take charge during absence to steward instructing to send across such thing a immediately needed change be greatly better for for whereas quarter aboard kasanumi be cramped of spartan simplicity captain cabin of koryu be spacious almost luxurious affair handsomely comfortably furnished with accommodation that reasonable man must wish for two day later fleet weighed proceeded to sea leaving koryu at anchor with fourth fifth destroyer flotilla fourteenth torpedo boat flotilla twelve craft in to protect order be to proceed to sea in time to reach port arthur roadstead at midnight of th sow harbour approach with mine according to certain plan then retire with assurance that if attacked there must be force of ample strength lying in wait to protect one part of duty after laying mine be to endeavour to entice russian fleet to come out in pursuit of experience have taught that for reason with be unacquainted russian ship invariably followed certain course when leaving harbour while when returning a invariably followed instruction therefore be to sow mine over area by ship returned to port while leaving free that area traversed by when coming out reason of course being that a many ship a possible must be enticed to come out in hope that many of must be destroyed upon return night of th be wretched one in respect for purpose weather be thick strong breeze be blowing from southward kicking up nasty sea be bitterly cold thin drizzle of fine snow made thick atmosphere still thicker so that be impossible to see farther than ship length in direction foresaw therefore that have very difficult task before not only in getting little torpedo boat across in heavy sea in depositing mine in right place after must arrive to spare torpedo boat a much a possible while making passage against heavy head sea decided to proceed at speed of ten knot accordingly got under way at five o'clock in evening leaving hour in hand to cover delay might meet with have very carefully studied tide current chart during afternoon taken careful note of strength of wind taking matter into consideration have worked out course unless of condition changed must take to exact spot wished to reach at eleven o'clock punctual to moment started in line ahead vessel towing fog buoy behind to serve a guide to next astern buoy have at last moment caused to be coated with luminous paint to make visible in intense darkness went well with destroyer rode sea like gull while at moderate speed of ten knot torpedo boat be not only able to keep station perfectly also avoided washing crew overboard at ten thirty made prearranged signal escort hove to leaving to finish journey carry out perilous task alone knew exactly where be rather where ought to be for have kept careful reckoning of progress from moment of starting unless something have gone wrong be then exactly two mile south east of pinnacle rock lighthouse be necessary to make sure otherwise might lay mine in wrong place labour must be useless accordingly shaped course for lighthouse cautiously stood in with leadsman stationed at extremity of overhanging navigating bridge took continuous cast of lead reported result to through number who stood outside cabin called to through open window while stood at table with chart spread open before pricking off position minute after minute comparing leadsmen result with shown on chart two agreeing accurately at length reached point beyond must be dangerous to go ordered engine to be stopped reversed at same time stepping out on to bridge to ascertain if anything must be seen be a thick a hedge lighthouse lantern be unlighted there be not even gleam from searchlight on cliff above to enable to verify position true roar of breaker close at hand told be not far from shore be have to guide there be nothing for therefore to go ahead do best must there be need for to enter into detailed technical description of operation of laying mine will therefore merely state that despite adverse condition succeeded in accomplishing task withdrawing without mishap be not moment too soon for light of dawn be filtering through haze a dropped last mine moved cautiously away from completed field next thing be to find escort have left two mile out at sea be groping way slowly seaward through fog keeping sharp lookout for destroyer when in moment mist lifted sighted about mile distant at same instant four mile away to north east appeared squadron of five destroyer at once identified a second destroyer flotilla yet must scarcely be right for second consisted of only four boat while yonder be five with yes sixth close inshore turned to get binoculars out of case in order to investigate little more closely even a did so five destroyer became suddenly enveloped in wreathing cloud of powder smoke while sharp angry bark of quick fire gun broke morning silence five destroyer be unquestionably engaged in fight among firing continued quite briskly for about five minute then there pealed out sharp violent explosion great cloud of smoke shot into air firing abruptly ceased smoke cleared away just in time to show that one of destroyer craft have be unable to identify be sinking shattered shapeless wreck at moment cry from number distracted attention from interesting little drama be eagerly watching turning toward harbour mouth in response to pointing finger saw big four funnelled two masted cruiser instantly recognised a bayan coming foaming out of harbour evidently intent upon driving off destroyer be now busily launching boat to save crew of destroyer have by time foundered be in very act of issuing order for one of hotchkisses to be fired to warn destroyer when bayan opened fire upon with light gun be obliged to retreat double quick of course bayan be match for in matter of speed so after covering retreat of second destroyer be creeping along close inshore pausing to pick up survivor of sunken destroyer cruiser turned attention gun upon be out of range of light gun for unknown reason did not open fire upon with heavy weapon therefore quickened up to about own speed trifle le hoping might be able to entice out to where knew own cruiser squadron be waiting to cover retreat unfortunately for success of scheme admiral dewa who commanded squadron sooner heard firing than put on speed rushed to rescue emerging from mist becoming visible while still three mile away instant that be clear of fog bank must see what be happening squadron opened fire upon bayan with heavy gun when ship be in turn compelled to up helm beat hurried retreat to intense disgust for felt confident that if cruiser have only lain doggo in fog bank must have cajoled russian ship into following so far out to sea that retreat must have be cut off must have nabbed a be diana novik came rushing out to rescue whereupon dewa who by time recognised mistake have made turned retired apparently in panic for great cloud of smoke be presently seen to be pouring from funnel of ship before ten minute be over became perfectly evident that admiral be playing foxy for despite cloud of smoke ship be barely holding own if indeed be doing a much a naturally in koryu at once took cue from admiral stoked up for be worth using a much small coal a must scrape together in order to increase volume of smoke pouring from funnel while allowed novik to gain upon trifle from time to time then by apparently desperate effort drew away from again time really looked a though ruse be going to prove successful for three russian cruiser continued to chase with utmost pertinacity determination chapter eight petropavlosk lured to doom explanation of russian cruiser pertinacity be soon made plain to admiral dewa by wireless message picked up addressed to captain of novik decoded ran thus keep in touch with enemy attack until join two battleship askold following to support signed makarov of course did not know anything about until afterward koryu not being fitted with wireless installation dewa at once made code signal to instructing to continue present tactic while be being done wireless operator be busily engaged in transmitting code message to admiral togo who be at moment lurking enveloped in mist thirty mile away near miao tao island with whole battle squadron new cruiser nisshin kasuga makarov however be evidently ignorant of fact atmosphere in neighbourhood of port arthur be now quite clear to lookout on highest point about fortress japanese ship be visible save cruiser squadron be undoubtedly in full retreat from pursuing russian ship be perfectly evident be afraid of be moment opportunity for russian admiral have long be pining moment when weak japanese force entirely unsupported lay at mercy now must smash accordingly hurried aboard petrofiavlosk signalled poltava askold of like flagship have steam up to weigh at once proceed to sea be done with marvellous smartness considering that craft be russian presently out came funnel belching immense volume of black smoke water leaping foaming about bow a pounded after at utmost speed after be only about fourteen knot meanwhile dewa who be bringing up rear in asama by speed of ship rest of squadron regulated theirs be very cleverly allowing russian to slowly overtake while russian be straining nerve to do so stoking up furiously wasting coal in most reckless manner then came order from admiral to to increase speed pas ahead of squadron out of harm way a be about to open fire upon russian of course there be nothing for to obey did forthwith when have got about mile ahead gradually slowed down again if there be fun toward be not going to miss besides be just possible might be of use for following russian battleship cruiser there be now coming up hand over hand crowd of destroyer against koryu hotchkisses might be brought into play admiral dewa only allowed just bare time to get ahead of squadron when made signal to open fire upon pursuer with cruiser inch turret gun signal have be awaited with utmost impatience be promptly responded to with steady deadly deliberate fire upon bayan be leading russian line before officer have time to realise what be happening shell be hurtling about raining against bow upon deck punishing so severely that have to stop engine allow rest of fleet to pas ahead russian fleet have thus far be coming on in line ahead now hurriedly formed line abreast two battleship opening fire upon cruiser with inch gun luckily for although water be russian aim be bad shell flew over on side of none hit then dewa who be far too good tactician to pit cruiser against battleship gave order to increase speed ran out of range undamaged only just out of range for wanted to draw russian ship so far away from port arthur that admiral togo might have chance to come up slip in between fortress cut off retreat force to fight without doubt must have be successful have not capricious weather played scurvy trick at critical moment when russian be eighteen mile off land in south easterly direction from port arthur for be at moment that fog have hitherto hidden togo approaching fleet suddenly cleared revealing to russian lookout on liau ti shan height japanese warship racing up from south west approach of japanese be instantly frantically signalled to wireless station in turn wirelessed alarming intelligence to russian admiral few moment study of chart revealed to makarov precariousness of situation if turned retreated at once might possibly escape by skin of teeth get back into harbour before togo ship must get up to cut off did not hesitate moment up went signal to retire over went russian helm away scuttled back toward lair even faster than came out while cruiser keenly on watch for such movement also wheeled sharply in pursuit keeping up steady fire upon bayan novik rearmost ship in russian line naturally koryu turned when cruiser did following up at full speed until be close in rear while dewa be far too busy attending to pursuit to spare attention to doings be at juncture that russian destroyer made gallant effort to check pursuit by distracting attention from big craft to believing that held important advantage over in point of speed boldly slowed down dropped astern in two division made determined demonstration on two flank repeatedly threatening to make dash close in use torpedo there be one exceptionally audacious craft pertinacity of caused to take particular notice of keep specially watchful eye upon because speedily came to conclusion that be doing more than merely demonstrate be bent upon mischief be making dead set at asama most valuable ship getting right to windward of pouring dense volume of black smoke from four funnel so forming screen for herself under cover of be evidently trying to edge in to within effective torpedo range of course asama one two of other cruiser opened fire upon with light gun who have crept up to windward saw that smoke screen be serving purpose admirably that although projectile be falling round be not being hit occurred to that now be time when in koryu might be able to render little useful service own destroyer having be unfortunately ordered to return to rendezvous time before be now out of sight accordingly gave order for gunner to stand by hotchkisses rang for full speed also calling down to engineer for very last ounce of steam must get out of boiler like arrow shot from bow koryu started forward edging well out to windward of destroyer opened brisk fire upon with hotchkisses aiming at deck tube round have seen men busily clustering be well that did so for russian be in very act of launching torpedo at moment indeed actually did launch by one of extraordinary fluke sometimes happen be so difficult to describe convincingly one of shot struck weapon at instant that issued from tube wrecking propeller rudder sending to bottom evidently destroyer crew have be so completely absorbed in attempt upon asama that have be oblivious to approach now seeing bearing menacingly down upon skipper suddenly shifted helm must fain have beaten retreat a happened however have by time drawn up abreast be between friend so evidently came to conclusion that there be nothing for to fight way out accordingly made dash to cut out across bow at same time turning whole battery of gun upon instantly ordered men to leave gun get away aft out of way of shot dismissing quartermaster also taking wheel in stead at such short range shot must not possibly miss in le than minute bow fore deck showed very pretty general average pound shell blowing hole through plating wrecking topgallant forecastle while several pound projectile pierced funnel blew away fore topmast knocked one corner of wheelhouse to smithereens did not care purpose have in mind be fully worth damage more knew now that unless personally be hit disabled must be able to accomplish for meant to give impudent destroyer stem to run down sink knowing that stout bow must shear through thin plating a though be paper koryu have speed to do destroyer having lost much of speed by barnacle weed on bottom exposed at roll evidently russian did not realise purpose until be too late seemed to think be fool who be giving chance to inflict deadly raking upon a crossed bow be not until suddenly shifted helm rendering collision inevitable that what be going to happen dawned upon then there arose sudden outcry a crew forsook gun made mad dash at two small boat slung to davit there be frantic jangling of bell down in destroyer engine room officer on bridge snatched revolver from belt snapped off five shot at in a many second none of took effect then be upon with scarcely perceptible shock struck fair square amidships right in wake of where judged boiler room must be there be horrible crackling rending of wood iron a stem sheared into through deck clamour of yell from crew a fought with other in mad haste to lower boat destroyer heeled over until be almost on beam end volleying succession of deep heavy boom accompanied by tremendous outburst of steam proclaimed that boiler have burst at same instant seemed to crumple up break completely in two bow half sweeping along port side while stern half drove past to starboard crew unable to get boat afloat leaping desperately overboard moment before striking craft have rung down order to engine room to stop engine shouted for crew to stand by with rope end now several of be hove by mean of managed to drag three russian up on to deck then backed astern fished up eight more of whom marched below locked up securely other poor fellow including captain of boat must have gone down with for saw nothing more of have taught destroyer lesson for thenceforth kept distance examining into own condition discovered that injury arising out of collision amounted to about a much paint scraped off a might be replaced by content of pound tin while other damage be so high above waterline a to make of practical account have not man injured so considered that have emerged from encounter very cheaply be just half past nine o'clock by watch when bursting through curtain of haze battle fleet hove in sight in south west quarter with flag flying water leaping foaming about cutwaters fine white feather of steam playing on top of waste pipe indicating that stoker be maintaining full head of steam in boiler japanese luck again be just too late for at moment russian fleet entered protective zone of shore battery with very poor attempt at bravado slowed down to speed of about six knot while sevastopol pobieda peresviet came steaming out to meet have managed to escape by skin of teeth now in accordance with instruction given to admiral not to risk ship by pitting against shore battery also be obliged to slow up finally to stop engine a matter of fact time have come for to retire evidently everybody be curious to see what must be result of mine laying operation of preceding night by common consent lay to have not long to wait saw signalling going on between flagship three craft have come out to meet fleet saw trio fall into line in rear of retreating fleet then while glass be glued to eye a watched procession of great ship sweeping majestically toward harbour mouth from be then little more than mile distant suddenly beheld tremendous flash of fire envelop bow of petropavlosk flagship be leading way into harbour flash be accompanied by upheaval of gigantic cone of water outburst of thick yellow smoke at once told that one of mine have got in deadly work instantly great exultant roar of banzai nippon burst forth from throat of eagerly watching japanese be a instantly checked when began to realise full magnitude of disaster have befallen enemy for even before sound of shattering explosion reached ear saw fore topmast fall saw long tongue of flame leap up from deck saw two funnel whirl over fall one after other while bridge pilot house foremast soared high into air so tremendous be force of explosion actually one of inch gun turret be torn bodily from strong fastening hurled twenty foot aloft to crash downward again upon hapless ship deck while great burst of flame probably due to explosion of boiler shot up where two funnel have stood moment before series of heavy explosion followed seeming to indicate explosion of magazine then doomed ship became enveloped in thick haze of green smoke in midst of played great stream of fire through terrible green haze be just able to see that have taken heavy list to starboard then bow dipped stern rose until two propeller be lifted out of water great mushroom shaped pillar of smoke shot up from be gone have happened in short space of two minute during shell from battleship be falling thick fast about russian ship have stopped engine when explosion occurred while of lowered boat in hope of being able to render assistance to unfortunate flagship with disappearance of flagship russian fleet resumed way toward harbour pobieda now being at head of line scarcely have started engine when enormous pillar of flame water smoke enveloped amidships too have come into contact with one of mine fortunately for with much le disastrous result than attending destruction of petropavlosk instantly listed showing that be severely damaged beyond nothing further happened so far a must see except that second explosion appeared to have created perfect panic among russian who immediately opened terrific fire with gun big small apparently at random for must see shot throwing up great jet of foam in water round later learned that when second explosion occurred one aboard one of ship yelled that fleet be surrounded by japanese submarine discharging torpedo hence frantic firing at water of course assertion be groundless since a matter of fact japanese have submarine be not very surprising that with two disaster one following so closely upon heel of other russian must jump to conclusion that have be attacked by submarine for must be remembered that have carefully educated into belief that mine be quite harmless loss of petropavlosk be terrible misfortune for russian for be one of most formidable ship being armed with four inch gun of most recent design mounted in pair in two big turret with a secondary battery twelve inch quick fire gun eight of be mounted in pair in four small turret placed two on beam behind inch steel armour while other four be in casemates similarly protected have six torpedo tube conjectured that probably have torpedo in tube exploded at time of disaster a for pobieda spy be able to ascertain that mine damaged have breached three of big compartment smaller one so that be only with utmost difficulty be got into harbour beached in time to save also one set of belleville boiler be so severely damaged a to be rendered useless consequently too be put out of action for considerable period thus at one fell swoop russian fleet be reduced in strength by two battleship worst loss be admiral for be indisputable that makarov be most able energetic enterprising naval leader possessed two day later more mine be laid in port arthur roadstead attempt be made to entice russian fleet to come out fight attempt be failure a matter of fact afterwards transpired that upon receipt of report announcing loss of petropavlosk damage to pobieda authority at petersburg have telegraphed order to effect that port arthur fleet be on account to leave harbour until arrival of admiral skrydloff makarov successor failing in admiral togo dispatched cruiser nisshin kasuga to pigeon bay to make high angle fire attack upon fortress ship in harbour be not engaged in of attempt admiral considering have well earned be deserving of few day rest besides very properly wished to give of other officer chance to distinguish understood that with exception of silencing new battery russian have built commanding bay bombardment be not attended with very important result on following day little admiral whom have named japanese nelson dispatched squadron of ten cruiser accompanied by torpedo flotilla to attempt to bring vladivostock squadron to battle squadron be accompanied by cargo steamer named kinshiu maru loaded with coal spare store for use of squadron while away from base expedition be placed under command of vice admiral kamimura with cruiser idzumi a flagship have now have little rest a there seemed to be immediate prospect of serious fighting at port arthur volunteered for expedition be temporarily attached to idzumi a supernumerary left base among elliot island on th of april after uneventful cruise of week duration arrived at port of gensan on eastern coast of korea about two third of distance from elliots to vladivostock there be japanese consul at place upon arrival off port commandant came off in steam launch boarding idzumi requested interview with admiral be at once granted pair be conducted to kamimura cabin where remained for best part of hour at close of interview visitor entered steam launch returned to shore ten minute later kamimura sent for when entered cabin found poring over chart of east coast of korea welcomed with usual elaborate courtesy of japanese in intercourse with other a well a with stranger invited to approach table be particularly glad that be good fortune to have pleasure of honourable company captain swinburne began for occasion have just arisen upon think service may prove of utmost value see little place iwon on chart two honourable gentleman who have just visited commandant of gensan japanese consul stationed here inform that rumour have reached ear of certain suspicious occurrence at iwon seem to point to possibility that russian government may be contemplating dispatch of large body of troop to vladivostock by rail embarkation there for iwon at spot may land march across korea take troop at port arthur in rear to tell truth have not much faith in idea only point in favour being that movement must be wholly unanticipated by in view of information have just received be bounden duty to investigate matter therefore propose to dispatch kinshiu maru on reconnoitring expedition to iwon to ascertain what foundation if there may be for suspicion a of course be aware carry small detachment of troop who may be very useful must opposition be met with troop will of course be commanded by own officer while captain yago will continue to command ship being merchant seaman have have experience of landing troop be where service will prove of value especially must resistance be offered therefore want to change over temporarily to kinshiu still a supernumerary with authority for to take charge of superintend landing subsequent embarkation arrangement be afraid will mean certain amount of disappointment for since a soon a have started will proceed in search of vladivostock fleet must endeavour to console with reflection may not find be able to entice to come out fight be true certainly did feel bit disappointed for most earnestly desired to see what be like to be engaged in regular pitched battle even though be only between couple of hostile squadron be where be to lend hand where required not to pick choose what must must not do in case be not going to make occasion for to be said that englishman have unwillingly accepted duty offered to therefore with a much cheerfulness a must muster expressed perfect readiness to do best whereupon kamimura gave written instruction dismissed to pack up such few of belonging a thought might need however a have only brought very limited kit aboard idzumi decided to take everything since must all go into small portmanteau meanwhile skipper of kinshiu have be signalled to have cabin prepared for for captain honda officer in command of troop to repair on board idzumi to receive instruction of course came at once have short interview with admiral left together honda doing honour of ship welcoming on board transport introducing fellow officer of whom seemed very jolly fellow with one desire namely to get to grip with russian left gensan that afternoon escorted by th torpedo boat flotilla under command of commander takebe cruiser weighing at same time heading east in hope of seeing hearing something of russian unfortunately for have not be under way couple of hour before ran into dense fog delayed progress to extent that did not reach iwon until morning of th found there long roughly constructed wooden jetty running far enough out from shore to give depth of about six foot alongside head at low water greatly facilitated landing ashore discovered certain artfully concealed field work of such character armed with few heavy gun might have pretty effectually covered landing unless interfered with by very powerful force visit be evidently quite unexpected for only found small body of russian troop about hundred so with squadron of cossack in possession few shell from torpedo boat sent to right about in double quick time destroyed earthwork jetty a precautionary measure having reconnoitred country for several mile in direction without discovering anything very alarming returned to ship same night without casualty of kind be now about six o'clock in evening during greater part of day weather have be beautifully fine toward three o'clock in afternoon heavy bank of dark slate coloured cloud have gathered in eastern quarter of sky so quickly rising spreading that by five o'clock entire firmament have become obscured wind dropped to dead calm light dwindled to murky unnatural kind of twilight there be few flickerings of sheet lightning low down on horizon occasionally accompanied by low muttering of distant thunder mercury be dropping with rather ominous rapidity confess that for own part felt bit puzzled did not quite know what to make of weather indication might be that nothing worse than violent thunderstorm be brewing against theory there be to be set sudden ominous decline of barometric pressure have fulfilled task be preparing to get under way when takebe who be in command of torpedo flotilla came aboard to consult with skipper a to advisability of going to sea in face of such threatening condition unfortunately escort be composed entirely of torpedo boat although be staunch enough little craft of kind be nothing like such good sea boat a destroyer latter be under able management capable of riding out practically weather with torpedo boat be rather different story of that have with be small rather ancient engine be not to be too implicitly relied upon boiler be nearly worn out indeed must never have be detailed for service have be thought that there must be likelihood of real righting if by chance must happen to be caught at sea in anything like heavy gale anything must go wrong with engine boiler probability be that must founder taking hand with be consideration be weighing upon commander takebe mind when came aboard kinshiu to consult with captain yagi be evident from first word that be in favour of adopting prudent course staying where be until must be seen how matter be going to turn out yagi looked at thing with different eye in first place yagi did not believe that portent indicated anything more serious than at worst sharp thunderstorm while at same time instruction from kamimura be that reconnaissance be to be executed with utmost dispatch that done be to immediately return to gensan so that might be on spot in event of cruiser needing to re bunker in case must come on to blow a commander takebe seemed to fear have apprehension concerning kinshiu be good sturdy little ship must weather out worst be at likely to happen two discussed matter together for quite hour occasionally referring to for opinion of be considerably older than have have much more varied experience than myself of somewhat peculiar weather condition of sea of japan therefore said a little a possible did not attempt to offer word of advice to of finally matter ended by of having own way be to say yagi decided to leave for gensan forthwith unescorted taking such trifling risk a there might be agreed amounted practically to none at while takebe determined to study safety of command by remaining where be awaiting development accordingly a soon a commander have gone order be given to get anchor about seven o'clock steamed out to sea chapter nine adventure of kinshiu maru by time that be fairly out at sea be pitch dark not star to be seen to add still further to obscurity light mist gathered a so often doe in japan sea so that by eight o'clock be only with utmost difficulty that be able to discern small junk have in tow have be employed by to facilitate landing of troop weather still continued overcast play of sheet lightning gradually grew more vivid frequent there be wind not much sea a time went on began to think with yagi that takebe apprehension have be groundless that be in for nothing worse than may be thunderstorm after spent couple of hour in saloon night watching infantry officer of whom there be six playing wonderful game of card of must make nothing then strolled up on bridge to see what weather be like to have yarn with yagi before turning in for night be still hazy very overcast there be not breath of air save draught created by motion of ship there be very beautiful display of sheet lightning almost continuous lighted up cloud mist sea in most marvellous manner ship be then heading south east with light burning brightly a in duty bound be sitting astride camp stool with shoulder resting against port rail of bridge while yagi also occupying camp stool sat facing be spinning yarn sort of japanese fairy tale seemed to be about geisha while be staring contemplatively into darkness over starboard bow watching wonderful play of lightning when suddenly a flash lighted up gloom thought caught momentary glimpse of three four dark shape about mile away broad on starboard bow if have really seen shape must only be ship be showing light therefore ruthlessly cut into skipper yarn by directing attention to point where momentary vision have revealed what be that say exclaimed ship without light then must be admiral still hunting for vladivostock squadron well have not seen have better tell so at same time inquire whether have fresh order for mr uchida to chief officer squadron be away out there somewhere on starboard bow have goodness to honourably make night signal a wish to speak admiral uchida hurried away signal lantern being always kept ready for immediate use in le than minute be hoisted meanwhile there have be no further lightning flash to illuminate darkness rose to foot for be still steaming ahead at full speed have feeling that must be drawing pretty close to stranger a did so signal be answered by imperative order stop immediately at same instant brilliant protracted flicker of sheet lightning revealed four large ship not more than three cable length distant leading ship be big lump of four funnelled cruiser funnel coloured white with black top carried three mast second craft be very similar in general appearance to first also having four white black topped funnel three mast third be two masted three funnelled ship while fourth be of distinctly ancient appearance being of period when sail be a much used a steam have two funnel be barque rigged with royal yard across be now under steam with canvas furled have such ship in fleet while instantly identified barque rigged craft a russian cruiser rurik of vladivostock squadron squadron then for admiral kamimura be especially hunting be actually at sea have fallen in with there be not least doubt about in wardroom gunroom of japanese warship there be album containing beautiful complete set of photograph of ship in russian navy ship being pictured from at least four different point of view be part of officer duty to study photograph until have acquired ability to identify at sight russian warship might chance to encounter thus in leading ship of squadron in sight moment reflection enabled to recognise rossia with astern of gromoboi then bogatyr finally rurik jove exclaimed have done now with vengeance yagi four ship comprise russian vladivostock squadron be right under gun stop man for heaven sake be only thing can do if beggar will sink out of hand will probably do in case growled yagi a laid hand on engine room telegraph rang down order to stop engine a honourably say captain be only thing to be done although mean interior of russian prison for hand of a kinshiu engine stopped rossia turned searchlight upon brought gun to bear lowered two boat crew of must see be armed to teeth at same moment two destroyer loomed up out of darkness one of stationed on port bow while other placed upon starboard quarter of with tube gun manned evidently russian did not mean to leave smallest loophole for escape six japanese infantry officer noting stoppage of engine came rushing up on deck to learn what be matter upon hearing that strange ship have stopped be russian warship hurried away below again presumably thought to give order of sort to troop under command rossia with way have on have by time closed to within about twenty five fathom of at juncture officer on bridge hailed ordering skipper to send boat good ejaculated yagi will do so will not go aboard rossia oh will slip away in darkness make for land will honourably accompany will not captain russian prison have attraction for eh be right friend have not answered for reason must decline to accompany because will never get away yagi how can with searchlight turned full upon destroyer where be nevertheless will try answered skipper turned away to bellow order to crew to clear away lower port lifeboat port side being shielded from glare of searchlight then heard order chief officer to superintend lowering of boat at same time to smuggle extra breaker of water bag two of biscuit into then turned again to if will not come with will honourably do friend demanded oh said will join infantry officer below see what be going to do without further parley ran down ladder made way below to saloon where found six officer sitting at table looking very pale grave well gentleman cried here be in nice little russian trap what do propose to do thought at first of performing hari kari said one of captain nagai with whom be discussing subject of hari kari only night before last appears to have come round to way of thinking that be better to live for emperor than to die for argues a did that dead man can hing for emperor whereas living man may be able to do many thing in statement there be truth therefore propose to surrender to russian in honourable hope that may be able to effect escape sooner later return to fight for what do honourably propose to do captain oh said to surrender seems most sensible thing to do doubtless will do eventually meanwhile however think will toddle up on deck again see how yagi ship crew be getting on be going to try to slip away in ship lifeboat know banzai cried one of officer hope will honourably succeed having decided to surrender think safest place be down here doubtless will soon see again y e s possibly replied will not surrender until last moment so if see again may conclude have found mean of effecting escape have seized saying shook hand with round returned to deck during brief visit to saloon yagi men have got boat into water be now pulling boldly for rossia noticed that directly passed out of area of radiance cast by searchlight shifted helm sharply crossing cruiser bow be evidently endeavouring to slip past in gloom of own shadow then suddenly idea occurred to kinshiu maru have in tow small junk lighter have used to facilitate landing of soldier at iwon where be now crouching low under cover of bulwark to avoid being seen by aboard rossia slipped aft cautiously peering over taffrail saw that have drifted right in under kinshiu counter where be momentarily threatening to bilge against steamer iron rudder a two craft ground against other on swell forward half of lay in deep shadow of kinchiu stern shadow rendered still deeper more opaque by vivid brilliance of searchlight beam covered stern half of immediately occurred to that if must climb down into unobserved cut adrift might possibly contrive to avoid entering russian prison after sooner thought of than done moment be propitious towing hawser lay under hand in moment be down upon tiny forecastle hacking away at grass rope with pocket knife blade be keen a sailor knife must always be with few vigorous slash hawser be severed be adrift then taking advantage of heave of two craft managed to move junk until lay entirely in shadow cast by kinshiu hull at juncture heard gruff voice of russian overhead on transport deck thinking discretion better part of valour under circumstance dropped off junk short fore deck into willow hold there concealed lest inquisitive russian must peer over bulwark catch sight of order up on deck again know whether occurred to of enemy to look over side think so at event if did nobody took trouble to come down search junk in few minute voice ceased took that visitor have gone below to search ship if have what must happen to with over hundred armed japanese soldier down there have not long to wait for answer to question about two minute of silence succeeded to sudden cessation of russian voice on deck then muffled crack of pistol shot rang out from kinshiu interior instantly followed by shout of banzai nippon crack of several rifle there arose sudden outburst of yell execration in russian stampede of many foot along deck sound of scuffling hand to hand fight volley of order from russian officer in command of boarding party hoarse hail from one of warship then rattle splash of oar hastily thrown out evidently japanese soldier have given intruder warm reception hurried departure of boarding party be quickly followed by rolling volley of rifle fire from kinshiu apparently directed upon retreating boat for heard cry groan seemed to proceed from then from rossia came sudden snapping bark of quick firers machine gun storm of missile crashed through transport thin bulwark flew whining overhead intermingled with shriek groan excited shout from japanese soldier who have evidently resolved to die fighting rather than surrender sound awakened fighting instinct within felt that let happen what must must be among gallant fellow doing share of work nipped out from under junk short deck intent upon climbing aboard kinshiu again then found that during short period of seclusion junk have parted company be now good twenty foot distant from transport true might jump overboard swim intervening space be actually poising for dive when question flashed into brain how be to get aboard how climb vessel smooth iron side there be rope hanging overboard save severed towing hawser have cut through so high up even when steamer stern dipped end did not reach within couple of foot of water recognised that whether must not must now stay where be for return to steamer be impossible while stood there on junk short fore deck watching scene with fascinated eye awful unequal duel went on between japanese rifle rossia machine gun soldier frenziedly yelling banzai nippon between volley while russian gunner plied piece in grim silence kinshiu deck knew must be by time veritable shamble for russian cruiser lay close aboard machine gun must sweep transport deck from stem to stern moreover rapid ominous slackening of rifle fire testified eloquently to frightful carnage be proceeding cry of banzai nippon be no longer thundered forth in defiant roar be raised by few voice only be almost drowned by dreadful shriek moan of wounded dying then suddenly there occurred frightful explosion kinshiu maru be hove up on mountain of foaming water belched forth fire smoke air became suddenly full of flying splinter wreckage heavy fragment of smote full upon forehead knocked back into junk hold a sens left be dimly conscious of wailing cry pealing out across water of sayonara farewell for ever be last good bye to emperor country who be nearest dearest to of heroic little band of japanese infantry men who preferred to die fighting gloriously rather than win inglorious safety by surrender russian have made end of affair by torpedoing transport must have sunk within very few minute when recovered sens be broad daylight for few moment knew not where be what have happened to be conscious of most splitting headache from have ever suffered in life next thing dawned upon be be lying in bottom of small craft of sort be rolling plunging most atrociously on short choppy sea be chilled to very marrow that water be washing about over with motion of boat be wet to skin although shivering with cold blood scorched vein a though be liquid fire sat up staring vaguely about then became aware of curious stiff feeling in skin of face putting hand to head to still throbbing smart of found that hair be clogged with sticky kind of liquid upon looking at hand found to be blood evidently own at once explained curious stiff feeling of face be probably caused by dry caked blood to make sure sprang open case of watch polished surface serving well enough for mirror gravely studied reflected image must have presented ghastly sight for whole face be mask of blood out of eye glared feverishly then a continued to stare at interior of watch case wondering what meant memory of event of preceding night knew must be preceding night because watch be still going came back to understood where be scrambling giddily to foot looked about saw bucket rolling to fro on junk bottom board sight suggested idea to taking bucket end of small line bent on to handle somehow managed to hoist up on to small foredeck lying prone for dared not a yet trust to stand lowered bucket drew up again full of clean sparkling salt water into plunged head keeping immersed a long a breath must allow meanwhile removing blood from face hair a well a must contact of cold salt water made lacerated forehead scalp smart most atrociously yet relieved headache greatly refreshed then stripping off wet shirt tore long strip from thoroughly saturating in clean salt water bound up wound a best must after felt distinctly better then sitting on little deck looked about to see if must discover trace of last night horror there be moderate breeze blowing instantly recognised that junk must have drifted several mile from spot where disaster have occurred there be nothing to be seen not so much a solitary scrap of wreckage within radius of mile beyond everything be blotted out by curtain of haze by time have pretty completely recovered sens be able to fully realise situation be wet cold feverish horribly thirsty be sole occupant of small leaky junk of about twenty five ton without mast sail having be removed in order better to fit for duty of carrying troop have pair of sweep aboard be true be so ponderous that demanded strength of four men to work be therefore quite useless to even have known precisely where be did not knew be be fifty mile thereabout to southward eastward of iwon might a well have be five hundred mile from place for mean have of returning to even of making shot at fact be be adrift in hulk utmost must do be to keep afloat if possible patiently wait for something to come along take off realising proceeded to overhaul junk with view to ascertaining what be resource remembered that cask of fresh water have be put aboard for use of troop while landing embarking soon found still more than half full snugly stowed away under foredeck with lot of raffle consisting of odds end of line of varying size fragment of fishing net few short length of planking other utterly useless stuff drank dipper after dipper of water until raging thirst be quenched then stripped off clothes wrung out spread to dry in wind while rubbed body dry with hand employing considerable amount of exertion in order to restore warmth to cramped limb in effort be at length successful next business be to search other end of junk in vague hope might find something in way of food there be none therefore have to go hungry have bucket however with bailed hooker practically dry a much to pas time keep warm a for other reason then having done everything must think of remained for be to wait a patiently a might be for something to come along rescue position be by mean enviable one have food for moment did not greatly matter since smart of wound have made feverish have appetite on other hand suffered from incessant thirst even copious draught of water in frequently indulged did little to allay weather be overcast there be thin mist lying upon surface of grey sea circumscribed view to radius of le than mile air be keenly raw recognised that be necessary to keep constantly active to counteract effect of chilly atmosphere did bustling about overhauling raffle in junk executing good deal of utterly useless work varied from time to time by taking long spell of watching in hope of sighting craft to might signal for assistance also repeatedly bathed head in sea water did little toward reducing feeling of feverishness from be suffering toward afternoon condition became more favourable cloud broke sun came out took feeling of rawness out of air so that longer suffered from cold mist melted away affording clear view to horizon sea be bare there be not even so much a blur of steamer smoke staining sky in direction began to wonder how long might be before must be picked up whether indeed must be picked up at knew of course that non arrival of kinshiu at gensan must give rise to speculation probably search for must be instituted along course might be expected to steer be already several mile from course hourly drifting farther from question of importance to be whether search must extend over sufficiently wide area to take in remainder of day passed uneventfully for must hing beyond what have already indicated craft of description hove in sight toward sunset pang of hunger began to manifest watched sea until night closed down then when became so dark that further watching be useless crept in under fore deck among raffle turned in upon bed a have be able to prepare for during day in anticipation of possibility might be obliged to pas night aboard junk a might be supposed under circumstance earlier part of night at least be full of discomfort for somewhere along in small hour dropped off to sleep eventually slept soundly to be awakened by noise of steam blowing off close at hand started up listened for moment to assure that sound be not illusion satisfied that be real scrambled up on junk deck to be greeted with sight of several ship of war close at hand single glance sufficed to assure that trouble be at end for ship in sight be of admiral kamimura squadron idzumi being hove to at le than cable length distant in very act of lowering boat there be several officer on bridge be close enough to enable to see that be scrutinising junk through glass therefore waved to be waved to in reply few minute later boat in charge of lieutenant dashed smartly alongside officer scrambled nimbly up junk low side think have not recognised until then although knew other very well gazed at dubiously for moment then hand shot out to grasp mine a exclaimed hillo dear swinburne what doe mean what be doing here be alone answered question by informing in a few word a possible of what have happened to ill fated kinshiu maru then got down into boat pulled across to idzumi where kamimura officer be impatiently awaiting gave warmest of welcome must not even permit to tell story lieutenant who have rescued assuring that have already obtained particular must tell a well a must be accordingly at once turned over to care of ship surgeon made comfortable in sick bay squadron immediately resuming cruise now that tension of looking after be relaxed reaction set in with high fever for next four day be really ill with frequent interval of delirium there be complication of kind by end of sixth day be so far recovered a to be able to dress sit up for hour two everybody aboard idzumi be exceedingly kind to a kind indeed a though have be brother fraternal feeling of kindly interest be not confined to idzumi alone kamimura informing with smile that have become quite habit for other ship to signal inquiry a to condition morning a officer of ship came off watch came tiptoeing along to inquire after if happened to be awake doctor permitted must sit chat with for hour so before retiring to cabin by mean gradually acquired missing link in story of squadron abortive cruise from conversation gathered that after squadron kinshiu parted company off gensan while in transport headed for iwon squadron proceeded toward vladivostock being much delayed by dense fog through steamed at half speed ship towing fog buoy a guide to ship immediately following though even with assistance keeping touch be only accomplished with extreme difficulty thus proceeded until by dead reckoning arrived at point seventy mile south of vladivostock when weather being much too thick to permit of fighting enemy even must two fleet blunder together admiral kamimura decided to retrace step arriving at gensan two day later here japanese consul boarded idzumi imparted to admiral startling information on previous day four strange warship accompanied by couple of destroyer have appeared off port warship being later identified a constituting vladivostock squadron destroyer have entered harbour boarded small japanese craft loaded with fish ordered crew to get into boat go ashore have then torpedoed expended torpedo being probably at least a valuable a ship sank later on russian cruiser have entered harbour have left again without doing damage in reply to inquiry concerning kinshiu maru consul replied that escort have yet returned information caused admiral kamimura uneasiness since there have be time for to do that have be ordered to do to get back to gensan squadron be actually getting anchor preparatory to departure to hunt for transport when commander takebe with torpedo boat arrived questioned a to whereabouts of kinshiu expressed surprise at non arrival briefly relating particular of discussion have resulted in transport leaving iwon unescorted while remained in harbour to see what weather development be going to be be enough for kamimura takebe story in conjunction with of consul at gensan convinced admiral that something very serious have happened at once gave order for torpedo flotilla to proceed along coast to hunt for news of transport while with squadron started off in chase of russian be on morning following second departure of squadron from gensan that sighted junk from be rescued be possible that in eagerness to overtake russian might have pushed on without pausing to examine small apparently derelict junk for fact fortunately for two three of idzumi officer recognised a junk kinshiu have taken with to facilitate landing operation at iwon after have taken off junk japanese have pushed ahead direct for vladivostock in hope of arriving there before russian in hope be disappointed upon arrival russian cruiser be seen to be already back in harbour be accomplished be to drive precipitately back into harbour two russian destroyer have impudence courage to come out threaten also to exchange few shot with russian fort chapter ten ito yarn arrived at rendezvous among hall island on afternoon of may rd found place practically deserted who be left behind reporting that admiral togo fleet have left for port arthur previous day for purpose of making third attempt to seal up russian fleet in harbour be by time making excellent progress toward recovery idzumi surgeon considered must do still better in hospital ashore be therefore landed within hour of ship coming to anchor that evening found comfortably established in roomy convalescent ward in charge of excellent assiduous medical nursing staff latter be composed of young japanese woman than whom think must be impossible to find more gentle attentive tender sick room attendant know whether be more than usually kind to because happened to be foreigner who be helping to fight japan battle in hour of need appeared to that be vying with other a to who must do most for have be king must not have done more for than did on following morning having be assisted to rise dress by two nurse whose especial charge be established by near open window overlooking roadstead be making play with particularly appetising breakfast when glancing out of window saw big fleet of transport arriving there be eighty three in for have curiosity to count while be coming to anchor fleet appeared consisting of warship have be to port arthur to assist in attempt to seal up harbour so interested be in arrival that in watching allowed breakfast to go cold nothing must satisfy nurse that must get breakfast did have scarcely finished belated meal be attended to by surgeon when door of ward be thrown open in rushed former lieutenant ito now captain of destroyer akatsuki have volunteered for service on nd appeared upon return have encountered idzumi number who have related to ito adventure aboard junk good fellow have straightway come to hospital to see pay respect also shrewdly suspected to spin yarn of own adventure insisted upon hearing story first when have told in fewest word possible told own stripped of somewhat peculiar mode of expression ran somewhat a follows two day ago began news reached here that soldier have crossed river yalu thereupon admiral made up mind that moment have arrived for further attempt to be made to seal up russian fleet in port arthur harbour a be aware togo have for time be quietly making preparation for attempt twelve steamer have be lying at anchor here having be provided especially for purpose know also that of twelve eight have be prepared in usual manner by placing heavy charge of gun cotton in bottom connected with bridge by electric wire so that officer in command might be able to explode charge sink ship at proper moment while on top of charge hull of ship be converted into solid rock like mass by filling with concrete made of stone old railway metal other iron cement five of ship be also fitted with searchlight so that might not again have to contend with difficulty of finding harbour entrance commander hayashi whom believe know be appointed to command expedition volunteer be called for in usual way of course offered togo be good enough to appoint to totomi maru small craft of nineteen hundred ton under splendid fellow named honda left here at noon of nd escorted by gunboat akagi chokai second third fourth fifth destroyer division ninth tenth fourteenth torpedo boat flotilla when started weather be everything must be desired there be wind water be like glass while for wonder air be crystal clear also there must be good slice of moon to light on way after sunset weather be too fine to last know how be in sea dear chap toward barometer began to fall very rapidly about eight o'clock fresh south easterly breeze sprang up quite suddenly became hazy sea got up rapidly by six bell in first watch be blowing hard weather became so thick that lost sight of other heard to day that hayashi seeing what be coming made signal to postpone attempt never saw signal went on rolling plunging through short choppy sea in most uncomfortable manner appears that alarm be first given to russian about two o'clock next morning by appearance of what looked like searchlight far out at sea directed full upon mouth of harbour of course searchlight on golden hill be at once brought into play chanced that a beam swept sea five of torpedo boat be sighted attempting to slip into harbour be thousand pity that be prematurely discovered for skipper have formed bold plan to enter harbour torpedo ship must find taking chance of being able to get away afterward of course discovery frustrated plan for so hot fire be opened upon by three russian gunboat be guarding harbour mouth that to have persisted must have meant destruction so be obliged to retire for admiral must not have thanked for throwing away boat uselessly then searchlight picked up mikawa maru be leading three other explosion ship straight for harbour terrific fire be opened upon russian evidently recognising a merchant ship guessing at business from sosa report appears that having seen flash of gun firing upon torpedo boat be under impression that certain of explosion ship have already entered harbour be being fired upon by russian a drew nearer in searchlight revealed mistake showing that instead of being one of last be first to arrive therefore called down into engine room for ounce of steam must give went full pelt for harbour through perfect tornado of projectile great small few of however touched ship though be lashing sea into spray round without sustaining serious damage mikawa charged right into narrow channel at top speed at point came into violent collision with something afterward proved to be boom ' constructed of stout balk of timber steel hawser ponderous chain cable strongly lashed together stretched right athwart channel from shore to shore be of nearly two thousand ton measurement with way that have on went through boom a though have be thread on went until not only searchlight also golden hill fort be on starboard quarter have penetrated farther than other japanese ship have done since war be declared when having reached point where channel be narrowest sosa skipper swung athwart fairway amid cheer of crew deafening explosion of gun shell coolly blew bottom out sank crew just having time to scramble into two boat a steamer foundered be that fine splendid agreed heartily what became of fine chap sosa crew did manage to escape sosa three men of boat crew contrived although be wounded to pull out to torpedo boat be picked up replied ito russian fired upon other boat destroyed crew despite sosa desperate effort to save next ship to arrive be sakura maru be about mile half ahead of in totomi be able to see everything happened to believe be opportune arrival gave gallant sosa companion chance to escape because of course a soon a sakura be seen russian gunner gave attention to be grand sight to see be more than thousand ton bigger than mikawa rushing straight for harbour mouth at utmost speed with water foaming about bow thin stream of smoke spark issuing from funnel whole hull spar rigging funnel standing up black silhouette between white beam of searchlight with shell exploding about deluging with foam apparently doing harm stood on evidently under full head of steam for must see white feather ' at top of waste pipe until reached pinnacle rock there anchored sank be manned almost entirely by cadet a illustration of consummate coolness with behaved let tell that when ship went down actually have presence of mind to take flare aloft with burnt from crosstrees to guide into channel of course russian fired upon shot away first one mast then other then be called upon to surrender of russian actually launching boat to take off floating wreckage cadet be imbued with true samurai spirit preferred death to surrender defended with revolver from who approached until japanese be slain then came turn of totomi maru being third ship to arrive well have not much to say about what did what happened to must be merely repetition of what have already described like predecessor went in at full speed struck floating object two terrific blow just a entered channel swept on amid hurricane of shell bullet shrieking whining about ear until came to wreck of mikawa there honda who be about a cool chap under fire a be stopped reversed engine swung ship athwart channel with bow a close a must guess to mikawa taffrail let go two anchor one ahead one aft calmly sank craft russian kept searchlight upon peppered well with rifle fire until totomi went down then have other fish to honourably fry a english say for aikoku maru be now racing in toward harbour mouth be high time for to attend to turned searchlight upon opened fire upon with weapon must hurl shot presently when be within about thousand yard of entrance fired observation mine a passed over down went taking engine room stoke hold crew with then there ensued spell a dear swinburne honourably call interlude possibly be end for there be more ship in sight firing died down searchlight beam stared steadily out to seaward who have survived that saturnalia of slaughter have opportunity to slip out rejoin torpedo boat be lurking close in under shadow of cliff waiting to pick up honda commanded leading boat in party be making escape other be creeping along a close a possible to foot of cliff under golden hill in order to elude notice of russian above honda with fourteen men be about quarter of mile ahead have eleven men with have arrived at point believed to be rightly a event proved immediately beneath fort be staring contemplatively up at face of cliff towered above when came abreast of sort of cleft in rock at foot of lay several big boulder in great pile of be in water suddenly idea occurred to that might be possible for active men to climb cleft acting upon impulse of moment put boat helm hard starboard giving word easy ' headed in toward boulder minute later found in miniature harbour just large enough to receive boat big boulder forming sort of breakwater men said have of revolver cutlass with ' answered that have then ' said let give russian up above little surprise believe can climb cleft for one be determined to try who go with a have quite anticipated agreed to join in attempt so making fast boat painter to rock leaving to take care of herself scrambled out honourably taking lead a be right up went be very difficult climb in semi darkness for moon be hidden by cloud way be so steep that be obliged to push pull other up at length reached top then lay down in little hollow to recover breath fort crowned summit of steep hill immediately in front of for fully five minute patiently examined at end of time came to conclusion that only by rear must hope to approach undiscovered accordingly led men round to land side of fort taking time that might save breath crept slowly up slope until reached not only summit of hill actually parapet of fort peering over be able to see that be armed with eight inch canet gun there be including gun crew at least hundred men in place of intently staring out to seaward evidently in momentary expectation of seeing more explosion ship arrive have be possible for to have entered that fort at moment must have led men in must have honourably died for glory of nippon destroying a many of enemy a must before going out ' ourselves entry at least swiftly enough to take russian by surprise be not possible parapet being protected by substantial chevaux de brise must neither have surmounted broken down without attracting attention be therefore obliged to content with giving what call scare ' ranging men in open order along rear parapet so that only head levelled revolver must be seen loudly called upon russian to surrender dear swinburne be worth toil of climb up cliff up steep slope of hill to behold blank dismay of russian did not last long though to give credit due to be brave fellow moment realised situation simply laughed at regarding exploit a joke a indeed be more than anything else joke have grim side too for commandant immediately ordered men to cover with rifle then ordered to surrender how be going to take ' asked throw revolver over here to ' ordered will send out men to conduct to town ' said if will be compelled to shoot ' said then shoot be hanged to ' replied giving sign to men opened fire with revolver at same moment that russian blazed away at with rifle not until chamber of revolver be empty did turn race down hill toward head of cleft by have ascended did suffer loss asked none at be cheerful answer bullet hummed about ear like mosquito in summer time not one of be even touched on other hand saw several russian fall before fire think at least thirty of must have gone down before turned honourably hooked ' a must say smiled good old ito be splendid fellow honest a day utterly unassuming brave a lion everything in short that shipmate must be be evident that habit of introducing that favourite expression honourable in conjunction with bit of british slang be inveterate with felt that must be long time before must be able to recognise incongruity well said what happened next oh nothing so far a be concerned replied scrambled down cleft into boat pushed off still keeping quite close to foot of cliff although there be heavy sea rolling in breaking upon indeed be high time for to be off for when pulled out of little harbour at base of cliff first light of dawn be showing along horizon to eastward suddenly cannonading have completely died away broke out furiously again from height above from new battery have be built on low ground higher up harbour at first thought have be seen that be firing at presently steamer hove in sight to seaward saw that firing be directed at three others followed presently recognised a remaining explosion steamer have lost way in fog of night before on came rushing toward harbour at top speed with hurricane of shell of size falling upon about full glare of searchlight shining full upon first of to come recognised a edo maru under command of commander takayagi looked frightfully battered a swept past yet kept afloat reached spot for be aiming engine stopped reversed be evidently preparing to anchor when shell struck poor takayagi who be standing on port extremity of bridge almost cutting in two hit funnel exploding blew tremendous hole in nagata know lieutenant nagata think second in command who be also on bridge immediately took charge anchored ship exploded charge down in hold ordering away boat left just a be sinking crew bringing away poor takayagi body with be to be buried ashore here afternoon with full military honour of course next steamer to come be otaru maru think fire directed upon be even hotter than greeted edo shell fell round none of seemed to hit meanwhile be replying briskly with hotchkisses din be terrific for battery must bring gun to bear be blazing away at while troop made appearance on cliff above rained bullet upon deck indeed sort of panic seemed to have seized russian for not only be hurling hundred of shell at devoted otaru be exploding observation mine everywhere in most reckless manner most deadly weapon of be searchlight beam directed right into eye of helmsman officer on bridge dazzled by blinding brilliance people must not see where be going instead of reaching appointed station in harbour otaru dashed at full speed upon rock crew of course took to boat be unfortunately in full glare of searchlight russian troop shot one of be by time about mile out at sea when suddenly caught sight of torpedo boat hove to without light rolling pitching furiously not far away feeling sure that must be japanese hailed got reply five minute later be following crew up side of number being warmly welcomed by friend lieutenant taira who be in command now came misfortune for a made spring from boat to deck of plunging number sweeping ray of russian searchlight passed over returned rested inexorably upon taira instantly gave order to engineer to go full speed ahead even before engine must be started number of shell came hurtling about one unfortunately passed through boat thin side without exploding cut steam pipe of number boiler of course stoke hold be instantly filled with high pressure steam before stoker must escape three of be scalded to death be horrible to hear scream at same time to realise impossibility of doing anything to save luckily for number lying at great distance saw that be in difficulty pluckily came to rescue taking in tow despite tremendous fire directed upon dragging out of range be too busily engaged in helping to save number to see much of what further happened in connection with attempt to bottle up ' russian fleet have since learned that sagami maru followed otaru maru be peculiarly unfortunate in struck mechanical mine just outside harbour went down with hand last ship asagao maru be scarcely le unfortunate for shell struck rudder a neared harbour rendered unmanageable so that went ashore close under golden hill crew refusing to surrender be killed to man just after last happening fog came driving in from seaward swallowed up so that russian lost sight of then firing ceased shortly afterwards fast cruiser came looming up through fog to cover retreat about nine o'clock in morning togo joined with battle squadron be most anxious to know result of night operation unfortunately none of must afford more than mere disconnected snatch of information think possessed more information than anybody else of course mine be by mean complete admiral be most anxious to know exactly how matter stood for great thing hinged upon measure of success therefore offered to take in picket boat attempt to obtain information required offer be accepted steamed in under cover of fog be so thick that be impossible for to see more than few yard in direction so thick indeed that actually found among mast of sunken craft before really knew where be there be two three shore boat groping about wreckage already took notice of imagining perhaps that belonged to one of own ship be therefore able to complete examination to definitely satisfy ourselves at last harbour be entirely blocked learning admiral wirelessed message to general oku informing that must safely move since russian ship be now effectually bottled up result of message be fleet of transport that see yonder now dear chap must be off doctor told that must on account weary by talking too much here have be yarning for last half hour more good bye hope to see about again soon here stop moment old chap cried having told so much may a well tell rest where be oku going ah answered ito be secret think many of must make good guess eh if be asked to guess must say pi tse wo answered very probably dear swinburne must be honourably correct answered ito a waved hand smilingly bowed out little later be honoured by visit from togo with whom believed to be something of favourite although togo favouritism never took form of sparing favoured one giving easy work to execute on contrary most infallible sign that man be in admiral favour be assignment to of exceptionally difficult arduous dangerous task have of course already heard of adventure from kamimura wanted to hear story from own lip also have several question to ask remained with nearly hour be most friendly kind in manner expressing regret at suffering such a be hope must soon be well enough to resume duty to surprise admiral called again somewhat late in afternoon be very busy said being engaged on task of arranging for convoy of general oku second army consisting of men task of whom be to assist in reduction of port arthur expected to be away full week at least possibly longer object of visit be to explain to that aboard transport in harbour be material for construction of great boom eight mile long to be carried from island of kwang lung tau most westerly of elliot group to mainland similar boom have already be run from island to island of group new big boom must render rendezvous immune to attack from land to northward object in looking up now be in connection with construction of new big boom appeared that after leaving that morning have encountered physician who have charge of hospital that official have expressed opinion that in course of next three four day might probably be sufficiently recovered to be discharged from hospital be employed upon light duty such a of superintendence anything did not involve personal exertion that remark have suggested idea to togo result of be second call upon to inquire whether knew anything about construction of protective boom a happened did having once be actively employed upon construction of experimental boom be afterward stretched across mouth of portsmouth harbour when therefore told admiral with usual directness of purpose at once appointed to superintend construction of long boom order being be to remain in hospital until doctor must discharge when be to resume command of kasanumi with a flagship proceed to elliot island in charge of torpedo flotilla must leave behind for purpose escorting steamer into must tranship material necessary for construction of long boom upon arrival there be to discharge steamer rather supervise discharge of landing material at most suitable spot must find then still supervising only proceed with celerity upon construction of boom briefly gave own idea a to how boom must be constructed left with entirely free hand to introduce improvement might suggest to so far a material at command must permit task be one strongly appealed to for gave scope for employment of certain inventive faculty believed possessed undertook with avidity that evening about hour before sunset transhipment of material for boom having be effected transport containing oku second army got anchor started for pi tse wo escorted by portion of fleet under togo while remaining portion consisting of light fast cruiser detachment of destroyer proceeded to port arthur to make assurance doubly sure by keeping eye upon russian ship there subsequently learned that latter appeared to be quite inactive although sound of frequent loud explosion proceeding from harbour indicated that russian be already busily engaged upon task of attempting to blast passage through obstructing wreck chapter eleven russian submarine by dint of wheedling entreaty most lavish promise on part must on account attempt to do actual work succeeded in inducing doctor to discharge from hospital on second day after departure of admiral with general oku transport to pi tse wo be discharged shortly after eleven o'clock in morning be conveyed in hand ambulance down to landing place where boat be waiting for having be semaphored for instant obtained discharge be glad to find aboard own little ship once more crew seemed to be a glad to see a be to see for appeared that during absence kasanumi have be employed upon nothing patrol work be not at to taste of lad young hiraoka lieutenant seemed keenly disappointed when learned that most exciting work for time to come be to be construction of long boom philosophically remarked that doubt a soon a russian learned what be about must have few of destroyer paying call when might hope for little fun by time got aboard be noon at once signalled transport asking how soon must be ready to start reply be that not expecting to be called upon to go to sea so soon fire be out boiler be full fire laid must have steam in three hour whereupon made signal to light fire at once report when be ready to move then got into reclining chair under awning aft having partaken of hasty luncheon treated to snooze since expected to be up night got under way shortly after three o'clock in afternoon having cleared harbour headed away north west for elliot group weather be for wonder beautifully fine fog very few cloud brilliant sunshine very little wind water a smooth a mill pond consequently made very good progress although speed of slowest transport be only ten knot of course rest of have to regulate pace by hers have weather be threatening must of course have be anxious barometer stood high a even at ten knot passage must only occupy about thirteen hour felt quite easy in mind trip across yellow sea be made without mishap adventure until arrived within about twelve mile of destination night be still gloriously fine water smooth star brilliant moon within about hour of setting hung in western sky spreading broad path of silver on surface of gently heaving sea be few minute after four bell in middle watch when having be dozing for time in chair have be taken up to bridge for convenience scrambled to foot began to pace to fro for be feeling somewhat chilly although wrapped in good warm ulster beauty of night fascinated be so calm peaceful air although trifle cool be yet bland a though be breath of coming summer looking back upon what have be called upon to endure of storm darkness bitter numbing cold wet rejoiced that summer be at hand hoping that before winter came again there must be peace that nightly buffeting by arctic wind hail snow icy sea must be at end a thought passed through mind gaze fixed contemplatively on broad path of silver now imperceptibly changing to liquid gold cast upon surface of sea by setting moon a gazed gradually became aware of tiny black object about mile away on port bow rising falling with lazy heave of swell in mine strewn sea smallest least conspicuous floating object demanded one instant most careful attention whipping binoculars out of case strapped to bridge rail quickly focused upon through glass looked very like top of ship galley funnel though not quite so stout be moving a though to cross hawse for with help of glass must see little ripple of scintillating foam piled up before knew in instant what be for have seen submarine before at once recognised slender object forging through water out yonder a upper portion of submarine periscope of course have seen probably good half hour before must not be submerged course be steering indicated that be bent upon mischief congratulated upon having sighted in good time before entering danger zone for kasanumi be about mile ahead of main body of little fleet felt must have time to deal with before others came up question be must attack destroyer must allow to pas reserve energy for transport under impression that be carrying troop be impossible to guess must never do to take chance therefore pointed out periscope to young hiraoka told what be then ordered to go down quietly have hand called get gun loaded thought of trying to get in torpedo before russian discharged hers occurred to decided against a of torpedo have trick of running erratically meanwhile continued to potter along at ten knot a though have seen nothing have not so much a ghost of suspicion that submarine be in neighbourhood there be one so far a must see indeed until moment never suspected russian of having in sea although vague rumour have never be able to substantiate have reached of submarine having be brought overland to port arthur from petersburg in section with eye glued to binoculars binoculars focused steadily upon small pole like object protruding bare two foot above shimmering silvery sheen of water directed signalman near to ring down order to engine room to stand by then to fetch wireless operator to in few word explained situation to youngster when came gave order while sound of hiraoka preparation came to ear suddenly a watched periscope moment becoming more distinct noticed that ripple of foam about be steadily lessening presently disappeared altogether submarine have evidently stopped engine be lying in wait to torpedo a passed to permit to pas on unsuspecting then get in work upon transport be bit of luck have not dared to hope for instantly made plan steadily kasanumi held on a though utterly unsuspecting steering course if continued must take athwart submarine hawse at distance of about three hundred yard le than effective range of torpedo be stealthily altering position under water turning bow toward so a to torpedo moment must arrive within range be trusting that presence be undetected waiting patiently for moment when must cross bow a lay latter believed for must not cant toward without going ahead astern must not do either without periscope raising ripple be certain that nothing of sort have happened determined to risk something after to put submarine out of action so held steadily on at length arrived so close must see periscope almost a distinctly without glass a with still intently watching laid hand on engine room telegraph carefully estimating steadily decreasing distance separated from moment to moment six hundred yard five hundred four fifty four hundred crashed telegraph handle over to full speed ahead on engine never moving eye for instant from periscope directed helmsman to steer straight for submarine be lying motionless inert there fifteen foot beneath surface calculated that must take russian at least minute to realise that be discovered to get way upon craft by time must be so close to that must be impossible for to dive to turn submarine bow on to much le to escape then a felt destroyer leap forward beneath like spirited horse at cut of whip blew whistle a signal to spark who instantly wirelessed back to main body to stop until further order to keep sharp lookout for submarine like greyhound slipped from leash kasanumi rushed at luckless periscope about few bubble of foam be just beginning to gather at moment when stem towering over hid from sight next instant hull swept over of course snapped clean off although felt shock whatever for draught of water be too light for keel to reach submarine conning tower by loss of periscope craft be effectually blinded now be at mercy for must come to surface sooner later while so smooth be water swirl wake of a forged ahead be clearly perceptible now have to do be to follow until rose then take sink a lost sight of periscope rang down to stop reverse engine at same time ordering helm hard port then a checked lost way went ahead first on port engine then on at same time shifting helm so a to get into wake of submarine managed to do before quite losing sight of disturbance made by passage through water done regulated pace by hers maintaining distance of about fifty fathom between shifted helm several time in evident attempt to baffle pursuit thanks to tell tale swirl raised be able to follow at length after chase of about three quarter of hour rose to surface watertight door of tower opened man head appeared looked greatly astonished to see within biscuit toss of instantly ducked out of sight leaving hatch open however heard shouting something to one in boat interior few second later head appeared stared at fixedly for few second during young hiraoka who have very fair knowledge of russian hailed to surrender too disappeared then while be patiently awaiting further development submarine be still going ahead suddenly inclined bow before must do anything dived with hatch open brave fellow who manned evidently taking leaf out of opponent book have chosen death rather than surrender have deliberately plunged to bottom rather than yield vessel to for of course craft be never seen again did of crew come to surface although hove to for hour more got boat out in readiness to pick up one who might escape from steel coffin be quite prepared to hear loud cheer of exultation burst from lip of crew when realised what have happened there be nothing that japanese admire more than courage deliberate act of devoted self sacrifice for honour of one country flag a have just beheld called forth merely low spoken murmur of intense almost envious praise arrived at destination without further adventure dropped anchor in roadstead just a sun rose above horizon flooding rocky shore of elliots with gold be heartily greeted by few craft found lying at anchor there looking back upon adventure with russian submarine must not help regarding a almost providential that have encountered for think there can be very little doubt that when fell in with must have be on way to elliot archipelago where have arrived safely might have found more than one spot in must have lain perdu to emerge at favourable moment destroy at least one if not more of most precious battleship giving order for immediate discharge of material for boom at spot selected immediately after have come to anchor turned in slept soundly until past midday resting again afternoon so that when evening came have quite recovered from fatigue of previous night be pronounced by doctor in charge of hospital ashore to be progressing toward complete recovery quite a rapidly a must be reasonably expected while wound be healing in fine style about four o'clock afternoon word be brought to that whole of material intended for construction of boom have be landed went ashore to inspect consisted for most part of enormous balk of timber massive cable there be also immense quantity of chain to serve a lashing stout staple iron bar innumerable bundle of long massive pointed spike thousand of empty cask stoutly hooped without bung hole coated with pitch to ensure permanent watertight ness commander tsuchiya whom have placed in charge of discharging operation have done work well stacking various item by keeping careful account of quantity of handed copy of list after have inspected whole of material returned to ship sat down to plan out detail of construction of boom with list of quantity before be comparatively easy task dawn of following day found ready to make start with tsuchiya again a principal aide quickly got to work pressing available hand into service many hand make light quick work especially where hand be willing be astonished at ardour zest handy little japanese seaman manifested toiled untiringly through long hot day with result that when knocked off at nightfall have considerably more than mile of boom put together secured in position by ponderous anchor stout chain cable be hard at work upon boom again when during afternoon of following day battle fleet returned from pi tse wo after covering landing of general oku army fleet steamed in between island cape terminal on mainland toward be running boom friend ijichi skipper of mikasa told with laugh when little admiral first saw boom made out what be must hardly credit eye have be under impression be still in hospital must probably not be able to get to work for week more yet there be a large a life in picket boat with head still swathed in bandage superintending operation clearly recognisable with assistance of pair of binoculars when at close of day went aboard flagship to report togo did not hesitate to let understand how intensely gratified be at progress have made meanwhile be fast progressing toward complete recovery on day following return of fleet to elliots bandage be removed from head be pronounced to be practically right once more to add to gratification destroyer arrived from sasebo bringing mail for fleet among be le than three delightful letter from friend gordons at home two equally delightful from sasebo friend mr boyd wife from gordons be full of congratulation for gathered from that long circumstantial account of second attempt to seal up port arthur harbour have appeared in home newspaper in somewhat conspicuous mention be made of doings friend be delighted to learn be so successfully maintaining finest tradition of british navy a be kindly pleased to put chum ronald be particularly chirpy about expressing in measured term wish that must have be with while informed that notwithstanding painful circumstance under have left terrible british navy officer of ship with only one two exception have expressed gratification while several of whom named have desired to convey to congratulation good wish during next day two excellent progress be made with construction of long boom then came spell of bad weather although did not hinder putting together of section of boom in smooth water of anchorage rendered impossible for to tow out splice to portion already in position although bad weather greatly delayed in way did not altogether regret for heavy sea kicked up by gale afforded splendid test of portion of boom already in place be greatly gratified a steamed out day after day to examine to find that have not be damaged displaced in smallest degree be toward end of third week of may that admiral signalled to proceed on board flagship be late in afternoon of thoroughly wretched day wind have be blowing hard from south'ard for past three four day with almost incessant rain there be very heavy sea running between island main have just returned from second inspection of boom that day naturally thought that signal indicated desire on part of admiral to question in relation to stability of structure when entered cabin greeted with question well captain swinburne how be boom standing sea out yonder be confirmed in opinion presently found that be mistaken for when have told that there be to tell about boom have expressed satisfaction said by way be commander tsuchiya who have be chief assistant in work be not replied in affirmative suppose understands whole business pretty well by time eh admiral continued bit a well a do sir answered seeming to scent other work for at great distance be good commented togo do think must be capable of completing work without further assistance from undoubtedly must sir replied indeed think right to say that after first day commander tsuchiya required help suggestion of kind from at seemed to perfectly understand principle of boom construction almost from very beginning after first day work upon took entire supervision into own hand leaving nothing to do merely to look on satisfy by personal observation that work be being properly done be presume remarked admiral certainly be sir replied good said togo that being case be free for service how must like chance to get little fighting ashore by way of change jove exclaimed must be splendid sir be going to land naval brigade anywhere well no answered admiral hardly that think at least be not present intention although circumstance may possibly render desirable eventually matter stand thus turning to table where map of liaotung peninsula lay unfolded upon pointing to certain spot on map be where general oku landed other day with army pointing to spot be where be now object of course be to march south lay siege to port arthur at point two half mile south of kinchau a suppose know be chinese walled city isthmus be only about two mile wide in about city russian have established in force prepared apparently to dispute oku passage of isthmus to last man mountain so prominently marked on map be mount sampson be more than two thousand foot in height a will readily understand dominates entire district upon mountain russian very strongly established scarping height constructing formidable breastwork behind to shelter of course be necessary for troop to take mountain since until must be done to pas isthmus must be impossible be glad to learn that mountain be now in hand here just to south of kinchau be range of hill known a nanshan height form sort of backbone to isthmus occupy almost entire width crest completely commanding narrow strip of low ground on side on height too russian have very strongly established so that although mount sampson be in hand isthmus remains impassable unfortunate fact so far a be concerned be that general oku have heavy artillery with otherwise must be able to shell nanshan height from mount sampson drive russian out have only field mountain gun of range insufficient for purpose therefore have requisitioned help from propose to send craft round to kinchau bay to shell russian position from sea kinchau bay sir interrupted pardon water in kinchau bay be so willow according to chart be afraid of craft capable of carrying gun heavy enough to be of service must have very great difficulty in approaching land near enough to be of real use why not hand bay sir on eastern side of isthmus for very good reason dear fellow that not only be hand bay mined must also be impossible for to clear bay being completely commanded by work craft must not face for five minute must be kinchau bay there be nothing else for answered admiral that being case continued be intention to dispatch thither akagi chokai hei yen tsukushi to afford assistance required by general oku ship will be accompanied by torpedo flotilla duty of will be to take sounding lay down line of buoy inside ship must not pas search for clear bay of mine a well a to render such further assistance a may be possible to land force anticipate that work required of torpedo flotilla will be of exceptionally arduous hazardous character for reason captain swinburne be going to place under command with kasanumi a flagship have be keeping eye upon sir will take opportunity to express very high appreciation of conduct have manifested dash fertility of resource cool courage under exceedingly trying condition have grown to look for a matter of course from englishman to that add element of caution fear japanese have not a fully developed a ought to have done therefore regard a fittest man must possibly select for service upon now propose to employ that also be reason why have so fully explained to situation at kinchau for be very necessary that must clearly understand may be required of have of course number of japanese officer whose courage must be quite equal to task be assigning to unfortunately lack that element of caution posse in proof of will be painful duty to presently announce series of terrible disaster news of have just reached three of at least be afraid must attribute to lack of caution indeed sir said be exceeding sorry to hear be permissible to ask particular oh yes answered admiral with heavy sigh must not have mentioned matter to at for fact that must very soon have come to ear in case within three day sir have lost six war vessel while seventh kasuga have be temporarily put out of action of six lost ship captain two be battleship hatsuse yashima hatsuse yashima good heaven sir be possible exclaimed be more than possible answered togo with heavy sigh be disastrous fact in addition to two ship have also lost yoshino fortunately not one of best fast cruiser oh be terrible terrible three disaster have occurred to day within very short space of time news reached by wireless in interval between sending for arrival appears that while yoshino takasago chitose kasagi kasuga be to westward of port arthur morning just after dawn ran into patch of dense fog while steaming through lookout aboard yoshino sighted floating mine short distance ahead thereupon officer in charge seems to have temporarily lost presence of mind for instead of sheering out of line a seems to might have done so avoided mine instantly stopped reversed engine without warning kasuga be next astern inevitable result of course be that kasuga struck yoshino heavily making such terrible rent in side that in spite of collision mat speedily filled capsized sank drowning over two hundred of crew kasuga badly damaged be on way hither may be expected to arrive time to night disaster however serious a be be nothing compared with loss of hatsuse yashima occurred shortly after midday little did dream a steamed away from here morning that must never see again happened about ten mile south of port arthur two ship striking mine within few minute of other hatsuse appears to have struck two mine second of completed destruction for foundered in le than two minute after second explosion occurred understand that considerably more than half crew have gone down with there be hope at first that yashima might be saved a collision mat be got over damaged bow steam pump be started while headed for here under own steam with rest of squadron in company latest news be to effect that can not possibly be kept afloat that crew be being taken off well be fortune of war suppose be useless to murmur can not hope to always have thing go well with revers will happen occasionally be afraid that have be growing just little too careless over confident of late must take lesson to heart see that doe not again happen be paralysing blow for now to return to matter more immediately concern captain have given earliest possible warning of what be going to ask to do in order that may have opportunity to think over situation make plan want to be ready to start at practically moment notice will not dispatch squadron until have further news from oku may arrive at minute a happened however although communication arrived from oku next day be full week before got order for careful reconnaissance revealed that very important preparation must be necessary before must be possible to take kinchau storm nanshan height just about sunset shikishima with attendant cruiser hove in sight before be hull up be possible for to distinguish that yashima be not among have gone down off dalny in willow water fortunately not until man have be safely taken out of other loss to admiral have referred be torpedo boat number dispatch boat mikayo of have come to grief one on th may other two day later through striking mine in kerr thirty mile to north east of port arthur torpedo boat number appeared be engaged in sweeping for mine when accident happened have already found destroyed three mine have discovered fourth fired several round at without result then number imprudently approached mine with intention of securing when exploded blowing in two killing wounding fourteen of crew of twenty three be two day later when mikayo believing bay to be clear entered to make sure be passing in through channel supposed to have be cleared by torpedo boat when too struck mine there be terrific explosion went to bottom with eight casualty in crew of two hundred be useful little ship having speed of over sixteen knot when be destroyed although have be known to achieve a much a twenty mounted two forty seven ten pounder be therefore not very formidable fighting craft story told by russian concerning destruction be to effect that fell victim to mine placed overnight in channel previously cleared by boat by young russian naval officer who stole out from port arthur in small steam launch under cover of night whether story be true not can not tell yet there be nothing very improbable about for be indisputable that many of russian displayed a fine courage a even japanese chapter twelve at work in kinchau bay meanwhile be spending day poring over map chart of kinchau neighbourhood with have be supplied leaving commander tsuchiya to carry on work of constructing long boom merely visiting in picket boat at close of day to see how work be progressing study of map chart have reference to scheme have come into head whereby might be possible to determine range of several russian position from certain fixed point in bay with utmost accuracy thereby greatly increasing effectiveness of naval fire when flotilla must be called into action map in particular have be issued to be drawn upon scale so large that even comparatively insignificant distance must be closely measured upon be so full of detail apparently building however unimportant be marked upon also be contoured be to say be covered over with wavy line of represented definite height above sea level with map before be of course easiest matter imaginable to determine position of most salient point of landscape of there be several assuming map to be correctly drawn to measure distance of from one with bountiful fund of at least approximately accurate information for starting point be simple matter for to fix upon number of point in bay a many a chose in fact must be clearly indicated by buoy bearing different coloured flag position of must be accurately determined by cross bearing plan be first to lay down buoy determine position then mark on map copy of must be handed to captain from by employment of scale pair of divider must immediately measure off with precision exact range of object desired having at length arranged scheme on map to liking proceeded with aboard mikasa submitted to admiral who with captain ijichi commander several of officer of ship examined with utmost interest asking several question in connection with when have fully explained scheme agreed that be admirable idea must undoubtedly be of utmost value if must only be carried out togo be of opinion that must not on contrary be convinced that must at length managed to get admiral somewhat reluctant consent to make experiment armed with went ashore making way to carpenter shop formed part of shore establishment among island ordered certain number of small triangular raft to be made of size just sufficient to support bamboo staff ten foot long to top of flag six foot long by three foot wide be to be firmly lashed flag to be of different colour arranged in raft be constructed merely of rough timber stoutly nailed together while flag being only required to last day two a hoped be made of coloured calico edge turned over hemmed with sewing machine that might not fray tear couple of hour work sufficed to complete small requisition with returned to kasanumi be within hour of sunset when got aboard with boatload of miscellaneous paraphernalia a torpedo flotilla always kept steam while at elliots excepting when became necessary to clean flue boiler at once got anchor proceeded to sea at speed of twenty knot be bound round to kinchau bay distance of from elliot group by sea be about one hundred thirteen sea mile therefore reckoned on arriving at destination about midnight must suit admirably moon be in third quarter be due to rise night at few minute after one o'clock must also suit excellently for wonder night be fine with light air out from about south east there be sea not much swell a destroyer be running well within went along quite easily comfortably seized opportunity to snatch few hour sleep leaving navigation of boat to chief officer who be quite equal to task trip be uneventful at midnight lieutenant hiraoka aroused with intimation that be standing into kinchau bay be already near enough to land to enable watch fire on hill to be made out accordingly turned out went on deck to take look round have studied map so exhaustively that dark though night be be able without difficulty to identify various height in sight of mount sampson be by far most conspicuous general appearance of land indeed be remarkably like what have already mentally pictured to be seemed to be gazing on quite familiar ground be of course running without light there be hardly ghost of chance of being seen eagerly searched bay for craft be gratified to find that be empty if there be craft there might be good many mine therefore in order to avoid possible risk crossed bay to northern shore keeping well out then going dead slow feeling way with lead hugged northern shore line a closely a depth of water must permit until arrived abreast little indentation cove when engine be stopped boat lowered with revolver in belt sword pocketful of cartridge water bottle wallet of provision azimuth compass box sextant be pulled ashore landed in cove boat immediately returning to destroyer soon vanished in darkness making for offing there be half dozen small crazy looking fishing boat drawn up on beach of cove groping about presently found footpath leading somewhere inland cautiously followed for little distance until crow of wakeful cock bark of dog warned that be at great distance from human dwelling of sort when struck off path waded through field of millet heading north west for summit of hill easily recognised even in dark a one of point from purposed to take set of observation more immediate anxiety however be to get away from neighbourhood of human habitation for although knew pretty well in general way where russian might be expected to be found there be always possibility of running unexpectedly into small detachment of of encountering korean peasant who might be disposed to betray upon off chance of securing reward for so doing low ground at foot of range of hill for be heading be cultivated a well a lower slope higher up ground be covered pretty thickly with scrub with here there few patch of fir tree when once got among felt be fairly safe for imagined that nobody must be likely to have business up there while in disturbed state of country nobody must be likely to wander there for pleasure by time reached lower margin of belt of scrub moon one half of in shadow have crept up above crest of mount sampson whole of country round about be flooded with dim ghostly light with help of be able to make out small walled city of kinchau planned in form of square side measuring about mile long japanese position in valley to south of few of russian position on nanshan height be also able to definitely reassure a to own position point for be aiming be about three mile north of little cove in have landed intervening ground be rugged with many outcrop of rough jagged rock much overgrown with thick tangled going therefore be bit toilsome did not greatly matter to for night air be distinctly raw be none too thickly clad exertion kept warm when reached belt of fir wood seemed to completely encircle range of height be climbing obscurity be such that be only with utmost difficulty be able to make headway at at length coming to spot where grass be exceptionally thick dry feeling somewhat fatigued with unwonted exertion flung down for short rest before knew what be happening fell fast asleep awoke chill cramped at sound of distant bugle call to find that sky over summit of mount sampson be just paling to approach of dawn therefore scrambled to foot much refreshed by nap resumed climb eager to get glimpse of surroundings with first of daylight for have great deal to do not very much time in to do quarter of hour of brisk walking brought to upper edge of fir wood there before scarcely mile distant stood peak have chosen a starting point for operation have be guided by map in selection of for contour showed that apart from mount sampson be one of most lofty elevation in neighbourhood also that rose somewhat abruptly to small well defined point first glance at assured that so far at least map spoke truly for summit appeared to consist of rocky knoll highest point of be short stunted conical mass top of seemed scarcely capable of affording standing room nothing must possibly have be better for purpose hurried forward upward eager now to get at work will not afflict reader by attempting to describe in detail plan of operation for involved mathematical problem of complexity only interesting to comprehensible by mathematician suffice to say that what have undertaken to do be to make three separate set of observation from a many chosen point consisting of carefully observed compass bearing angle taken with pocket sextant taking of observation travelling from one point to kept so busy day be scarcely able to find time to snatch couple of hurried meal while walking from one point to be not interfered with by anybody for with two opposing army facing other at close quarter population seemed scarcely inclined to venture out of door of course saw plenty of armed men russian own troop moving about in plain surround kinchau there be considerable amount of desultory firing going on be not until well on in afternoon came into close proximity of of troop be when became necessary for to cross road leading into kinchau from north along road armed russian singly in two three often in large body be passing to fro lost nearly hour of valuable time waiting for opportunity merely to cross road unseen however managed at last reached final observation point just in time to satisfactorily finish work before night fell light failed now next task be to somehow make way back to cove in have landed eighteen hour earlier to do be necessary for to recross road where have be held up during afternoon now darkness be in favour succeeded in getting across with scarcely delay arriving at cove safely with good hour to spare be weary waiting for boat be due to come for at midnight for be very tired after unusual exertion throughout day must gladly have slept must not do for to have slept must have exposed to double risk of being surprised of missing boat be therefore by mean sorry when about midnight heard low whistle announced arrival to step lightly into murmur order to shove off be work of moment hour later be again safely aboard kasanumi to great joy of young hiraoka who appeared have be day haunted with fear might fall into hand of russian now weary a be there be at least two hour work before with pencil paper protractor parallel ruler scale making calculation laying down upon map chart result of observation result be on whole eminently satisfactory for although discovered few trifling error in map here there observation enabled to correct when have at length finished map chart be in condition must enable to proceed with second part of task with assurance of success accomplished retired to cabin with easy mind slept sleep of just until midday salt water douche on deck for few minute skilfully administered by laughing japanese seaman brisk rub down with rough towel left fresh invigorated quite ready for meal work still lay ahead of first part of consisted in laying down upon chart number of position corresponding with varying draught of water of several unit admiral be detailing to assist general oku in operation against russian force who be barring passage of kinchau isthmus laying down of position above referred to be task demanding considerable amount of thought care for be important that ship must approach shore a nearly a possible otherwise gun might be out ranged while on other hand must not be permitted to approach too near must be exposed to risk of being left aground on falling tide also be imperative that berth chosen for must be so situated a to enable to afford maximum amount of possible assistance devoted entire afternoon to consideration of question at length fixed upon series of position seemed to to answer requirement a nearly a tidal condition must allow next task be to accurately fix several position by a complete series of cross bearing a possible having accomplished there be nothing more to be done until after midnight meanwhile kasanumi with engine stopped be lying hove to sixty mile to westward of kinchau in gulf of liaotung waiting for nightfall at four bell in first watch got under way started to run east at speed of twenty knot for have now to complete entire plan by placing buoy triangular raft have provided for purpose in position in kinchau bay have already selected for marked upon chart too anxious for complete success of scheme to be able to sleep have ordered deck chair to be brought up from below be sitting in on little navigating bridge with midshipman named uchida who have be detailed for service with pacing softly to fro from port to starboard keeping lookout cold night air be beginning to produce pleasantly drowsy effect upon when a boy halted for moment in turning on march suddenly stiffened stared intently out upon starboard beam stood thus like figure suddenly turned to stone for space of full minute more then came softly to side saluted three craft on starboard beam sir coming up from south west reported what do look like demanded rising to foot staring out in direction toward boy pointed can not yet say sir replied at present be too far off to reveal character indeed doubt if must have seen so soon for fact glimpsed flame issuing from one of funnel yes said thanks mr uchida see too have goodness to bring night glass from chart house appear to be steaming with light out lad hurried away quickly returned with night glass focused applied to eye night be overcast there be few star blinking out between cloud be flying fast up from westward by feeble uncertain light be presently able to distinguish little more clearly three small shapeless blur that uchida keen eye have detected be little more than shapeless blur still even when viewed through powerful lens of night glass be able to distinguish one of be considerably bigger than other two be much of size be funnel of big fellow be showing flame seemed to indicate that be being driven while other two appeared to be running easily yet three be in company appearance of two smaller craft seemed to suggest to that might possibly be destroyer what other be must not guess be not big enough for cruiser transport fact that be evidently being hard driven to enable to keep pace with consort possibly escort led to doubt whether be warship of kind one thing be pretty clear be that like ourselves be evidently bound for kinchau bay be enemy friend if former be eminently undesirable that must be permitted to arrive be for to look into matter how be head demanded of helmsman east three degree south replied shift helm to east twenty five degree south ordered bow of destroyer swung round until be heading for point at must intercept stranger then mr uchida said pas word to prepare to make private night signal signal be presently hoisted to yard arm displayed for fully five minute without evoking response then knew that stranger be enemy accordingly hauled down signal again cleared for action loading torpedo tube a well done quickened up pace to full speed for if be going to have fight wanted to be out there in open so far away from shore that sound of firing must not reach russian about kinchau so apprise of presence of enemy in adjacent water a rapidly neared enemy made out to be two destroyer evidently escorting third craft be single funnelled steamer of apparently about eighteen hundred ton sat deep in water a though loaded to full capacity be much too small for transport for life of must not imagine what character might be there must be doubt concerning destroyer be evident russian for be four funnelled funnel arranged in pair be distinctly characteristic of certain class of russian destroyer side wasted time upon useless preliminary be russian who opened ball by craft firing almost simultaneously gun must bring to bear upon aim be nothing to boast of for although heard shell screaming about remained untouched twice fired upon before must give word to gun layer time ineffectively then gave order to commence firing sooner have word passed lip than pounder spoke moment later there occurred two distinct explosion aboard nearest russian boat instantly became enveloped in great cloud of steam apparently that first shot of ours have struck exploded one of boiler for almost immediately slackened speed began to drop mishap however did not seem to in least discourage consort putting on full speed now dashed at in most determined gallant manner firing a came receiving fire in return then for ten minute found engaged in regular ding dong fight antagonist closing to distance of le than two hundred yard hammering away at other a fast a gun must be served very soon became apparent that fellow be much better cooler gunner of two for whereas russian seemed to ram in charge let fly on instant that gun be loaded men waited watching roll of own ship that of enemy firing at waterline a rolled away from with result within first five minute of fight lucky shot from pounder sent shell through upturned bilge foot so below normal waterline blowing hole through thin plating admitted tremendous inrush of water time that rolled toward crew at once got out collision mat made most desperate effort to get over stop leak pound quick firers peppered so severely that after struggling manfully for two three minute be obliged to let mat go lost then launched torpedo at missed by inch only whereupon ordered men to cease fire hailed russian to ask if must surrender not bit of reply a translated to by hiraoka who be excellent russian linguist be that knew how to die not how to surrender reply be accompanied by salvo from one of gun must bear too at moment when became only too apparent that boat be rapidly sinking since therefore be evident that be resolved to fight to last there be nothing for to open fire upon afresh much a regretted a obstinately persisted in keeping up fire upon end however be nearer than even thought for have fired few more shot at opponent when there occurred terrific explosion aboard instantly followed by several others deck opened up like lid of box great sheet of flame leapt up from interior seeming to break in two dismembered hull rapidly disappeared bow stern portion rearing out of water for few second ere plunged to bottom leaving nothing to show where boat have be save great cloud of acrid smoke steam few fragment of wreckage dozen men struggling in water of course instantly stopped engine launched boat only found saved three men out of boat total complement of forty seven learned that name of lost destroyer be beztraschni that of officer have perished with now have leisure to attend to other two craft be by time three mile astern having apparently stopped engine to await at safe distance course of event swinging round headed for at full speed with gun loaded torpedo in tube ready to open fire a soon a got within effective range a drew nearer however became evident that there be something very seriously wrong with destroyer have first fired upon have dropped astern disabled for there be boat in water about seemingly passing between other craft boat going to with only two three hand in leaving loaded by time that have arrived within mile of must see that destroyer be in sinking condition minute later lost sight of altogether have gone down boat be still in water alongside surviving craft men be climbing up side from a arrived within thirty fathom of hailed demanding surrender reply instantly came from to effect that surrendered whereupon dispatched hiraoka on board in charge of armed boat crew ten minute later youngster hailed informing that prize be named vashka of seventeen hundred sixty ton register originally cargo steamer now adapted for mine laying that be from dalny bound for kinchau bay for purpose of sowing bay with mine in anticipation of probability that of ship must be sent to participate in attack upon isthmus added information that vessel hoping to escape notice of japan warship by taking roundabout route have be escorted by two destroyer only beztraschni storozhevoi latter of have seen go down few minute before a result of injury inflicted upon by pounder shell from have not only blown great rent in bottom a burst fragment of have pierced two of boiler be evident that have made capture of considerable importance therefore proceeded on board prize with armed reinforcement after going carefully into matter with hiraoka arranged with to take vashka to elliots in charge of prize crew there to act according to admiral order matter arranged returned to kasanumi resumed voyage while prize headed away south west on way round to elliot island now have leisure to look into extent of own injury proved be by mean so serious a might have be expected having regard to fierceness closeness of fight casualty amounted to two killed five wounded one of seriously while top of aftermost of midship pair of funnel have be blown away rail of navigating bridge smashed doubled up in most astonishing way pilot house roof torn off topside pierced in le than five place very pretty general average made of cabin in shell have evidently burst luckily none of injury seriously affected craft safety while most of must be at least temporarily patched up in few hour also very luckily navigating instrument chronometer sextant nautical almanac book of logarithmic other table have almost miraculously escaped injury steamed into kinchau bay with light out about hour later than have arranged for still in sufficient time for work lay before when arrived off cove where have previously landed largest boat be lowered buoy raft have caused to be prepared be placed in having attached to very light chain of just sufficient length to securely moor with aid of good grapnel accompanied by two men then jumped in pulled ashore while kasanumi turned tail steamed off to sea again at full speed so a to be out of sight from shore before dawn arrived in cove secured boat then settled down a comfortably a be possible to await dawn came at last a have expected there very shortly afterwards arrived forty manchurian fisherman from little village about mile distant at first be somewhat alarmed to find cove boat apparently in possession of japanese men o ' war men have taken precaution to ensure that one of men must be capable of playing part of interpreter before long be able not only to reassure also by judicious admixture of cajolery threat to secure assistance in completion of scheme money appeal to manchurian fisherman just a powerfully a doe to most other people more powerfully than doe to many for see so little of consequently when intimated be prepared to pay magnificent sum of ten yen for few hour use of one of boat with crew of four men whole crowd came tumbling over one in eagerness to secure prize chose boat most suitable for purpose transferred raft gear to leaving own boat in charge of man who undertook to guard with life for sum of one yen then in company with other boat be going fishing in bay shoved off pulled out of cove by stroke of greatest good fortune day be beautifully fine clear so be able without slightest difficulty to get one of bearing with most absolute accuracy to place several buoy on prearranged spot with perfect precision work be successfully most satisfactorily accomplished shortly before noon now remained to be done be to affix different coloured flag to buoy that part must have to be deferred until ship must actually come into action otherwise sharp sighted enemy might prematurely catch sight of guessing purpose destroy chapter thirteen go ashore hour before midnight launching own boat crew pushed out of cove into kinchau bay in readiness to board kasanumi immediately upon arrival from offing toward close of afternoon weather have undergone change becoming overcast hazy with drizzling rain wind too have shifted a pushed out of cove be blowing fresh from westward knocking up short choppy sea threatened soon to become dangerous to small boat a ours luckily for however hiraoka be bit ahead of time night barometer having warned that bad weather be brewing with result that in little more than hour after leaving cove made out dark form of destroyer hove to waiting for within fifty fathom of boat now be that have practical experience of value of suitable colouring a aid to concealment for although kasanumi have be where found for full quarter of hour although have be keeping sharp lookout for remained invisible until be close aboard of thanks to peculiar shade of grey with have caused to be painted scrambled aboard gladly enough hoisted boat to davit at once started back for rendezvous at elliot group where arrived without adventure shortly after sunrise on following morning when little later went aboard flagship to report result of expedition to admiral learned that have only got back just in nick of time for at last communication have be received from general oku announcing that preparation be now complete squadron detached to assist be under order to leave for kinchau bay very night squadron consisted of tsukushi light cruiser armed with two inch four inch gun old ironclad hei yen once belonging to chinese navy captured by japanese at first battle of yalu mounted one inch krupp have formed part of original armament two inch modern gun also akagi survivor of yalu battle armed with four inch gun chokai carrying one inch one inch gun be craft destined to bombard nanshan height from sea while japanese infantry artillery attacked from land side be only craft have at time at suitable for purpose while even be incapable of rendering such efficient help a might have be desired fact being that willow water of kinchau bay compelled to keep at so great distance from shore that must only use gun at extreme range accompanying four ship be flotilla consisting of ten torpedo boat under command duty being to lend hand generally in manner might be required there be just comfortable time for to re bunker kasanumi before six o'clock at hour got under way expedition a whole being under command of rear admiral misamichi who knew locality well having carefully reconnoitred whole of western coast of peninsula week two earlier have by time completed calculation laid down upon chart position of series of buoy indicated in figure exact measurement in yard from line marked to number of point ashore copy of chart have be handed to captain be therefore now in position to steam in open fire forthwith with absolute certainty of landing shot upon spot aimed at be rather slow going lot speed of course being regulated by of slowest craft of bunch happened to be old hei yen progress be further impeded by circumstance that upon rounding liao ti shan promontory ran into westerly breeze sea that flung torpedo boat about like cork necessitated slowing down to speed of about eight knot in consequence of be late next night when arrived came to anchor well out in deep water now arose little difficulty started to communicate by wireless to general oku fact of arrival in bay by code of course such be russian keenness activity that moment own wireless picked up message a of course be bound to do finding that be in code must not decipher immediately proceeded to mix so effectually that reading of became impossible first word two however reached oku at once shrewdly surmising that message be from proceeded to signal by searchlight using adaptation of morse code conversation thus carried on be lengthy one occupying more than hour when suddenly ceased almost immediately afterward admiral signalled to proceed on board flagship be much more easily said than done for by time be blowing moderate gale sea be running so heavily that be a much a boat must do to live in while a for getting alongside cruiser be quite out of question be obliged to hoist aboard in standing bowline at end of whip upon being shown into admiral misamichi cabin found occupant somewhat ruefully contemplating rather voluminous communication from shore have just received welcomed with much cordiality then passed document over to be so good a to read captain said then kindly tell what make of purport to be general oku instruction for to morrow so dense be stupidity that be compelled to confess inability to understand read communication carefully through from beginning to end three time be then obliged to admit have only be able to glean very hazy imperfect notion of what general required gathered that desired squadron to concentrate fire from time to time upon certain point a directed by signal mischief of be that out there in bay have mean of identifying point named by general in other word gave designation of be completely ignorant produced chart of place likewise map studied intently with oku message beside finally came to conclusion that be incomprehensible then admiral sent for captain of other ship have shot at with similar result at length said appears to sir that there be one thing to be done namely for to go ashore find general oku explain to difficulty get to mark on map several point mentioned here touching dispatch a be aware have already be ashore here spent whole day among hill reconnoitring ground making observation therefore know country well including own enemy position probably hour conversation with general will enable to identify point mentioned in dispatch with of already marked upon chart thus for example point position of be wholly unable to identify may be position have marked in fact anything must be one other of have numbered for numbered one of yes yes agreed admiral be quite comprehensible if must only get ashore matter must very soon be adjusted how be going to get ashore still more difficult how be going to get off again from what know of bay be prepared to say that there be surf breaking on beach at moment boat of ours must pas through live listen to wind how howl through rigging true be point have entirely escaped in eagerness how be to get ashore rather how be to get off again be pretty confident of ability to get ashore for surf swimming be favourite pastime of mine a to getting off again well doubted whether even strength be equal to task of struggling out through long line of surf knew must now be thundering in upon kinchau beach difficulty be finally overcome by admiral consenting to attempting to get ashore upon condition must not attempt to swim off again unless felt absolutely convinced of ability to accomplish feat if must not be to remain ashore with oku helping in manner might suggest especially by signalling off to fleet from time to time number of several position must be required to shell matter settled made way back to kasanumi there prepared for somewhat hazardous adventure by carefully tying up marked figured copy of map of kinchau surroundings in piece of thin sheet rubber to protect from wet next divested myself of clothing except pair of swimming drawer pair of thin canvas running shoe then tying map in rubber case round neck signalled smallest torpedo boat to look out for haul aboard for by time sea be running so heavily that be impossible to launch boat when having received reply to signal simply dived overboard swam down to leeward to where torpedo boat lay crew be of course keenly on alert a came driving down toward only visible in consequence of phosphorescence of water flung lifebuoy bent on to end of line so hauled aboard be anchored at distance of about four mile from shore be of course much too great distance for to attempt to swim in sea be now running especially a must need ounce of strength to fight way through long stretch of surf that knew must now be breaking along shore therefore briefly explained to skipper of torpedo boat mission upon be bound what wished to do then while saw to doing of part retired to little cabin stripped off wet swimming kit gave vigorous towelling to banish cold of even brief swim have already undertaken meanwhile boat be got under way taken in toward kinchau with lead going time when at length be a near shore a be at prudent for to approach be turned with head to seaward skipper came down to apprise of state of affair boat have taken about twenty minute to feel way in during time have be assiduously practising gymnastics be therefore now not only dry also in pleasant glow of warmth quite ready to undertake really formidable part of task still lay before swimming kit have meanwhile be taken down into stokehole so that when be handed to be not only nearly dry what be very much more to purpose comfortably warm donning fine warm boat cloak accompanied skipper to deck walked aft to take look at task before found that have taken boat in to very edge of outer line of surf stretched away inshore of line after line in apparently interminable procession of breaker like line of infantry rushing forward to assault vaguely visible in pallid phosphorescence against blackness of starless night to fight way to shore through wide area of roaring leaping seething breaker promised to be task must tax strength energy to utmost limit be case of necessity have undertaken to do therefore throwing off borrowed boat cloak with word of farewell to skipper of boat waited for next oncoming breaker dived overboard at precise moment when must catch up in mighty arm sweep without effort on part good twenty fathom toward shore b r r r water struck icy cold to warm skin a plunged deep into heart of great arching mass of water caught just a be rising to surface hurled shoreward with irresistible force rolling over over like cork a broke into long line of hissing pallid foam knew exactly what to expect be fully prepared for therefore allowed to do with just what must holding breath waiting until breaker have passed ahead spent force then striking out strongly a came to surface swam on toward next line of breaker where same thing be repeated time shade le violently until at length after what seemed like hour a matter of fact must not have be more than about forty minute of battling with breaker foot touched ground moment later last breaker very mild harmless one compared with in offing lifted up almost gently deposited on beach upon hand knee crawled up above watermark then rose to foot to look about recover breath get bearing after stinging cold of water air felt quite pleasantly warm knew must soon get chilled if did not keep moving briskly so seeing line of watch fire about mile away from position guessed must be japanese set out toward at brisk walking pace ground being fortunately open in direction be few minute before found unexpectedly halted with point of japanese sentry bayonet gently pressing against breast of course have countersign appearance particularly unconventional garb must have convinced of truth of story that being unable to get ashore in other way have swum in from fleet with communication from admiral for general oku for passed on to next sentry without hesitation thus in course of ten minute found in tent of certain colonel who not only have heard of have also seen now recognised from learned that general staff quarter be situated about mile farther inland on one of lower slope of mount sampson to very kindly offered to conduct of course must not present before general oku in bathing rig be not without difficulty that suit of clothes be at length found into must get be managed at last off went colonel companion seeming to be greatly impressed with swimming feat wonder remarked if there be anything that englishman must not at least attempt to do way led through japanese camp so have very good opportunity to observe what domestic life if may so term of japanese soldier be at front be surprised to see how thoroughly possible contingency have be foreseen provided for how many ingenious little device have be thought out included in kit with object of adding to comfort in due time arrived at headquarters late though hour be general staff be not only awake on move be holding sort of council of war for purpose of making final arrangement for morrow a happened arrival be most opportune for staff be planning detail of assault must by possibility be successful without assistance of navy upon be confidently reckoning whereas be duty to inform that unless there came very quick change of weather must be impossible for ship to co operate have to explain at length why caused immediate change of plan grand assault being provisionally postponed since there be prospect whatever at moment of change of weather occurring in time delivered message produced map explaining various marking upon describing work upon have be engaged during past few day be exceedingly gratified to learn that must greatly simplify assist general plan be also satisfactory to know that japanese have never have slightest suspicion of what be doing be tantamount to assurance that russian be equally ignorant be amazing to see facility with oku altered plan sooner did understand that chance be against fleet being able to help on following day than be ready with alternative scheme in quarter of hour have everything cut dried officer present be given clear concise instruction relative to duty on morrow be dismissed with hint to get what rest might a morrow be to be busy day general oshima who be in command of rd division constituting japanese left very kindly took under wing found sleeping quarter in tent occupant of happened to be out on duty being greatly fatigued after swim slept soundly that night be awakened at dawn by bugle call turned out to see what weather be like to disgust doubtless that of everybody else be worse than ever sky be overcast louring with great rag of dirty grey scud flying athwart face of heaven from westward while top of mount sampson be completely enveloped in mist notwithstanding gale clung to rugged peak rib of mountain very much a tablecloth doe to summit of table mountain there be fog down where be what be even worse be smothered with blinding suffocating cloud of dust for be dry gale hand be devoutly praying that louring sky must dissolve into rain if only for hour just to lay dust so save from unpleasantness of being blinded suffocated a for bay be just one continuous sheet of foam while breaker leapt boiled for space of full mile from beach single glance at be sufficient to make clear that must be impossible for fleet to co operate so long a gale lasted even if tossing mast spray enveloped hull of craft in offing have not told similar tale general oshima walked couple of mile to northward along slope of mount sampson in order to get good view of bay clear of northern spur of nanshan height just to make assurance doubly sure be scarcely necessary to point out to wildly plunging hull of ship to make understand hopelessness of case once clearly established hurried back to headquarters to make report oku however be not man to be deterred by weather indeed anything else finding that projected assault be impossible for moment resolved to begin bombardment with own gun doing best must with unaided accompanying bombardment with what termed demonstration in force in order to bring out russian compel to man defence while exposed to fire of gun thus by curious combination of circumstance appeared that at last be to be afforded opportunity of seeing what land battle be like naturally volunteered service in capacity where must be made useful general eagerly closed with offer be particularly anxious to obtain exact range of certain of russian position without being obliged to fire trial shot asked if must do for seeing that have already done similar work quite recently told must must with pleasure if such thing a box sextant azimuth compass be to be found in camp somewhat to surprise turned out upon inquiry that such thing be to be have therefore have recourse to what be known among engineer a plane table be obliged to extemporise with apparatus used in conjunction with carefully measured line three hundred yard in length be soon able to supply information required whole device be of course of very rough ready description be greatly gratified when first shot be fired to see shell drop upon exact spot aimed at task general oku have undertaken must accomplish before advance must be made by upon port arthur be exceedingly difficult one a have already be said effected landing at point near yentoa bay distant sixty mile north east of port arthur a crow fly from thence must need make way to port arthur overland since there be such thing for a getting there by sea about way on journey occurred isthmus of kinchau be only about two mile wide must traverse on way neck of land two mile wide be great matter to fortify fact russian speedily demonstrated to march along such narrow strip of land with sixteen thousand resolute armed men saying nay must be difficult enough in conscience be that strip of land level unhappily for japanese be not so nanshan height running through from north to south like raised backbone leaving only very narrow strip of low ground on side of be only difficulty japanese have to contend with for three mile north east of narrowest part of isthmus towered mount sampson over two thousand foot in height commanding entire neighbourhood affording ideal position for russian battery then at foot of mount sampson lay walled city of kinchau russian have seized fortified finally there be nanshan height upon crest of russian have constructed ten fort armed with seventy gun several of be of inch inch calibre firing shell of from two hundred to one hundred pound weight to attempt to pas several position while be in hand of russian must have be simply courting annihilation first task therefore be to capture so far a mount sampson be concerned have be done when arrived upon scene there still remained kinchau nanshan height to be taken of threatened to be even tougher piece of work than storming of mount sampson for russian after experience of extraordinary intrepidity of japanese when storming mountain have adopted conceivable mean to make height impregnable first of there be ten fort with seventy gun lining crest of height in addition to russian have two battery of quick fire field artillery ten machine gun next in front of fort along eastern slope of height be side from attack be possible there be row after row of shelter trench solidly roofed with timber covered with earth to protect occupant from artillery fire below again russian have dug countless circular pitfall about ten foot deep shaped like drinking cup with very narrow bottom pit having at bottom stout upright sharpened stake upon hapless person falling in must inevitably be impaled be in fact adaptation of stake pitfall employed by many african other native to capture kill big game pit be dug so close together that of party of stormers rushing up slope large proportion must inevitably fall in be unwittingly pushed in by comrade passage between pit be purposely left here there be mined mine being connected to one of fort above by electric cable so that must be exploded at moment by merely pressing button moment must of course be when passage way be crowded with japanese lastly at foot of hill there be great maze of strongly constructed wire entanglement during slow passage of hapless stormers must be exposed to withering rifle shell fire thus task japanese have to perform be first to pas through wire entanglement at foot of hill next to achieve passage of staked pit mined ground between exposed time be remembered to terrific fire from fort trench above next to take line after line of trench finally to storm fort on crest of height task frankly admit seemed to impossible must confess that first impression of land battle be disappointing have expected to see japanese march out storm height under cover of fire of own gun a matter of fact did march out there be storming of height have momentarily forgotten that what be witnessing be merely demonstration presume served purpose however for general staff seemed to be perfectly satisfied with result in case have effect intended of compelling russian to man trench under fire of japanese gun feeble though be a compared with of enemy must have inflicted severe punishment upon packed mass of infantry who swarmed into trench to repel what have reason to suppose be genuine attack japanese closely watched by russian captive balloon be sent up directly troop be seen to be in motion having compelled russian to turn out expend considerable quantity of ammunition in comparatively innocuous long range shooting calmly marched back again about three o'clock in afternoon about time firing ceased while lasted however be hot enough to bring on heavy rain day ended with tremendous downpour converted hillside into network of miniature cascade must have be exceedingly unpleasant for of russian whom expediency watchfulness compelled to remain in trench with gale increased in fury rain have produced at least one good result have laid dust most effectually while have made little mud for thirsty earth seemed to absorb water almost a fast a fell also cooled air considerably be to advantage of japanese who must have strenuous work of climbing hill while must tend to chill benumb russian who must be compelled to remain comparatively inactive in sodden trench whether be consideration fact that barometer be rapidly rising combination of can not say about ten o'clock night word went round that general attack upon russian work be to be made a soon a possible after midnight chapter fourteen storming of nanshan height by midnight change of weather have occurred wind at ten o'clock in evening have be blowing harder than ever suddenly subsided air grew close almost to suffocation immense black cloud settled down upon summit of mount sampson where rested broodingly sure precursor of thunderstorm if be judge of weather lore first troop to move consisted of detachment of th engineer battalion who be assigned perilous duty of blowing down gate of kinchau of there be four corresponding to four cardinal point of compass volunteered to accompany party for task devolved upon be one that rather appealed to be most emphatic in refusal explaining that must more than probably require service at daylight shortly afterward to communicate with squadron in offing accordingly have to stand aside somewhat unwillingly see march off without be perhaps just a well for attempt resulted in failure man who participated in be killed just a engineer marched out of camp on way to kinchau brooding cloud on summit of mount sampson began to send forth flash after flash of vivid lightning green blue sun bright lighted up not only rugged slope of mountain also other more deadly slope of nanshan height while peal after peal of thunder crashed rolled reverberated among ravine scored side of mountain be weird enough scene of weirdness be intensified by russian searchlight be turned on with first crash of thunder russian appeared to mistake for roar of japanese gun a matter of fact appeared to be bit panicky night for not only did turn on searchlight at first sound of thunder occupant of fort trench on crest side of nanshan height at once opened terrific fire from piece great small must be brought to bear upon foot of slope be instantly swept by very hurricane of shrapnel rifle bullet while japanese safely under cover looked on smiled for two hour storm raged with such fury that volleying peal of thunder quite outroared booming of russian artillery rifle fire gradually died down a muscovite began to realise that there be attack about two o'clock in morning storm passed away still rumbling muttering to eastward during two hour of elemental fury chinese village in neighbourhood be set on fire practically destroyed while several japanese soldier be struck by lightning killed outright more le seriously injured with passing of storm thick white mist arose from low ground completely blotting out everything beyond few yard distant under cover of mist japanese made disposition for coming battle entirely unseen by enemy probably unheard also for be revelation to to see how quietly large body of men must be moved when necessity for silence have be fully impressed upon a dawn gradually brightened sky behind ridge of mount sampson russian again became uneasy rifle once more began to speak from trench shot here then shot yonder followed by quite spluttering here there all along front artillery remained silent for fog be still so dense that nothing must be seen at to aim protected by cover of fog japanese soldier went to breakfast fortifying with good meal in preparation for arduous labour of day lay before did same for knew not how long might be before must again have opportunity to eat drink also following example of several of officer men filled jacket pocket with biscuit provided with good capacious flask of cold tea having done felt ready for anything have barely finished breakfast when sun showed over ridge of mount sampson almost immediately thick curtain of fog have thus far so effectually hidden movement of japanese troop from enemy began to lift thin be signal for final movement prior to storming of nanshan height movement be directed against city of kinchau being known by time that devoted band of engineer who have be dispatched at midnight to blow in gate of city must have failed in mission otherwise of at least must have be back to report to st division be assigned task of taking city did in brilliant style marching upon southern gate party of four engineer be sent forward to blow in massive barrier be protected by steel plate band secured by heavy steel bolt loopholed for musketry devoted quartette succeeded in placing blasting charge igniting fuse under heavy fire not only from loopholed gate also from wall in so doing be so severely wounded that after have lighted fuse be unable to effect escape received further severe injury when explosion occurred gate be blown off hinge then waiting st division straining like eager hound held in leash rushed forward through thick acrid smoke with levelled bayonet yelling banzai nippon a ran a charged impetuously in through south gate enemy went streaming a impetuously out through west gate about mile away kinchau be now in hand of japanese be not sufficient for must need pursue flying russian did so with such furious impetuosity that literally drove into sea be to say into water of kinchau bay where luckless russian to number of five hundred be either shot down drowned almost to man only ten of surviving being taken prisoner have distant view of whole affair from knoll on northern spur of nanshan height where have taken up position commanded view not only of practically whole of ground over stormers must have to pas also of bay fleet to must probably be required to signal from time to time a fight progressed meanwhile mist have by time lifted revealing flotilla of torpedo boat destroyer feeling way into bay keeping bright lookout for possible mine well astern of came akagi chokai still farther out be old hei yen cruiser tsukushi cautiously creeping in with leadsmen perpetually sounding on beam bottom about where be required to be be flat tide be on ebb great fear of skipper of two craft therefore be that might touch ground hang there left by tide exposed helplessly to fire of russian gun thanks however to labour of few day earlier be able to get close enough in to open upon russian work at extreme range although until tide must rise must not bring thoroughly effective fire upon russian battery so put out of action if have ship so too have russian in shape of gunboat bobr five small steamer in hand bay on side of isthmus opposite to kinchau bay nanshan height being between so that be hidden from sight of other bobr be likely to prove very awkward customer for for mounted one inch one inch gun although be long way from being up to date be still quite good enough to out range japanese field gun severely pepper left occupied ground at head of hand bay steamer accompanied be spy discovered fitted up expressly for purpose of quickly ferrying troop across from one side of hand bay to other according a might be wanted instead of being obliged to march round head of bay in face of troop thus russian be in position to harass left flank rear to rush reinforcement across head of bay distance of about mile a circumstance might require bohr began day proceeding by opening fire with inch gun upon artillery of rd division have taken up position upon lower slope of mount sampson from must reach russian battery established upon crest of nanshan height gunboat fire did very little mischief seemed to be regarded by side a signal to begin fight for at once battery got to work shell dropping with most beautiful precision upon gun trench of russian be so stationed that have most excellent view of practically entire scene of operation sooner did artillery open fire than russian battery replied with crash seemed to make very air quiver land battle be very different spectacle from sea battle in respect that in latter shell hit miss mark if miss there be splash two that end matter so far a particular shell be concerned ashore shell whether not find mark hit something though be only ground immediately there be violent explosion flash of fire great cloud of smoke violent scattering of dust clod of earth stone if nothing worse thus must confess that for few second be perfectly amazed to see slope of mount sampson on one hand where artillery be placed nanshan height on other where be situated russian battery suddenly burst into great jet of flame cloud of smoke flying debris a shell showered down upon explosion of shrapnel be easily distinguished from of common shell for former almost invariably burst in air smoke from explosion standing out against background of sky hill like tuft of cotton wool have suddenly sprung into existence from nowhere very shortly after artillery duel began saw japanese infantry moving out to storm nanshan height smiled to myself at acuteness of leader for men began advance in such open formation that shrapnel shell seldom succeeded in accounting for more than one man often enough failed to do even that of course be seen from trench terrific rifle fire be opened upon for same reason be very ineffective at outset at least for rifleman have to be crack shot to bowl over man at distance of close upon mile if one wished to get man have to aim at correctly judge distance too of course be at beginning of attack later on matter became good deal more favourable for defender correspondingly adverse to attacking force be interestedly watching development of attack upon height when galloper dashed up to with message from general requesting to signal ship in offing to concentrate fire upon nanshan ridge so smart be men so keen lookout be maintaining aboard ship that within three minute of receipt by of order inch inch inch shell be dropping all along ridge busily searching for russian battery position of unfortunately must not be seen from western side for next half hour be kept incessantly employed in signalling fleet directing fire shoal water of kinchau bay be against although ship drew in so close that touched ground several time be still too far off to actually silence russian battery although contrived to give very severe punishing to extent distract attention from stormers unfortunately must only muster six heavy gun between at extreme range at be obliged to fire be not nearly enough though certainly helped when at length be once more free to turn attention to what be happening on eastern side of height saw that foremost line of skirmisher have reached spot about mile distant from first russian defence consisting of perfect maze of wire entanglement be signalling back to main body almost immediately detachment of cossack appeared advancing at gallop toward signaller from direction of linshiatun village on shore of sunk bay a horseman appeared japanese soldier vanished a if by magic having flung down upon ground taken cover on swept cossack yelling lashing horse with whip brandishing long lance suddenly down went horse rider next instant cossack flung up arm collapsed inert upon horse neck then reeled fell then two three went down almost at same instant then dozen curious thing about be that there be nothing sudden spurt of flame smoke wreath crack of rifle to account for casualty be to say must neither see hear anything fact be that cossack be going down before calm deliberate rifle fire of concealed japanese infantry men then flash from one of field gun of rd division caught eye before sharp bark of reached ear white tuft of cotton wool like smoke suddenly appeared in air above galloping cossack more of went down flash more tuft of cotton wool leaping into view tremendous disorder confusion among cossack men horse falling right left then survivor suddenly wheeled outward galloped back at headlong speed leaving behind mangled heap of men horse greater number dead here there prostrate kicking horse might be seen wounded cossack crawling slowly painfully away from scene of carnage flight of cossack be signal for resumption of advance by japanese whose skirmisher reappeared still in very open formation man here man there showing for few second a in crouching attitude rose to foot scurried forward few yard then again took cover while fire of russian gun swept ground over be passing a yet however there appeared to be very few casualty among men here there noticed prostrate form lying motionless while others crept up scuttled past have be found by shrapnel shell share of work be done even shrapnel can not do much harm if formation be kept sufficiently open a man after man pushed forward others crept out following until whole of ground between line base of height be dotted with japanese infantry men creeping ever closer up to first line of russian defence terrible maze of barbed wire entanglement meanwhile whole of japanese field artillery a well a of ship be concentrating fire upon crest of height covering advance of stormers now attention be once more diverted from advance by necessity for to signal direction to fleet now be that full value of previous labour began to be manifested for have to signal ship to direct fire upon such such point wherever in fact russian battery be proving especially troublesome that gun layer have to do be to refer to map with have supplied be at once informed of exact range of point with result that hail of shell instantly began to fall upon particular battery with most deadly precision thus after little while battery on height became in turn focus of terrific crossfire from ship field battery effect of soon became manifest in silencing of several of russian gun by dismounting a afterwards discovered by complete destruction of men working with gun of fleet playing such havoc among ten fort crowned height now became possible for field artillery to turn attention upon trench tier after tier of lined eastern slope of height up stormers must have to pas trench be quite formidable work roofed over with timber earth to protect occupant from artillery fire loopholed for rifle fire yet thanks again to labour of previous day in determining exact range of gun be able to search from end to end blowing parapet to dust matchwood hurling wreckage among gunner who be working russian quick firers machine gun many of whom be thus killed wounded carnage must have be indeed be a later saw for frightful yet russian maintained most gallant defence clung to trench with unflinching determination lucky shell from one of field gun fell upon exploded one of many russian mine be scattered pretty thickly over hillside explosion blew big gap in one of line of wire entanglement circumstance without doubt resulted subsequently in saving of many life hour after hour artillery duel proceeded gunner doing utmost to cover slow advance of stormers while russian artillery systematically swept with crossfire inch of ground men must have to traverse crash of artillery be continuous most distracting effect be intensified by incessant scream of shell sharp thud a burst interspersed with everlasting hammering of machine gun quick firers nanshan be ablaze with fire of russian gun bursting of shell entire hill be enwrapped in fantastically whirling wreath of smoke be moment rent violently asunder by explosion of bursting shell thus far have occupied position undisturbed about mid morning certain russian sharpshooter chanced to detect assistant in act of signalling to ship at once favoured with undivided attention to such purpose be compelled to beat hasty retreat change of position be compelled to make be however advantageous rather than otherwise for found perfectly safe spot behind two tall boulder standing close together while effectually shielding from russian bullet still enabled to see be happening yet that might be summed up in very few word just incessant flash of fire great volume of smoke interspersed with smoke patch of flying debris very little else great mass of troop advancing in serried line column after column with colour proudly flying burnished bayonet glistening in sun none of old fashioned pomp circumstance of war when opposing army marched toward other with band playing discharged musket when be near enough to see white of opponent eye then charged with fixed bayonet fighting out hand to hand sort of battle went out of fashion with introduction of breech loading rifle machine gun now with between fifty sixty thousand men in action there be period when not solitary human being must be seen when did appear be only at interval be few in number just man here man there dotted about sparsely over large area of ground visible for perhaps dozen second then lost again hidden behind cover of sort be getting well on toward noon when message reached from general to effect that two battery of russian quick fire field gun have be discovered on summit of nan kwang ling hill eight hundred foot high about mile to westward of nanshan height requesting to signal ship in bay to give whole attention to two battery unfortunately for tide in bay be now on ebb hei yen tsukushi be obliged to haul off to avoid grounding akagi chokai responded nobly to call creeping in until actually felt ground enveloping nan kwang ling knoll in flame smoke have scarcely finished signalling to ship when stir on plain immediately below indicated that general considered artillery preparation complete that actual storming of russian position be now to be attempted battalion of st division situated in japanese centre suddenly deployed into open commenced advance by making series of short rush through field of green barley on opposite side of road from kinchau to linshiatun dashing forward few yard then a machine gun rifle in russian trench be turned upon sinking from view into barley through crept on hand knee until whistle of leader call of bugle gave signal for dash heroism of devoted japanese infantry be something to send thrill through heart of man sooner did show than whole of ground occupied that in front of be swept by devastating crossfire from whole line of russian trench beat down young barley a heavy shower of rain might level to unaccustomed to style of fighting looked a though nothing might venture upon shot swept zone live yet time after time intrepid japanese rose to foot crouching low made yet short rush forward though with sadly diminished number uproar be deafening crash of heavy gun upon crest of height from fort hoshangtao near linshiatun now joined in fray mingled with hammer like thudding of machine gun continuous rolling crackle of rifle fire from trench be frightful then a though be not enough russian gunboat bohr turned inch gun upon advancing japanese quickly getting range began to drop shell right among slaughter one understood must be awful yet prepared a be in measure for what followed stood aghast when finally out of whole battalion mere handful of men numbering perhaps fifty sixty emerged from growing barley made staggering rush toward first line of wire entanglement at once proceeded to attack with nipper fully exposed while to concentrated fire of whole body of defender be forlorn hope of most desperate description one after gallant fellow collapsed died pierced by innumerable bullet first assault have resulted in failure who took part in be wiped out now be that russian deemed moment suitable for counter demonstration bohr doubtless in obedience to signal from shore steamed up toward head of hand bay a far a shoaling water must permit five steamer loaded with troop closely following making a though be intention to land troop upon small promontory jutting out into head of bay be distinct menace to japanese left although might be merely demonstration be imperative to meet might develop into serious most embarrassing attack therefore badly a must be spared from task of shelling height russian trench battery of field gun placed on south western slope of mount sampson be turned upon gunboat accompanying flotilla of steamer latter being compelled to hastily retire while several of shell struck bohr temporarily silenced fire judging from appearance generally gunboat appeared to have be rather severely punished about quarter of hour later slowly retired to former position farther down bay re opened fire although with considerably le vigour than before fire from fort hoshangtao occupying promontory separate sunk bay from hand bay be most galling factor in fight for gun have range enabled to drop heavy shell right upon left centre while be out of range of own gun therefore men have to stand motionless hour after hour endure pitiless shelling of russian gunner with bitter knowledge that to silence fort be quite out of power utter annihilation of first battalion of stormers warned general oku that to advance comparatively small party be to sacrifice uselessly while also indicated that task of artillery preparation have be by mean a complete a have judged to be therefore sedulously continued work of preparation through afternoon until five o'clock when message from artillery commander warned that crisis be at hand message be to effect that have fired away practically entire supply of ammunition only reserve round remaining what be to do situated a be at distance of more than two mile from headquarters upon outlying spur of nanshan height quite alone save for companionship of solitary assistant signaller with only occasional curt order from general in reference to signal wished to transmit to ship in offing be naturally ignorant a to critical pas at have arrived must only draw conclusion from what actually saw happening what occurred at staff headquarters during momentous day especially at momentous hour did not learn until several hour later so far a be possible propose to relate event in chronological order that proper continuity of narrative may be maintained will therefore briefly state here that when general received artillery commander message that ammunition be practically exhausted summoned few of principal officer held brief council of war what be to be done under circumstance be now five o'clock in afternoon bringing up of further supply of ammunition must involve delay of at least two hour probably more while to suspend action meanwhile must practically be to defer assault until next day certain of officer present strongly advocated postponement giving a opinion that to attempt to storm height unsupported by adequate gun fire be merely to make useless sacrifice of whole brigade of sorely needed men one two officer indeed ventured to express conviction that height be impregnable discussion lasted about quarter of hour at end of time general oku who have be listening saying nothing abruptly broke up council by announcing determination to risk everything upon single cast of die gunner be to expend reserve round of ammunition upon slow carefully considered deadly bombardment of height while entire infantry force be to move forward simultaneously to assault officer who have ventured to advise delay shook head doubtfully at once proceeded to station fully prepared to loyally support general to last breath when news of general decision be communicated to troop be only with utmost difficulty that must be restrained from cheering so putting russian on qui vive although have be warned beforehand to maintain strict silence first step in proceeding be for officer commanding various regiment to call for volunteer prepared to undertake task of preceding main body of stormers in order to cut way through line of wire entanglement to sever electric cable connecting innumerable ground mine with fort volunteer be invited to step six pace to front in majority of case entire regiment appealed to advanced six pace with precision promptitude of parade evolution under such circumstance there be of course one thing to be done be for captain to choose certain number of men considered best adapted for work detail for duty men veritable forlorn hope discarding knapsack greatcoat everything in shape of impedimenta even weapon armed only with stout pair of wire cutting nipper dashed out of rank like unleashed greyhound at word of command with great shout of banzai nippon went running leaping through field of young barley eager to outdistance others a went crash of own enemy artillery fire of have be languishing burst forth afresh mingled with hammering of machine gun rolling volley of rifle fire in moment whole of ground over pioneer must have to pas be being swept by crossfire of lead in seemed impossible that anything must live man after man be seen to go down yet still comrade pressed on in ever diminishing number until at length mere handful staggered up to first line of wire entanglement there fell riddled with bullet task unaccomplished not for moment did fate discourage who be detailed to follow like racer dashed forward in widely extended order now leaping high in air anon crouching almost double in vain effort to dodge terrible inexorable hail of bullet again man after man went crashing to ground while other panting gasping breathless men staggered stumbled past prostrate figure intent upon one purpose only to reach line of wire sever few of entanglement before yielding up life few of actually contrived to accomplish purpose before died although damage be able to do be quite incommensurate with frightful sacrifice of life cost in accordance with oku plan main body of stormers followed closely upon heel of volunteer wire cutter st division led way dashing forward losing heavily until arrived within few yard of foremost line of russian trench here be brought to standstill by wire entanglement while russian rifle machine gun fire played upon pitilessly mowing down in heap in desperation of seized firmly rooted post to wire be attached strove to root up by main force while others placed muzzle of rifle against wire pulling trigger severed in way attempted to climb over wire others to creep through where one succeeded twenty became entangled be shot dead before must clear however who contrived to get through at once gave attention to mine position of be clearly indicated by settlement of ground caused by rain of preceding night thus became possible to sever several of electric cable connected with fort awful entanglement still held up main body of stormers keeping fully exposed to murderous fire from trench a desperately strove to break through thing be beginning to look very bad indeed for side when chanced to notice that russian line on left be weak bulk of men having be rushed toward centre where attack be being most fiercely pressed in instant recognised that here be opportunity only opportunity perhaps to retrieve fortune of day turning to companion said dare not leave post here for at moment may receive message to be signalled to ship can will manage single handed for next quarter of hour so if be game to sprint across open to carry message from to general ogawa will find somewhere yonder in command of th division if run hard can cover distance in five minute be game to try be honourably game illustrious captain replied man standing at salute good said then make way a quickly a possible to general ogawa when have found say come from captain swinburne explain to where be posted tell that from here can see that russian left have be so greatly weakened that surprise attack on part must certainly turn thus very materially help frontal attack tell will be necessary for to lead troop along shore of bay in direction pointing say that may even be necessary for troop to enter water wade for distance since tide be rising that if will do be certain can retrieve day understand then go with salute man swung round upon heel sprang away down hill running like startled hare in le than five minute saw rush into line of th division then feeling pretty confident that ogawa must recognise opportunity seize snatched up signal flag that assistant have dropped proceeded to call up fleet after calling for about minute dropped flag placed glass to eye be right be keeping bright lookout afloat tsukushi be waiting to receive message therefore at once proceeded to signal to be ready to support anticipated movement with gun fire by time have done men of th brigade be proceeding at something bit faster than double toward shore while gun in squadron opened in support a have anticipated troop be obliged to actually enter water of bay in place rose breast high pushed through losing rather heavily hurled upon russian flank rear while others getting inkling of what be happening from sound of heavy firing on other side of hill pressed home frontal attack thus keeping russian main body busily engaged with yell of banzai banzai nippon men of th brigade fought way forward foot by foot using rifle bayonet with such furious energy suddenly russian broke fled before with howl of exultation victorious japanese scrambled forward upward until figure became visible to comrade below still fighting desperately in effort to break through russian line thirty engineer of victorious th division be now detailed to cut path through wire entanglement still protected russian trench did lying flat upon ground without attempting to raise head twenty two out of thirty be killed in accomplishment of task way be made through poured be gallant brigade th regiment taking lead next moment be in russian trench fighting desperately hand to hand japanese determined to drive out russian russian equally determined to hold ground at cost now stormers of st rd division seeing success of comrade be stung into making of further effort hurling bodily upon entanglement actually broke down by sheer physical force although hundred be horribly mangled in process despite awful fire from rifle machine gun mowed through up swept irresistibly until with deafening yell of banzai joined victorious comrade on crest planted banner of japan upon topmost height of nanshan for few brief breathless minute member of staff watching from below beheld glint ruddy flash of bayonet in light of setting sun a russian made last desperate effort to hold ground japanese infantry intoxicated with success in face of stupendous difficulty must take denial have conquered wire entanglement braved machine gun fire now mere flesh blood be a powerless to stop a thread be to stop battleship russian simply have to fly die chose former alternative retreating in disorder upon nankwang ling while japanese whose turn be now to take revenge for loss so pitilessly inflicted upon through hour of terrible day rained shot shell without mercy upon flying foe weather have be improving ever since morning now a firing gradually died down sun sank into water of gulf of liaotung in blaze of purple golden splendour a palpitant edge of glowing upper rim vanished beneath long level line of western horizon firing on side suddenly ceased altogether great solemn hush fell upon scene be positively awe inspiring after continuous deafening roar day of cannonade crash of bursting shell then a ear accustomed to sudden silence became aware of low terrible sound breaking moaning of hundred of mangled suffering dying men ghastly fruit of ferocious struggle for possession of few barren acre of rough hilly country suddenly fast gathering dusk of evening became illuminated station building in little village of to fang shan be ablaze doubtless purposely set on fire by russian to hinder possible pursuit be soon mass of flame flickering light from luridly illuminated scored gashed side of neighbouring hill finally with terrific roar russian magazine exploded sending up great column of flame smoke a reverberation of explosion rumbled echoed again again until finally died away among gorge ravine of surrounding elevation silence again sank upon scene victorious japanese being so utterly exhausted by herculean labour that pursuit of flying russian became impossible conqueror flinging down on position have gained instantly sinking into kind of lethargy fatigue being so great that be unable to remain awake long enough to partake of food be quickly prepared for chapter fifteen be thanked in presence of army japanese loss incurred in struggle for possession of nanshan height amounted to over four thousand killed wounded what russian loss in killed wounded totalled up to think ever knew excepting that by evidence of captured trench alone must have be tremendously heavy material loss however amounted to sixty eight gun many of be of inch inch calibre ten machine gun three searchlight dynamo considerable quantity of ammunition food while victory gave to japanese complete command of isthmus by enabling general nakamura to seize linshiatun fort hoshangtao in immediate neighbourhood thus opening way to occupation of nan kwang ling dalny advance of oku army upon port arthur a soon a became evident that fighting be over for day by time have become too dark for to signal to squadron in offing made way down hillside to spot where headquarters staff be established seeking general oku tent entered reported general received very kindly courteously must see in moment that be tremendously busy tent being full of officer to whom be rapidly issuing order having therefore reported received order to remain in camp for night withdrew sought hospitality of host of previous night who accorded very warm cordial welcome there be none of joyousness that exaltation of spirit have expected to see a result of brilliant victory have gained number be le than have be on previous night absentee be lying out under star dead wounded somewhere yonder upon shot scored blood drenched slope of nanshan joy of victory be quenched in sorrow for fallen snatched hasty almost silent meal then of who have not to go forth on duty rolled in cloak sought relief of sleep for own part slept like log only awoke when bugle sounded reveille little party turned out tubbed took breakfast then at sound of assembly sallied forth to see what be to be next item on programme strong ambulance party have be busily engaged through night collecting wounded bringing in to hospital tent work be now practically finished preparation for disposal of dead have not yet be begun still weary troop be falling in under arm in distance recognised general oku surrounded by member of staff already on ground commanding officer be at post non commissioned officer be busily engaged in seeing that troop be in order for inspection few minute later roll call be being gone through done troop be put through few simple evolution terminated in being drawn up in close formation constituting three side of hollow square with men facing inward general oku then summoned aide de camp to side gave brief order aide saluting turned away glanced rapidly about finally making way toward where now stood alone at great distance halted within about six pace of saluted said commander in chief desire immediate presence most honourable captain stand yonder right said will join at once have idea what want for think can guess replied companion a fell into step beside be sure that general will prefer to make known to said more couple of minute later halted before general staff oku took returned salute then shook hand with with much cordiality requested to take up position alongside on right hand done proceeded to make little speech to closely packed troop shorn of rather strange to western ear flowery phraseology peculiar to japanese speech ran somewhat a follows soldier of second japanese army gladly seize first available opportunity present to tender on behalf of august emperor people of japan most heartfelt thanks for glorious victory by indomitable courage sacrifice so nobly achieved yesterday difficulty be called upon to surmount be so stupendous valour of enemy so great that there be moment when almost became persuaded that position be attacking be impregnable that courage devotion have displayed have gone for nothing yet must not quite bring to believe that soldier of japan must ever permit to be beaten under circumstance however adverse therefore called upon again for one last supreme effort valour devotion with responded to call be attested by victorious presence of glorious flag upon height to day here general be interrupted by soul stirring shout of banzai from exultant troop echo of shout have not died away among surrounding hill before serried mass of infantry be once more silent motionless a statue oku resumed be proud officer be proud be sure that yourselves be proud of glorious achievement yet soldier must not arrogate to ourselves entire credit of so magnificent victory without assistance of navy that victory say frankly must have be impossible sailor therefore be entitled to equal share of glory yesterday reaped on slope of terrible height rejoice chance have afforded so early opportunity a to tender personal thanks thanks of officer thanks of soldier in rank to navy here represented by noble gallant captain swinburne here there be further shout of banzai even more enthusiastic if be possible than preceded general raised hand for silence presently proceeded be however indebted to captain swinburne not only a representing navy also in purely personal form through trying hour of yesterday stood on slope of height alone save for companionship of solitary signaller exposed during part of time to pitiless fire of enemy in constant danger of being captured during whole of time devoted unsparingly to task of directing fire of ship to spot where from time to time be most urgently needed crowning great service by sending communication to commander of th division enabled officer to effect diversion resulted in hard won victory have therefore now in presence of honour to tender to captain swinburne on behalf of august emperor thus publicly heartfelt thanks for inestimably valuable service yesterday rendered to cause of japan so saying general oku turned to gave hearty handshake example be immediately followed by officer of staff while troop put cap upon bayonet waved enthusiastically yelling banzai until be sure must have felt a hoarse a crow little ceremony over received general permission to rejoin ship a soon a have penned dispatch to admiral misamichi who be in command of squadron requested to deliver dispatch received about hour later from oku own hand whereupon bade member of staff farewell wished best of luck in further encounter with enemy then hurried away to little cove on north side of bay have used on two three previous occasion where have shrewd suspicion must find boat awaiting be not mistaken shortly after six bell in forenoon watch be aboard tsukushi handing over general oku dispatch to admiral latter at once read seemed much gratified at content however did not communicate to shrewdly surmised that be letter of thanks for service rendered by squadron intimation that presence be no longer needed so far a latter part of assumption be concerned be doubtless right for after little chat during briefly related experience of previous day learning in return that chokai have lost commander two men killed with two lieutenant five men wounded received instruction to return to ship a squadron must presently proceed to rejoin admiral togo at base hour later be steaming out of bay two day after arrival at base destroyer kagero arrived with mail for fleet to great surprise brought for letter from uncle bob a well a one from chum young gordon from sir robert naturally first opened letter from uncle bob for not only be first letter have received from of family since disgrace also envelope be deeply edged with black first fear be that might contain announcement of death of dear aunt betsy upon extracting content of envelope be at once reassured for saw that really consisted of two letter one from uncle bob other from aunt there have be death in family however that of cousin bob author of trouble have resulted in dismissal from british navy appeared that while engaged in battle practice there have be bad accident on board terrible one of quick firers having burst killing two men wounding five others one of latter so seriously that have subsequently died that one be bob when informed by ship surgeon that have few hour to live have sent for chaplain to have made full confession of crime declaring that have be spurred to by blind unreasoning jealousy of chaplain horrified at what heard took down confession in writing poor bob have signed after chaplain have added at dying lad request expression of deep contrition for misdeed prayer to for forgiveness of wrong have done two letter be sad reading for have be penned by heart broken people who have not only lost only son have learned at very moment of loss that pride in have be misplaced that have be guilty of deliberate despicable cruel crime shame sorrow be patent in sentence of letter indeed made effort to conceal finished up by saying that bob being gone from gone so tragically hoped must forgive for hard thought may have have of must be son to in place of one have lost further begged that innocence now being established must lose time in hastening home to to comfort in bitter bereavement to take step to procure reinstatement in british navy have be informed might probably be accomplished without much difficulty under circumstance letter from sir robert gordon be also chiefly in reference to bob death particular of of confession have learned from son ronald also be of opinion that in view of bob confession ought not to be very difficult to secure cancellation of expulsion whenever might choose to return to england said word suggesting must return at once on contrary offered own lady gordon very hearty congratulation upon frequency with name have be mentioned in paper a having be specially referred to by togo in dispatch expressed hope that before end of war must have many further opportunity to distinguish letter from aunt uncle moved profoundly grief for loss of only son even more shattered faith in be pathetic in extreme while be easy to see how yearningly heart turned to for comfort consolation in bitter bereavement be smarting with shame at thought that be son lad of whom have be so proud upon whose future have built such high hope who be author of undeserved disgrace ruin so far a career in british navy be concerned wanted at home in order that might have comfort of doing what must to make up to for son treachery in plenitude of affection be for moment more than half inclined to yield to entreaty resign commission in japanese navy go home to forthwith in course of hour two calm reflection came to aid must certainly return to england endeavour to secure reinstatement in navy of own country not until after war be over if lived so long have put hand to plough must not turn back although of course knew that there be plenty of japanese officer quite a good useful a myself quite ready to step into place must choose to vacate came to conclusion however let authority at home be ever so ready to remedy what have proved to be miscarriage of justice must in nowise help case with by forsaking cause have espoused at moment when decisive event of war be beginning a then believed to loom faintly upon horizon told if wished for reinstatement wished for nothing else half so ardently must remain until issue of war be decided when must go back home with good grace taking with fairly creditable record with to back up application meanwhile sat down wrote letter to aunt uncle excusing for not at once acceding to request to forthwith return to england explaining reason have urged to decision pouring out in long passionate declaration pent up affection of heart for sympathy with in bitter sorrow also wrote to sir robert gordon telling that aunt uncle have expressed desire must return to forthwith reiterating reason impelled to decline on following day signal be made from flagship upon proceeding on board be informed by admiral that general oku report a to assistance rendered by ship during battle of nanshan especially of important service personally have rendered on particular day immediately preceded have be particularly gratifying to that have afforded utmost satisfaction pleasure to forward report to baron minister of navy with covering letter from hoped must be of service to meanwhile be instructed to proceed forthwith to port arthur with ship to assist in blockading of port filled bunker replenished stock of ammunition during afternoon steamed out of tashantau harbour with light out a soon a darkness fell steaming dead slow night keeping sharp lookout for enemy ship a rumour have reached admiral that russian be planning raid upon japanese coast by vladivostock fleet might be expected to put to sea at moment saw nothing arrived off port arthur at daybreak on following morning without adventure of kind here fell in with cruiser of blockading fleet to admiral in command of forthwith reported delivered over mail bag for blockading ship with have be entrusted instruction be to remain with blockaders during daytime while at night kasanumi be to take part in mine laying operation in roadstead of beleaguered fortress be nightly conducted with untiring pertinacity shortly after arrival destroyer flotilla have be engaged in operation during night came steaming out among approaching craft recognised with pleasure akatsuki still commanded by former lieutenant staunch friend enthusiastic ito that have by mean forgotten be quickly made manifest for sooner be near enough to identify kasanumi than semaphore started work signalling that wished to communicate upon signalman responding first question be whether be still in command receiving reply in affirmative forthwith invited to go on board ship to take breakfast with when moved amendment to effect that process must be reversed that instead must come breakfast with upon ground that coming fresh from rendezvous larder be probably better stocked than at once joyously accepted invitation quarter of hour later have very great pleasure of welcoming on own quarter deck dear chap be just a enthusiastic just a keen just a full of life a ever seemed unfeignedly glad to see of course have tremendous lot to say to other be most eager to learn what have be doing since parted company when learned that be fresh from kinchau have actually assisted at battle of nanshan height positively refused to say single word about until have given full true particular account of happening of terrible yet glorious day enthusiasm delight a endeavoured to describe final irresistible rush of japanese up heart breaking shot swept slope be supreme seemed to literally swell with pride when spoke of thrilling japanese cheer a fellow countryman finally carried last line of russian defence routed defender leaped to foot repeated shout of banzai again again while eye shone like star tear of joy pride rolled down cheek be time before must turn mind away from event of strenuous day when at length succeeded in doing so must get to talk about appeared that stirring though event seemed to be be nightly happening before port arthur be flat stale unprofitable compared with event a storming of nanshan height so a matter of fact be a soon discovered for for duty of destroyer flotilla consisted simply in steaming inshore night industriously laying mine in roadstead at harbour mouth russian a industriously strove to remove next day true sameness of work be occasionally relieved by more le exciting episode a when for instance russian must suddenly turn searchlight upon battery must open fire then simply have to scuttle for life for of course shore battery mounted very much heavier longer range gun than that destroyer must carry there be sense in attempting a general rule to oppose pounder pounder to inch inch gun yet by mean allowed russian to invariably have own way there be time when under cover of darkness one two of must creep right into harbour entrance getting so close under cliff that became impossible for russian to depress heavy gun sufficiently to reach must boldly engage fort with quick firers even with rifle fire picking off gunner be foolhardy enough to expose not unfrequently dismounting otherwise putting out of action few of lighter gun be good fortune of kasanumi on one occasion very shortly after return to strike one of russian inch canets mounted in fort between golden hill inner harbour fair square upon muzzle blow clean off with shell from pounder such success a be of course very rare engagement between destroyer russian fort be immensely exciting afforded most agreeable welcome change from monotony of mine laying for when undertook such adventure never knew whether not must emerge from scatheless operation of getting in close under cliff undetected be of course hazardous enough to make attempt irresistibly fascinating be getting away again after alarm have be given enemy searchlight have be turned upon when excitement reached height for of course moment that be far enough away from shelter of beetling cliff to enable russian to train big gun upon must open fire upon for that be worth then became case of dodging shell be then that ingenuity be taxed to very utmost twisting turning hither thither a ran at full speed into offing always endeavouring to make turn in most unexpected direction possible at precise moment when anticipated that gun be being brought to bear upon on whole be fairly successful be pretty conclusively evidenced by small amount of damage sustained indeed most serious mishap about time in water arose from totally different cause one of officer certain commander oda have invented particularly deadly kind of mine japanese government adopted named after inventor few day after return to water of port arthur oda be engaged upon task of laying of mine in outer roadstead when one of somehow exploded killing captain of ship eighteen men wounding oda seven others strangely enough however ship herself be only very slightly damaged le fortunate be russian for only day two later two of gunboat while engaged in attempt to remove of mine came in contact with craft immediately went to bottom taking most of men with chapter sixteen floating mine be true saying that pitcher go too often to well get broken at last thus came about with rather with kasanumi a day passed became aware of greatly increased activity on part of garrison of port arthur cruising in offing during daytime well beyond range of russian biggest gun yet near enough at hand to make sure that blockade of port be effective sound of violent explosion came floating off to day long telling in unmistakable language strenuous effort be being made to clear channel of sunken steamer wherewith have blocked at such heavy cost to ourselves there must be one reason for such tremendous activity be doubtless that enemy have in contemplation to send fleet to sea probably with object of finding more secure shelter in port of vladivostock surmise be confirmed by spy in port arthur if still further confirmation of intention be needed be to be found in increased effort russian put forth to hamper mine laying operation in roadstead for about time became practice of enemy to send out ship sometimes two even three to lie at anchor in road night ship ship always anchored well under cover of heaviest gun of fortress yet so far out that own heavy gun completely commanded water of roadstead thus tremendously increasing difficulty of sowing water with mine naturally presence of ship in roadstead offered almost irresistible temptation to destroyer to essay task of sinking at least putting out of action desire on part be smiled upon by togo to put case mildly for information be now continually reaching to effect that formidable baltic fleet be being rapidly prepared for sea that departure on long voyage to far east be imminent while togo be naturally anxious that port arthur fleet vladivostock fleet also if possible must be effectually disposed of before arrival of so powerful reinforcement in japanese water therefore great a be risk attending attack of powerfully armed ship at anchor under cover of several formidable fort careful a admiral be of ship of men attempt be made to discourage of torpedo flotilla when desire to attack be made known on contrary desire be smiled upon a have said nothing more than word of caution be given against incurring of unnecessary risk perhaps ought to explain precisely what mean by saying that desire of commander of torpedo flotilla to attack ship be smiled upon by admiral have not only smiled upon have given imperative order that torpedo fleet be to be employed upon possible occasion for harassing discomfiture of enemy tactic employed have be for destroyer torpedo boat to attack in number division even two three division being sent in at time be due to initiative that tactic be now to be altered that attack be now to be permitted by a few a two boat only up to now have be regular practice for large number of craft to creep in toward roadstead at low speed until discovered by enemy searchlight then dash in upon foe at utmost speed through hail of shell discharge torpedo a circled round quarry then dash out again trusting to speed to carry back into zone of safety of course plan have advantage inasmuch a that more there be of greater in theory chance that of must score hit against there be fact that during final rush of torpedo craft upon enemy necessity to maintain highest speed throughout entire period of attack involved forced draught consequently flaming funnel latter of course immediately attracted attention of enemy nullified effort to take by surprise now have by time gained considerable amount of experience of torpedo warfare have not failed to observe in majority of case where attack have failed failure have be due to above cause combined with fact that ten dozen craft ran much greater risk of being picked up by enemy searchlight than must one two have therefore seemed to that taking everything into consideration prospect of successful attack by two craft one to support assist other in case of need be a good a of dozen craft while risk must be very much le provided that attack be made coolly circumspectly in accordance with plan have worked out plan be in brief to run for harbour at normal speed until be practically within effective range then instead of dashing in at full speed to stop engine throb of be loud enough to be heard at considerable distance on quiet night head directly for quarry discharging torpedo when momentum way of boat have carried a far a must go trusting to subsequent confusion to enable to escape unscathed have fully explained view of mine to admiral have obtained sanction to put plan to test accordingly on certain night toward middle of june after russian have be let severely alone for forty eight hour kasanumi accompanied by akaisuki friend ito ship left rest of blockaders with object of putting theory into practice be splendid night for purpose there be breathless calm water be smooth a oil although there be certainly moon be in last quarter did not rise until close upon one o'clock in morning moreover sky be overcast by great sheet of dappled cloud through only solitary star here there peeped faintly be consequently dark enough to afford reasonable chance of getting within striking distance of quarry undetected when russian sent ship out of harbour to lie night in roadstead a did pretty frequently now be custom to get out early in afternoon after destroyer have carefully swept anchorage in search of mine be hope that having left alone for preceding two day must by time be getting suspicious of such unwonted inactivity on part consequently must send out one perhaps even two ship to guard against possible coup on part mine laying craft very rarely got to work before one two o'clock in morning that being hour when human vigilance be popularly supposed to be least active therefore planned to arrive in roadstead about midnight hoping must then catch enemy off guard snatching rest in preparation for moment when activity usually began now thing have most to fear be long distance searchlight established in station on golden hill at height of two hundred foot above sea level searchlight be generally turned on at dusk be kept unceasingly playing upon anchorage adjacent water through night commanded entire roadstead from point three mile east of harbour mouth right round to south west a far a pinnacle rock difficulty be how to avoid being picked up by before have delivered attack by time knew seaward surroundings of port arthur almost by heart knew for instance be most important that searchlight station be placed so far back from edge of crumbling cliff that water immediately at foot of latter for distance of perhaps hundred yard to seaward must not be reached by beam of light be therefore enveloped in darkness rendered deeper more opaque by dazzling brilliance of light also knew that along outer edge of patch of darkness there be sufficient depth of water to float destroyer even at dead low water plan therefore be to make wide sweep to seaward upon leaving blockading squadron gradually turning east north thus eventually to get into takhe bay five mile east of port arthur anchorage from thence creep along shore to westward keeping a close in a depth of water must permit there be only one difficulty about be that at certain point not far from where searchlight station stood there be gap in line of cliff where ground sloped steeply down to water edge for short distance here of course beam of light have uninterrupted play right up to beach believed must overcome difficulty by simply watching opportunity slipping past gap when searchlight be not playing upon went well with until about seven bell in first watch half past eleven o'clock when great bank of fog for sea be notorious came driving in from south west in moment be enveloped in cloud so thick that standing upon bridge must scarcely distinguish aftermost funnel must not see taffrail at be then about three mile from shore with indentation of takhe bay straight ahead of near enough anchorage for man on signal yard to make out before fog enveloped of course that there be two ship at anchor in roadstead one five funnelled craft knew must only be askold while other showing four funnel gathered from description must be armoured cruiser bayan searchlight have of course be in action ever since have made land a beam swept slowly over ship have revealed enough of detail to enable to easily identify be most exasperating that fog must have swept down upon just when did have come hour even hour later must have welcomed for must then have have time to get up within striking distance of ship under cover of fog must have approached closely enough to have made sure of while now well be useless to cry over what must not be helped only thing to do be to make best of thing a be to hope that fog might yet prove friend in disguise after fortunately a fog came sweeping up to have presence of mind to hail man on yard who be at moment describing ship saw riding at anchor in road asking to tell exactly how bore from reply be be square abeam honourable captain immediately put head in through window of wheelhouse demanded of helmsman how be at moment heading answered that be then steering north forty degree west by compass then said alter course at once to west forty degree south that added addressing young hiraoka who be standing beside ought to take to near enough to enable to sight kindly go aft mr hiraoka hail akatsuki telling of shift of helm youngster ran aft to do bidding fog at moment being so thick that be impossible to see one hand before one face even beam of distant searchlight being so effectually obscured that might have be extinguished for that knew to contrary have rung down for engine to stop so that might not run away from akatsuki after shifting helm without informing her of alteration in course everything be now so still that have difficulty in distinguishing young hiraoka hail reply from other destroyer breaking through soft swish lap of water under bow be akatsuki lieutenant who be answering hail have just acknowledged intimation of altered course be ordering own helmsman to make like change when without slightest warning experienced terrific shock felt exactly a though ship have be smitten savage blow from below by giant hammer so violent be be flung high in air over rail of bridge on to steel turtle back deck beneath upon landed head first with such violence immediately lost consciousness before happened be sensible of two thing one of being blinding flash of flame coincident with shock in bow for length of ten twelve foot seemed to crumple up fly to piece while other be that a be tossed high in air sustained violent blow on chest from heavy object seemed to sear flesh like white hot iron then down came upon head knew more first sensation upon coming to myself be that of violent aching over body a though bone in have be broken aching of head be even worse than of body while a for chest smarted throbbed a though blade of burning knife rested upon next became aware be in bed finally opening eye saw be occupant of one of many bed in large airy room somehow seemed familiar to presently identified a ward have once before occupied in hospital at base among elliot island be broad daylight sun be shining brilliantly into room through widely opened window admitted gentle refreshing breeze pleasantly charged with ozone two dainty little woman nurse be doing something at table at far end of room happened to come within range of vision presently heard gentle splash of water in direction immediately brought home to consciousness that mouth throat be parched opened mouth to call to nurse be thirsty be only very faintest of whisper escaped smarting lip be enough however to immediately produce gentle rustle on other side of bed next moment pretty face be bending over pair of soft dark almond shaped eye be gazing sympathetically into mine ah exclaimed owner of eye at last illustrious captain be again be suffering very acutely noble sir suffering whispered rather ache a if have be beaten to jelly be a thirsty a a limekiln can by chance get something to drink bucketful will do to start with bucketful murmured looking anxiously down at a laid long slender pointed finger upon pulse of left hand where rested outside coverlet continued evidently speaking to herself pulse be almost normal there be trace of fever bucketful oh english shook head a though giving up problem that found too difficult for solution shuffled off with curious gait peculiar to japanese woman without saying word to approached other two nurse at far end of ward said something caused to turn stare in direction then senior of party accompanied by girl whom have so tremendously astonished came up to bedside looked at felt pulse shuffled away again presently returning with one of cup with spout from one can drink while in recumbent position placed point of spout between lip next moment be aware that be imbibing delicious broth cup be only about size of ordinary breakfast cup content be gone before must well taste asked for more got second cupful then a be asking for still more medical staff of hospital entered ward whole crowd turned with one accord grouped around bed chief keen clever looking little fellow whose age be impossible to guess at since be clean shaven turned to nurse who be feeding sharply demanded what be that be administering explained adding in seriousness information have demanded bucketful whereupon turned regarded with upraised eyebrow laid finger upon wrist so be suffering from extreme thirst captain eh demanded nodded emphatically ah said yes be only to be expected well turned to head nurse gave certain instruction in so low tone of voice must not catch what said then drawing notebook from pocket very carefully with much consideration wrote what imagined to be prescription tore out leaf handed to nurse with instruction to have made up then turning again to inquired how felt described symptom a well a must wondering while how be be only able to speak in merest whisper member of staff including head must not have listened with more rapt attention have be communicating to item of intelligence of most tremendous import when have finished head drew away from bed to far end of room where for minute appeared to be delivering lecture to member of staff who have followed then lecture being finished came back to side of bed one of nurse having carefully folded back covering a low a waist head proceeded to deftly loosen fastening of enormous bandage now discovered enveloped chest done be very tenderly raised to sitting posture operation gave excruciating pain by way endless turn of bandage be deftly unwound one of nurse seating upon bed supporting meanwhile when at bandage be removed several broad strip of dressing be disclosed upon removal revealed ghastly great jagged wound stretching right across chest edge of have be very neatly drawn together by number of stitch then for first time remembered violent blow on chest have received when bow of kasanumi be destroyed wound be intently examined by entire staff pronounced to be healing most satisfactorily then after being thoroughly sponged with warm water be re dressed fresh bandage applied meanwhile have made discovery that head also be enveloped in bandage when asked why be informed that have received scalp wound however be of serious consequence when also have be re dressed entire operation occupying best part of hour felt considerably easier although much exhausted while wound in chest be being dressed have seized opportunity to look round ward saw that several of bed be occupied one of patient who appeared to be suffering from broken arm being man whom appeared to know a sat staring at turned head eye met whereupon to amazement up went uninjured hand to salute who be that man demanded seem to recognise face do remarked chief ah wonder be one of survivor of disaster by so nearly lost honourable life be one of crew of kasanumi one of crew of kasanumi repeated of course remember now how come to be here be with rest of crew of ship rescued by akatsuki ship be happily at hand when disaster occurred replied chief ah disaster remarked yes be beginning to remember about now what be nature of disaster doctor be that ever ascertained according to friend captain ito who brought here there be doubt that ship struck mine be reply of course went down though not so quickly that entire crew be saved together with most of personal effect there be time indeed to save most if not of belonging captain be now here awaiting convalescence thank said pray when did disaster occur just week ago last night be reply week ago exclaimed in consternation then have lain here time unconscious certainly have replied chief now however that be happily conscious once more must do utmost to keep so to assist recovery therefore more conversation if please until give permission what now have to do be to remain perfectly quiet free from excitement pleasurable otherwise rest sleep take such food such medicine a will order for recover strength a rapidly a possible then when be sufficiently well to receive visitor will permit few of many who be now eager to see to do so no not word therewith little fellow staff turned away proceeded to overhaul rest of patient nurse whom have at first seen upon recovering consciousness appeared to have be specially told off to look after for upon departure of staff came knelt by bedside a be fashion instead of sitting be just within range of vision a lay suppose must have stared at pretty intently for time for presently saw colour rising at once brought to bearing thinking to put at ease said to nurse what be name coloured still more after regarding steadfastly for moment answered contemptible insignificant name illustrious captain be peach blossom peach blossom repeated very appropriate name too by jove see here peach blossom chief surgeon seems to have forgotten said be thirsty do think must find something to drink two three tumbler of cold water now eh have idea that must taste particularly good will speak to chief noble captain if consent will honourably let have replied chief evidently consented few minute later be quenching thirst with most delicious draught have ever tasted be only pure cold water a slowly imbibed told that at last really understood full meaning of term nectar well there be need for to dwell at length upon sojourn in hospital be given to understand be making splendid recovery yet although be brought back to elliot island admitted to hospital on morning of th june be not until nearly three week have passed that be permitted to receive visitor first of whom be fine fellow ito to whom owed life will not readily forget little chap delight when upon entering ward discovered sitting up in bed reading propped up by cushion bed rest sprang forward eye fairly snapping with pleasure excitement seizing welcoming hand shook with such energy good little peach blossom felt constrained to spring hastily to foot rescue from too strenuous demonstration of joy at vigorous remonstrance however dropped hand a though have burnt sinking into chair by bedside proceeded to apologise with almost abject contrition must not be comforted until have assured not quite truthfully be afraid that have not hurt then in answer to question proceeded to tell what knew of matter appeared that at moment when explosion occurred akatsuki be so close to kasanumi that two craft be touching other although from kasanumi bridge where be then standing must not see other destroyer also appeared that at moment when ordered course of kasanumi to be altered akatsuki be close astern of broad on port quarter consequence being that shifting of helm carried so close athwart bow that touched when crossing stern be at moment that explosion occurred ito instantly divining what have happened at once manoeuvred craft in such fashion a to lay alongside fast sinking kasanumi so that crew of latter be able to transfer directly from one ship to other without using boat meanwhile helmsman signalman on kasanumi bridge have seen tossed over rail by force of explosion although severely shaken have instantly flung down upon turtle back where found lying bleeding insensible to pick up carry aft be next thing to be done for realised at once that own ship be sinking did transferring senseless body to akatsuki moment that got alongside be at once taken below temporarily patched up while crew of kasanumi be being transferred together with such of belonging a be able to save cabin steward with utmost devotion concentrating effort upon saving most valuable of belonging regardless of loss of own be at first thought possibly kasanumi might be saved ito did utmost in direction working for more than hour upon stricken craft damage be too serious despite collision mat pump craft continued to settle until at length recognising that effort be useless ordered hand aboard own ship cast off kasanumi foundering almost before akatsuki must back off clear of ito made attempt to attack ship in port arthur road single handed at once shaped course for elliot island running clear of fog hour later arrived at base lost time in having conveyed ashore to hospital where a already recorded lay for week in state of alternating delirium coma before recovered sens doctor assured that be making splendid recovery yet to myself progress appeared to be horribly slow be certainly not accelerated by knowledge that while be lying there helpless big event be happening have appearance of leading up to still bigger event in near future for instance there be second sortie of russian squadron from vladivostock in middle of june lasting over fortnight during inflicted great loss damage upon japanese be most risky thing to do must certainly have resulted in disaster have not poor unhappy admiral kamimura be morally chained down prevented from taking effective measure against raider by stringent order that be to hold strait of korea at cost yet such be human inconsistency notwithstanding above stringent order bound unfortunate admiral hand foot effectually precluded pursuit of raiding ship be so severely blamed by man in street for damage done that mob actually attacked wrecked house of course be most unjust cruel treatment of thoroughly capable zealous man who hampered though be did must to bring raider to book indeed for sudden change of weather at critical moment must probably have brought to action given severe punishing then there be abortive sortie of port arthur fleet three day after destruction of kasanumi true ship be only at sea for about twenty four hour did nothing narrowly escaping capture only by togo over eagerness to engage thus discovering to russian in time to allow latter to make good retreat back to port arthur same felt be losing much in not being present to seemed that plucky little admiral have missed splendid chance over last event for did enemy perceptible damage only succeeded in driving back to lair a matter of fact only injury sustained by russian be that happened to battleship sevastopol struck one of mine a be returning to port arthur anchorage be only got into harbour with utmost difficulty chapter seventeen unexpected promotion among other naval custom japanese have copied from british be that of trying by court martial officer who be so unfortunate a to lose ship on day when first received permission from doctor to take short turn in open air also received intimation that trial for loss of kasanumi must be held week from date on board flagship mikasa must then be in harbour of course be still very much of invalid for although ghastly wound in chest have so far healed that no longer needed dressing be warned that even very trifling exertion might cause to burst open again while have by mean recovered former strength nevertheless on day appointed made shift to walk down to beach supported by arm of orderly with same assistance to climb flagship side ladder when arrived alongside in steam launch have be sent ashore to fetch there be need for to describe at length proceeding of naval court martial have be admirably done by captain marryat a be in day so be to day in essential of course trial be merest formality for there must not be slightest shadow of doubt that craft have be lost through collision with mine while under way in dense fog that be one of incident of war for nobody enemy can be held responsible accordingly be honourably acquitted sword be returned to amid congratulation of admiral officer who have constituted court five day later received visit from togo who seemed to have conceived rather liking for after making most friendly inquiry a to health progress be making toward convalescence repeated congratulation upon acquittal by court martial then asked how much longer thought must be before must again be fit for active service be happily able to assure that unless anything quite unforeseen happened hoped to be quite ready for duty in fortnight even le if service be urgently required remember gave answer with considerable eagerness for there be certain subtle something in tone of admiral question somehow suggested that event of importance be in air good ejaculated togo be excellent news friend for if what hear be true must appear that time be drawing near when will be in urgent need of assistance officer can give will say no more at present except hope will take utmost care of yourself get quite well again a quickly a possible for at present information be too vague to permit to make definite statement meanwhile putting hand into breast pocket producing long official looking document affords utmost pleasure to hand be appointment to command of yakumo have be pleasant duty to mention name in dispatch in connection with many service meritoriously rendered latest having reference to very valuable assistance rendered by prior to during battle of nanshan appointment be outward token of authority appreciation of service be looking forward with much interest to moment when will take up new command for a know yakumo be very fine ship under smart enterprising captain will expect great thing of by jove sir will not be disappointed if can help exclaimed springing to foot in paroxysm of delight grasping hand admiral kindly extended to know how to find word in to express profound gratitude to sir for kindness to from moment when presented before utter stranger continued huskily togo interrupted reaching up patting shoulder in very kind fatherly way there there murmured soothingly say no more about dear boy say more about want wordy expression of gratitude must know that by time if really feel grateful to for anything have done for will show gratitude in deed rather than word when strenuous time arrive already see looming in distance therewith affording opportunity to reply fine little fellow well named nelson of japan hastily shook by hand effected escape while sank into chair almost overwhelmed at extent of good fortune captain of yakumo must scarcely credit a admiral have said yakumo be very fine ship be indeed one of finest armoured cruiser japan at time possessed waterline be protected by belt of krupp steel seven inch thick amidships tapering off to five inch thickness at bow stern mounted four inch quick fire gun in two turret fourteen inch gun on broadside must steam twenty one knot when clean carried crew of five hundred officer men rather different craft from little kasanumi with single pounder five pounder eh felt that in command of such ship a must dare do almost anything delight must have proved important factor in aiding recovery for from moment when received appointment strength came back to so rapidly that instead of fortnight have allowed in conversation with admiral took only nine day to qualify for discharge from hospital to report for duty be proud moment for when stood on spacious quarter deck of new command in presence of hand mustered for occasion read commission appointing to command of ship vacancy have occurred in consequence of death of previous captain when boarded craft did so fully prepared for certain coldness of reception on part of officer for naturally in ordinary course of event command ought to have gone to senior officer one commander arisaka not so on contrary a finished reading commission folded up put in pocket commander approached shook hand in most friendly way expressed extreme gratification felt by rest of officer of ship at finding under leadership of one who a be kind enough to put have so brilliantly distinguished then proceeded to present to rest of officer in rotation in strict accordance with rank of whom found something pleasant complimentary to say by way of response made little speech to hand crew a well a officer in expressed gratification at finding in command of so fine ship manned by so fine crew voiced hope that not only must be able to work comfortably harmoniously together also that admiral must speedily afford opportunity to add fresh laurel to yakumo fame speech elicited quite enthusiastic storm of banzai agreeable relation with officer crew being thus satisfactorily established took up quarter onboard forthwith proceeded to learn ship be to say made intimately acquainted with locality purpose of numerous engine piece of machinery with be fitted number position of magazine content number situation of torpedo tube us of many fitment to be found in conning tower in fact everything connected with working so that in hour of action might have detail firmly fixed in memory ready for use at moment notice wherever found anything capable of improvement unhesitatingly have that improvement carried out although feel bound to say that found very little anywhere needing modification in way by continually exercising crew at such evolution a must be carried out with ship at anchor very soon became perfectly familiar with new command a strength steadily returned began to long for opportunity to test a well a ship crew for during whole of time yakumo with several other cruiser four battleship have be lying at anchor at rendezvous at elliot island not idle by mean like yakumo tuning up for certain eventuality approach of seemed to sense in mysterious way yet after know that there be very much mystery about for secret service agent of whom there be several in port arthur informed that from moment when on memorable sunday th august one of first twenty shell fired at stronghold by investing japanese fell aboard battleship retvisan lying at anchor in harbour seriously damaged there have be general outcry that russian fleet ought to go to sea fight rather than remain in harbour be ignominiously destroyed without striking blow in self defence be known that admiral vitgeft prince ukhtomsky second in command be utterly opposed to course freely expressed opinion being that russian ship already more le seriously damaged by attack to have be subjected from time to time during progress of war be totally unfit to meet engage japanese fleet have reason to believe be in first class fighting trim there be certain officer however whose mortification at enforced inactivity blinded to soundness of judgment if ship must be destroyed let be destroyed at sea in act of inflicting a much injury a possible upon enemy be contention be certainly reasonable one be broadly hinted that leader of faction found mean to convey contention to ear of admiral alexieff for strange to say following day brought wireless message from commander in chief to vitgeft ordering latter to take whole fleet to sea proceed to vladivostock fighting way thither if necessary effort be of course made by vitgeft to keep order profound secret be necessary to communicate to captain of several ship other officer whose duty required that must posse such knowledge delight of of at learning that long cherished desire be about to be granted be not conducive to secrecy moreover sudden feverish hurry bustle of preparation be sufficient advertisement of what be impending very night news be signalled to blockading squadron in offing from be a promptly transmitted by wireless to togo among elliots news be confirmed on following morning by patrol vessel off port from came information that tremendous state of activity be discernible among russian ship that indication pointed toward almost immediate sortie news arrived by wireless about hour after sunrise immediately upon receiving signal be made for captain to at once proceed on board flagship such signal have confidently be expected after news of preceding day be in fact waiting for display be equivalent to starting signal for race for sooner did flag break abroad than be read next instant shrill piping of many boatswain whistle be heard in calm morning air crew of captain gig be seen rushing along boom dropping recklessly down into boat in le than minute mirror like water of harbour be being churned into foam a flotilla of gig darted away from ship gangway ladder striving to be first to arrive alongside mikasa be not first to reach goal for battleship be lying together with cruiser distance outside boat be fourth alongside beating asama gig by length to intense disgust of captain yamada who occupied stern sheet never mind yamada old chap exclaimed a shook hand ascended mikasa side ladder together perhaps will get pull of later on will bet case of champagne that yakumo score hit before asama to day bet be eagerly accepted chatting gaily passed along flagship deck entered admiral state cabin where found togo captain of four battleship already assembled conversing eagerly admiral shook hand with of complimented upon rapid recovery then turned to welcome other captain who be fast arriving while joined little quickly swelling group of officer who have already arrived for of course togo must say nothing until everybody be present be not kept waiting very long however perhaps matter of ten minute after arrival then captain ijichi of mikasa who a captain arrived have be ticking name off list announced that be present rapped sharply on table with sword hilt for silence next moment to use common expression one might have heard pin drop then admiral togo stepped forward unrolled chart spread open upon table stood for moment looking round crowded cabin with curiously intent eager gaze gentleman said wireless message have morning arrived from blockading squadron off port arthur entirely confirms news of yesterday to effect that russian fleet be about to put to sea probably with intention of making for vladivostock imagine vladivostock to be destination for simple reason that there be other port open to moreover a be fully aware there be dry dock at vladivostock large enough to receive battleship conjecture intention of enemy to be to take damaged ship there for purpose of repairing so that may be in condition to reinforce assist baltic fleet upon arrival in water gentleman if be enemy intention must never be carried out must prevent at cost short of loss of own battleship must preserve in order that may be able to meet baltic fleet upon something like equal term when arrives now question of how best to meet port arthur fleet without unduly risking own battleship be one have greatly exercised mind ever since moment when first became apparent that russian be meditating sortie have formed plan will now lay before upon will be very grateful to receive frankly expressed criticism opinion taking for granted that purpose of russian admiral be to make for vladivostock propose to proceed to encounter rock a be aware lie directly in track of ship bound from port arthur southward past shan tung promontory admiral pointed out upon chart position of three place mentioned a spoke there await arrival of russian who will by time be so far from port arthur trust measure propose to take to prevent from returning may be effective need not remind that instruction be have be throughout war to risk battleship a little a possible since upon depends safety of japan fact believe fully realise therefore intend to fight forthcoming battle at long range trusting to superior gunnery to enable to inflict maximum amount of injury upon enemy with minimum amount of injury to ourselves purpose to proceed in following manner yakumo will lead fleet to sea followed by kasagi takasago chitose takachiho naniwa chiyoda in order named will be followed at distance of three mile by six armoured cruiser in wake of will follow four battleship with remaining cruiser destroyer bringing up rear further order can not give at present since plan be necessarily subject to modification according to report will doubt come to from time to time from blockading squadron portion of will follow russian fleet reporting upon formation course steer speed so on only thing further have now to say be that duty of destroyer flotilla will be to keep russian destroyer so fully occupied that latter will have opportunity to approach big ship while opportunity must be seized to attack russian especially battleship be have to say gentleman except that fleet will have honour to meet to day must be destroyed look to of individually to give best assistance in accomplishment of purpose now have officer suggestion to offer will be most grateful for helpful hint nobody spoke eye wandered round cabin searching for possible speaker admiral eye met mine thought there seemed to be question in a nobody else seemed inclined to speak decided to answer that questioning glance there be just one remark must like to make sir if may be permitted said have not good fortune to be present when japanese last met port arthur fleet le than two month ago from have heard with regard to meeting gather that there must have be port arthur fleet to day have not sir be too eager to meet revealing presence to at early moment retirement to port arthur be still possible for if be case obvious lesson to be learnt seems to be that must on account show until russian have run too far off shore to get back again before can intercept must also suggest desirability of taking step to effectually cut off retreat togo nodded smiled gentleman said have heard captain swinburne remark have of anything to add to comment to make upon for moment there be silence then captain matsumoto commanding fuji stepped forward must like to say sir said that entirely concur in what captain swinburne have said unlike gentleman have honour to be present on occasion to refers believe present including sir will be inclined to agree that honourable captain have put finger upon two cause then combined to render escape of russian fleet possible low murmur of assent followed when died away togo spoke thank gentleman said for expression of opinion to have just listened agree that mistake be made upon occasion be who made mistake will not be repeated may rest assured recognised mistake when be too late to amend have now made plan accordingly have one else suggestion to offer there be response very well then gentleman resumed togo conference be at end return to ship get anchor at once will proceed to sea forthwith may hachiman sama japanese god of war be with to day crown arm with victory moment silence followed then cabin rang with exultant shout of banzai banzai nippon instantly taken up by crew out on deck who heard a instantly repeated by crew of other ship a sound of cheering reached then one after filed past admiral who shook hand with of a passed out of cabin ten minute later harbour be resounding with clank of chain cable being hove in through fleet hawse pipe stowed away below chapter eighteen battle of yellow sea be still quite early half past six o'clock in morning to be exact when gun from mikasa string of flag drooping from end of signal yard in breathless calm of hot august morning gave signal for japanese fleet to go forth to battle in accordance with admiral instruction yakumo be to lead way to sea be proud moment for when standing upon cruiser navigating bridge personally rang down order to engine room ahead half speed engine considered still consider have reason to be proud for here be lad not yet quite nineteen year of age captain of one of finest most formidable cruiser in japanese navy have attained to position may say now think without laying open to charge of being unduly vain solely by own exertion without particle of favour shown excepting that when own country contemptuously dispensed with service alien whom be now serving received with utmost courtesy kindness ah well thank god that bitter period in life be past now can bear to look back upon with equanimity memory of often swept down upon like black cloud in day of be now writing there be thought of unmerited disgrace ruined career in own country to interfere with happiness humble pride upon glorious morning enjoyed satisfaction of knowing that innocence have be made clear that stain of guilt have be removed from name be a happy just then a suppose be ever possible for mortal to be indeed quite apart from matter of purely personal nature must have be very difficult for normal minded individual to have be otherwise than buoyant upon particular morning for everything conspired to make one so weather be glorious sky clear rich sapphire blue be for wonder without cloud air be so still that until got under way made wind for ourselves signal flag drooped in motionless fold interpretation be largely matter of guesswork then there be pomp circumstance of modern war ship already cleared for action of decorated with at least two enormous battle flag wrought by dainty finger of japan fairest daughter flaunting defiantly from mast head must have be magnificent sight to behold that proud fleet steaming out to sea ship after ship falling into line with machine like precision keeping distance perfectly first squadron of cruiser led by yakumo then other five armoured cruiser with asama in van then four battleship accompanied by nisshin kasuga be powerful enough to take place in line of battle finally swarm of heterogeneous craft composed of older le important cruiser other vessel wasp of sea destroyer yakumo have scarcely begun to gather way when flagship signalled course south west by south speed twelve knot a signalman ran up answering pennant entered chart room approaching table upon chart of yellow sea lay spread out requested mr shiraishi navigating lieutenant to lay down south west by south course upon chart that might see where must take did so saw with satisfaction that must take twenty five mile to eastward of encounter rock unfortunate spot near japanese fleet have too prematurely revealed presence upon occasion of previous encounter with russian twenty five mile be excellent if held on upon course must cross bow of russian at distance a must enable to pas unseen then come up from southward in enemy rear so cutting off from port arthur rendering impossible for to avoid fight shortly after clearing harbour asama attendant cruiser parted company with striking off to westward with object of working round in rear of russian again mentally complimented togo upon astuteness nine o'clock came few minute later there arrived wireless message from admiral for squadron to change course thirty four degree to westward wondered what might portend for have be receiving almost continuous wireless message from squadron off port arthur latest of told that russian although undoubtedly intending sortie have not yet started again visited chart room with shiraishi assistance discovered that new course must bring within about seven mile south east of encounter rock about noon four bell have just gone tinkling along line of japanese ship informing whom might concern that hour be ten o'clock in morning when fresh wireless message came from blockading squadron informing that at last russian fleet be actually steaming out of port arthur harbour with battle flag flying band playing ship company singing russian national anthem with battleship tsarevich vitgeft flagship leading a message be decoded news spread throughout japanese fleet almost audible sigh of relief escaped breast of officer men russian be not only coming out actually meant to fight fateful hour have be so long so eagerly awaited be now at last at hand great cheer arose passing along line from ship to ship officer who have already assured that preparation for meeting enemy be complete once more went round to make assurance doubly sure japanese blockading fleet gradually closed in behind russian ship compelling vitgeft to send back gunboat mining craft reserve destroyer a boat be threatening to cut off about eleven o'clock got message informing that fleet must have to meet consisted of six battleship four cruiser seven destroyer eighth destroyer believed to be reshitelny having contrived by superior speed to give boat slip steam away in direction of chifu meanwhile glass be falling great mass of cloud came driving up from eastward little breeze from same quarter sprang up rapidly freshening knocking up sea soon set even battleship rolling pitching ponderously well so much better for told other gunner be by time quite accustomed to shoot from rolling pitching platform while russian have have such profitable experience heavier sea greater must probably be superiority of shooting be nearing noon when at length broad on starboard bow great cloud of black smoke began to show on south eastern horizon shortly afterward forest of mast from truck of of flaunted great white flag bearing blue saint andrew cross began to rise above sea line followed by numerous funnel belching immense volume of black smoke two fleet be nearing other fast be therefore not long before ponderous bulk of tsarevich topped horizon with retvisan pobieda peresviet flying rear admiral prince ukhtomsky flag sevastopol poltava following then came old friend of five funnel askold followed by pallada diana with hospital ship flying red cross flag bringing up rear well astern on port beam well to rear of line of battleship be cruiser novik easily distinguished by three funnel with single mast stepped between second third funnel seven destroyer up fluttered signal aboard mikasa scarcely have flag broke out when away went destroyer at top speed like hound released from leash to attack enemy stirring sight be to witness dash for be now blowing quite fresh nasty choppy sea have arisen through plucky little boat raced like school of dolphin chasing flying fish now throwing third of length clean out of water anon plunging into oncoming wave until water foamed hissed over turtle back bridge poured in torrent down upon main deck overboard russian admiral be not going to tamely submit to torpedo attack in broad daylight allowed boat to get well within range of gun then opened brisk fire upon driving off for moment nevertheless although boat never actually scored hit day be of utmost assistance hovering on enemy flank rear dashing in upon from time to time distracting attention at many critical moment encounter rock now bore north west from seven mile distant be broad upon port beam of russian at about same distance have fleet held on a be then going russian must very soon have cut through line provided of course that have permitted to do so attempt evidently did not appeal to vitgeft for tsarevich suddenly starboarded helm led away from in north westerly direction while togo perhaps afraid that be preliminary to retreat on part of russian fleet feigned nervousness that certainly did not feel shifted helm heading south south west at same time forming battleship in line abreast result be that for time two fleet be actually steaming away from other russian being upon starboard quarter after steaming short distance in direction formation be altered back to line ahead course be changed to south west apparently with object of getting ship well in hand be close upon one o'clock in afternoon when admiral having put through one two further manoeuvre apparently satisfied that have strung up to necessary pitch of alertness finally formed line ahead changed course to east north east at same time hoisting signal engage signal be greeted with terrific outburst of cheering from ship face have begun to look gloomy a distance between two fleet increased once more became wreathed in smile speed be increased began to rapidly overhaul enemy spray flying high over bow a pushed way irresistibly through rising sea now horizon round from north west south showed dark with smoke a japanese cruiser began to close in from point upon russian be tsarevich at length opened ball by bringing inch gun in fore turret to bear upon mikasa there be brilliant double flash big outburst of white smoke for moment partially veiled great ship ere drove away to leeward huge double splash a ponderous shell hit water about mile away then came crashing boom a sound of explosion reached against wind shot have fallen short two shot appeared to be regarded by rest of russian battleship a signal to open fire for immediately did so flash bursting out here there all along enemy battle line first from one ship then from a though ship be striving must first get off shot while projectile seemed to be falling everywhere excepting aboard japanese ship true two three shell flew muttering loudly high over head rest fell either wide very far short anticipation seemed be proving correct roll pitching of ship be playing mischief with aim of russian gunner then big gun of flagship asahi spoke just four shot coolly deliberately fired one shot at time to test range be found to be too great for effective practice fire thereupon ceased although not one of eight ranging shot have actually touched russian ship fell much closer to mark than have russian projectile close enough at event to make vitgeft nervous for immediate effect be to cause to haul up to northward so that looked a though be seriously contemplating advisability of doubling round encounter rock retreating back to port arthur be moment when everything seemed to be hanging in balance when single false move must ruin everything chance that have be so long waiting for must be lost port arthur be still close enough under lee of russian to permit of reaching shelter of battery without very serious loss must elect to make attempt be moment demanding boldness astuteness of action gambler like togo resolved to risk everything upon single throw instead of making signal to close with enemy immediately bring to battle admiral signalled change course sixteen point east meant that whole fleet now steaming in line ahead parallel to russian course heading in same direction must swerve round upon port helm go back over ground have just traversed that in fact must turn tail run away from russian manoeuvre be executed in splendid style two minute later japanese fleet be heading south west while russian fleet now nine mile distant bore about two point abaft starboard beam object of manoeuvre be of course to impress russian admiral with conviction that be a little anxious to put fortune to touch a be apparently ruse be successful for almost immediately russian shifted helm heading about south east standing across wake with funnel belching great volume of smoke showing that tremendous effort be going to be made to give slip for what seemed to interminable half hour astute little japanese nelson permitted to lay flattering unction to soul that be going to succeed for during half hour japanese fleet plugged steadily away to south west moment increasing distance between enemy then at last judging from respective position of two fleet that superior speed must certainly frustrate further attempt at escape on part of enemy up went longed for signal for to swerve round give chase manoeuvre of ours be signal for shift of helm on part of russian have be heading about south east now seeing coming straight for swerved away until be heading almost due east a though even now anxious to defer evil moment a long a possible must speedily have recognised impossibility of escape for now with carefully cleaned furnace fire full head of steam ship be racing along through fast rising sea at speed must enable to rapidly overhaul chase notwithstanding that be plunging until be buried to hawse pipe fore deck be smothered with two fleet be now running upon converging line enemy about point before port beam steering east while be steering east north east visibly gaining a minute slipped by at last looked a though fight must no longer be delayed thrill of excitement passed through a now began to fully realise be about to take part in great naval battle fought under modern condition in ship protected by ponderous plate of steel armour furnished with most modern engine of destruction what must such battle look like how must end meanwhile day be passing although two fleet have be within sight of other for more than two hour nothing have thus far be done fleet be now steaming in single line ahead battleship leading cruiser following closely russian fleet being slightly ahead steaming surprisingly well considering condition of ship though be rapidly overhauling five bell half past two o'clock in afternoon watch pealed out at same moment asama yakumo received order to haul out from fleet heave to holding ready to deal with enemy ship might attempt to break back toward port arthur so be not to be allowed to take part in fight after be positively heart breaking for moment felt inclined to imitate nelson at copenhagen turn blind eye to signal sight of asama promptly sheering out from line brought to sens knew that poor yamada must be just a bitterly disappointed a yet there be obeying order with same promptitude that must have displayed have be ordered to attack enemy single handed nodded rather savagely be afraid at commander who be regarding with eyebrow raised questioningly right growled hard port sir sheer out of line swept right round in wide semi circle finally stopping engine when arrived at spot about midway between rear of two fleet engine have just stopped be on point of opening semaphore conversation with asama hove to about mile distant with purpose of making sort of arrangement for coping with certain possible eventuality when vivid flash great cloud of smoke burst from mikasa be immediately followed by similar outburst from rest of battleship be opening fire upon russian rear a ship came within range to give due russian be by mean slow to reply be presently evident from number of shell falling round that be concentrating fire upon mikasa first hit be scored by one of ship shikishima afterwards learned landed inch shell under askold forward bridge saw flash smoke of exploding shell must not of course tell what damage be done next second shell hit same craft about waterline within minute huge volume of smoke be seen pouring from seeming to indicate that be on fire with ourselves at standstill fleet steaming away from at high speed soon passed beyond range of vision that knew about fight be that there be terrific cannonading going on while eastern horizon bore dense veil of smoke came driving rapidly down upon before rising gale cannonading continued with tremendous energy for about three quarter of hour then began to slacken until by seven bell half past three in afternoon have ceased altogether what have happened be fight over might be so although must scarcely believe that russian have be utterly beaten in short space of hour for although ship be in anything first class condition men be brave be scarcely likely to yield so long a merest ghost of chance of success remained to be not doomed to remain very long in suspense however for just a eight bell be striking wireless message arrived from admiral ordering asama to rejoin forthwith giving course east south east believe engine be first to move asama be now nearly mile to eastward of standing higher out of water than therefore drifting to leeward faster consequently really have best of start be going to let get into action before if must help called down voice tube to carmichael engineer commander explaining state of affair begging to do best unfortunately for however asama chief be scotch too therefore at once became race between two ship keener because of friendly rivalry between two scotchman be generally conceded that asama have advantage of yakumo by about knot when at length shortly before four bell in first dog watch rejoined line two craft be running neck neck battle recommenced about quarter of hour before be able to resume former position in fighting line poltava opening fire with inch gun upon mikasa against ship appeared russian have concentrated effort during earlier phase of fight poltava be sternmost ship in russian battle line a though shot have be signal fire instantly ran right along russian line from rear to van din be frightful for ship at once returned russian fire in moment a seemed sea round about mikasa on side tsarevich peresviet retvisan on side of russian be lashed into innumerable great fountain of leaping spray shone magnificently like great shower of vari coloured jewel in orange light of declining sun presently a gunner got range there be added to deafening explosion of gun sound of projectile smiting like titan hammer upon armoured side other protected part of ship crash of bursting shell great cloud of powder smoke whirled about ship hiding for second two then driving away to leeward upon wing of increasing gale splinter of wood iron fragment of burst shell swept over ship like hail prostrate form here there about deck weltering in blood proclaimed growing deadly accuracy of fire on side pandemonium of sound be such that human voice must no longer make heard officer on bridge be obliged to give order in dumb show even shriek of wounded went unheard in hellish babel of sound a distance between contending ship decreased one began to realise terrific character of force employed by man for destruction of fellow man for now must be seen that tsarevich ponderous a be bulk literally visibly heeled swayed under tremendous impact of enemy projectile be by mean getting thing own way for when fight have be raging for about hour mikasa be struck upon fore barbette by inch shell shook ship from stem to stern a exploded put barbette with two inch gun out of action for time through jamming of turning machinery damage however be speedily repaired meanwhile fight went on with ever increasing fierceness determination at superiority of japanese fire began to make apparent speed of russian ship steadily fell must be seen that many of particularly battleship be in great distress especially be case with vitgeft flagship tsarevich upon much of fire of own battleship have be concentrated have great hole in bow about ten foot in diameter anchor be shot away hawse pipe have vanished to enumerate only more apparent injury then inch shell struck fore turret wrecked interior a subsequently learned glanced off entered conning tower killed everybody in except two destroyed compass killed man at wheel who a fell jammed helm hard starboard causing ship to swerve sharply out of line wheel round in wide circle completely upsetting formation seriously imperilling many of sister ship few second later shell fell aboard hitting foot of foremast causing to totter though did not actually fall same shell afterward learned literally blew admiral vitgeft to atom also seriously wounding several of staff throwing ship into perfect chaos of confusion be beginning of end shell now literally rained upon doing frightful damage on deck below while be patent to that be completely out of control erratic movement produced utmost confusion in russian battle line broke up became mere disorganised mob of ship upon japanese ship at once closed determined to avail to utmost of opportunity to bring engagement to speedy end indeed end appeared to be near for serious a be plight of tsarevich that of of sister battleship be even worse peresviet for example flagship of prince ukhtomsky who in consequence of death of admiral vitgeft be now in supreme command be perfect wreck so far a upper work be concerned mast be destroyed funnel be battered pierced be on fire while poltava have two of inch gun smashed containing turret jammed at moment when confusion created by erratic movement of tsarevich be at height peresviet displayed signal from bridge sheering out of melee headed away back in direction of port arthur followed by sevastopol poltava while askold admiral reitsenstein flagship followed by cruiser diana pallada novik broke away from rest of fleet under ounce of steam that must raise headed away in south easterly direction followed by asama six other cruiser a for pobieda retvisan apparently animated by same desperate resolve suddenly shifted helm steamed straight for battle line a mortally wounded lion will sometimes turn upon hunter with last remains of fast ebbing strength slay foe before perishing looked a though meant to use ram successful employment of might cost loss of at least two of treasured battleship be accordingly received with terrific fire from japanese ship present retvisan being slightly in advance of companion received heaviest of fire under seemed to crumple up into almost shapeless mass of wreckage be not possible for mere mortal to continue to face devastating hail of shell a suddenly a have started toward now swerved away instantly followed by pobieda steaming hard in wake of prince ukhtomsky division rejoined just a dusk of evening be turning to darkness with flight of two ship battle came to end because for reason known only to togo failed to follow up advantage complete destruction of russian fleet of be of opinion that felt handicapped by stringent order have received not to risk loss of of precious battleship one more of might easily have be destroyed in darkness by mine dropped by flying enemy by torpedo launched from deck of daring enterprising destroyer if be influenced by such consideration a who will blame say that be wrong yet people be not wanting who complained that battle be indecisive one because russian ship have be either captured sunk in course of fight although assertion be undeniable grumbler forgot little group of very important fact chief of be that five russian battleship protected cruiser pallada succeeded in regaining port arthur harbour be so desperately damaged that be practically reduced to condition of scrap iron inasmuch a despite effort of russian to repair none of be again able to leave port arthur until fell into hand of japanese when fortress surrendered a for sixth russian battleship tsarevich took advantage of darkness to separate from rest of fleet made for kiaochau where arrived on following day where be of course interned same fate befell cruiser askold diana former of sought shelter at shanghai while latter succeeded in escaping a far south a saigon destroyer reshitelny separated from russian fleet immediately after departure from port arthur escaped japanese destroyer duly reached chifu whither have be sent with dispatch from admiral vitgeft requesting that vladivostock squadron might be dispatched to assist in proposed passage through korean strait mission accomplished commander agreed to assent to demand of sah chinese admiral on station that must disarm surrender certain vital part of machinery japanese however have doubt a to power of chinese authority to enforce demand accordingly commander fujimoto took matter into own hand late on night of th october entered chifu harbour after altercation with commander of russian vessel calmly took reshitelny in tow carried off be of course violation of neutral territory led to little temporary friction ended in destroyer being added to japanese navy chapter nineteen fall of port arthur have said nothing a to part played by yakumo in battle of yellow sea for simple reason that there be nothing particular to relate that played not altogether unimportant part in fight be evidenced by fact that only two of japanese ship namely mikasa nisshin have heavier list of killed than although kasuga scored one more in wounded than did fact be that in general engagement such a referred to after initial movement of various ship have be noted one becomes so utterly engrossed in one own particular share of work that there be little opportunity to note more than most salient incident of battle moreover din of battle continuous roar of gun crash of bursting shell deafening clang of projectile upon armour scream of wounded suffocating fume of powder tend to benumb one power of observation so that captain of fighting ship have little opportunity to note anything more than movement of particular ship happens to be engaging at moment importance of defeat of port arthur fleet indecisive a have at first seemed to be soon began to be realised when secret agent in fortress sent complete carefully ascertained information relative to condition of ship have succeeded in regaining shelter of harbour from information at once became apparent that a fighting unit none of must again be made of service until conclusion of war japan heaved great sigh of relief be intensified when on evening of th august news be flashed through country that gallant sorely tried kamimura have at last be granted long cherished wish to meet vladivostock squadron have defeated true defeat like of port arthur fleet be not a decisive a must have be wished for of three cruiser gromovoi rossia runk sallied forth from vladivostock under command of admiral jessen in response to admiral vitgeft call for support in last desperate sortie from port arthur two of gromovoi rossia succeeded in regaining shelter of vladivostock harbour while only rurik least formidable of trio be sunk again a in case of port arthur although bulk of russian force contrived to escape capture destruction have be so severely handled a to be rendered innocuous for many month to come japan be at last free from continual menace of destruction of fast cruiser novik in korsakovsk harbour on st august by japanese ship chitose drove last nail in coffin of russia naval power in far east from time forward with exception of maintaining effective blockade of port arthur japanese navy have little to do except prepare at point to meet menace of baltic fleet at time be beginning to materialise take definite shape meanwhile after almost superhuman struggle against enormous odds in face of frightful suffering loss japan land force be beginning to make progress during last day of july general kuroki force fought won battle of towan yushuling pas on rd august general oku seized hai cheng newchwang old town be situated twenty mile inland from port of newchwang then there came pause during final preparation for advance upon liao yang be being completed liao yang promised to be very tough nut to crack for general kuropatkin fully recognising possibility of position have determined to make stand there inflict upon japanese such crushing defeat that further capacity for taking offensive must be driven out of after subjugation of beaten disheartened enemy must prove easy task rendered easier perhaps by fact that great assault upon port arthur by japanese have failed disastrously with frightful loss to assailant defence of liao yang be of great extent enormous strength including not only formidable fort earthwork armed with powerful gun mile upon mile of most carefully elaborately constructed trench also with innumerable pitfall with sharpened stake at bottom a in case of nanshan height defence pitfall be arranged in regular line interrupted at interval by patch of mined ground while outside again there ran practically continuous girdle of barbed wire entanglement wire being charged with electric current powerful enough to instantly destroy one who must be unfortunate enough to come into contact with liao yang defence be in fact repetition of defence of nanshan height where japanese suffered such appalling loss except that be of even more elaborate deadly character attack upon liao yang be indeed in many respect repetition of attack upon kinchau for a in case of kinchau there be formidable hill position that of shushan to be first stormed taken task be entrusted to second japanese army under leadership of general oku accomplished on st september after three night two day of desperate fighting in course of heroic japanese suffered frightful loss on same day russian began to withdraw from liao yang under heavy fire from japanese artillery on following day japanese captured yentai mine few hour later general nodzu at head of fourth japanese army entered town of liao yang unopposed meanwhile what be state of affair on land before port arthur a have already be said great general assault upon land defence began on th august resulted in disastrous failure with frightful loss for japanese failure terrible a be be not by mean complete blackness be irradiated by gleam of light here there sufficed to keep alive that spirit of hope indomitable resolution misfortune must ever quite quench in breast of japanese be undoubtedly determining factor in campaign to particularise on th august st japanese division be ordered to capture five redoubt on crest of ridge west of railway known a swishiying redoubt redoubt be taken on following day capture paved way for general assault four day later began with furious bombardment of height known a metre hill be stormed taken at point of bayonet later in day by st division immediately pushed south east with object of gaining possession of namaokayama metre hill hill be protected by among other device intricate barbed wire entanglement charged with high tension electric current penetration of proved to be task of almost insuperable difficulty nevertheless be eventually accomplished on morning of nd august by splendid act of heroism sacrifice on part of fifty japanese west panlung fort be captured cleared way for capture of east fort superhuman effort made by japanese in capturing position completely exhausted with result that assault ended in failure since majority of defence remained in hand of russian on rd august battleship sevastopol will be remembered be one of ship contrived to make good escape from japanese fleet after battle of yellow sea having be patched up a far a resource of port arthur dockyard must allow got under way steaming round to takhe bay proceeded to shell japanese line in neighbourhood of ta ku shan panlung redoubt be rather daring thing to do for there be not ship in harbour capable of supporting while japanese blockading squadron in offing be close enough in to be clearly visible from height included in squadron be new armoured cruiser nisshin kasuga purchased from argentine just before declaration of war sooner be seen that sevastopol have actually ventured outside harbour than two powerful craft steamed in opened fire upon also upon laolutze fort be supporting approach of japanese cruiser be signal for hurried retirement on part of russian battleship lost time in effecting retreat to harbour while entering struck contact mine exploded beneath bow inflicting such serious damage that be only with very great difficulty succeeded in returning to berth with bow almost completely submerged be last straw so far a sevastopol be concerned be practically put out of action for remainder of war week later cruiser destroyer effected coup there be reason to believe must have materially hastened fall of fortress consisted in capture off round island of great fleet of chinese junk bound from wei hai wei to port arthur conveying to beleaguered city vast quantity of food clothing ammunition explosive supply of imaginable description junk be taken into dalny where cargo be declared to be contraband of war confiscated by japanese several success comparatively unimportant though be coupled with practical destruction of port arthur vladivostock fleet put new heart into japanese for time with arrival passage of month of september during appreciable progress be made in operation before port arthur even unexampled patience superb stoicism thus far displayed by japanese a people showed sign of wear tear to have so long be subjected murmuring at general nogi apparent non success began to make heard casualty list seemed to grow ever longer with passage of day without visible result except nogi contrived to retain possession of few unimportant position have gained black cloud of pessimism seemed to be settling down upon island empire meanwhile however in silent secret undemonstrative way japanese army have be making preparation of important character among be included construction of concrete emplacement for eighteen inch howitzer from great thing be expected fired pound projectile charged with high explosive have range enabled to command entire area of fortress including harbour on st october first six of howitzer opened fire in presence of general baron kodama who have crossed to port arthur from japan to administer perhaps fillip to officer army generally north kikwan fort be first recipient of new gun delicate attention one hundred shell being poured into huge cloud of dust smoke at once arose from fort be enormously strong very important result be apparent on following day for few day afterwards howitzer lobbed shell upon fleet pobieda poltava retvisan peresviet be struck crew driven out of after be moved to east harbour where be hidden from sight of gunner by intervening high ground meanwhile japanese engineer be resolutely industriously pushing sap ever closer up to russian fort in progress of task most furious sanguinary hand to hand fighting with bayonet bomb be of daily nay hourly occurrence slaughter be appalling few of combatant on side surviving such encounter yet although advantage be on side of defender patience heroism of japanese steadily told on th october attacked work at yenchang near takhe bay destroyed two machine gun with be armed success be followed up by capture on th october of immensely strong russian position on hashimakayana hill ten day later japanese troop stormed took after hour of sanguinary fighting two important position of erhlung sungshushan on northern north western salient of old chinese wall success be considered to have cleared ground for general assault have be ordered from headquarters in japan for four day th th th th october russian work be subjected to terrific bombardment a up to then mortal eye have certainly never beheld reached height about eight o'clock on morning of th continued until about one o'clock in afternoon during din be terrific indescribable shell shrapnel fell upon russian work at rate of one hundred per minute fort resembled volcano in eruption from continuous explosion of shell fell upon entire landscape became veiled in thick haze of smoke at one o'clock preparation be thought to be complete ten minute later great assault began to end in complete disastrous failure russian fort supposed to have be silenced by four day of terrific bombardment be a formidable a ever a stormers dashed forward be met by so furious rifle artillery fire that be literally annihilated second grand assault upon port arthur have failed a completely tragically a first to have incurred such tremendous loss for such insignificant result be terribly depressing experience for japan benumbing effect of blow began to pas away when in first week of news arrived of general oku splendid success upon shaho with renewed hope that indomitable patience courage be so marked feature of japanese character troop before port arthur set to work to repair disaster first success be achieved in middle of month of november when gained possession of little village of kaokiatun thus securing command of pigeon bay success be followed on rd of month by attempt on part of japanese to capture russian trench on east kikwan hill attempt resulted in failure with loss of three hundred slain to say nothing of wounded be followed on th by attack upon q fort north kikwan erhlung sungshushan too resulted in failure for japanese with awful slaughter failure in case however being tempered by capture of trench on east kikwan hill capture be of very great importance to japanese from fact that commanded approach to fort on summit of hill russian recognising fact fought madly to regain possession of trench finally succeeding toward midnight fighting on occasion be most disastrous for japanese wounded alone totalling over while be estimated that in dead loss must have exceeded result of sanguinary fighting be to convince japanese staff at last that defence on eastern slope be impregnable to assault must be captured by other mean accordingly next turned attention to metre hill be key to eastern defence of port arthur determined to take by assault be particularly tough proposition after tremendous loss nogi army have already suffered in disastrous assault upon eastern defence staff might well have be excused have hesitated to undertake such herculean task for position be so immensely strong that russian regarded a impregnable merely natural difficulty of adventure be great for a name indicates be lofty hill with steep almost precipitous slope to scale even unopposed be light task when to difficulty be added further one that hill

protected by strong barbed wire entanglement that work on summit mounted several machine gun heavier piece of artillery reader may be able to form slight idea of obstacle japanese undertook to surmount a well a indomitable courage possessed to make attempt must not be supposed however that attack be about to be made on spur of moment without previous preparation on contrary for two whole month japanese have be steadily sapping from north north west day night in face of most vigorous determined opposition on part of russian first constructing parallel about hundred yard from first line of russian trench from parallel driving sap pierced wire entanglement in two place reached to within fifty yard of russian line while be being done four of new japanese inch howitzer concentrated fire upon work on twin summit of hill assault be ordered for evening of th november supported by heavy bombardment from howitzer battery in rear troop chosen for assault broke cover rushed first line of russian trench bayoneting occupant almost before latter have time to open fire upon then followed hand to hand fighting of most ferocious sanguinary character lasted night morning found assailant still in possession of trench have be won now strongly reinforced japanese proceeded to push forward to attack summit akasakayama battery immediately russian gun in neighbouring fort opened fire upon stormers with shrapnel heavy shell in very few minute entire scene be so completely veiled in powder smoke that be impossible for anyone to tell exactly how fight be going four time japanese stormed crest be beaten back be not until three o'clock in afternoon when delivered fifth assault that at last burst through wire entanglement reached crest for time held russian fire be too hot for at length be not only driven off crest also out of trench have won on previous night attack be resumed next day again resulted in failure then japanese staff put foot down declared that hill must be taken at cost cruiser sai yen akagi be ordered round to pigeon bay to co operate with troop by covering assault with fire unfortunately a sai yen be getting into position on th struck mine sank not far from where old hei yen disappeared two month earlier put end to plan for naval assistance land force be obliged to rely entirely upon fighting of most desperate sanguinary character proceeded through afternoon night of th november be not until next day that indomitable courage persistence of japanese be rewarded with success western summit of metre hill being taken by held day despite most desperate effort on part of russian to retake be beginning of end so far a port arthur be concerned on th december eastern summit of hill also fell into hand of japanese next day secured possession of akasakayama thus obtaining command of entire metre range important position in possession tide of war at once turned in favour of japanese for height commanded not only town harbour of port arthur big inch howitzer a well a battery of naval inch inch gun be at once brought up bombardment of russian warship be begun on th december poltava be sunk by russian to save from destruction by japanese fire next day retvisan met like fate while fire broke out aboard peresviet on th pobieda be at bottom of harbour while pallada be obviously following on following day bayan be hit no le than twenty two time bursting into flame shortly before noon burning until shortly after four o'clock in afternoon while sevastopol be seriously damaged mine laying ship amur be also hit sunk dockyard sustained serious damage yet strangely enough through bombardment russian did little by way of reply seemed overwhelmed paralysed at misfortune be now befalling else a of began to shrewdly suspect ammunition be at last exhausted on th of month sevastopol only russian battleship still remaining afloat in harbour moved from mooring sought refuge behind big boom under gun of mantushan fort on tiger peninsula where few night later be energetically attacked by destroyer attack be repeated nightly with considerable loss to side until night of th th when ship be successfully torpedoed end be so evidently near now that ceased attack nothing must save on th of month captain took out into deep water opened kingston valve sank so that might not fall into hand of japanese meanwhile north kikwan fort be captured by troop on night of th after fight cost close upon thousand men two day later took battery close to on th formidable erhlung became ours after tremendous fight success after success on part now

surrender of port arthur needle to say japanese general gladly yet without undue haste acceded to stoessel proposal at noon of nd january major general ijichi met major general reiss at plum tree cottage miserable little hovel situated in village of swishiying negotiation be opened resulted in port arthur passing into possession of japanese on evening of day although russian evacuation did not take place until th of january chapter twenty battle of tsushima meanwhile what have become of japanese navy after battle of yellow sea so far a yakumo be concerned be in very thick of fight when be at hottest when at battle came to end with flight of retvisan pobieda be one of ship have be so severely mauled that extensive repair be necessary before must undertake further service accordingly be ordered to proceed forthwith to sasebo to refit since be by mean alone in plight have to await turn hence be middle of january before yakumo be again ready for sea in meantime have ample opportunity to cement friendship with member of boyd family who have acted part of good samaritan to when first made acquaintance with day before yakumo left sasebo for rendezvous at elliot island news arrived that long talked of baltic fleet have reached madagascar be at anchor in passandava bay refitting provisioning generally enjoying hospitality of french nation of course be not first news that have received of have be duly apprised of departure from libau on th october have also heard with surprise on part of japanese with bitter mortification shame on own part of subsequent unprovoked unpunished attack upon gamecock fleet of british trawler nobody be in least disturbed by news that formidable fleet be at last actually at sea for a matter of fact in japan regarded departure a nothing more than move on part of russian government intended to encourage garrison of port arthur to continue resistance for to speak plain truth nobody seriously believed that voyage must ever be continued far beyond western extremity of english channel for must not see how be going to be done now when be apparent that france be openly ignoring outraging law governing neutral nation in favour of russia behoved japan to take serious notice of what be happening not only protested vigorously against france violation of neutrality set to work in earnest to prepare for new menace be gradually creeping closer to shore for month after arrival of yakumo at elliots half of crew formed portion of busy multitude who toiled in port arthur harbour to raise sunken ship cumbered to clear entrance channel on th of february naval contingent rejoined ship on th japanese battle fleet disappeared from human ken for three whole month be more seen save by few who be made clearly to understand vital necessity to remain absolutely silent not so however japanese cruiser be mission to generate feeling of uneasiness anxiety in mind of admiral rojdestvensky of officer men with object squadron single ship be directed to show suddenly mysteriously a suddenly to disappear again in water through russian fleet must have to pas on voyage to vladivostock did so effectually with such excellent judgment very soon various telegraph cable grew hot with number of message transmitted through telling most marvellous story of enormous japanese fleet seen in various part of world at same moment of huge incredibly strong fortification erected on formosan coast elsewhere bluffing be not confined to side however french newspaper be permitted to fall into hand in news be circumstantially set forth that in consequence of fall of port arthur admiral rojdestvensky have be recalled that be taking entire fleet back to europe by way of suez canal with exception of four of best battleship be hinted have foundered at sea on th march however reliable information reached japan that st nd division of rojdestvensky fleet have left madagascar on th of month steering north east two day later news reached that russian fleet have be sighted in indian ocean still steering north east week later first of scout smart fast steam yacht flying german colour apparently bound westward passed within four mile of armada took careful count of reported by wireless exact position fact that consisted of forty three ship seven of be battleship while of rest ten be cruiser seven be destroyer from moment scout under conceivable guise except of warship never for moment lost touch with russian knew that passed singapore on th april knew that touched at anamba island coaled there before dutch warship must arrive to prevent knew that on th april fleet arrived in kamranh harbour in french indo china where while awaiting arrival of admiral nebogatoff squadron be coming out via suez canal russian proceeded to make good defect generally prepare for fight knew awaited of course japanese government vigorously protested against flagrant violation of law regulating conduct of neutral france replied with polite assurance that such violation must not be repeated be followed by order to russian to leave kamranh harbour obeyed at leisure moving on first to port dayot then when ordered from there in response to fresh japanese protest to hon koe bay thus with connivance of french authority very pretty game of hide seek be played by rojdestvensky until th may when nebogatoff joined with nine craft now completed fleet entered hon koe bay calmly proceeded to complete task of refitting coaling provisioning prior to great attempt to force way through to vladivostock a for japanese government speedily recognised that france have quite made up mind to ignore law of neutrality in favour of russia accordingly ceased to lodge further useless protest week later on th may to be exact entire russian fleet left hon koe bay steering northward although french authority suppressed news of departure for two whole day togo who be now with fleet in chin hai bay on southern coast of korea received news by wireless same night thenceforward progress be carefully watched reported daily so that at moment togo must put finger upon chart indicate position of enemy within few mile meanwhile togo be busily engaged in preparation of plan for great battle toward have be looking forward for so long in work be of course hampered by lack of knowledge a to intention of russian there be two route by must reach vladivostock one shorter of two by way of korea strait up through sea of japan other via east coast of japan la perouse strait also must rojdestvensky choose shorter route must pas to east to west of tsushima island togo solved problem by preparing plan of battle for of three alternative route on th may russian fleet be reported a being south west of quelpart island off entrance of korea strait position rendered practically certain that be rojdestvensky intention to take shorter route up through sea of japan be shortly before sunset on th may that fateful wireless message enemy in sight fifty mile west of torishima came in from one of scouting cruiser two minute later signal be flying from mikasa summoning japanese admiral to council of war council be brief one lasting barely quarter of hour then admiral returned to respective flagship latter at once signalled captain of several squadron to meet in cabin of admiral of squadron yakumo formed part of armoured cruiser division under command of admiral kamimura accordingly be in cabin of idzumo that six captain of division presently assembled to receive instruction be concise enough of such character a to indicate that togo have given long expected battle tremendous amount of consideration have finally settled detail with almost mathematical precision in first place for good sufficient reason battle be to be fought in eastern

until engagement must become general remainder of protected cruiser division fourteen in number be to proceed to sea with main fleet on following morning parting company when be fairly at sea then find enemy rear closing in upon harassing a much a possible acting according to circumstance quite independently of main fleet captain using own initiative a for of armoured cruiser division be to have honour of forming part of battle line be sufficiently gratifying intelligence that followed be even more so former tactic of engaging enemy at extreme range in order to preserve precious battleship from injury be to be abandoned be battle for have be so carefully hoarded in must be made fullest use of utmost value must be exacted in word be to be fought for that be worth closing with enemy to within effective range firing slowly deliberately so shot must tell there be also general order issued in highest degree illustrative of japanese thoroughness be that man throughout fleet be

harbour morning of th may dawned bright clear at five o'clock crew of japanese ship partook of substantial meal before proceeding to task of clearing for action be still partaking of meal when marconi gram arrived from shinano maru one of scout informing that russian fleet be in sight entering eastern strait that be impossible a yet to say how many ship be present a atmosphere be misty also that there be high sea running in russian ship be rolling heavily be news that togo have be anxiously awaiting now that have knew that enemy be making for precise spot where have be planned to meet little admiral gave vent to great sigh of relief ordered signal to be made for protected cruiser squadron to weigh lead rest of fleet out to sea order be at once carried out quietly deliberately for there be plenty of time on hand chitose admiral kotaoka flagship four consort leading followed by kasagi four consort under admiral dewa being followed in turn by akitsushima three consort under admiral uriu

port side of line steamed flotilla of japan fastest destroyer told off by togo to act a dispatch boat in event of flagship wireless apparatus being put out of action mast shot away once clear of land soon ran into atmosphere of haze rising sea set long line of ship rolling ponderously a vessel rolled plunged flinging heavy shower of spray over weather bow captain stood in chart room with chart of strait spread open on table before anxiously awaiting next news of enemy chart have be for convenience ' sake carefully divided up into series of numbered square about nine o'clock expected message arrived ran enemy be in two hundred three being number of square on chart occupied by russian fleet at moment sooner be message decoded purport made known than mutual congratulation be exchanged for even a fall of metre hill into hand of soldier have be prelude to surrender of port arthur so now fact of russian fleet being in square on chart be accepted a omen of victory fine weather of early morning have by time completely deserted sky have become overcast tsushima conical summit be hidden by great bank of heavy louring cloud grey dreary looking sea be running in confused turbulent foam flecked surge through big ship wallowed heavily flinging great comber of yeasty froth from bow while little torpedo craft smothered in spray be tossed about like cork yet despite gloomy aspect of weather japanese fleet presented magnificent inspiriting sight a ploughed steadily through leaping mist flecked sea ship keeping station with most perfect accuracy with two in case three great battle flag snapping defiantly in freshening breeze be shortly after six bell in forenoon watch when at length received message must have removed load of anxiety from little admiral mind came from izumi one of ship have be dispatched on previous night for purpose of luring enemy into eastern channel reported at length captain have succeeded in ascertaining full force of enemy fleet that consisted of eleven battleship of st nd rd class nine cruiser nine auxiliary cruiser nine destroyer be heavy odds to face with four battleship eight armoured cruiser eighteen protected cruiser yet never for moment did shrink from encounter for be one determined to conquer moreover weather gloomy a be be in favour for ship having be painted peculiar grey tint have be found so effective in atmosphere of sea of japan be scarcely visible at distance of four mile while heavy sea must probably give own gunner great advantage over of enemy be about quarter to two o'clock in afternoon be steaming in line ahead with mikasa leading course being about south south west when fog thinning somewhat suddenly saw away on port bow great cloud of black smoke underneath presently discerned several large ship approaching in two line black hull yellow funnel showing up with remarkable distinctness against light grey background of fog instantly telescope pair of binoculars in japanese fleet be levelled at in endeavour to identify craft in sight for be intimately acquainted with characteristic of ship in enemy fleet presently recognised big three funnelled craft at head of port line a oslabia while two funnelled battleship leading starboard line be undoubtedly suvaroff admiral rojdestvensky flagship astern of followed alexander third borodino orel while in wake of oslabia be able to identify sissoi veliki navarin admiral nakhimoff with long string of other craft at moment too far distant for identification while be still endeavouring to identify of more distant ship mikasa made general signal fate of empire depends upon effort let man do utmost be greeted with great roar of banzai nippon swept along line of fleet like rumbling of distant thunder crew of ship have of course be at quarter officer at fire control station for time now began to receive from range finder range of oslabia leading russian ship fifteen thousand yard fourteen thousand twelve came report in rapid succession a two fleet rushed toward other at distance of twelve thousand yard mikasa helm be shifted course of japanese line altered four point to eastward a though purpose be to pas along russian line to port exchanging broadside a passed so enemy evidently understood for came steadily on knew differently already forward gun in fleet be bearing steadily upon oslabia when in obedience to signal from flagship speed of japanese fleet quickened up to fifteen knot knew that great battle be about to begin began few minute earlier than anticipated for range finder have just given distance of head of russian column a nine thousand yard when two bright flash followed by great cloud of white smoke broke from oslabia fore turret presently saw two great fountain of foam leap into air distance beyond mikasa a though have be signal suvaroff alexander third sissoi veliki instantly followed suit second two later heard loud angry muttering of inch shell hurtling toward flew over others fell short not one touched a heavy rumbling boom of report reached ear mikasa signalled shift of helm further four point east before russian fully realised what be about japanese fleet be crossing t be to say passing athwart enemy course gun russian must bring to bear upon be now being loaded fired a rapidly a possible so in very short time enemy ship be enveloped in whirling wreath of powder smoke yet not single japanese gun have thus far spoken six thousand yard be presently signalled by range finder at same moment three shot roared forth from turret of mikasa shikishima fuji knew at what target be aimed of who happened to have glass at eye saw bright flash cloud of smoke suddenly burst into view on oslabia conning tower one of inch shell have found mark a subsequently learned instantly killed admiral folkersam instant success told that might unhesitatingly rely upon accuracy of range finder at once ship in japanese battle line opened fire first upon oslabia then upon suvaroff manoeuvre of crossing t enabling to bring one of broadside gun upon enemy while in turn must only fire few of fore turret gun rest being blanketed by ship leading line careful deliberate fire of twelve ship upon two must have one result oslabia suvaroff received most fearful punishing unprotected portion of hulk be blown to ribbon dense column of dark smoke poured from oslabia presently be seen that suvaroff be on fire burning furiously ship a though instinctively swerved away to eastward anxious not to shorten distance farther between japanese presently oslabia suvaroff fell out of respective line dropped to rear with own line between enemy then came turn of alexander third be now leading russian starboard line got even more severely peppered than battered sister in misfortune for range have now dwindled to four thousand yard shot of ours be telling with terrible effect must not be supposed however that while enemy be being punished so severely be going scatheless be not very far from although be giving good deal better than received shell be by time falling pretty thickly around while hit be becoming steadily le infrequent first to come aboard yakumo be inch shell struck fore barbette on starboard side glanced upward striking conning tower exploding fragment wrecking couple of ventilator boat freely puncturing fore funnel while one piece swept cap off head overboard asama however next one astern of yakumo suffered very much more severely than did three heavy shell hitting abaft in quick succession throwing steering gear out of action causing to leak so badly that have to drop out of line be left astern executing temporary repair by time be to say shortly before six bell in afternoon watch two fleet be heading about east south east running in parallel line own line leading that of enemy by about mile while alexander third be like oslabia suvaroff in flame blazing furiously few minute later be seen that sissoi veliki be also on fire being now leading ship of russian port line of battle in accordance with togo tactic object with navarin admiral nakhimoff of concentrated fire of battle line meanwhile protected cruiser squadron have come upon scene be harassing russian rear so effectively that aided by vigorous attack of battle line upon russian van enemy line be breaking up in confusion togo now gave order for to close in upon enemy van leading way in mikasa with result that leading russian ship in order to avoid being crossed raked be compelled to continually bear ever more more away to southward until finally swept right round be heading north once more with alexander third suvaroff oslabia out of line practically out of action be difficult nay more be impossible for captain of ship taking part in general action to note remember phase detail of such action be so intensely preoccupied in task of fighting manoeuvring own ship that only certain detached incident of engagement impress upon memory strongly enough to be permanently remembered thus be able to recall about period of battle came to definite conclusion that have won notwithstanding fact that several of ship including yakumo have suffered severely asama for example be at least temporarily out of action while kasuga one of two new cruiser purchased from argentine just before outbreak of war have three of heavy gun rendered useless by time protected cruiser division have crept up on starboard quarter of russian line be vigorously attacking in direction while battle line to port of russian be a vigorously pounding enemy front thus bringing russian line between two fire be about time that one of brief interlude of comparative inaction occur in most battle afforded opportunity to look round bit obtain first comprehensive view of battle since commencement wind have be blowing fresh during earlier part of day have be gradually dropping be now little more than mere breathing sky still continued overcast gloomy shadow falling upon sullenly heaving longer breaking sea causing tumbling water to look almost black where be not veiled by drifting smoke wreath slowly moving patch of fog be obscuration caused by combination of smoke fog have produced interval of comparative inaction of have spoken for rendered accurate firing difficult ship in accordance with togo determination not to waste ammunition be only firing occasional single shot when hull of opponent became distinctly visible although russian be blazing away at a recklessly a ever thus enveloping in almost continuous veil of smoke be renewed a quickly a drifted away be now that asama having effected temporary repair came up resumed place in line of battle be thus once more intact ship keeping station with most perfect regularity with russian line such a be four thousand yard distant about point abaft starboard beam roar of enemy artillery be incessant continuous crashing boom of gun reminding one a much a anything of tremendous thunderstorm while flash of gun seen through gloom of louring afternoon not altogether inadequately represented accompanying lightning looked round to see if must discover of silenced russian battleship yes there be three of oslabia about three mile away broad on starboard quarter suvaroff about mile astern of alexander third about mile astern of suvaroff astern of own line being vigorously attacked by protected cruiser oslabia be low in water have heavy list to port suvaroff still apparently on fire have lost funnel foremast alexander third from cloud of smoke be still rising also have heavy list be steaming ahead very slowly although like sister in misfortune still replied with utmost gallantry to fire so far a oslabia be concerned race be evidently run for even a watched became apparent that be fast settling in water while with roll list to port became stronger until at last found holding breath in momentary expectation to see roll right over catastrophe be not long delayed there came moment when having rolled heavily to port failed to lift again heeled steadily more more until watching through powerful glass saw number of object go sliding away off deck into water with heavy splash over went until mast funnel lay along on water two after turret gun spoke out defiantly for last time down went in great swirl of foam while russian destroyer closed in upon spot to save such of crew a might contrive to remain afloat now turned attention to suvaroff be just in time to witness very plucky attack upon by squadron of destroyer notwithstanding disabled condition beat off in most gallant fashion next turned to have look at alexander third crew appeared to have extinguished fire aboard got back into something like former trim be now heading to rejoin russian line be re forming after fashion presently saw drop into third place in line between orel sissoi veliki latter also seemed to have extinguished fire meanwhile mist have thickened into fog rapidly became so dense that presently lost sight of enemy altogether shrewdly suspecting that russian must seize opportunity to effect escape togo now led battle line round in sweep from north east to south west then to south for distance of eight mile during sighted shelled enemy cruiser squadron of auxiliary ship heading to south west at point togo decided to turn northward again before doing so detached six armoured cruiser of yakumo be one under admiral kamimura with order to pursue destroy ship of have just lost sight be about four o'clock in afternoon by time wind have dwindled away to mere nothing sea have so far gone down torpedo craft must keep pace with larger craft without being swept by sea from stem to stern still weather continued to be very dismal dreary sky still lowering overcast not solitary gleam of sunshine fog gathering so thickly that be difficult to see anything beyond two mile radius heavy gun firing have by time died down to nothing pretty lively cannonade of lighter weapon down in south western quarter told that engagement between cruiser of enemy be still proceeding briskly although nothing must be seen accordingly idzumo led five armoured sister in direction at speed of fifteen knot suddenly a pushed along guided on course by sound of firing thunder of heavy gun easily distinguishable from sharper report of lighter weapon burst forth ahead to amazement for fully believed that whole of enemy battleship have fled northward clearly however be mistaken in so believing kamimura at once recognised that capricious fortune be unexpectedly holding out to opportunity to wipe off of utterly undeserved opprobrium have attached to earlier in war because of failure to bring vladivostock squadron to book later success have by mean effaced accordingly signalled squadron to increase speed to eighteen knot be supposed to be maximum attainable by asama although others be capable of extra knot inferiority of speed on part have always be rather sore point with have have many talk with carmichael yakumo engineer commander about who have felt reproach a keenly a did have assured that if ever worse came to worst must undertake to get extra knot out of ship although must be at peril of what elegantly termed general bust up in engine room so now called to down voice tube begging to speed up a far a dared few minute later noticed that be gaining upon iwate next ahead while asama second astern be also stoking up thereupon signalled flagship that have speed in hand if required order be at once given to increase speed by knot be not very long afterward that have ocular demonstration of value extra spurt of speed might prove to be for while be still plugging along in direction of firing suddenly sighted two craft coming slowly in direction proved to be kasagi escorted by chitose making for japanese coast former being holed below waterline making so much water that be doubtful whether must be possible to save signalled that matter be going badly with protected cruiser eleven of being then hotly engaged by twelve of enemy one of be second class battleship while three others be battleship of third class admiral dewa who be on board concluded communication by urging to hasten to rescue steadily increasing distinctness with sound of firing reached proved that be rapidly overhauling contending squadron twenty minute later sighted rearmost ship on side blazing away at other hammer tongs own cruiser be to southward of russian line therefore kamimura led force to northward of enemy thus placing latter between two fire at same time signalling to concentrate fire upon four russian battleship did with vengeance within five minute be enveloped in roaring tempest of flame smoke bursting shell precision of fire be infinitely superior to of russian fired at least three time a rapidly a did whereas one of shell reached mark bulk of theirs flew wide be rapidly growing demoralised when fight have be in progress twenty minute line suddenly broke up into little group of two three made off to northward at top speed of whose speed permitted following keeping up brisk fire with forward gun suddenly a pursued two ship be sighted ahead evidently in difficulty few minute later identified a russian battleship suvaroff repair ship kamschatka immediately kamimura signalled ordering destruction then while be in very act of training gun upon battleship be sighted in distance too be evidently in parlous state so much so indeed that scarcely have time to identify a alexander third when capsized sank then opened fire vigorously upon other two ship while destroyer closed in upon suvaroff now listing so heavily that be almost on beam end although be in such sorry plight crew displayed utmost gallantry defending from torpedo craft with only gun must bring to bear be hopeless fight however boat dashed in time after time discharging torpedo at at length two of missile got home one under stern other in wake of engine room blowing great hole in side last finished water poured into in torrent few minute later rolled right over disappeared kamschatka followed few minute later meanwhile ship have be pursuing have disappeared in fog heading northward in direction knew battleship have preceded therefore since hour have now arrived when according to arrangement torpedo flotilla be to take up game kamimura signalled to reduce speed to ten knot to shape course for appointed rendezvous near matsushima island night followed be anxious one for hand for be steaming through dark foggy night with light out nothing untoward happened however with appearance of dawn on following morning little air of wind sprang up swept fog away be shortly before three bell in morning watch half past five o'clock be of th may six ship of japanese armoured cruiser division be steaming northward in line abreast when tokiwa be easternmost ship reported smoke low down on eastern horizon at once course be altered eight point to eastward ship proceeded in line ahead closing in upon tokiwa leading ship a did so while kamimura reported circumstance by wireless to togo who with battle squadron be sixty mile away to northward of twenty minute later after lively bout of signalling by wireless operator aboard japanese ship became certain that smoke seen must proceed from enemy ship disposition be made for dealing with instruction of armoured division being to close slowly in upon enemy from westward while battleship rushed down at full speed from north protected cruiser did same from south result be that few hour later four russian battleship namely orel apraxin nicolai first seniavin found completely hemmed in by ship while light cruiser izumrud availing herself of superior speed just managed to escape by skin of teeth will say for outnumbered though be hopeless a be situation with ammunition running short crew almost in state of collapse from nerve strain four ship made gallant defence be not until be reduced to very last extremity that admiral nebogatoff ordered white flag to be hoisted over squadron in token of surrender prize crew be at once put aboard prize be ordered south to sasebo under escort of cruiser of yakumo be one orel be such wreck that be incapable of steaming more than eight knot consequently did not arrive in harbour until afternoon of following day when wireless message having prepared inhabitant for arrival received such ovation a thrill yet to remember chapter twenty one reinstated be not until nearly fortnight later that full result of battle of tsushima became known then tabulating intelligence came to hand from various point be at last in position to realise surprising character of japanese navy achievement briefly baldly summarised amounted to of eleven russian battleship went into action on memorable th may four be captured while remaining seven be sunk of nine cruiser five be sunk of nine auxiliary cruiser four be sunk one be captured while of nine destroyer one biedovy be captured with admiral rojdestvensky seriously wounded on board four be sunk twenty six of thirty eight craft composed much vaunted baltic fleet be thus accounted for of remaining twelve three small cruiser almaz grosny bravy destroyer succeeded in making way to vladivostock while remainder escaped to manilla shanghai madagascar where with exception of auxiliary cruiser anadyr at madagascar be duly disarmed interned have fully made up mind that with destruction of russian baltic fleet war must of necessity come to end be mistaken overture of peace be made by russia be not to be expected that after signal triumph on land sea japan must jeopardise prospect of securing satisfactory settlement by being first to open negotiation therefore in pursuance of land campaign be decided to attack russian from north by way of great river amur japanese have ascertained be navigable by light draught vessel for at least thousand mile during late spring when thaw spring rain caused river to run full in order to utilise amur be imperatively necessary that japan must have control of island of sakhalin accordingly on th june fleet of warship under admiral kataoka dewa assembled at yokohama from whence few day later sailed convoying fleet of transport aboard be one of newly raised army division under command of general haraguchi ship yakumo be one of warship detailed for expedition naturally went with space doe not permit of giving detail of expedition be not at of eventful character suffice to say that attained object sakhalin becoming ours on st july meanwhile however after result of battle of tsushima became known president roosevelt decided that time have arrived when friendly intervention of perfectly disinterested power such a united state of america might be welcome to belligerent accordingly on th june opened negotiation by dispatching identical note to emperor of japan tsar of russia offering service a mediator offer be accepted by on th august plenipotentiary of two nation met at portsmouth in new hampshire usa negotiation be of protracted nature be several time in danger of falling through in consequence of uncompromising attitude of russia representative ultimately however thanks to president roosevelt masterly diplomacy conciliatory spirit of japanese agreement be arrived at treaty of peace between japan russia be signed on th september of term of treaty be not necessary for to speak here since in nowise affect fortune of present historian conclusion of treaty however of course put stop to hostility on side end of september found ship back in sasebo where latter among other ship be paid off previous to paying off however togo have sent for at interview followed inquired most solicitously what be plan for future at same time assuring that if cared to remain in service of japan might absolutely rely upon continuous employment further promotion have however long before quite made up mind a to course of action must pursue upon conclusion of war namely to return to england endeavour to secure rehabilitation in british naval service explained to at length when have heard have to say admitted that what have decided upon be undoubtedly right thing to do then learning that proposed to return home by way of san francisco new york dismissed for time being only to inform two day later that learning be about to resign commission a captain in japanese navy emperor have expressed desire to see prior to departure from dominion in order that might personally thank for service have rendered to japan
